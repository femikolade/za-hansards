This website provides a navigation through the historical debates of the Senate and House of Assembly of South Africa from 1910 to 1994. The physical copies are converted into structured formatted XML, from which they are then converted to static web pages.
This has been a collaborative effort between Historians, Librarians and developers:

* Professor Keith Breckenridge - The Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of the Witwatersrand
* Dr Stephen Sparks - Historical Studies, University of Johannesburg
* Mr Azizo da Fonseca - Digitisation Co-ordinator, Wits University
* Dr Femi Kolade (Ph.D University of the Witwatersrand) - femikolade@outlook.com

This project is funded by the <a href="https://www.mellon.org/grant-details/african-digital-humanities-20444309" target="_blank">Mellon Foundation</a> for promoting African digital humanities.
Conversion is on-going, hence content and pages are subject to change.
