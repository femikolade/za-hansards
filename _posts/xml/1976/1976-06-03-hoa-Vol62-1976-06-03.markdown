<p>Mr. Chairman, there are four amendments standing in my name on the Order Paper. I have already, during the Second Reading, referred to the matters covered by these amendments, and it may well be, Mr. Chairman, that you may rule that in so far as these amendments are concerned, they have financial implications. Sir, if you rule that the extension of the definition of &#x201C;child&#x201D; to include children who are not at a university or other educational institutions, as well as other descendants, and the extension of the definition of &#x201C;parent&#x201D; to include parents-in-law, do indeed have financial implications, then I would ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to take over these amendments and move them so that they can be accepted. If, on the other hand, Sir, you are prepared to rule that these amendments are permissible, then I shall move the four amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<p>Order! I regret that I am unable to accept the amendments moved by the hon. member for Yeoville since they all involve increased expenditure and accordingly require the State President&#x2019;s recommendation. I shall, however, allow the hon. member to make one speech in support of his amendments, in order to attempt to persuade the hon. the Deputy Minister to take over the amendments.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I gladly comply with the request of the hon. member by dealing briefly with the amendments printed in his name on the Order Paper. The first amendment of the hon. member has the effect of making provision, in addition to the provision made for children at universities, etc., for children &#x201C;who are otherwise undergoing training for an occupation&#x201D;. Unfortunately, it is impossible to entertain any idea of conceding to this request. I should like to outline the reasons for this attitude. I had someone ascertain the earnings of, for example, the apprentices to whom the hon. member referred in his Second Reading speech. The earnings vary from trade to trade, but the fact of the matter is that apprentices in the building industry, for example, earn up to 59,15 cents per hour. The amounts earned in this way are, in some cases, full salaries. In this regard I should also like to refer to a point which was raised by another hon. member during Second Reading, and that is that when a person is dependent for his education on the maintenance which is paid, this requires further defining. I pointed out&#x2014;and I should like to repeat it now&#x2014;that paragraph (d) of the definition actually covered the whole object of the proposed amendment of the hon. member. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(d) any such unmarried child over the age of 18 years who is all full-time student at any university or other educational institution &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2020;&#x201C;Educational institution&#x201D; could embrace quite a wide area of what the hon. member has in mind in his amendment.</p>

<p>*Secondly, the hon. member proposes the insertion on page 3, after line 18, of &#x201C;(e) who is a descendant of such member&#x201D;. I think what the hon. member has in mind with this amendment is the kind of provision made in another Act, and that is that a grandchild, for example, may be the responsibility of a grandparent. For that reason we have gone into the matter thoroughly, and I have been informed by a senior member of the legal profession, who has been dealing with this for years, that in all his years of experience there has been one case only where something of this kind has happened, where a grandparent has had to look after his grandchild. Moreover, it is possible to make provision for such a child in terms of other measures, if it is necessary that provision be made for him in any way.</p>

<p>The third amendment deals with a child &#x201C;or other descendant&#x201D;. What I have said before covers this point as well. The fourth amendment refers to parents-in-law. In this regard I may just say that in all cases of a parent-in-law being dependent on a child, generous provision for such a person exists in the ordinary pension laws for such a person to apply for the ordinary social pension or other benefits, such as a disability allowance and, in some cases, even an attendant&#x2019;s allowance when this is justified. If we were to extend the scope of this legislation so as to include a mother-in-law as well, we would be giving the legislation a basis which would render it impossible for us to have justice done to all the cases which might be brought to our attention.</p>

<p>Since I am on my feet, I should also like to say that the proposal of the hon. member for Umbilo was dealt with in full at the Second Reading. This has also been moved as an amendment by the hon. member for Yeoville with regard to other provisions. What I am referring to is the omission from the legislation of the definition of the population groups.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are grateful to the hon. the Deputy Minister for giving us his reaction on the amendments moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. Towards the end he mentioned the position in regard to the various population groups. However, this is the definition clause, and before moving my amendment there is one aspect which I would like also to raise with the hon. the Minister, and that is on page 7, the definition of &#x201C;parent&#x201D;. In paragraph (xx) a parent is defined, in relation to a member, as &#x201C;his lawful parent and includes any person who, in the opinion of the Secretary is or was his foster parent and who was immediately prior to the member&#x2019;s death dependent on such member for his maintenance&#x201D;. Now, if we look at a clause which is still to be dealt with, clause 4&#x2014;if you do not mind, Mr. Chairman, I would just like to refer briefly to clause 4(f)&#x2014;one finds that provision is made whereby persons are entitled to receive pensions. In paragraph (f) there is reference to each parent of a deceased member who is not survived by a dependant, and it is stated that such parent will then be entitled to a pension which will be 20&#x0025; of the amount of pension which would have been paid to the deceased member. On the basis of the figures which the hon. the Minister gave us in the Second Reading debate, this, on a pension of R300 a month, will be R60 a month. Now, the basis on which the parent of a deceased member may claim a pension is that the deceased&#x2019;s parent would have been dependent on such member for maintenance. I should like to have some clarity from the hon. the Deputy Minister as to what will be the basis of young men who undertake their military training straight from school. Therefore there will be no basis which, immediately prior to that member&#x2019;s death, this person might be dependent on such member for his maintenance should his death occur at the very commencement or early on in his training. It would then be difficult to prove that that parent was in fact dependent on the deceased member. That is my first query concerning the definition of a parent. I would now like to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 7, in line 59, to omit &#x201C;population groups or&#x201D;.</block>

<p>We have specifically indicated that the system of having pensions based on a formula, is acceptable to this side of the House and we believe this is a considerable improvement as compared with the existing position in terms of the Acts which are now to be repealed. However, the whole basis of calculating what pensions are to be paid depends on the amount or the number which is published and determined by the hon. the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance and which is published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. This means that the benefits which are derived from the basis of applying the formula, is fully dependent upon the amounts that are determined by the Minister and published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. At this stage we do not know what the figures will be, because it still has to be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. The hon. the Deputy Minister indicated during the Second Reading debate what he had in mind. He indicated various categories on which the formula for the relevant amounts would be based. He indicated a ratio which would roughly be 6 : 4 : 3 based on the pre-disablement potential earning capacity of the members concerned. We believe this is sufficient means for calculating what amounts shall be determined and published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and for ascertaining the application of the formula or the factors to be involved so that the amount of pension or benefit to be paid can be based on that category, bearing in mind the predisablement earning potential of the person concerned. We believe this is sufficient grounds, as far as the hon. the Minister is concerned, on which to base benefits that will be paid without the need to include in this clause the population groups.</p>

<p>The Government policy has been to move away from discrimination, and we believe it is desirable to ensure that legislation does not lay down by definition the various population groups as a basis for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s decision in determining the relevant figures. It is preferable to base the figure that is to be printed in the <i>Government Gazette</i> on the <span class="col_7933-7934" refersTo="page_1297"/>potential earning capacity of the member concerned. We believe this can quite easily be done on the basis of having the various categories determined in relation to the potential earning capacity.</p>

<p>Let us look at the position in regard to certain other Acts, for example the Unemployment Insurance Act, in terms of which there are various benefits derived from various groups. Although there is legislation now before this House to amend that basis for the granting of benefits to a certain degree, the principle involved takes the earnings of the contributor concerned as the basis, with a classification into 14 income level groups. Consequently the benefits derived from members of the Unemployment Insurance Fund are based on those 14 categories or groups as far as the level of income is concerned. We consider it undesirable to have, in the legislation, a differentiation between various population groups, when the matter can be based purely on the different categories, depending upon the potential earning capacity of the people concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister and other members have said that at the present time this legislation only affects White persons. However, provision must obviously be made for the future, and we believe it is quite sufficient to ensure that there is a basis for awarding benefits purely in terms of the different categories which will be determined by the hon. the Minister in relation to the earning capacity of the members concerned. This would then meet the necessary requirements. We believe that it is necessary that there should be different categories, and that is why we have not suggested that the categories be omitted from this clause. It is necessary to have various categories. Obviously there will be people whose earning capacity, as a result of their academic and other qualifications, will be potentially higher than that of others. Consequently it is necessary to have different categories. On this basis, therefore, we believe such a system would obviate the charge of discrimination being levelled when future legislation involving differences in colour or different population groups is passed or reviewed in this House. This portion of the clause should be omitted so as to obviate such a situation and to bring about a degree of equality as far as benefits are concerned, at the same time bearing in mind that different categories are to be applied when the hon. the Minister determines the amounts to be applied to the formula as it is to be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umbilo. During the Second Reading debate I tried to underline and make the same point that has now been made again. I do not want to indulge in unnecessary repetition, but we believe this is a point which needs urgent attention from the hon. the Deputy Minister. The Bill itself goes even part of the way because it is interesting to note that if one looks at this particular clause, one sees that it is framed in discretionary terms rather than in mandatory terms. Subsection (2)(a) provides in line 57, page 7&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; different amounts or numbers may so be determined in respect of different population groups or categories of persons.</block>

<p>This suggests that even here one is not laying down that it &#x201C;shall be done&#x201D;, but &#x201C;may be done&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Whatever the outcome is, the point that one tried to make in the Second Reading debate, and I believe needs to be made under this clause again, is that if one were to speak in ideal terms, then I would agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s interpretation of my own speech in the Second Reading debate, namely that in ideal terms you cannot distinguish between one man and another when he lays down his life for his country. However, we are also well aware that here we have a situation where different people have different needs and are in different groups. The example has already been given by the previous speaker regarding unemployment insurance. Here you do have categories which are laid down. The point that I want to make is that it is possible at this stage where we have before us such an excellent piece of legislation, where we have such significant improvements made and where we have such a significant narrowing of the gap, for the hon. the Deputy Minister to go just one step further and to accept the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like firstly to react to the hon. the Deputy Minister on the four amendments <span class="col_7935-7936" refersTo="page_1298"/>which I did not move and which he did not accept. The basic difference in approach, I think, between the hon. the Deputy Minister and ourselves&#x2014;I am of the opinion that we should get this clear&#x2014;is that the hon. the Deputy Minister has made it clear in his speech that there are other social pensions that can be brought into the picture to deal with deserving cases, that there are other means of solving a problem based on an issue of charity. I do not want any misunderstanding, and therefore I say that the difference between the hon. the Deputy Minister and this side of the House is that we believe that a war pension is not an act of charity; it is a right. It is a right which every serving soldier has, and knows he has, that the State is giving it to him, because the State is asking him to risk his life and to risk injury. He therefore has a right to this. I think to approach it as if it were a social pension, as if it were an act of charity, is a wrong conception. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister is doing a disservice to the whole concept if he leaves that uncorrected. I think it is very important that he does not do that. As far as we are concerned, the fact that there may be one grandchild in issue&#x2014;and I dispute that, because I maintain that it is a problem which exists in many cases&#x2014;one child of one soldier, is certainly something which should not be left without the needs of that soldier being attended to. That is what I think should be the approach of the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>When it comes to parents-in-law and the case that I made out, I believe that the responsibility of many serving soldiers to support parents-in-law is a very real one. To say to a serving soldier that if anything should happen to him, his mother-in-law could try to get a social pension or try to live on charity, is not the approach. It certainly is not the approach. I think the soldier should be confident that whatever the position is, the State will in fact care for those to whom he has a responsibility and that the State will not try to push that responsibility on to a charitable organization or on to a social pension situation.</p>

<p>When it comes to the question of the amendment dealing with people who are otherwise undergoing training for an occupation, I want to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister appears to have overlooked the words in the definition to the effect that the man must be a full-time student, whether at a university or at another educational institution. The fact that he may be a part-time student of some kind at some educational institution or that the particular educational institution may not be one such as is contemplated in this clause, again excludes people and specifically the sort of person who is least privileged. I would ask that the hon. the Deputy Minister should look again at these amendments. After the House has passed this Bill, let him consider them again and go into the possibilities of doing something for these people, because I do not believe that we should allow a serving soldier to be under the impression that, if anything happens to him, those who are dear to him will in these circumstances have to rely on charity. I think that that is an entirely undesirable state of affairs. I think that a person who becomes a serving soldier should feel that he certainly does not have to worry about his family, whether it be his immediate family, his wife, children, grandchildren or his mother-in-law. He should not have the worry that they may be in need if anything should happen to him. Therefore I appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister, if he will not accept these amendments today, at least to ask his department to investigate them and possibly at some stage in the future make the necessary adjustments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not wish to cover the whole field again, but I shall refer briefly to the points raised by the hon. members. In the first place, to reply to the hon. member for Yeoville, may I say that I have never looked upon providing people with social pensions as an act of charity. I have never looked upon it in that way because I believe that people, who live out their lives for this country, deserve something back. Therefore it is not an act of charity; these are deserving cases. However, I do follow the argument of the hon. member. I want to repeat what I said at the Second Reading, and that is that I have no doubt that improvements can be brought about to this Bill. I have no doubt that we will be coming with amendments, hopefully in the very near future. I also mentioned in my Second Reading speech that it has already been shown that we will have to look at the legislation again in respect of the soldiers who took part in previous wars and that we will have to bring this measure into line to some extent. In one of the newspapers it <span class="col_7937-7938" refersTo="page_1299"/>was reported that I had said that this measure will be brought on a par with what we suggest for the present-day soldiers. Of course, I did not say that, but I did say, and I repeat, that we shall at least have to narrow the gap between the pensions paid to those who fought in previous wars and those who are covered by this Bill. However, these things cannot be done merely by passing an Act of Parliament We also have to consider the opinion of the several organizations concerned with this matter such as the S.A. Legion and others. These organizations brought to our notice certain anomalies which do exist, and I do not deny that they exist. We can try to produce a perfect Bill and waste a lot of time straightening out every word, but this measure must at least correspond with legislation that is on the Statute Book at present. I want to give all three members who spoke on the matter the assurance that this will not be the final word on this measure.</p>

<p>I have indicated that we shall be having a look at the question of a brochure. I have also mentioned that we are having discussions with the Department of Defence in this regard. We have to consult them. I can mention today that only two days ago we received a letter from that department pointing out certain things which they thought should be brought in. We are most definitely considering all these things. I also mentioned that even the gap that exists at present between the different race groups in respect of ex-servicemen who fought in other wars must also be amended at some stage. I cannot say at this moment how it will be done, but in other cases it has been done by raising the percentage increase in respect of certain race groups so as to approach the ratio we anticipate should be paid out to present members of the Force. Therefore, I regret that, for reasons I have pointed out, I cannot accept this amendment. What the hon. member for Pinelands said, is perfectly correct. It is perfectly correct that this is a permissive measure. The clause does not stipulate that it is compulsory that it should be based on that alone. Therefore amendments can be introduced, but one must be practical about it too. To think that we could at the present moment increase these pensions, is wrong. We can only do so when we have the funds. When we do so, we shall have to face up to the fact that, in the case of soldiers of previous wars, there is a discrepancy which is much wider than is expected to be the case under this new proposed legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo also asked me what I thought the position would be in the case of a young man being called to war, should his parents be dependent on him. I believe that, whatever mistakes we may have made, it can be said to our credit that we listened to the appeals made by organizations such as the S.A. Legion and others. In the past, cases like this have been treated with the utmost compassion and understanding. Therefore, even in the case of a youngster, on whom his elderly parents would become dependent within five or six years, compassion and understanding will be displayed in dealing with his case. I have no doubt that this approach will remain unchanged in the future. If this does not happen, organizations representing ex-servicemen will certainly complain. I, for one, as well as all other hon. members of this House, I believe, will regard any such complaint as being fair and just. Those people who willingly sacrifice their lives for the country, should know that they and their next of kin are well cared for.</p>

<p>I do promise, therefore, that I shall again look into the points mentioned. In ironing out things with which we are not completely satisfied at the present moment, we shall bear in mind the points raised during the Second Reading and during the Committee Stage, especially those points to which we cannot&#x2014; for reasons stated&#x2014;agree at the moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I regret that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not yet replied to the point which I was trying to make, viz. why it was necessary to have incorporated in clause 1(2)(a) the question of the different population groups, because the hon. the Deputy Minister quite rightly referred to a matter which was raised during the Second Reading. It is true that this matter was discussed during the Second Reading, the matter of the disparity among the various race groups and the disparity between existing pensioners who will not derive any benefit from these formulae and those who will receive benefits after 1 July 1975. It is on that basis that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not yet justified his inclination to retain the present wording of clause 1(2)(a), where it refers to population groups.</p>

<p><span class="col_7939-7940" refersTo="page_1300"/>When the hon. the Deputy Minister spoke during the Second Reading, he indicated various figures in various categories. He also indicated that he had in mind six categories. It is true that he based it on the fact that there would be two categories for each of the racial groups&#x2014;being the Whites, Coloureds and Indians taken together and the Bantu. The point I want to make, is that it is not necessary to have those population groups defined as such. The same object can be achieved in applying a factor to the various formulae if one merely had the six groups, as the hon. the Deputy Minister indicated he was going to have published in the <i>Government Gazette</i>, which was mandatory for him to do. It is stated in the clause that it &#x201C;shall be determined by notice in the <i>Government Gazette&#x201D;</i>. The hon. the Deputy Minister can have the members classified as either A or B or C members, or whatever the case may be. This, the hon. the Deputy Minister indicated during the Second Reading, was his intention. He intended to base it on six different categories, on six different figures, on six different pensions awarded. Surely, if the hon. the Deputy Minister is able to do that with regard to six categories of persons, based on the potential earning capacity of those concerned, he can do so without necessarily taking into account the population groups, but merely on the basis of the categories of the potential earning capacity of the people concerned. He intends to have six categories. We on this side of the House fail to see why the hon. the Deputy Minister at this stage wishes to retain the words &#x201C;population groups&#x201D; and to differentiate on the basis of colour or race, when it will not in any way materially affect his application of the formulae, if he bases it purely on the potential earning capacity of the people concerned. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will indicate why he deems it necessary to stipulate population groups in addition to stipulating different categories.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to reply briefly to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. I believe this field has been covered more than adequately by this time as a result of the various viewpoints which have been raised. Firstly, as the hon. member for Verwoerdburg said, only Whites are affected by this measure. If a basis were to be determined on which the income group could be determined, hon. members would be able to debate the matter for a long time. However, it would mean, firstly, that many Whites who already find themselves in this position, would receive far less than the minimum amount of R300 laid down as the minimum amount. In the circumstances I do not know how I shall be able to justify such action to the people of the Legion and others. Secondly, it is said that discrimination on the basis of colour is to be done away with. I should like to emphasize that I have never understood this in any other way but that the hon. the Prime Minister has said repeatedly: &#x201C;We are moving away from discrimination on the grounds of colour alone,&#x201D; but moving away does not mean that one can create chaos by simply doing away with everything all at once.</p>

<p>As I have pointed out during the Second Reading, this will have an effect on other pension schemes as well. I am not now going to repeat all those arguments. I have said, and I mean it, that this is a permissive clause. If the hon. the Minister decides in his wisdom to make use of the other categories and not the ones which he may also apply, then it is for the hon. the Minister to decide, be it this year or next year and on the insistence of whoever it may be. At this stage, therefore, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to raise one point very briefly arising out of the hon. the Deputy Minister drawing attention to the fact that at the moment the serving soldiers who are not White are not national servicemen. In the same clause that we are dealing with we also deal with formula III. Formula III is specifically referred to in clause 8, which deals with the situation where the recipient of a pension dies. If one of the old soldiers, if I may use that term, dies, then formula III comes into operation. It is therefore clear that in so far as the retaining of this provision in respect of the differentiation between population groups is concerned, the immediate effect will be that the clause will be applied to formula III in terms of clause 8. The argument of the hon. the Deputy Minister <span class="col_7941-7942" refersTo="page_1301"/>is&#x2014;and this will become relevant when clause 8 is debated&#x2014;that he does not immediately want to make all pensions equal, because he has not the money. However, one can make the increases that occur from now on, on a completely different basis without having recourse to differentiation and discrimination on the basis of colour.</p>

<p>That is why we in these benches not only want this provision to apply in respect of formulae I and II, as the hon. member for Umbilo has argued, but also in respect of formula HI, as this is most important in respect of ex-servicemen of past wars. That is why we cannot accept that this provision should remain as part of this clause.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 9, in line 5, to omit &#x201C;outside the Republic&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(2) on page 9, in lines 6 to 9, to omit subparagraph (ii);</li>

<li>(3) on page 9, in line 16, after &#x201C;on&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or returning from&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(4) on page 9, in line 23, to omit &#x201C;unprovoked&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_7943-7944" refersTo="page_1302"/>I motivated these amendments during my Second Reading speech. I should briefly like to point to the import of the amendments. In the first amendment I have moved that the words &#x201C;outside the Republic&#x201D; in line 5 on page 9 be omitted, and in the second amendment I have moved that the whole of subparagraph (ii) be omitted. As I have indicated, the reason for this is that, in today&#x2019;s conditions, taking into account the type of activity in which we are likely to have our forces engaged, the distinction between service inside and outside the Republic is not a realistic one. There should not be a greater onus in respect of an injury which occurs in the case of service inside the Republic than in the case of service outside the Republic. To my mind the old distinction is a remnant of the last war and that it has become academic. That is why I have moved the first two amendments.</p>

<p>As regards my third amendment, the wording in clause 2(l)(a)(iii) is designed to cover anybody who proceeds on authorized leave. I think the intention of this provision is not only to cover such a person while he is proceeding on authorized leave, but also while he is returning from authorized leave. Both these matters should be covered.</p>

<p>As regards my fourth amendment, the provision in clause 2(1)(a)(iv) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A disability shall be deemed also to have been caused by military service&#x2014;if it is the result &#x2026; of such training or which was sustained in an unprovoked assault occasioned by his membership of the S.A. Defence Force &#x2026;</block>

<p>Therefore, the issue is whether the fact that he is a member of the S.A. Defence Force is the cause for the assault. To include the word &#x201C;unprovoked&#x201D; once again creates an onus which I find undesirable. If a man is assaulted within the ordinary course of the term by reason of his membership of the Defence Force, then he should in fact be covered. Let me give an example. If somebody were to insult the Defence Force and a member of the Defence Force were to react, then as a result of this he would have been provoked. To my mind that would be a provoked assault. If anyone defends the Defence Force in these circumstances, then surely he should be covered. In my submission the word &#x201C;unprovoked&#x2019; &#x2019; in these circumstances can only result in difficulties, and that is the reason for the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we in the official Opposition will not support the amendments of the hon. member for Yeoville. We find it strange that the hon. member for Yeoville should suddenly want to consider service beyond the borders of the Republic on the same basis as service within the Republic. We see a difference in the circumstances which can arise in the case of service within and without the Republic. If a person is beyond the borders of the Republic and serving outside the Republic, then he is the total responsibility of the Defence Force. Any injuries which he then suffers should be the responsibility of the State.</p>

<p>We do not believe that it is reasonable to say that you must remove all discretion from the Secretary and that if a man who is on military service anywhere in the Republic, under any circumstances, for any reason whatever, becomes injured, then the Secretary shall have no discretion in ruling that that injury was either due to factors which were not due to his service or to his own misbehaviour or to his own negligence. To suggest that a man, simply because he is wearing a uniform should be absolved from any responsibility for his own actions or behaviour is, we believe, not reasonable, and therefore we feel that the Bill as it stands draws a correct distinction between service outside the Republic and the need to impose a sense of responsibility on people serving in the Republic. Obviously, if conditions arose such as those which were visualized by the hon. member for Yeoville, a different set of circumstances would be created. We must surely not believe that the Secretary is going to rule out compensation for injury which is the result of a state of war or a state of active hostility within the Republic itself. So we think that this distinction is necessary.</p>

<p>As regards the third amendment, which relates to a person proceeding on authorized leave, I want to draw attention to the words &#x201C;to or from his home&#x201D;. If you are travelling to or from your home, that means you are travelling in either direction, to your place of destination. It is quite clear in the Bill and we are not prepared to split hairs over the meaning of words.</p>

<p><span class="col_7945-7946" refersTo="page_1303"/>In regard to the last amendment, which relates to an unprovoked assault, again we do not believe it is reasonable to say that if a man who is wearing a uniform gets full of hops and punches somebody and then gets injured, that provocation should not count as one of the factors to be considered. If a man is assaulted without provocation, then obviously he should be protected, but we do not think it is reasonable to protect a man who provokes an assault and then as a result of provoking, becomes injured. So we do not support these amendments.</p>

<p>I just want to say that I cannot accept the amendments. I do not want to repeat what the hon. member said, but I just want to say that as far as the first two points are concerned, regarding service inside or outside the Republic, our standpoint is supported by the S.A. Legion and other organizations who try to look to the interests of ex-servicemen.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think that will be borne out by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member&#x2019;s third amendment, perhaps the hon. member misread this provision, because it states very clearly &#x201C;to or from his home or place of destination&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As regards the last amendment and the example mentioned by the hon. member, I want to say that if a man insults the S.A. Army or insults his parents, then surely that is provocation and no Secretary or other official would be so foolish as to describe that as being unprovoked, if the person concerned defends his country or he defends himself. I can assure the hon. member that that will be regarded as a provoked assault. Therefore I regret that I cannot accept these amendments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to what the hon. member for Durban Point has said, I want to say that I do not intend to turn this into a petty political argument as he has obviously tried to do. I shall rather try to keep it on the level on which this debate has been conducted so far. I want to come back and deal specifically with this issue. In so far as the difference between &#x201C;inside&#x201D; and &#x201C;outside&#x201D; the Republic is concerned, let us look at how the Bill reads at present. Firstly, a person can only get compensation in any case &#x201C;if it arose or became manifest during the performance of military service&#x201D;. That applies whether it is inside or outside the Republic. The example given by the hon. member for Durban Point is quite irrelevant to the issue. The simple fact is that it states &#x201C;during the performance of military service&#x201D;. The difficulty which arises&#x2014;and I want to draw attention to it very clearly&#x2014;is that there is no difference, to my mind, whether a soldier happens to serve&#x2014;and I am talking now about injury, nothing else; I am not talking about politics&#x2014;on the one side of the border, or whether he is injured on the other side of the border. How can there be any difference? It is illogical that in the one case there is a necessity for the Secretary to exercise his discretion while in the other case it is automatic. The reason why this was originally introduced and why it was supported in the old days by all the service organizations, is that when one served in Egypt, or served in Italy or the desert, there was quite a different situation compared with being in South Africa. But that is no longer the position in regard to wars in which we are going to be involved. The real wars are going to be fought&#x2014;if they are going to be fought and I hope they will not be&#x2014;are going to be fought on our borders and inside our own country. That is what the issue is. Why there should be a disability where discretion now has to be exercised on the one hand where one soldier gets injured because he is inside the border of the Republic and no discretion if he was on the other side, to me is utterly illogical. I think that events will show, and I make the forecast, that although the hon. the Deputy Minister may not accept it today, he will come back in a little while with an amending Bill in which this very matter will be put right. I have no doubt about it.</p>

<p>Then we come to the second amendment, a technical amendment, namely the question of &#x201C;or returning from&#x201D;. If one reads this it is quite clear that one can proceed on authorized leave from one&#x2019;s home. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, all that this amendment is designed to do is to put the matter right from a semantic point of view. If the hon. the Deputy Minister does not want to accept that, I do not mind. It is merely to put the semantics right and I do not feel too strongly about it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister misunderstood me completely with regard to the third amendment. The situation in ordinary <span class="col_7947-7948" refersTo="page_1304"/>law is that an assault which is committed upon someone which is occasioned by his membership of the South African Defence Force does not mean what the hon. member for Durban Point says, namely that the man may be full of hops and gets himself involved in a fight that is not the issue. He is only protected here when the assault takes place because he is a member of the Defence Force. That is what is stated in the Bill. In other words, the ordinary situation does not arise. If he gets involved in a brawl, quite obviously that is not an assault which would be occasioned by his membership of the Defence Force. It is only because of the fact that he serves and because he serves in those circumstances that he is assaulted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>And if he is on crowd control duty?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Let us take the hon. member&#x2019;s example. If he is on crowd control duty, then this does not apply at all. Then he is injured while acting in the performance of his duties in terms of subsection (1), if the hon. member will look at it. Crowd control duty has nothing to do with this. While he is actually performing his duty he is always covered. It is only when he is not acting in the performance of his military service that this provision applies at all. This is the sort of case where the situation may arise in South Africa that some people might be anti-war and might decide to assault soldiers. That is what this is designed to cover, and the hon. member for Durban Point knows it. That is all this is about. When we deal with an unprovoked assault, the example which I gave is that you may find that a soldier finds that the Defence Force is insulted, as a result of which he does something which is then regarded as provocation to the other person to assault him. In these circumstances it could be said that because of his reaction he would have provoked the assault. I gave that as an example. If he is assaulted and the assault is occasioned by his membership of the Defence Force, then he should be covered.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is one query I should like to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister. However, before doing so, I should like to associate myself with what has been said by the hon. member for Durban Point in rejecting various amendments moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. Of importance here is the question of the deletion of &#x201C;outside the Republic&#x201D; and the omission of clause 2(l)(a)(ii). If these amendments were accepted, such acceptance would perhaps place at a disadvantage some of those persons who are going to be vitally affected by the provisions of this Bill. I say this because the date of commencement of this legislation is 1 July 1975. The measure is therefore being made retrospective in effect. This would cover many of the young men who have performed service outside the Republic in Angola These people are also desirous of knowing on what basis their disablement benefits will be granted. The elimination of the discretion, which the hon. member for Yeoville seeks in his amendment, would certainly place these people on a different basis to those who are, for instance, receiving compensation as the result of service in the Korean War in recent times. I do not see why there should be an objection to treating these people who have served in Angola on a different basis to the basis on which those are treated who served in other wars, for example the war in Korea.</p>

<p>The query I want to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister also involves the period of military service. Let me quote for the purposes of my argument clause 2(3)(c), which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The military service of a member shall be deemed to have commenced on the date on which he departed from his home or usual residence to report for military service in terms of the provisions of the Defence Act.</block>

<p>This clearly defines the commencement of his military service, but there appears to be no other provision with regard to when his military service shall cease. For example, those persons undergoing three months&#x2019; service will be returned to their homes when the three months&#x2019; period of service is over. However, they may be injured or killed on the journey home, and there is no provision in the legislation to determine the exact time when &#x201C;military service&#x201D; ceases. I would be grateful if the hon. the Deputy Minister would give some indication of what will be deemed to be the &#x201C;end&#x201D; of the period military service.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I just add a word about the first amendment <span class="col_7949-7950" refersTo="page_1305"/>moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. I think it is important to realize that this makes provision for injury or disability which arises &#x201C;during&#x201D; a period of service, but not for injury or disability directly caused &#x201C;by reason of&#x201D; active involvement in conflict. I am merely raising this issue because the hon. member for Yeoville queried the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s remarks that the S.A. Legion had accepted this position. When a man is outside the Republic he is under the full-time control of the military authorities and as such is their responsibility. This applies to the full period of his being outside the Republic. For that reason we feel the responsibility must be complete when a person is outside the Republic. However, when he is doing military service within the Republic, there are times when he is not under the direct control or command of the military authorities. He does have civilian freedom of movement within his own country, and we believe that a distinction must be drawn under those circumstances. Injuries can well arise while he is doing military service, but because of something that happens in the course of his exercising his normal civilian rights within the country. For that reason the hon. the Deputy Minister is correct in saying that the S.A. Legion was prepared to accept this distinction between service inside and outside the Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not wish to repeat our arguments, but the hon. the Deputy Minister did not reply to the query I raised in the Second Reading concerning the proposed ceiling to the gratuity, a ceiling of respectively R300 and R600.

I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will indicate that he will either remove the ceiling and allow the gratuity to be determined by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, or that he will make provision for some other relief to ensure that the figure is realistic.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I apologize for not having replied in full on this matter during the Second Reading debate, but I just want to tell the hon. member that these amounts were discussed in detail with the S.A.

There is of course no reason why amendments should not be made to this when adjustments are considered next year, changes as foreseen in clause 8.

<block name="quote">On page 15, in lines 50 and 51, to omit &#x201C;persons belonging to different population groups or&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;different&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This particular clause deals with the veterans of past wars, and the issue here is somewhat different to the others, because here we are actually dealing with large numbers of people who are not White and who were not involved in past wars. The reason for this amendment is that, whereas one has had increases which have been applied, the increases have not tended to close the gap, but they have instead tended to widen the gap, because when one has a percentage increase added to both, one has a situation in which the gap can in fact be widened.</p>

<p>In the present circumstances, it is perfectly true that, in so far as the desire to wipe out the gap entirely is concerned, it may be necessary in years to come to give bigger increases to Black people as opposed to the increases given to White people, in order to wipe out the gap and to make the two equal. That can be done, even after the acceptance of the amendment, by the power that the hon. the Minister has to differentiate between categories of people, but not on a basis of race.</p>

<p>Sir, I am just about to finish it. All that I am saying, is that it can&#x2014;in respect of categories of people&#x2014;wipe out the gap without referring to people&#x2019;s race. Taking race as a factor should not come into any issue which arises here. That is why I move this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House did not move an amendment to this particular clause, for the reason&#x2014;partly stated by the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;that there is a difference between the provisions of this clause, which affect the existing pensioners, and those who received pension awards before July 1, 1975. We know that there are something like 2 855 Coloureds and Indians and 1 887 Bantu who are war pensioners and who will be affected by the consolidation which is to take place in terms of this clause. The reason why we did not move an amendment, is that we believe it is perhaps necessary for the hon. the Deputy Minister to have this provision in order to bring about a rapid narrowing of the gap between the pensions paid to Whites and to non-Whites. For this reason we would be pleased if the hon. the Deputy Minister could give an indication as to whether it is necessary for him to retain the clause as it now stands, so as to enable him to differentiate on a favourable basis, particularly among the non-White war pensioners, in order to bring about a narrowing of the gap for the existing pensioners. It is on that basis that we have not moved an amendment to this particular clause. However, we would like to hear the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s explanation as to whether he does require this wording to give effect to the narrowing of the gap.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the only reply I can give to the hon. member is that that is exactly the position. It does not only concern a narrowing of the gap between the different race groups, as it is still applicable at the moment, but also the narrowing of the gap between the different war groups, between ex-servicemen of the different wars. I did say during my Second Reading speech that this matter would be considered by next year. However, I cannot give any assurance as to what will be done in the case of Black people, because that is something I do not know. All I can say, is that attention to the request will be given during the course of next year.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe the situation is very simple. If the desire is to eliminate the gap entirely, the power that the hon. the Minister would have in his hand to differentiate between categories of persons, would be quite adequate. The tragedy is that race is being enshrined in this piece of legislation as a factor on which the hon. the Minister will operate. If, money-wise, the increases are equal, the gap will be virtually eliminated in no time, and the remainder of the gap will be eliminated by the power to distinguish between categories of persons. However, to perpetuate race as a ground for distinction, is something which is undesirable.</p>

<p>Amendment negatived (Progressive Reform Party dissenting).</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 13:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 13 appears to cover the entire position outlined by the hon. the Minister of Defence when he was questioned recently about whose responsibility a wounded ex-serviceman was at certain stages of his career. At first blush it appears that this clause does in fact cover that position, but on closer examination it seems that that is not the position, because what happens here is that the Pensions Act covers a wounded man if in fact he has been certified as having a pensionable disability. It is only after that act takes place, the certification of the wounded man as having a pensionable disability, that the provisions of clause 13 apply. There is an area which is not covered by legislation, the area outlined recently by the hon. the Minister of Defence when he said that the wounded man was covered by the Defence Act and by the military hospital until such time as that wounded man is discharged from hospital and discharged after his service. Immediately he is discharged, says the Minister, he will become the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. Unfortunately that is not the case, because this has been brought to my notice very forcibly recently. I have in my constituency a wounded soldier who was discharged from border <span class="col_7955-7956" refersTo="page_1308"/>service and is no longer a national serviceman or a member or a volunteer, as referred to in clause 13. This man having been discharged, then went back to his job.</p>

<p>I can understand that he can benefit in the opinion of the Secretary if he has any disability.

The case of the voter in my constituency is on all fours with what I am describing here.

I believe it is an historical thing which needs to be looked at in the light of modern conditions.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House wish to state briefly that we have no objection to the Third Reading of the Bill. We have followed with keen interest the various speeches made by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions in regard to further improvements which may be forthcoming with the passing of this Bill. We shall follow the position with keen interest particularly in the light of the view that he expressed that it is the intention of the Government to narrow the gap between the various groups and between the various types of pensioners, which means that the older pensioners can also look forward to further alleviation at some time in the future.</p>

<p>We believe that it is important that the Bill be dealt with expeditiously by virtue of the fact that there will be a considerable number of men, widows and dependants who will derive benefits, particularly in terms of the new formula which will come into operation, and which will be applied retrospectively, as from 1 July 1975. It will also benefit the older pensioners, who look in hope to the Government to afford them some relief as they have suffered considerably in recent times as a result of inflation and other factors.</p>

<p>At this stage it is appropriate to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister and particularly to the senior officials who have devised this new and improved system in regard to the award of war pensions. We hope that it will have the desired effect and that it will be successfully administered.

<summary>(Motion)</summary>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) That the petition from R. H. C. Wood, President of the Transkeian White Citizens Association, praying for leave to be heard at the Bar of the House by counsel in opposition to the provisions of the Status of the Transkei Bill, presented to this House on 1 June, be granted;</li>

<li>(2) that such counsel be heard at the Bar of the House at such time as the House may direct; and</li>

<li>(3) that immediately after such address a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the position of the South African citizens presently owning property in the Transkei, the Committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers.</li>

</ol>

<p>Sir, the motion is an unusual one. The last time, I think, that it was allowed in this House was in 1914. In the Other Place, in 1946, permission was given for an Indian to appear before its Bar. There have been other petitions that have been placed before this House in the past, but they have either not been allowed to be discussed, through being placed at the bottom of the Order Paper, or they have fallen away with the withdrawal of the Bill which affected them. I give as an example the Native Legislation Bill of 1936. I am therefore very grateful to the hon. the Leader of the House for giving me this opportunity of using Government time to introduce my motion.</p>

<p>Sir, a motion of this nature is only allowed in very urgent cases, and I submit that the case I have before the House now is indeed urgent I am pleased to see that the hon. member for Cradock supports my view that applications of this nature should be allowed to be discussed in the House. In an interview with the Press he apparently said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I feel the public don&#x2019;t have the right to be heard at the Bar of the House, but I also feel that direct representation should be made to the Minister.</block>

<p>Direct representations have been made to the Minister on several occasions, and now we plead for the right of these people to appear at the Bar of the House. The hon. member for Cradock went on to say in that interview&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whites living in the Transkei will have to make up their minds whether they want to be South African or Transkeian citizens. I don&#x2019;t think they will be deprived of their citizenship, but at some stage they must decide if they want to stay there.</block>

<p>That is the whole point, Sir. The White Transkeians want the assurance that when they do want to leave, they can in fact do so. I want to stress that the petition does not object in any way to the ideological policy of the Government or to its political effect. Let me read the petition to this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) A Bill titled the Status of the Transkei Bill to grant independence to the Transkei having been introduced in the House of Assembly and (2) no provision being made in the said Bill for the compensation of South African citizens presently owning properties and business in the Transkei, and <span class="col_7963-7964" refersTo="page_1312"/>(3) in view of the hardship, suffering and uncertainty being experienced by the said property owners, your petitioners humbly pray that&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the House, in order to enable the Petitioner to state its case, will grant leave to Counsel to appear on its behalf at the Bar of the House;</li>

<li>(b) the House will appoint, as a matter of urgency, a Select Committee to receive and to investigate the complaints and recommendations of the White property owners of the Transkei, especially in regard to&#x2014;</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(i) the payment of compensation;</li>

<li>(ii) the establishment of a valuation court to consider appeals; and</li>

<li>(iii) making provision in an Act of Parliament for the purchase of their properties by the Government of the Republic after independence.</li>

</ol>

<p>Who is the petitioner? The petitioner is the Transkeian White Citizens Association. It is a non-political association, in terms of its constitution. Its executive committee consists of two representatives appointed by the councils by Butterworth, Idutywa, Engcobo and Umtata. Two are appointed by the Transkei Civic Association, an association of 50 years&#x2019; standing. Two are appointed by the Umtata Chamber of Commerce and six are appointed by the general public of the Transkei. Furthermore, the association has been accepted by the hon. the Minister as an official body representing the Whites in the Transkei.</p>

<p>The Bill provides for the granting of independence by devolving the powers of the Republic completely and absolutely to the Transkei, thus divesting this Parliament of all legislative powers over that area and of interference in local administration after 26 October. The Bill also provides for citizenship of the new and independent State and protects, in a measure, the right of Transkeian citizens living in the Republic. It does not, however, make any reference to rights and the protection of rights of South African citizens who own property and carry on business in the Transkei. In considering their position, we must remember that when the majority of these people acquired their properties and businesses in the Transkei, they were not aware that the Transkei was destined to become a foreign State. When they learnt what was to happen, numbers of them offered their properties to the Government which had, in terms of a White Paper, offered to compensate those who suffered any pecuniary loss through implementation of Government policy. Because of the large numbers of those offering properties, the Government was compelled, for financial reasons, to introduce a priority scheme, a scheme which classified certain owners, e.g. the aged, the infirm, deceased estates. This has caused resentment and hardship. While the Transkei remains part and parcel of the Republic and this Government is responsible for the just government in the area, these owners are prepared to wait their turn, albeit reluctantly. Now, however, circumstances have changed completely and they demand the right to be able to dispose of their properties at any time they please. Their consternation is great because of the meagre funds set aside by the Government for the acquisition of properties in the coming financial year.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister might say, as he has done in the past, that he has given an undertaking that the White Paper issued in 1964 will be applied, no doubt even be up-dated to meet present conditions. We say that that is not enough. The present system provides for priority schemes. This is not satisfactory. There may have been some justification for this system up to date, but there is no justification for it after independence. The Minister may say, too, that he has an agreement with the Transkei Government that the Bantu Trust will buy after independence. He will tell us that the Bantu Trust and Land Act was amended to allow it to buy in independent States. He will tell us, too, that he has made provision for other means of payment, other than cash&#x2014;for instance promissory notes, Government bonds or other scrip. It may do all that, but it does not satisfy this association for Whites living in the Transkei. Its members want protection through legislation.</p>

<p>The Heckroodt Commission was appointed by Dr. Verwoerd to go into the question of <span class="col_7965-7966" refersTo="page_1313"/>compensation for Whites in the Transkei. The commission consisted of Mr. Heckroodt, Dr. Holloway and Mr. Fleming. They visited the Transkei, met the Transkeians publicly and in discussion about the protection which they required, Mr. Heckroodt said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whatever we may recommend and whatever the Government may accept, it will be translated into an Act of Parliament.</block>

<p>This is what they have insisted on all along. They want an Act of Parliament to protect their rights. Similar statements were made by Dr. Holloway and Mr. Fleming. The people there want it made clear in legislation&#x2014;if not in this, then in a separate Act&#x2014;that they have a legal right to compensation, to be paid by whatever South African Government is in power at the relevant time. The inhabitants of Port St. Johns wanted similar protection by way of legislation. They were given assurances by Dr. Verwoerd. On 13 April, 1962, he said in this House that if there were any doubts about certain White areas within the Transkei, like in the case of Port St. Johns, there was no basis for these doubts. Port St. Johns could not be regarded as a White spot. Assurances were given by other Prime Ministers and by the Ministers themselves. Yet we know what happened in the case of Port St. Johns. The inhabitants of Port St. Johns wanted legislation, but they were told it was not necessary. They were White in terms of the law. The Whites in the Transkei therefore now want legislation giving them legal rights to take proceedings against the Government of the Republic for compensation, or they want the immediate provision or sufficient funds to buy up the land of all those who wish to leave before independence. They also want provision for an appeal to an evaluation court should they not be satisfied with the amount offered by the Trust for their properties.</p>

<p>In terms of the White Paper, the Trust may purchase properties at prices approved by the hon. the Minister. Although the hon. the Minister has been reasonable in increasing offers when appeals have been made to him, there have been cases where he has not agreed to the appeals and made increased offers. Prices are therefore now still subject to the whim of a Minister, though not necessarily this Minister. It may even be his successor. They consequently feel they should be given the same rights as other people whose properties are expropriated. Those other people all have a right to go to a board or to a court of appeal. The Whites in the Transkei feel that it is only just that in their circumstances they should have the same right.</p>

<p>I, and other hon. members of this House, have repeatedly raised in this House the question of the Whites in the Transkei, and more recently especially of those in Port St. Johns. They themselves have sought interviews with the hon. the Prime Minister with the object of stating their claims for generous and just treatment. Now at the eleventh hour, when Parliament is about to take the irrevocable step of setting the Transkei on its way to independence, they seek leave of this House to be allowed to appear at the Bar of the House to ask that a Select Committee of members of all parties be appointed to meet them and hear, from them personally, their pleas for protection by way of legislation or otherwise. This should be done before the Transkei obtains independence. After the advent of independence, this Parliament will have no right of interfering in the affairs of the Transkei.</p>

<p>The legislation before the House at present has been described as the most important ever introduced in this Parliament. I therefore appeal to hon. members to make certain that this event is not marred by the sacrifice of our own citizens who will willy-nilly find themselves domiciled in a new and independent State. While it may be very magnanimous of us to give complete freedom, with no strings attached, and with very generous&#x2014;to say the least&#x2014;gifts of money and service assistance to ensure the continued peaceful and orderly development of the Transkei as an independent State, it would be a great pity to spoil this by a sordid act of betrayal of our own citizens without giving them a chance of putting their own case to this House. After all, this is a unique situation in our history. It is an act which the Government hopes will be followed up in the case of others in the years to come. Let us set an example now which will do us credit, not only as far as non-South African citizens are concerned&#x2014;i.e. the Transkeians&#x2014;but also as far as our own citizens are concerned. I appeal to the House to support me in this motion I have moved.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened very attentively to the <span class="col_7967-7968" refersTo="page_1314"/>address delivered by the hon. member for Griqualand East. What he did here this afternoon, was to anticipate the petition to which his motion relates. The argument he delivered here this afternoon on the merits of the case should have been delivered at the Bar of the House. I do not want to do that, but merely want to debate, from the procedural point of view, the question whether this House as such should grant this petition, yes or no. I know that this is something that seldom occurs in this House. As a matter of fact, as far as I know, there are only six persons in this House today who were here in 1952 when a similar application last came before the House.</p>

<p>For those who do not know the origin of this rule, I want to make a few observations on the matter. I think if one wants to debate this motion on its merits, one must first consider why there is a rule in our parliamentary procedure that a person from outside this House may come to the Bar to present his case to Parliament. This is the first question to which I want to furnish a reply.</p>

<p>I do not want to remind us of the history of the British Parliament; all of us know it. It was first the <i>Witenagemot</i> in the Anglo-Saxon period and then became the <i>Magnum Concilium</i> when Latin became the sophisticated language. <i>The Magnum Concilium</i> came to be known as <i>the Parlementum</i> for the first time on 19 December 1241, and this was a Latinized form of the French word <i>parler</i>. The most significant fact is that the ordinary member of the public, the man outside Parliament, the &#x201C;commoner&#x201D; as he was called, at that time did not have the right to introduce legislation in Parliament, neither personally nor through a representative. As a matter of fact, it was in 1254 that Simon de Montfort for the first time summoned together the knights of the counties as &#x201C;representatives of the people&#x201D;. They did not meet as true representatives of the people, because they were appointed and not elected, but this is the way in which the people eventually obtained representation in the British Parliament.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that legislation was originally introduced by way of petition. One must, however, go back to the Latin interpretation of the word. The Latin word for legislation is <i>judicium,</i> from which is derived the English word &#x201C;judgement&#x201D;, which really means &#x201C;oordeel&#x201D;. It is very interesting that in the year 1414, under Henry V, a petition was presented to the House of Commons for the first time. This petition led to the passing of the first legislation by Parliament. We must give Henry V credit for that. It then came about that, because there were knights in Parliament who represented not the people outside, but themselves, persons outside Parliament were granted the right to appear at the Bar of the House in order to present their case there or to introduce legislation personally. In this connection I should like to refer to 1485, when the first woman appeared at the Bar and successfully presented a petition. Her legislation was passed unanimously by the House. This happened in spite of the fact that women only obtained the franchise in 1918. The practice of allowing petitions to be presented was continued because the strange situation existed in the House of Commons that in 1606, for example, more than 40 members were below the age of 18 years. In fact, in 1621 the youngest member ever was elected to Parliament. He was a certain Edmund Waller, who was elected a member of Parliament at the age of 15. Such a young member then procured a competent person, for example an advocate, to stand at the Bar and introduce the necessary legislation on his behalf. From this arose the practice which we still have today and in connection with which this issue is being debated today.</p>

<p>Only after the First Reform Bill, the Second Reading of which was agreed to by one vote&#x2014;the vote was 302 against 301&#x2014;had been placed on the Statute Book in 1832, the total number of voters in Britain was doubled to become 400 000. After the Second Reform Bill was passed in 1867 the franchise was extended so that 2,5 million people became entitled to vote. The Third Reform Bill, 1884, subsequently doubled the number to 5 million voters. Voters&#x2019; rolls were then introduced for the first time and voters could elect their own representatives. As a result their legally elected representatives took their seats in Parliament, instead of nominated members.</p>

<p>From 1910 to 1948 there were five occasions and subsequently three more occasions in this Parliament&#x2014;and then I leave out of account what happened in the Cape Parliament&#x2014;on which petitions such as the one dealt with by the hon. member in his motion today, were dealt with by this House. As a result of the Indemnity and Undesirables Special Deportation Bill of 1914 Adv. P. F. <span class="col_7969-7970" refersTo="page_1315"/>Smit requested at the time to appear on behalf of persons who had already been deported and were already on board ship bound for Europe. They themselves were not here. In other words, they were not voters who could present their case here through the agency of their representatives. They were already on board ship and were already on their way abroad. For that reason the then Parliament granted the petition.</p>

<p>I may just add that that Bill of Gen. Smuts was so important that the Second Reading speech lasted 6&#x00BC; hours. This is still regarded as a record in Parliament today. Moreover, Adv. Smit was the only person ever to have appeared before both the House of Assembly and the Senate. I may add that the Government of the time thought nothing of his arguments. In fact, they were rejected by 95 votes to 11. The second case where a person was allowed to appear at the Bar in this Parliament and to present his case, was that of an Indian named M.D. Barmania. This was in 1946. He appeared before the Senate. It is not necessary for me to give the reference, because it will only take up time. The Government rejected his petition by 22 votes to 13 in the Senate. In other words, even in that instance there was no merit whatsoever in the case.</p>

<p>I just want to give hon. members an indication of what kind of legislation has resulted in persons applying to appear at the Bar. After 1948 there was the case of Mrs. Ballinger, who asked whether certain persons could appear at the Bar of the House in consequence of the Suppression of Communism Act. In 1951 a similar application was received as a result of the Act relating to separate voters&#x2019; rolls for Coloured persons. I can continue in this way. As I have said, there was also the case of Margaret Ballinger on 19 May 1952, subsequent to which Fred Carneson submitted certain petitions.</p>

<p>I see my time is running out fast. The important point I wish to emphasize is that, as I have said, petitions initially played an important part in Parliament. I just want to furnish one figure which hon. members can place under their pillows to ponder upon. The Parliament which sat from 1910 to 1915 received no fewer than 2 475 petitions. Since then Parliament has changed throughout the world. It has changed not only in South Africa, but also in Britain, Canada and the other Commonwealth countries.</p>

<p>Over the years the kind of application presented by the hon. member here today, has been pushed aside to an increasing extent for the simple reason that there are representatives in Parliament today who can plead the cause of the voters concerned if it is necessary to do so. According to the 1970 census there were 9 281 White persons&#x2014;not voters&#x2014;in the Transkei. What is in actual fact happening now, is that that hon. member, who is a lawyer and who represents those people in the Transkei, is by way of this motion asking this House that another lawyer should come to plead for his own people. The hon. member is today making the significant admission that he is not competent to plead on behalf of his own voters. That is why he has come forward with this motion. He, a lawyer, is now asking that another lawyer should act for him. I have never in my life experienced it that a lawyer says: &#x201C;I am unable to present my own case; I am going to ask another lawyer to present my case,&#x201D; whether it be in court, before Parliament or wherever. The crux of the matter is that the people concerned have their representative in Parliament. If he is unable to present their case, he ought not to represent that electoral division here. Let him then make way for another man.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I notice that the clock is ticking away very rapidly. The point I want to make is that, if this Parliament allows petitions relating to legislation and requesting that leave be granted to counsel or to persons outside Parliament to appear at the Bar of the House, to be presented at will, this Parliament will open a door which it will never be able to close again. I have before me a mass of legislation which was piloted through Parliament in this year alone. I have looked through it and I may venture to say that in connection with 75&#x0025; of the legislation applications could have been made for the persons concerned to have been allowed to present their case here personally.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point. The opening created in that way could never be closed again. In other words, it would simply amount to this, that this Parliament would continually be dealing with people from outside, people who are in fact represented in this House and whose actions could rightly be interpreted as indicating that their representative <span class="col_7971-7972" refersTo="page_1316"/>was not competent to present their case here, with the result that they prefer to appoint counsel to present their case at the Bar of the House. That is what the result would be.</p>

<p>There are, however, very clear rulings on cases of this nature. These rulings mean in effect that when such a petition is granted, it should not be one dealing with political policy. I quote from <i>Parliamentary Procedure in South Africa</i> by Ralph Kilpin. On page 7 he writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Opposition in Parliament to questions of public policy such as are dealt with in public bills is restricted to members; but petitions may be received in opposition to public bills and leave is sometimes given to counsel to appear at the bar of the House on second reading or other stages when a Bill is of so peculiar a character as to justify a hearing of parties whose interests, as distinct from the general interests of the country, have been directly affected by it.</block>

<p>The question of the independence of the Transkei forms part of the political set-up in this country. It is not coincidentally involved here. The Transkei is an integral part of the political set-up in the country.</p>

[Interjections.] My time is very limited, but I do want to make a further quotation, this time from <i>Parliamentary Practice</i> by Sir T. Erskine May. I refer to page 476 of the 11th edition, where we are given an indication of what we should in fact do with this motion. In this case it was a Bill that was involved, but I want to make it applicable to this motion. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And even so late as the 3rd June, 1772, the Lords having amended a money clause in the Com Bill, Governor Pownall moved that the Bill be rejected, which motion being seconded, the Speaker said &#x201C;that he would do his part of the business, and toss the Bill over the table&#x201D;. The Bill was rejected and the Speaker, according to his promise, threw it over the table, &#x201C;several members on both sides of the question kicking it as they went out&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to say, so that there should be no misunderstanding, that I think the last remarks by the hon. member for Middelburg are an insult &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Middelland, then; it makes no difference; they are equally bad. The last remarks by the hon. member are an insult to people who are sincerely trying to protect their property interests. To treat them with contempt such as this, I find unbelievable from a senior and responsible hon. member of this House. [Interjections.] I believe that to speak in those terms is something that, with great respect, the hon. member should have thought of before deciding to make a joke at the expense of people who are sincerely seeking to protect their interests. [Interjections.] The hon. member tried to start his address to this House by relying upon precedents, by relying upon principles, and as he went along, he adapted precedents and principles to serve his own particular purpose. The truth is that there are statements by hon. learned Speakers of this House which completely negate what the hon. member has said. I want to quote, if I may, a specific one which shows what the practice is. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the admitted practice of Parliament to hear petitioners, either by themselves or by counsel, at the Bar of the House on any Bill or other legislative measure in which the peculiar interests of the petitioners are directly involved or in which an alleged injury is apprehended.</block>

<p>This is the very point of the request of the hon. member for Griqualand East. This is exactly the point. It is not correct to say that a member of parliament is the only representative when it comes to an issue. The truth is, according to the rulings of Speakers, going back a long <span class="col_7973-7974" refersTo="page_1317"/>time, that when a matter is of general interest and when it affects the country as a whole, it is for the members of Parliament to speak on that general political issue. However, when it is a matter in which particular people are specifically involved, then the people themselves are entitled to be heard. That is the truth of it and if you want examples of it, the example of 1914 which the hon. member quoted from is a classic example because the issue of deportation affects nobody more than the person who is being deported. The issue of one&#x2019;s property in the Transkei affects nobody more than the person whose property is in the Transkei. It is a particular interest relating to that particular matter. The political decision as to whether or not the Transkei should become independent is a completely different matter which is unrelated to the matter under discussion and it is accordingly not proper to debate this matter.</p>

<p>That is not correct, because the hon. member well knows that they were South African citizens and had not been deprived of their citizenship when they were being deported. The hon. member knows this better than anyone else and yet, despite that, he says that they were not represented. Is that not correct? They were not deprived of their citizenship. How dare he say that, Mr. Speaker? Let us go to the other cases. The hon. member knows, better than anyone else, &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>In exactly the same way as they instructed their counsel, they could have instructed their member of Parliament. With respect, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is being childish. Let me go further and give the hon. member another example. In 1936, as the hon. member knows, since he made a study of it, there were representations that there should be a hearing at the Bar granted for people who opposed what was then called the Native Representation Bill. This request was granted even although they were not heard because the matter was at the bottom of the Order Paper.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>That is right.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>That is right; and they were represented in Parliament at the stage when that measure was to be made applicable to them. That is the issue. It is a peculiar interest in a particular matter which is the real issue to be decided.</p>

<p>We can go further. In 1932 the South African Indian Congress was allowed to protest against the Transvaal Land Tenure Bill because they had a particular interest, a particular interest in regard to property. And yet the other example the hon. member quoted demonstrates how the principle is involved. When it came to the Suppression of Communism Bill, it was said that that was a matter of general political interest and did not deal specifically with people. There are also similar examples of that kind. Where you have a particular, peculiar interest&#x2014;and the word &#x201C;peculiar&#x201D; is used in its technical sense&#x2014; then that is a right that should be extended to you, but when a general political issue is at stake, it is another matter.</p>

<p>The job of the hon. member for Griqualand East, who can defend himself, in this Parliament is to talk about whether or not the Transkei should become independent. That is a matter of general political interest. He can look after his constituents as well, but there is nothing wrong when people who are affected and who have property there, say that they want to be heard.</p>

<p>Let me give another example. There is a procedure which the hon. member who spoke before me knows about, viz. the procedure in front of a Select Committee. A Select Committee is, in fact, Parliament. How many times have we heard that we must hear people who are interested before a Select Committee? Nobody says that there should not be Select Committees because the members of Parliament have the answers to everything and can represent everybody in the country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point. All they wish to ask for at the Bar of the House, is for a Select Committee to be appointed. If we agree to appoint a Select Committee without hearing them at the Bar of the House, I am certain the hon. member for Griqualand East will support it, and certainly we in these benches shall do so. That is all they are asking for.</p>

<p>I now want to test the uniqueness of the situation. The hon. member dramatically holds up a bunch of legislation and says that on all these things they could be heard all the time. I now want to know from that hon. member how many times we are going to create independent States in South Africa. Will there be 100 of them in Bills that the hon. member talks about? Is this not a unique occasion in the history of South Africa? Is it not a particular occasion in South Africa where one should, at this dramatic moment, take a different view and allow everybody to be heard? It is the essence of democracy that one should try and bring the participation of people as close to the people as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member went back in history. Let me go to the home of democracy, to Greece, where in fact the people participated in the true sense of the word. The whole history and tradition of this House&#x2014;and this is why we hear people at the Bar&#x2014;is based upon these old traditions of the participation of the people in the determination of their own destiny. At this unique moment in the history of South Africa, the hon. member, who presumably speaks for his party, seeks to deprive people who are fundamentally interested of this fundamental participation in the democratic process. With great respect, I think it is something which is not to the credit of the party for which that hon. member has just spoken.</p>

<p>I think it is a unique moment. I am not talking of the merits of the case; I am talking about the fact that there are people here who have vested interests, interests in property, and who, at the present moment, have to rely purely on the word of the Government that they will be compensated. There is no legal right to it, there is no actual machinery, as has been indicated, and they are asking that they should be heard. They are simply asking to be heard and they are going to be deprived of that simple right by a majority vote of this Parliament. I think it is something which ordinary people will find very difficult to understand. That is why we have no difficulty. We in these benches support the motion of the hon. member for Griqualand East but we do not wish to debate the merits of the matter, because that is the task of a Select Committee. We do not wish to debate the issue of the Transkei now, but we ask the Government, at a unique moment in South Africa&#x2019;s history, not to negate a fundamental concept of people who have interests and who are affected, while all they ask is to be heard. They should not be deprived of that democratic right.</p>

However, I congratulate him on having said it first. Basically, what it amounts to is that the hon. member for Griqualand East yesterday began to submit the testimonial of his own incompetence to the House.

<p>I could tell the hon. member for Durban Point where he can go to. Yesterday I explained to the hon. member for Griqualand East and the petitioner the case which will undoubtedly still be discussed in the House, and told them they would receive documents for perusal. I explained to them that agreements had been concluded with the Transkei relating to the procedures we would adopt, as we have done over the past two years under the White Paper. I refer to the compensation for the White people in the Transkei who are to be bought out. I also explained that the agreement we concluded with the Transkei is authorized in clause 5 of the Bill. The hon. member states that no reference is made in the Bill to anything of the kind, but that it is a half-truth, if not entirely an untruth. When the petitioner was with me yesterday, in the company of the hon. member, he addressed a personal request to me that the matter be stated in legislation. I conveyed the request to the Government, as I undertook to do. But the Government deems it totally unnecessary to make references of this nature in legislation on a larger scale than that to which I have just referred and which is covered by section 5. It is also covered by the authorization for the Bantu Trust to make purchases within the Transkei after independence. Under legislation piloted through the House earlier this year, the Bantu Trust can in fact effect transfers of rights of such properties to people in the Transkei after they have been purchased. The hon. member must therefore go and tell his petitioners that the wording of their petition is not based on the true facts. I shall shortly be referring to the petition itself in order to disprove further some of the statements it contains.</p>

<p>Why did the Government decide to say that it was unnecessary to introduce further duplicating legislative provisions in this connection? This was not said merely because the Government had stated by way of announcements&#x2014;I myself have stated this repeatedly in the House&#x2014;that it would carry out the undertaking as elucidated in the White Paper until after independence. But we have a very long, long record and tradition in connection with this matter. [Interjections.] Sir, the hon. member over there must not blow hot and cold at me. A few minutes ago he pretended that I had supposedly been so good to the people and now he is reproaching me by saying that we cannot be trusted. Sir, what are the facts? Forty years under various governments, under the governments of various parties from 1936 to date, the purchases of land have been carried out by the S.A. Bantu Trust and generally speaking, in that time the people have never availed themselves of the kind of appeal the hon. member came and requested here today. As regards the purchases of this kind of property which this petition is about, properties within the Transkei, we have been doing this for the past 12 years in terms of the White Paper, and thus far there has been general satisfaction in this regard. This is this government&#x2019;s record and these are the facts which indicate that it is unnecessary to pass <span class="col_7979-7980" refersTo="page_1320"/>further duplicating legislation. I see the hon. member wants to put a question to me.</p>

<p>That hon. member would do better to remain silent. But what is more, that hon. member ought to realize, and I say this to the hon. member for Yeoville, too, because in fact that is all I need to say to him in reply to his speech&#x2014;he only really spoke in competition with the UP&#x2014;that the people, the Whites in question here, the Whites in the Transkei, were not being deprived of representation in the Transkei by this Government. They are still going to remain voters for this Parliament and will still have the opportunity every five years to send capable people to this Parliament to champion their interests here. They will continue to have representation in this Parliament, but after the self-confessions made today by the hon. member for Griqualand East that he is unable to put the case of those people and that someone else must appear before the Bar of the House for that purpose, it would not surprise me if they were to elect someone else to put their case. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I should now like to refer briefly to what is stated in the petition. I do not take it greatly amiss of the petitioners that their petition is not based on correct facts, because it seems obvious to me that either they had no one to advise them or else they only had the hon. member for Griqualand East to do so. They state that the Transkei Act does not make provision for compensation. I have already dealt with this point by referring to the White Paper in connection with this. [Interjections.] Sir, it is extremely difficult for me to speak in the face of such rudeness. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall withdraw the word &#x201C;rudeness&#x201D;. Sir, if they do not want to listen to me, they can leave. I say that the compensation factor has been covered by the agreement with the Transkei which the Government will ratify in the usual way, and the covering of that agreement by clause 5 of the Status Bill which this House is still to pass. I have already expressed myself with regard to the request of the petitioners that they want an advocate here to speak on their behalf and it is unnecessary to repeat what I said earlier with reference to the opinion of the hon. member for Griqualand East in this connection, but I do just want to add that as far as the compensation is concerned&#x2014;I omitted to say this just now&#x2014;in the past 12 years alone we have already paid out approximately R33 million to people for this kind of property we are discussing here this afternoon. Hon. members cannot therefore come and tell us that we have been insensitive about this matter in the past.</p>

<p>Then the petitioners go on to ask that a Select Committee be appointed after their appearance here to investigate their problems, <i>inter alia,</i> those relating to compensation, and also in respect of the establishment of a court to value the properties, a valuation court. This, too, is unnecessary because the White Paper and the system according to which we have operated thus far, according to the White Paper, provides for a system of compensation which, as I say, has involved us paying out over R33 million, to the satisfaction of all those people and without their trying to make use of appeal procedures. In a certain sense they have this.</p>

<p><span class="col_7981-7982" refersTo="page_1321"/>The last point I want to deal with is the request of the petitioners that provision be made by way of an Act of Parliament for their properties to be purchased after independence. This is a totally unnecessary request because the Trust Act is the Act under which we are going to purchase the land. What is more, as regards the action of the Trust in transferring properties, this has been supplemented by Act No. 4 of 1976 which we passed here earlier this year. In other words, not one of those statements made by the petitioners is entirely correct. I therefore do not think that this House has any reason to comply with the request of the petitioners nor the proposal made by the hon. member for Griqualand East.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know what term to use, Sir, but I shall obey your ruling and say his references to me were insulting and he showed me no courtesy. He has not helped us at all today; in fact, he has made the position worse. It shows once again that we have in charge of this operation a Minister who does not understand what it is all about. We are at the mercy of a Minister like this.</p>

<p>What did the hon. the Minister say? He said that protection was being given to the White people of the Transkei in terms of clause 5 of the Bill. What these people want is legislation giving them a right against this Government. They want legislation which can force the Government to take certain action. There is nothing at all in this legislation which gives them any right. What does clause 5 do? Clause 5 deals with treaties, conventions and agreements entered into between the Government of the Republic and the Government of the Transkei. It has nothing to do with the White people in the Transkei. There is no liability for this Government towards them here. They want an Act which states that this Government &#x201C;shall&#x201D; buy, not that this Government can enter into a contract with the Transkei Government that the Bantu Trust &#x201C;may&#x201D; buy.</p>

<p>What protection does the White Paper (W.P. C.C.&#x2014;&#x2019;64) give? Let me read this White Paper on which the hon. the Minister made so much score. When the recommendations were made by Mr. Heckroodt, it was understood that legislation would be introduced at the same time to give protection and stability to the White people. The White Paper states&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(b) The adjustment committee will value businesses, including goodwill, as indicated hereunder, and submit its recommendations to the Minister&#x2014;</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(i) Land Value;</li>

<li>(ii) Value of improvements which existed on 30 June 1963;</li>

<li>(iii) Goodwill being profits for 3 years, calculated retrospectively from 30 June 1963; and</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(c) Such properties may be purchased by the South African Native Trust at prices as may be approved by the Minister.</li>

</ol>

<p>Everything is &#x201C;may be&#x201D;. The Bantu Trust &#x201C;may&#x201D; buy. The amendments which we passed the other day do note state that the Trust &#x201C;must&#x201D; buy the properties of the Whites in the Transkei. It said it &#x201C;may&#x201D; buy them. It may but at prices approved by the Minister. What protection is that? The hon. the Minister asked us to accept his word. He says that he has made the promises and he has carried out the conditions as set out in the White Paper. What was the experience of Port St. Johns, to come back to this question? What was the value of the promises made not only by the hon. the Minister, but also by the then hon. the Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd himself? Absolutely no value at all.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>No, but they are stuck with their properties; they cannot get rid of them. That is what is happening. The hon. the <span class="col_7983-7984" refersTo="page_1322"/>Minister did not rob anybody, but he did pay somebody R2 million for land that was not worth it. The others now have to sit there and are unable to sell their properties at all. The hon. the Minister, in reply to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, referred to a &#x201C;wild&#x201D; statement he made about nationalization. What has happened everywhere in the north? Has not just that process been going on? What did the late Dr. Verwoerd say in this House when he was warning about White capital going into the Reserves? He said that if anybody puts capital into the Reserves and the assets are nationalized, they must not come to him for assistance. That was what Dr. Verwoerd said. He issued that warning at the time. There is another question which I should like to ask. What will happen if the Transkei Government refuses&#x2014;this is a very grave fear which the people have there&#x2014;to allow people to take money out of the country? What will happen then to the people who have their properties there? How are they going to be paid out? They want to know things like that. What will happen if the Transkei Government imposes a purchases tax or the capital gains tax? Those people want to know things like this. How can they be satisfied? This Government is giving them nothing. All they are given are promises. I appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister. What these people want is a legal obligation on any South African Government&#x2014;not only this Government&#x2014;at any relevant time so that it will be forced to buy up the properties. What happens if nationalization takes place overnight? Will the Government then buy up all those properties? Does the hon. the Prime Minister agree with what the hon. the Minister said this Government would purchase?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, after the last hour I think I can now understand why there will be a negative response to the request of the hon. member for Durban Central to show the Cabinet as they are on television. [Interjections.] I think if South Africa had seen the Cabinet in action this afternoon with their concern or their non-concern for the little man, they would have realized what is really at stake. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, I hope you will allow me, before I raise a few specific issues about television with the hon. the Minister, just to respond very briefly to the attack which was made on the Press last night by the hon. member for Durban Point during the course of this debate. I raise this issue because this is the kind of attack which is now becoming part of the small change not only of the politically intolerant which we have become used to in the past, but also of the politically disappointed and dispossessed. I think there is a very important principle involved in this. The hon. member for Durban Point made the astonishing remark last night that the Press in South Africa was free, but that it was also tied and not independent. In heaven&#x2019;s name, how can a Press be free and at the same time be tied? Dit gaan my verstand heeltemal te bowe. He complained&#x2014;we know this was the gravamen of his charge&#x2014;that the English newspapers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; were the sycophants and the camp followers, if not the masters, of the PRP.</block>

<p>For this reason he looks to the SABC to give, what he calls, a balanced political picture of South Africa. All I can say to him is that there is no harm in hoping. He can keep on hoping.</p>

<p>I want to tell the Committee&#x2014;I think it is important&#x2014;that there is no editor of any newspaper in this country, of whatever language medium, who will, if he has any kind of self-respect, adopt a political line in which he does not believe. That is an absolute fact. I do not care what the theory is, but this is a fact. [Interjections.] Why should there always be doubt about the integrity of professional people like journalists? I think it is utter nonsense. Every editor tries to the best of his ability to present a balanced picture. That is all he can do. He can do no more than that. I can say without any fear of contradiction that no editor will accept instructions from managers or owners of newspapers. That is a simple fact. One final word: I wish, in heaven&#x2019;s name, that those who are constantly denigrating the Press would realize the very grave disservice they are doing not only to Press freedom but, what is much more important, to democracy itself or, at least, to the little democracy there is in this country. Therefore, the sooner they stop it, the better.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister two recent Sunday evening television programmes for which the organizer of religious broadcasts, Mr. Bill Chalmers, was responsible. There is a very important principle involved in this and that is why I mention this person by name. In the first of the programmes there was mention of a discredited anti-semitic document called &#x201C;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&#x201D;, which Mr. Chalmers actually recommended to his viewers. He did have the grace to add that the work was now &#x201C;rejected by a number of authorities&#x201D;, but what he did not say is that it had been ruled to be a forgery by the South African courts as well as courts elsewhere in the world. The second was a programme last Sunday evening in which Mr. Chalmers advanced the astonishing if not entirely original theory that Western high finance and top <span class="col_7987-7988" refersTo="page_1324"/>banking families were somehow behind international communism and that they were bent on the destruction of Western-style government, property rights, family life and religion.</p>

<p>I say that this is not a wholly original theory because it has been advanced on quiet &#x201C;stryddae&#x201D; in the far out-back. It is usually advanced by the HNP and sometimes by some of the more acceptable of our &#x201C;stryders, oud en jonk&#x201D;. Nobody objects to intelligent and reasonable controversy on television. On the contrary, this is what any intelligent person needs and wants. It is when we reach the level of the wholly eccentric that viewers have a right to protest. I suggest in all seriousness that both the programmes to which I have referred fall within that lunatic fringe. What I want to know from the hon. the Minister is whether the SABC is entitled to allow a man with Mr. Chalmers&#x2019; eccentric views free reign on television. I say, emphatically, &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I believe it is dangerous to allow people of such insensitivity to make their own value judgments on such very sensitive issues. I suggest in all seriousness that such a man should be put into a position where he will have no final responsibility. What is more, this is no isolated incident. This is not something that has suddenly &#x201C;ontpopped&#x201D;. I should like to remind the Committee that a year ago the hon. member for Pinelands in this House quoted Mr. Chalmers as saying: &#x201C;I am grateful, I am intensely grateful to the SABC for the vital role it plays in God&#x2019;s plans&#x201D;. The hon. member then went on to suggest that the SABC should at least be equally grateful to Mr. Chalmers, and I quote: &#x201C;Because he has been on record many times, both on the radio and in the newspapers, and I suppose he will be on record on television in future&#x201D; &#x2026; this was 15 months ago &#x2026; &#x201C;as being 100&#x0025; committed to the policy of separate development. Mr. Chalmers is also on record as having said: &#x2018;The Government is on the side of God in maintaining this fortress of Christianity&#x2019;.&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, I want to say that, for all the gratitude that the SABC owes Mr. Chalmers and <i>vice versa,</i> the listening and the viewing public has a right to be spared his way&#x2014;out and excessively provocative views, unless it is prepared at the same time to give equal time to more orthodox thinkers to refute his views. I hope that this will happen.</p>

<p>I do not suggest that Mr. Chalmers is not sincere. All I know is that some of the most misguided people in life have been sincere. That is no excuse of any nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say a few words about the proposal to spend R102 million on providing a television service for Africans. I hope the hon. the Minister and his advisers will have second thoughts on this matter. To begin with, I would like to say that the number of Black people who will benefit by such a service at this stage or in the near future will be relatively small. As we know, most African homes have no electricity, and the high cost of a television set makes it unlikely that this facility will be widely used. Secondly, the cultural level of the Black people who will be able to afford television will, in any event, be relatively high. They will, therefore, derive as much enjoyment, I suggest, from the present single-channel service as most White people. This will be even truer if the SABC broadened its base a little bit and sometimes forgot its ethnic hang-up.</p>

<p>Finally&#x2014;and this, I believe, is an important argument&#x2014;according to a newspaper survey, the people of Soweto would much rather have free compulsory education than a separate television service. They take this stand on the fact that R102 million, which TV would cost them, is enough to provide free and compulsory education for Africans within four years. If it came to a choice, there is absolutely no doubt about what Black people would choose, and there is certainly no doubt as to what would be in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not wish to suggest for one moment that television should not provide for people of colour; in fact, the almost total absence of Black, Coloured and Indian faces on South African television today is one of its major defects: it gives the whole service an air of unreality. I suggest the SABC should try very much harder than it is doing at the moment to think of this country as a country of 25 million people, and not of 2,5 million or&#x2014;as even sometimes, in their generous moments&#x2014;of 4 million people. As far as the present single-channel arrangement is concerned, I hope that the hon. the Minister and the SABC will not lightly change to separate channels&#x2014;English and Afrikaans. My experience is that there has been considerable sympathy for this present system. However, there will be pressure which will build up. Not only does it help to promote bilingualism, but I believe it contributes something towards a mutual cultural understanding <span class="col_7989-7990" refersTo="page_1325"/>in the broader sense. In any case, I believe it is wholesome for one language group to be exposed to another. The hon. the Minister has taken the point. I shall not elaborate on it.</p>

<p>There is one final issue that I would like to raise. I want to say a few words about a programme which was broadcast on Monday evening, the programme &#x201C;Bakens op die Republikeinse Pad&#x201D;. If this programme was supposed to be plainly and simply the story of the National Party&#x2019;s struggle to establish a Republic, it should have been clearly labelled as such. It should not have had to masquerade in the guise of being something else, of being the story of South Africa&#x2019;s progress towards a Republic. [Interjections.] As a snatch of sectional documentation it had no place on television, unless the other side of the story was also told. The fact that some kind of other side is apparently to be presented tonight&#x2014;and I look forward to seeing this&#x2014;is surely a tacit admission that the first programme was one-sided and was unfair to many listeners and was regarded as such.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not have time to concern myself with the lot of nonsense the hon. member spoke. I have 10 minutes to speak and we are dealing with other important things. I cannot reply to him and still say what I want to in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s calculation of time is just as incorrect as his politics. Let us be practical and ask ourselves what we want to achieve with the education and training of our pupils. I want to mention seven things in reply to this question. Firstly, we want to establish a positive <i>joie de vivre</i> in our young people. Four basic truths of life stem from a positive <i>joie de vivre</i>. These are that one tolerates criticism, endures hardships, endures injustice and survives hardships. Furthermore one astonishes oneself with one&#x2019;s courage and succeeds with one&#x2019;s conviction. To me, if there is a model of <i>joie de vivre</i> which is built into an organization and the people who serve the organization, then it is the National Party. Let us enumerate the points. We tolerated criticism over the years; dirty criticism. We endured injustice and our history is laced with this. We survived hardships, astonished the world with our courage and won convincingly. If we can establish those ideas in our people, then we have brought home to them a basic truth which has stood the test of centuries.</p>

<p>The second point is the enthusiastic awareness of one&#x2019;s vocation. If only we could establish this idea amongst our children! Let us see whether we can. Dr. Malan said: &#x201C;Believe in yourself, believe in your nation, believe in your God.&#x201D; What is the message inherent in this? A vocation, an awareness of a vocation. What does Strijdom say? He said: &#x201C;The struggle continues.&#x201D; To what purpose? To achieve one&#x2019;s vocation. What did Verwoerd say? He said: &#x201C;A nation creates its own future.&#x201D; This is its vocation. What does Vorster say? He said: &#x201C;Fulfil your vocation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The third point is respect and veneration for life. We have to establish that idea amongst our young people: Respect and veneration for life. Because life is God. At the moment the whole world is looking for a new evaluation of life. In this exaggerated humanism, this exaggerated sensitivity to which we are subjected, especially we here in South Africa, not an after-effect of the reaction against the contempt and denial of the respect for life during the Second World War and the misery and suffering which stemmed from it?</p>

<p>The fourth is appreciation for the fine and beautiful. When recently we strolled through the mountains with the officials of the Department of Forestry, I realized that I do not need a Bible under my arm to turn me into a believer. I only have to look at the Omnipotent, the good and beautiful to find something in it which I can cherish, love and live for.</p>

<p>The fifth is love of one&#x2019;s neighbour and charitable service. Yesterday when the hon. member for Westdene said that there are more than 2 000 welfare organizations in South Africa, I immediately thought of all the wonderful virtues which have already been built into our national structure.</p>

<p>The sixth is the joyful willingness to serve one&#x2019;s country and its inhabitants. For example look at our men on the border. Those with long hair must not simply be condemned without qualification, because I have testimony that people with long hair fought most courageously and bravely on the border.</p>

<p>I am speaking of our people, those who have built-in qualities.</p>

<p>The seventh is a strong, positive religious focus.</p>

<p>If we can build these seven characteristics into our people, then I am not afraid. Whose responsibility is it to do so? It must start with the parent and from the parent it is transferred chiefly to the teacher and he must take it further. I want to say at once that no country in the world is rich enough to pay the right class teacher sufficiently for his services. If we think that we can buy the inner qualities in a teacher as a person, as a setter of examples, as an inspiration and inculcator of these seven factors which I mentioned, with money, then we are making a fatal mistake. If we think that we can eliminate overnight all the complexities with which we are dealing in our fatherland, with money and legislation, then we are making a mistake. If I think of the foolish, simplified educational system of Sweden and compare it with our education with its diverse cultures, our built-in historical-political problems and our geographic ties which lead to fragmentation, division, wastage of labour and finance, then I see that we are making a mistake to want to try and rectify it with money. For these reasons, this council which the hon. the Minister created, is the introduction to a whole new era in our education.</p>

<p>This new professional education council, this honorary council, will have an immense task upon its shoulders. This council will have to ensure that the academic consolidation which has been introduced in the training of teachers, a consolidation between colleges and university, will remain an academic consolidation and that it will not contribute towards the destruction of the effective forming milieu of education. We shall have to ensure that the forming milieu and background of teachers remains unimproved. I welcome the consolidating role which the new dispensation in respect of educational institutions and universities will play in the academic sphere. A further point is that the council will have to perpetuate the idea of unity in our teacher training. In future it will have to give special attention to its contribution towards the maintenance of an education-orientated vocational training. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the music of the <i>Stem van Suid-Afrika</i> was composed by the Rev. M. L. de Villers in the Stempastorie at Simonstown. The address of the parsonage is No. 1 Church Street, Simonstown, and the parsonage borders on the grounds of the D.R. Church on the one hand and on the Submarine Headquarters on the other. These buildings are all situated between the Main Road and the sea. For the past 15 years the parsonage itself has belonged to Rev. Hennie Louw who until recently was the Senior Naval Chaplain in Simonstown and who retired at the end of last year. The premises of the D.R. Church are the property of the Navy and not the D.R. Church, but they are of course made available for the use of the community. Over the past year I have held discussions with Rev. Louw, senior Naval officers and the Department of Community Development with a view to acquiring the parsonage for the State, the Navy or any other State body that would be able to ensure its preservation. The minister himself is a willing seller.</p>

<p>Everyone to whom I have spoken, feel strongly about the fact that the parsonage, the birthplace of our beloved national anthem, should be preserved at all costs. However, there is a problem in this connection. What person or what body can buy Rev. Louw&#x2019;s parsonage? The problem is aggravated by the fact that the building is practically surrounded by Naval property and that the Navy, for obvious reasons, wants to acquire all possible properties on the seaward side of the Main Road. I and others who feel as I do, are deeply concerned about the fact that if things carry on like this for much longer and a decision is not taken, the possibility exists that the Naval expansion programme may have an adverse effect on the grounds of the parsonage and that the building might even be demolished. In my opinion this would be a disaster. We do not have enough national monuments in South Africa, and the place where the national anthem was written must definitely be included amongst those we do have.</p>

<p>I have a possible solution which I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The simple solution is naturally to have the Navy buy the parsonage. However, if they do so, the building cannot remain unproductive. If it is used as an ordinary dwelling, how will the public have access to the building in which the music of the <i>Stem</i> <span class="col_7993-7994" refersTo="page_1327"/><i>van Suid-Afrika</i> was composed? On the other hand, should the building be declared a national monument before the Navy buys it, then there is the further problem that the Navy is not authorized to buy national monuments. The Navy is only authorized to buy buildings either for office or dwelling purposes. I am not even speaking about the maintenance of buildings.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to request the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assistance in this connection. The problem could be solved with initiative, enthusiasm and the necessary executive authority. In order to set the ball rolling, I should like to suggest that the hon. the Minister call a meeting of the people and bodies concerned. I also want to suggest that he give serious consideration to buying the parsonage and furnishing the lounge to represent the study of Rev. M. L. de Villiers. Furthermore I want to suggest that the rest of the building&#x2014;it is a big building&#x2014;is rented to the Navy as a home for the commanding officer of the Submarine Base. If these specific suggestions are not acceptable, the Navy should buy the building and after that the Minister should ensure that the building as a whole, or a part of it, is declared a national monument which will be maintained by the department. But whatever is going to be done, the Minister must make a decision. Although it is a pleasant task for me to raise this matter this afternoon, it is the Minister who has to take the decision. I want to express the hope that the place where our national anthem was written, which is one of our greatest unifying factors, viz. the home of the composer, Rev. M. L. de Villiers, will always be preserved and revered in a suitable manner as a national monument.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Simonstown raised a matter that has great merit, a matter which means a great deal to all of us. I can only express the hope that it will be possible to find a solution so that this old parsonage may be preserved.</p>

<p>Sir, the high failure rate at our South African universities is a matter which has been already referred to with a great deal of concern. Last night, as the hon. the Minister has already done on a previous occasion, the hon. member for Rissik pointed out that the total cost per student amounts to approximately R3 000 per year, and if the student fails the money is wasted. Therefore the public expects the universities as well as the State to make an attempt to force this high failure rate to lower levels. Of course this must be done without lowering the academic standards of our universities in any way&#x2014;and I feel very strongly about this. Consequently serious attention is being given to this problem by our university authorities. But it is definitely not a problem which only the universities have to deal with. The problem is a far more extensive one. The fact of the matter is simply that there are many students registered at our South African universities today who should never have gone to university. As a result of the present process of selection, the universities receive a large number of students who are simply not mature enough for university studies. One of the most important reasons for this is the present matriculation exemption. The matriculation exemption is very wide and general and does not suffice as a prerequisite for university study. Sir, with this I am not saying that the matriculation standard in the various subjects is not high enough. I am only saying that the matriculation exemption is very wide and general and does not suffice for university selection or screening. To put it another way, the matriculation exemption as a sifting process for university admission is definitely not selective enough. We all know that pupils at school are exercised and drilled to do well in matric and to obtain exemption. This redounds to the credit of that school and teacher, and this is probably rightly so, but whether the pupils are capable after that of going to university and simply following any course of his choice, or often of his parents&#x2019; choice, is another question.</p>

<p>The problem of the high failure rate is also connected with the correct channelling of students for their tertiary training, channelling in accordance with their aptitude, interest and ability. Tertiary training, and particularly technical training which has also been referred to in this debate, at non-university institutions in South Africa unfortunately does not have the status and reputation which it ought to have. Everyone who wants to receive tertiary training, thinks that they simply have to go to university. An exaggerated status value, and I almost want to say a snob value, is attached to university training in South Africa. The importance and value of study at colleges and other tertiary institutions&#x2014;I am thinking in particular of the colleges for advanced technical <span class="col_7995-7996" refersTo="page_1328"/>education&#x2014;do not have the status and reputation which they ought to have in South Africa. After all, study at such institutions is not inferior. Indeed, people differ as far as their aptitude, interest and talents are concerned. Therefore the universities simply cannot accommodate everyone. I am of the opinion that universities, colleges and other institutions for tertiary education should complement one another to a greater extent.</p>

<p>Therefore I appreciate the fact that the hon. the Minister spoke in favour of a greater interaction between the universities and these institutions. Students whom, as a result of more selective selection processes, it might not be possible to admit to university initially, would eventually be able to return to a university for further study via other institutions. A greater flexibility between the universities and the various tertiary institutions is also desirable. More students would then be able to follow a particular part of their course&#x2014;for instance the theoretical part&#x2014;at university, while other sections could be followed at other institutions. Therefore to summarize, the high failure rate at universities is definitely connected to the admission requirements in operation today, as well as with the right channelling of students. Better channelling of students to various tertiary institutions with the necessary interaction and flexibility between them will decrease the failure rate considerably.</p>

<p>A second aspect which is related to the high rate of failure, is the teaching methods. In other words, the transfer of knowledge from the lecturer to the student. It must be borne in mind that professors and lecturers are appointed as a result of their academic achievements; in other words, as a result of their ability to study and do research themselves. But in the teaching situation the ability of that lecturer with respect to the student and his achievements is of cardinal importance. Therefore universities will have to make more of training and schooling their lecturing staff, to make the best use of teaching methods. I am aware of the a fact that many universities have already begun to do this. An example of which I have most knowledge as a result of my connection is that of the Rand Afrikaans University. As a new young university in South Africa, RAU could approach the teaching situation in a new and original manner. RAU was not yet bound down by traditional teaching patterns and practices which had become established at the university over many years. As a result of various aims which the university created for itself with respect to its students, the university formulated a teaching code, a teaching code which was binding on all its lecturers. The purpose of the teaching code was to rationalize the teaching as far as possible; in other words, to apply teaching methods as effectively as possible so that the student may become more involved in the teaching situation and so that the student may learn to deal with the subject matter more personally. Therefore, to summarize this aspect, effective teaching methods are a prerequisite for good results and for a low failure rate.</p>

<p>A third matter which in my opinion undoubtedly contributes towards the high failure rate at the universities in South Africa, are our fragmented school syllabuses in South Africa. Prof. Pauw and other educationists have been requesting an institute for curriculum research for a long time. It is essential that syllabuses should be better co-ordinated, not only at school level, but also with a view to further subsequent study. The change from school to university can definitely be bridged better by means of proper curriculum and syllabus planning. I am convinced that there is definitely a need in South Africa for a comprehensive syllabus policy in order to connect teaching in South Africa to a greater degree with the requirements of the student on the one hand, and to bring about a more sensible connection between schools and other tertiary institutions.</p>

<p>In the last place the failure rate is also related with the nature of examinations at schools and universities. We may with justification pose the question whether our examination system is sufficiently aimed at evaluating all aspects of the pupil&#x2019;s or student&#x2019;s mastering of a subject and whether it is not too one-sided and tests only facts or learned knowledge. Mastering a subject also requires insight into that subject; in other words, the ability to evaluate, to weigh standpoints against one another and to be able to make an independent judgment. Then there is also the application of that knowledge. Does the present system of examinations test the students efficiently with a view to the work which he will eventually do? Knowledge of a subject can be so theoretical and divorced <span class="col_7997-7998" refersTo="page_1329"/>from life that the Dutch reference to such scholars as &#x201C;vakidiote&#x201D; is not entirely inapplicable. It is therefore important for teaching methods and the examination system to contribute towards the advancement of independent balanced thought, within the various subject directions. For the sake of the cost factor, but also for the sake of the best utilization of our brain potential in South Africa, I believe it is of the utmost importance for this matter to enjoy attention at the highest level.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there seems to have been a misunderstanding in regard to my speech yesterday. My concern was for national unity, but a number of hon. members of this House seem to have misunderstood it. It was never my intention to attack the Afrikaner, his history or what he holds dear. On the contrary. My aim was to forge better links between Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking South Africans. I regret that what I said has been misunderstood by a number of hon. members of this House. I firmly believe, however, that subjective emotion will give way, in time, to a broad South Africanism.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, these past two days I have been listening carefully and thoroughly&#x2014;I myself did not speak at all&#x2014;to 28 speakers who participated in the debate on education and related matters. I allowed the people opposite, who had so many complaints to make about television, and those on my side, to do complete justice to themselves. I did so with a specific purpose. What I should very much like is that we should not only talk about education and training, which is a matter of deep concern to us, but also listen to what is said about it, as I have been doing these past two days. However, I want whatever is necessary to be done after all the listening.</p>

<p>Now that we have thrashed out this matter thoroughly over the past two days, and since there is absolute unanimity in this House on the fundamental importance of education and training, it is my wish and desire that the necessary should be done. For me it is a sheer pleasure to act as champion of education and the teacher. At the same time I can honestly say that it is the most enjoyable and most pleasant task with which I have ever been entrusted. To me it is as enjoyable as any sport, even as enjoyable as &#x201C;Boeresport&#x201D;!</p>

<p>The Secretary to the Department of National Education is no longer a young man, but he is performing his task with the greatest possible dedication. On this occasion I should very much like to thank him for the dedicated and very competent manner in which he is supporting me and guiding the department, and also for the fact that he has for many years already been engaged in the service of education in South Africa. On this occasion, too, I want to thank all the education officials in my department and in the provinces for their competent dedication.</p>

<p>I want to address a word of special appreciation to the Committee of Heads of Education. I should very much have liked to have elaborated on this in greater detail. The report of the Committee of Heads of Education was tabled here. It is clear that the work which that body is doing deserves the greatest measure of praise, gratitude and appreciation from this House, and on this occasion I should very much like to convey these sentiments to them. I am deeply aware of the great work that they are doing, and I hope hon. members will also make themselves conversant with the great work and the excellent results which that committee has achieved, and is still achieving, in the interests of education in South Africa.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to thank the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations very sincerely for the extremely good co-operation they are offering me. I also thank them for the competent and responsible way in which they are acting. I can only say that I have found on every occasion that they are people with a profound understanding, people who regard and serve education with the utmost seriousness and sense of responsibility. I have really grown fond of them, as I have of the C.H.O. and the educationists. Then, too, there are the Administrators&#x2014;we are really blessed with very good Administrators whom I want to thank for their competence and their dedication to education. There are the MPC&#x2019;s. They are brilliant, extremely good men. Then there are the Directors of Education in each province, <i>the</i> important educationists, the rectors at our universities, the principals of the colleges and the schools and, perhaps the most important of all, the teachers. To this large host of people, Afrikaans as well as English-speaking, who are engaged in the service of <span class="col_7999-8000" refersTo="page_1330"/>education in the Republic, I want to say thank you very much for your dedication. I want to say to them: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s get going in the interests of education; I have no doubt at all that, together, we will be able to achieve very good results.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Education deserves the highest priority. This Government&#x2014;I am not saying &#x201C;I&#x201D;&#x2014; <i>wants</i> to accord it this priority, and is doing so. I am very grateful for the unanimous support of this House to be able to ensure that education will receive the highest priority and will assume its rightful place in our State economy. It can be proved statistically that the money and service expended on education are among the most important and most profitable long-term investments a State can make. I know of no better investment; if there is one, I should like to hear of it. No nation has ever become insolvent because of its investment in education. In the modern world it has probably become an absolute rule that the nation that does not attach the necessary value to the education and training of its children will drop out of the race, as surely as the sun also rises. Such a nation will drop out owing to the cut-throat competition brought about by progress in the world, and owing to the cut-throat competition for superiority by people and nations so as to preserve themselves and stay in the competition. If such a nation has dropped out, it will be too late to lodge an appeal against neglect in this regard. It will be too late when history relentlessly passes its irrevocable judgment. This may never be allowed to become true of the Republic of South Africa, and for that reason we are calledupon to ensure that we rather spend too much on education than too little, and neglect our duty.</p>

<p>Education cannot rise above the quality of its teachers. Surely this is the plain and simple truth! Surely it is impossible for education to rise above the quality of its teachers. That is why it is essential, and is a primary requisite&#x2014;in my opinion it is a simple truth&#x2014;that education should attract sufficient numbers of recruits of the right calibre. It is the duty of our people to provide education with its best sons. The people have to do this. On this occasion I want to make an appeal to the young men of the Republic of South Africa to consider this wonderful profession, the teaching profession. &#x201C;Come, fall in, and become teachers, so that we do not have to keep on hearing of crises in education.&#x201D; I am making an appeal to our young men to join the teaching profession. On my part I declare that the National Party Government and the people of South Africa will look after their interests and will see to it that they are happy in the teaching profession and that it will be worth while for them.</p>

<p>In the second place we must ensure that the recruits who enter the teaching profession&#x2014;I hope there will be more of them as from 1 January 1977&#x2014;receive the best training. There are hon. members who refer to the agreement which was reached, and I am very grateful that such an agreement as far as the training of teachers is concerned was reached between the universities and the colleges. I am of the opinion that this is the foundation on which everything rests, for I said to myself: &#x201C;Look, if there is a squabble between the universities and the colleges about the training of teachers, how on earth will one be able to set the matter straight and get if off the ground? Surely you will not be able to succeed in doing so.&#x201D; One of the first things I said when I accepted this position was that we have to set this matter straight, come what may. I said: &#x201C;Make or break.&#x201D; Well, I began on 1 February and I must say I feel very happy as a result of all the sound co-operation. I have already referred to people who gave their co-operation. Be that as it may, that agreement has been reached and I have given the particulars to the Press, and I shall give it to them again rather than spend too much time on it now, in this debate. I say that a wonderful agreement has been reached, so that university and college will now co-operate in the interests of teacher training in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>We must attract the recruits and ensure that they receive the best training, but then, thirdly, we must ensure that their services are retained for education. Consequently the education service must be made as attractive as possible for the teacher. If we are able to do this, it will stimulate the teachers to keep on improving their qualifications. If we say that education cannot rise above the quality of teacher, surely we are called upon to ensure that the teacher is well qualified. In this regard it worries me, or to put it more strongly, it grieves me to see statistics which hon. members saw in the newspapers according to which only 66&#x0025; of the teachers who teach geography had been trained to do so, while the percentage in the <span class="col_8001-8002" refersTo="page_1331"/>case of mathematics is less than 50&#x0025;, etc. We must ensure that the teachers receive the best possible training and that they improve their qualifications. This is imperative. We must also attract new recruits from the same and from higher socio-economic levels of our society.</p>

<p>We are unanimous in this House on the importance of education, but now I want to ask hon. members how many of them have sons in the teaching profession. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, one must begin at home. All of us agree that in these times and under the present circumstances education is important. Hon. members opposite even allege that there is a crisis in education. I think this has been stated in exaggerated terms. Most certainly there is no doubt at all that there are things in education which are not right. Consequently I say this from every platform. If we want to set matters straight, we must begin at home. We must set an example to the people of South Africa. If we say that education is the mother of all professions, we must apply this, and not sit with a mouthful of teeth if it is asked how many of us have sons who are members of the teaching profession.</p>

<p>It is absolutely essential. We shall have to give attention to this and other important matters such as teacher training, the elimination of unnecessary, vexatious administrative work, the importance of mathematics and physics and chemistry at school&#x2014;I shall have a few more words to say in this regard in a moment&#x2014;and the high failure rate which various hon. members discussed. If we want to give education the place it deserves in our State economy, we shall have to work at this matter with zeal, enthusiasm and dedication. Because I believe that we can unite the people involved in education in a zestful and enthusiastic effort to get on with the job, I have no doubt that education is going to be victorious in the interests of South Africa. That is why I want to reiterate that it is a privilege for me to act as the champion of education. In the words of Plato, education is the foundation of the State, but the ultimate aim and the essence of education is the building of character, which has to be achieved by the disciplining of the body, the will and the mind. There is no doubt about it, Sir, Plato was no fool. Over the centuries the essence of education has been the building of character which, as I have said, has to be achieved by the disciplining of the body, the will and the mind. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture has just walked in&#x2014;my learned friend, Hendrik X. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, we must realize that education feeds all the professions. In these times, in this country, too, education is referred to as the mother of all professions, but we should consider for just a while what this really means. There has to be a realistic understanding of what it really is. In truth it means that education feeds all the occupations and professions with recruits, and for that reason education has to provide a stream of candidates to meet the manifold and differentiated manpower needs in the country. Surely we may not forget this. In this exact life and age in which we find ourselves, there is no manpower, in whatever line of work, which has not gone through the mill of education. That is why it is the mother of all professions. Everyone, even the farmer of today, has to pass through it. Everyone has to receive education, otherwise he cannot compete in the world and cannot maintain its position. This is what we should not forget, for it emphasizes the high priority of education. Good education leads to educated workers, educated neighbours, less poverty, less crime, better race relations, educated citizens and a high economic growth rate.</p>

<p>For any country a good education is one of <span class="col_8003-8004" refersTo="page_1332"/>the principal means by which the pace of economic growth can be accelerated. Mr. Chairman&#x2014;in a somewhat lighter vein&#x2014;I have on occasion said to the hon. the Minister of Finance: &#x201C;Success depends on luck and pluck; luck in finding somebody to pluck.&#x201D; While I am talking about education, I address these words once again to the hon. the Minister of Finance, for these are matters which we should take stock of realistically. Education is the principal means by which an acceleration in the rate of economic growth can be achieved. Our country is no exception to the rule. A high education level exercises a decisive effect on both personal income as well as the income of the country, since a high level of education not only increases the extent of production, but also ensures a higher standard in the product itself.</p>

<p>In the Transvaal the centenary of the Transvaal Education Department was recently celebrated. Because I am very interested in this matter, I tried to picture to myself what appearance education presented there after a century. I asked myself what the most durable aspect was which emerged after a century of education in the Republic of South Africa. As befits a student, I paged through the annual reports, the inspectors&#x2019; reports and the school journals. It was a great pleasure for me to scrutinize as many as possible of those documents. What struck me the most upon reading those old documents, was the concern among the educationists, among the teachers, for the children. Whether it was illness, playing truant, under-achievement, dirty clothing, attention was given to these matters.</p>

<p>I should like to quote an extract from a school journal. This is a journal of a school which has long since been closed down. On 3 October 1931 the principal of the school wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die skool sluit met al die kinders skoon, seifs die veelbesproke Willem.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] I am not in any way referring to the hon. member for Johannesburg North. [Interjections.]</p>

<block name="quote">Die skool sluit met al die kinders skoon, seifs die veelbesproke Willem. Dit is vir my baie aangenaam om hierdie voorwaartse stap te kan boekstaaf.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in those words an entire world is revealed, the world of the teacher who is in the service of our children, who served our children for the space of a century and who performed their task with great dedication and with great success. To them we say: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>I should now like to reply to the questions which were put to me here. I also want to refer to certain of the points raised by hon. members in this debate. I shall try to do so as well as I can. I shall also try not to omit any questions.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central referred to the salary structure for teachers. In this regard I should like to quote briefly from Hansard of 22 April 1976, when the question of the salary structure for teachers was under discussion. The hon. the Prime Minister said in column 5207&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition to and in supplementation of the announced increase in salaries, which also&#x2014;as I said&#x2014;applies to teachers, &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the 10&#x0025; on 1 July 1976 and the 5&#x0025;, if the economy of the country permits, on 1 January 1977&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Government has moreover considered, and accepted in principle, the need for the revision of the salary structures in the teaching profession.</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The extent and further particulars of this structural revision require further study, however, and the full or partial implementation thereof will inevitably have to depend on the financial position in future.</block>

<p>Hon. members are aware that we find ourselves in a pressing financial position at present. Hon. members opposite pointed out, with good insight, that the salary structure position must of course be considered within the framework of the available financial means. There is no doubt at all about that. The principle has, however, been accepted. On the particulars the Cabinet appointed a Cabinet Committee of which I am the chairman. This Cabinet Committee considered certain submissions and laid down certain guiding principles for the Public Service Commission and the Committee of Heads of Education and the other departments concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_8005-8006" refersTo="page_1333"/>The Public Service Commission, the Committee of Heads of Education and the other departments concerned are at present engaged in working out a new salary structure for teachers and for all who are associated with the teaching profession. We hope that they will, as soon as possible, come to the Cabinet Committee with a final submission, which will in its turn refer the proposals to the Cabinet. By as soon as possible, I really mean as soon as possible. I do not want to lay down any time limit now. However, it is expected that the bodies concerned will shortly come forward with proposals. In this regard I want to say that if the idea should arise in anyone&#x2019;s mind that the Government, as far as education is concerned, is not doing its duty, I must point out that the total appropriation for White education in the Republic for 1974&#x2013;&#x2019;75, amounted to R586 million. This rose in 1975&#x2013;&#x2019;76 to R706 million, which represented an increase of 20,5&#x0025;. This is therefore a very fine and a very good achievement.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central, who apologized for his absence in view of the fact that he had to go somewhere, made certain statements in regard to television and I shall reply in general to that in a moment. He also referred to the expansion of an English-medium university to a campus in Pretoria, and he mentioned the possibility of an Afrikaans-medium university in Natal. I should like to inform the hon. members that the University Advisory Council, which is a statutory body, appointed a sub-committee to look into this matter, and I already have an appointment to see the bodies which are endeavouring to establish such a campus in Pretoria. This will happen within the next month or two. I am also willing to see the other organization to which the hon. member referred at any time they are prepared to do so, so that we may discuss the matter and so that the matter may be brought to the attention of the University Advisory Council and receive the necessary attention.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Bilingual universities should preferably be established.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, we can look into that, and the advisory council is there to make recommendations on that matter.</p>

<p>As far as the Colleges for Advanced Technical Education are concerned, the evaluation of qualifications to which the hon. member referred, this matter is already receiving attention and cases to which attention is drawn, are being investigated. I want to ask the hon. members, and specifically the hon. member for Durban Central, preferably to bring cases to my attention, and I undertake to have them properly investigated.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the report of the Museum Commission. This report has already been tabled. Some of the organizations involved in this matter have already asked me whether they may comment on the recommendations contained in the report. I am at present waiting for their comments, and after I have received them, consideration will be given to the joint recommendations with a view to putting them into effect.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Algoa made a very fine speech, for which I want to thank him sincerely. The hon. member raised a very important point by referring to the system which is at present in use at the University of Port Elizabeth, i.e. the mini-courses, or rather the audio-tutorial approach. I have read quite a lot about this. An excellent thesis was written about this, and I made extensive use of it recently at Stellenbosch. It dealt with the entire question of where the fault lies in regard to the high failure rate at our universities. Does it lie with the schools or with the university? It is a very penetrating and excellent study, and I have no doubt at all that this system at the University of Port Elizabeth is going to produce results. The hon. member mentioned that there were cases in which the failure rate at universities had already been reduced to 8&#x0025;. This is an excellent achievement.</p>

<p>The University Advisory Council has been requested by me personally to devote their urgent attention to the question of the high failure rate, because&#x2014;as the hon. members for Rissik and for Springs said&#x2014;it is costing the country enormous sums of money. I think it is completely unnecessary for the failure rate to be so high. If one reads the treaties which have already been written in this regard, it becomes clearly apparent where the fault lies. I think the faults can be rectified and I think the University Advisory Council is the appropriate body to take the lead in this regard. I think I have at the same time replied now to the question of the hon. member for Rissik.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Algoa also referred to the position of the married woman in the <span class="col_8007-8008" refersTo="page_1334"/>teaching profession. In the salary structure which I explained to this House a moment ago, attention is being given to the position of the woman, but it is a very complicated matter, with many difficult aspects, and I do not want to go into details now. Nor can I make any promises in this regard. As hon. members can expect, however, I am very sympathetic towards the women in the teaching profession. My mother always said: &#x201C;My little boy, people will not love you for your little face; you will have to be a clever and sensible little boy.&#x201D; I stand for many causes and, believe me, I also stand on the side of the woman. Hon. members must make no mistake about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs also mentioned the question of the older pensioners. This is a heart-break story, and I am very sympathetic towards it, but hon. members will understand that it does not rest with me, but with my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions. I undertake to convey the request for an inquiry, and I shall personally give the matter my sympathetic consideration to see whether it is not in any way possible to do something in this regard. At present the economic circumstances are difficult, but it is true that an urgent inquiry must be instituted into the matter, and we shall therefore give effect to the requests which were addressed to us in this regard.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North started off so well when he referred to national unity, and I want to tell him that it has always been my ideal to make as huge a contribution as humanly possible towards greater national unity in the Republic of South Africa. I thought the hon. member was going to make a very valuable contribution in this regard, but then he made a very unfortunate <i>faux pas</i>. I am happy that the hon. member attempted to put it right in the way he did this afternoon. If we are to achieve a greater measure of national unity, then we must learn first and foremost to respect those things that are dear to us and to the other man. I see the hon. member nods his head. He therefore agrees with me. To me it has been a privilege on more than one occasion to have spoken with great feeling and pride of the heroic achievements of Elizabeth Sharp and other English-speaking heroes and heroines in the history of the Republic of South Africa. I feel that it is one of the prime ways of making a contribution towards national unity. Hon. members can rely on me to make every effort I can to create greater national unity in the Republic of South Africa. I shall do so with pleasure and with zest.</p>

<p>*I have great appreciation for what the hon. member for Hercules said in regard to the Cape college. I shall look into the matter again. In fact, this has already been done, and it has been decided that the development should proceed at the present pace. It is the function of the college council to submit proposals for consideration, proposals in regard to the matter which the hon. member raised. The department has abundantly demonstrated its willingness to all colleges to promote only the best development. I am very grateful to the hon. member for having raised the matter. I promise that we shall look into the matter again. If there is anything he can do to cause the college council to submit a proposal, his suggestions in this regard could more conveniently be carried out. I have appreciation for the positive way in which the hon. member makes his contribution to debates on educational matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville asked us to give attention to the formula with reference to the Van Wyk de Vries Commission. I want to inform the hon. member that the subsidy which is calculated in accordance with the formula&#x2014;the formula has only been in operation for two years&#x2014;amounted to R110 million in 1974-&#x2019;75 and rose to R138 million in 1975-&#x2019;76, an increase, therefore, of R28 million, or 25,1&#x0025;. The hon. member said that I should lose no time in causing an investigation to be instituted into this matter. I want to inform the hon. member that the formula contained components which are adjusted from year to year to make provision for rising costs. The University Advisory Council gives thorough attention to the finances of the universities. If the advisory council which, as hon. members know, consists of representatives of all the universities, finds that the formula does not meet the needs, it will make recommendations. Because I consider it to be a very important matter, I consequently promise the hon. member that, because he raised the matter, I shall once again personally look into the matter of the formula properly, or have it done.</p>

<p><span class="col_8009-8010" refersTo="page_1335"/>In my opinion the hon. member raised a very important point in respect of loans and bursaries for the average student. At the end of my reply I shall refer to the brilliant student and scholar. All these things are important. The average person is the salt of the earth. We must not doubt that. When I was the head boy in my matriculation year of the school which I attended, we asked that the most average boy, the boy which in sport and in the scholastic field achieved only average results, should address the school and express thanks on behalf of the other at that farewell function. It was one of the most moving occasions of my life. That most average scholar is today a famous man in the world. The average person is therefore someone who is capable of making a powerful and important contribution. We must look after these people, and we are doing so. If the hon. member were to look at the annual report, he would see a list of bodies that contribute to the fund for bursaries. In the Republic an abundance of bursaries are available. There are too many to list. We shall therefore have to see whether we cannot introduce a computer system so that the right people may be reached and a proper utilization of the busaries ensured.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member also referred to immigrant teachers. Last year during the debate on the Immigration Vote, when I was still the Minister of Immigration, I said in a reply to a question by the hon. member for Parktown that I would take up the question of immigrant teachers with the Administrators. I in fact wrote to each Administrator in the Republic of South Africa. I received their replies. This question is not a simple one. At this junction of our development and with the position in regard to teachers in South Africa, I am in favour of making use of immigrant teachers as far as it is possible to do so. I am ironing out the problems there are. There are indeed certain problems. I have here a letter in this regard I received approximately a week ago. It is dated 20 May 1976.</p>

<p>I have written to the authorities in Great Britain and in some of the other countries. Firstly, there is the important aspect that teachers are recruited on the basis of specific jobs in South Africa, for a specific school. They have certain problems about that. The second problem is the question of salaries in South Africa, because the salaries here are lower than the salaries for teachers in Great Britain and in other parts of Europe. Then there is also the language problem. However, we are looking into these. I am wholeheartedly in agreement with the hon. member that we must, at least on a short-term basis, make more use of immigrant teachers in these scarce subjects where we need them so badly, and I hope that we can solve those problems so that in the short term the position can be improved. [Interjections.] We are looking into it and I can speak on behalf of the hon. the Minister of Immigration, because I discussed the matter with him. He and his department will not lay any difficulties in our way in this regard.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me about White universities playing against non-White universities, as was the case last year when the University of the Western Cape played against Cape Town University. This is a delicate question. I referred it to the Committee of Heads of the universities and I am awaiting their reply. In regard to the other point he raised, I wish to tell the hon. member that I have looked very carefully into the Snyman report myself. It is a very good report, to my way of thinking, and I can agree with many of the recommendations made. I consider it to be a very important report. With that I think I have replied to all the questions of the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>*Then there is the hon. member for Virginia. He made a very good speech. He referred to the question of syllabi. He referred to the question of syllabi and the basic contents of the syllabi. I want to inform the hon. member that the Committee of Heads of Education and the Joint Matriculation Board have an agreement that syllabi will be revised approximately every five years. We are now in the second phase of that, or rather in the first phase, and therefore at the end&#x2014;it is very close&#x2014;of close attention having ordinarily to be given to this question of syllabi. I shall see to it personally, together with my department with the hon. member that the question of overloaded syllabi is extremely important. I should like to make an announcement in this regard. The Joint Matriculation Board and the Committee of Heads of Education have appointed a joint syllabus committee, representative of all examining bodies, to give urgent attention, as an interim measure, to the curtailment of the syllabus for science and <span class="col_8011-8012" refersTo="page_1336"/>physics and chemistry, and I am very grateful for this. During the Easter recess I called in the chairman of the JMB and had a long discussion with him, together with the Secretary of the department.</p>

<p>The Committee met on 3 May and decided to recommend a significant curtailment of the syllabus for examination purposes. The recommendation will be considered next week by the Committee of the Heads of Education and during the last week of June by the JMB. We cannot keep this waiting until the cows come home. It has to happen soon so that the children will at least be able to benefit from it as from 1 January. Otherwise we would not be solving any problems in this regard. If the proposals are consequently accepted and introduced in this way, it would not only alleviate the pressure of the overloaded syllabi on teachers and pupils, but would also be conducive to more effective education and in that way make this subject, as well as mathematics, biology, etc., more attractive. Therefore I want to make an appeal to our girls and boys not to shy away from the difficult subjects such as physics and chemistry or mathematics. These are basic subjects on which the future of South Africa is being built. In common with my good friend the hon. member for Carletonville, who made such a fine speech here a moment ago, I want to issue the warning that we should be careful with the advice we give our children on the subjects they should take at school. Sir, I have data here, unfortunately I do not have the time to go into it now. However, I can tell hon. members that if they consider of what great possibilities people are depriving their children by not encouraging them to take mathematics and chemistry and physics at school, it is quite frightening. Consequently we must be very careful that we do not channelize our children towards the easy subjects, and leave the difficult subjects to one side. We are giving urgent attention to these difficult subjects with a view to simplifying the syllabus so that it can be made attractive for the children and so that we can have a return to these subjects. Therefore, I am making an appeal to parents and children to &#x201C;swot&#x201D; those difficult subjects. They will not be sorry; it will mean a great deal to them in the world if they do so, for it opens up opportunities for them which they would not otherwise have had.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs referred to pensions. I have already replied to that. I have great appreciation for what the hon. member said. He is a person who was a member of the teaching profession for many years. He also referred to the establishment of a council for writers&#x2014;an arts council. Mr. P. G. du Plessis, a man for whom I have very great appreciation, discussed the matter with me. Before I reply to the hon. member I just want to inform hon. members that we must be very careful in this country not to cause a rift between the writers and the hierarchy of the Republic of South Africa. There must be close liaison and a good understanding between writers and the people in positions of authority in the Republic of South Africa. I make no secret of the matter when I say that personally I shall do everything in my power to create a sound relationship between State and writers. The writers, of course, must also meet their obligations on their part, and we shall make our contribution in a spirit of goodwill and good understanding. If this does not happen, then hon. members must understand that one could pluck the bitter fruits, not in the short term, but in the long term, and that would be a very, very bad thing, while if there are sound relations and goodwill, we have a guarantee over the long term of the development of important things in the cultural sphere. For that reason I am very sympathetically disposed to the idea which the hon. member for Springs raised and I shall look into this entire matter with great interest. I may just point out that the British Arts Council has far wider functions than simply to co-ordinate the works of authors. Most certainly the matter cannot simply be in isolation, i.e. only in regard to authors. The Commission of Inquiry into the Performing Arts is giving attention to something similar to that which Mr. P. G. du Plessis had in mind. But, as I have already said, I shall look into this matter with great sympathy. I hope that it will be possible to give effect to it.</p>

<p>While I am on this point&#x2014;the arts also fall under National Education&#x2014;I want to point out to hon. members that in a time of inflation, as we find ourselves in at the moment, the people who suffer the greatest hardships and have the hardest time of it, are the artists, for people purchase fewer works of art and fewer books. They are more concerned about their expenses now. Therefore the artists are the first people who are hard-hit by this kind of thing. In this House I should like to inform all our artists, in <span class="col_8013-8014" refersTo="page_1337"/>their great variety&#x2014;from ballet to the writers&#x2014;that we have a love and understanding for the major and important contribution which they are making in respect of the cultural possessions of our country, the cultural contribution which extends far beyond our borders, therefore not only throughout the Republic of South Africa but throughout the entire world. In this regard hon. members will allow me to quote what Solzhenitsyn had to say when he won the Nobel Prize and made a speech on the theme &#x201C;One word of Truth&#x201D;. I waited with great interest for this &#x201C;One word of Truth&#x201D; which this man would convey to the world. The &#x201C;One word of Truth&#x201D; which Solzhenitsyn wanted to convey to the world on that greatest occasion of his life was that the world could only be saved through beauty, through what is uplifting and elevating. Not through economic matters such as communism, capitalism and that sort of thing, but through what was uplifting, what was beautiful and splendid&#x2014;that which the artist gave us. He added that &#x201C;the supreme beauty&#x201D; in the world was the love which God had had for mankind by redeeming them through the act of reconciliation of his only Son. We therefore have great appreciation for our artists for the good they are producing.</p>

<p>&#x2020; I now come to the hon. member for Umlazi who raised an important question of subsidies for private schools. That, of course, is the responsibility of the provinces. He also asked about tax rebates on donations for private schools. I am very sympathetic to such a request, but the matter has to be dealt with by my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance. I shall, however, raise the matter with him again and have it investigated. If I am in a position to recommend such action to him, I would be delighted to do so. The hon. member must please remember, however, that at the moment economic necessities are very compelling and it is not easy to obtain funds at the moment, whatever the purpose may be.</p>

<p>*I have already replied to the question raised by the hon. member for Rissik in regard to the high failure rate. He is a university man who represents a major university, and he made a very interesting and important contribution here, for which I thank him sincerely.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I have a very high regard for the hon. member for Umhlanga. He is a true advocate of free television licences. As I say, I appreciate his style because I like a man who perseveres and goes for what he believes in. As I have said in previous debates, I am very sympathetically disposed as far as that is concerned, but at the moment that is simply not possible. The hon. member must please accept the fact. I shall, however, keep the matter in mind, and if and when free licences do become available in the future, the hon. member will have reason to feel he has made an important contribution. The aged and others can be very happy at the way the hon. member has fought for their cause in each and every debate.</p>

<p>&#x2026; made a good speech. [Interjections.] In regard to the earlier broadcasting of programmes, I want to say something that I think is important. In this regard the SABC has a very simple, but very important set rule which fits very well into South African circumstances, and as soon as I have mentioned it, you will all agree wholeheartedly with it. We must not draw our children out of the sunlight to look at television. We must afford the children a maximum opportunity to benefit from the wonderful natural conditions and sunlight of South Africa. For that reason the SABC is not in favour of the earlier broadcasting of television programmes.</p>

<p>That hon. member may also switch off when the Ministers speak on television and he does not want to see them. However, I want to refer to what the hon. member said in regard to the shifting of the news to 7 o&#x2019;clock. This would be in conflict with the SABC&#x2019;s requirement that the news should be the dividing line between the Afrikaans and English programmes. However, this matter will be looked into again. I took up the matter of the youth programmes with the SABC. They will look into that. I think it is a very important and positive idea which truly deserves attention.</p>

<p><span class="col_8015-8016" refersTo="page_1338"/>I could also reply now to the hon. member for Parktown and other hon. members in regard to the question of the division of the television programmes into separate English and Afrikaans programmes. There is no doubt at all that this is a very good thing. It has elicited an excellent reaction, and I am absolutely convinced that fundamentally we will not change the system.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet raised the matter of the technical colleges. Of course they offer a very wide variety of courses, and where the necessary demand exists, further courses may be introduced. We may perhaps therefore be able to help the hon. member. However, the S.A. Agricultural Union now has to take the initiative. We will then render what assistance we can. The develop of a technical college at Bloemfontein is at present receiving our attention. It was also said that we should use the programme <i>Kamera Een</i> to bring the farmer and the urban dweller closer to one another. I think it is also essential, and I am certain the idea will be brought to the attention of the producers of the programme <i>Kamera Een</i>. I have no doubt but that they will be able to put this idea to good use.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch asked to be excused. He was not able to be present. He said a few very important things here. I have no doubt at all that we must give serious thought to our educational matters. We must look at them with vision. I agree with him that we will have to make adjustments according to our needs. I appreciate that education will adapt itself to the needs of the community. This is in fact so. In my opinion that hon. member is on the right track. If he were politically on the right track to that same extent to which he is on the right track in regard to educational matters, he would probably not have been on thas side of the House any more.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to quote from a work by Sir Walter Moberley. The work is called Crisis in the University, a work written in 1959. When I was at university, I really studied this work in depth. This gentleman wrote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The argument for a cultural education must be judged in the whole of the world situation and the situation of a given country at a given time. In such a time first things must come first&#x2014;necessities before luxuries. How this truism is applied to the education problem will depend on how we picture the challenge of our time or the challenge of a given country. If the world&#x2019;s or the country&#x2019;s troubles are due, first and foremost, to failure to apply systematically appropriate means to meet ends, then what we need most is more and better experts, and the first task of education will then be to produce those experts. On the other hand, if our most intractable divisions are concerned with ends, if they arise from the difficulty which two men or two nations find in living together peacefully in a house or a country or nations in a world, even when food and warmth and clothing and the other material necessities of life are amply provided, if the most serious menace is not scarcity but envy, hatred and malice and all uncharitableness, then the mental commodity most in demand will be practical wisdom rather than specialized expertise. In that case the most urgent and practical service demanded of education and the universities will be that they should turn out an elite who will be men of judgment and skilled considerers of human beings.</block>

<p>*I think this is also of absolutely cardinal importance to our educational system in the Republic of South Africa at the moment. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member for Rondebosch that more urgent attention should be given to technical colleges and that the sphere of the technical colleges should be properly demarcated <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> that of the universities. It is clear that universities are research and academic institutions. Technical colleges are vocationally-orientated institutions. Once this had been done properly there has to be closer liaison between the universities and the colleges so that&#x2014;as hon. members mentioned here&#x2014;students who are now going to universities, although they should really be attending college, can, owing to the closer liaison, be channelled to the colleges. Then students who are attending college, but who should be attending university, can be channelled to the universities. I want to tell the hon. member that I have a very <span class="col_8017-8018" refersTo="page_1339"/>soft spot for these technical colleges. They must, as soon as possible, become institutions of greater status in our country, and I shall therefore continue to give very close attention to this entire matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for De Aar made a very important speech on the question of the drain on men, and the salary structure in education. I have already replied to that, but I must thank him for his positive contribution.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point discussed television. Other hon. members also discussed this subject. I should like to reply briefly to what they had to say.</p>

<p>&#x2020; Speakers who referred to the SABC during this debate raised very few matters which were not dealt with earlier during this session. The hon. member for Durban Central referred to the projected costs of a second television channel. This is an important matter and I hope that I shall be able to dispel doubts and uncertainties about it. I sincerely hope that this matter will not become a political football in the Republic of South Africa. The hon. member expressed doubts about the costs and he indicated his belief that a service for the Bantu population could be provided in the existing channel at far lower cost. The fact of the matter is, however, that additional television studios and other programme production facilities will have to be provided for if there is to be any extension in the hours of transmission irrespective of the language in which programmes are presented. The only costs which could be saved by incorporating Bantu programmes in the existing channel are those for additional transmitters. These costs represent a comparatively small proportion of the total costs. This is a fact which should not be overlooked. However, hon. members should bear in mind the practical implications of such an approach. If a meaningful and worthwhile service for the Bantu is to be presented, it must be presented during the peak viewing hours when people are at home and able to view the programmes. This is quite obvious. Such a service will also have to be presented in at least five languages in addition to Afrikaans and English. I think therefore that it is obvious that a television service for the Bantu can only be adequately presented in a separate channel. For heaven&#x2019;s sake, these facts are simple basic facts and I hope that no hon. member will again rise in this House to speak about this question so glibly as some of my hon. friends have done during this debate. This is a complicated issue and one cannot say that in a country like South Africa we must present all programmes in one channel and everything in the garden will be rosy. Heaven knows it will not be all rosy in the garden; it will be one heck of a chaos! There is no doubt about that. It is therefore important that it is realized in this country that a Bantu television service will require the installation of a separate channel. I am in favour of installing such a separate channel and furthermore I am also in favour of installing that separate channel as soon as possible on condition that the necessary funds are available. I am of the opinion that it is in everybody&#x2019;s interest&#x2014;in the interest of the Blacks as well as the Whites. I should therefore suggest that we stop talking so glibly about this very, very important issue.</p>

<p>*I should like to return to the question of the appearance of Ministers on television.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the hon. member and anybody may switch on his television set and tune in one any channel he likes. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>*A question which my good friend, the hon. member for Durban North, produces out of the hat every time, is the appearance of Ministers on television. I should like to deal with this matter in detail on this one occasion, but to be able to do so, I must unfortunately speak about myself, and it is terribly difficult and not pleasant to speak about yourself. However, I should like this matter to be cleared up. I want to tell hon. members at once that we must stop talking nonsense about this matter across the floor of the House. The primary, the decisive criterion in the consideration of news items for inclusion in the television news bulletins, is the newsworthiness of such items. Television news, like any other responsible news medium which gears itself to informing its public, cannot allow itself to be forced away from this premise, for what is at issue is not who makes the news; what is at issue is the news and the presentation of news.</p>

<p><span class="col_8019-8020" refersTo="page_1340"/>To introduce a kind of quota system in respect of Ministers, or what have you, would amount to censorship of newsworthy statements. Anything like that is completely unacceptable to the SABC. However, I am certain that it would also be unacceptable to hon. members on the opposite side. The question is therefore not how frequently a Minister, Ministers, or whoever it may be, appear on the television screen, but how newsworthy the statements are. This is the only criterion which the SABC uses and there is no other criterion which can be used. By virtue of their position in the administrative machine of the country, Ministers are of course in the position that they are newsmakers. When hon. members had so much to say about television yesterday evening, I decided that I would simply remain seated in my bench and afford them the opportunity of having their say and finishing what they had to say. Anyone can see what coverage the hon. members received in this morning&#x2019;s and this afternoon&#x2019;s newspapers. In my opinion they received full cover. What I am now going to say, I am saying in all humility, for it is not because I am Piet Koornhof that I am in a position to make statements; I am in that position because I am a Minister. If I do not make statements about certain matters, I am not doing my job. If I had risen to my feet yesterday evening and discussed certain matters, the speeches of some of the hon. members who received good news coverage this morning and this afternoon, would have had to be omitted from the newspapers. That is as simple as it is, but now the hon. members are not even thanking me for that. [Interjections.] As far as television is concerned, I do the same thing. The fact that news value is the criterion and that Ministers, for that reason, frequently make statements on television, is supported by the fact that statements by Ministers are quoted in the newspapers just as frequently. Since the polemic on the appearance of Ministers began to be fomented&#x2014;I hope this is the end of that story now&#x2014;the SABC gave special attention to the way in which television and other news media dealt with statements. I pointed out to the SABC that there was such a thing as &#x201C;overexposure&#x201D;, and requested them to give the Cabinet a rest for a while. I told them that they would also do well to allow me to appear on television less frequently, for after a while the public sees one too frequently and then they become annoyed at one. They investigated the matter and found that the statements of Ministers were more frequently given prominence by newspapers than the SABC did in its television service.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned, I was dealing with the question which was raised here by the hon. member for Durban Point and other Opposition members. It concerned the appearance of Ministers on television. Let me say that, after an investigation, it was proved that Ministers appeared more frequently in newspapers than on television. Therefore the SABC has already been acting very cautiously in this regard, after I had spoken to them about it. In so far as Ministers did appear, it was on every occasion in regard to information which was of importance to the public. Television news is an information medium which as to keep the public informed about national affairs, and it would have failed if it had omitted to present that information. It is important to notice that Ministers always appear on television in their capacity as Ministers of State and always on matters of national importance, and not in their capacity as office bearers of their party or in order to further party-political interests. Even on the one or two occasions when a Minister was presented on television while appearing at a party-political function, it concerned matters of national interest, or information of national interest. But in any event this has only happened in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>We must understand one another well now. I do hope the hon. member for Durban Point is not becoming difficult now. We must thrash out this matter with one another, for it is not in the national interests that we keep on meddling in it. There are criterions here which are accepted throughout the world. Events are newsworthy or they are not newsworthy. The SABC is going to a great <span class="col_8021-8022" refersTo="page_1341"/>deal of trouble&#x2014;make no mistake about it&#x2014;and is acting with great circumspection in this regard. If I can be convinced that the opposite is true, I am prepared to listen with an open mind to what is said. However, we must be fair. If we do not do so, we are not harming our party, but the country. It would then amount to one thing only: An eternal bickering in this regard would mean that we would constantly be disparaging the Ministers, the Prime Minister and the authority in this country. Surely it is not in the national interests that this should happen. Surely there are other people present in this country as well. I want to deal fully with this matter, because I cannot keep on discussing it, nor do I intend doing so. If hon. members wish to ask me questions in this regard, they are welcome to do so now. I am an honest and a straightforward person, and I am open to conviction, but when we have finished with this matter, then that has to be the end of it. The SABC does not make news.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Just let me state the case, and then I shall afford the hon. member an opportunity of asking a question. I promise to do so. As I have said the SABC is not the origin of news items, but simply reflects newsworthy items. That is all it does. SATV merely reflects what is newsworthy. Naturally Ministers are frequently invited to announce newsworthy items and to officiate at newsworthy occasions, more so than other public personalities. It is simply in the normal course of their work that this happens. As with all other media, the television news also applies the normal news criteria. To expect the SABC and SATV to accord a different treatment to Ministers in television news than has been the case all these years, and different treatment to that which is accorded to Ministers in other countries, would amount to the SABC being subjected to other journalistic standards than in the case of the other media. It would mean that the SABC would be expected to withhold important news from the public merely on the basis of a head poll. Surely this is not in the interests of the country. Surely it is not in anyone&#x2019;s interests. Now that I have dealt with this matter fully and properly, I really hope that we have heard the end of it. If the hon. member for Durban Point now wishes to ask me a question, he is very welcome to do so.</p>

[Interjections.] I am referring now to the presence of a Cabinet Minister at a function such as the laying of the comer stone, a social function or other social occasion. Is the mere presence of a Cabinet Minister there, such urgent, important and serious news in South Africa? [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one of the reasons why the presence of a Cabinet Minister at public functions is important is because a Minister is the head of a specific department. The Minister is the executive officer of his department. If the hon. member for Durban Point and other hon. members want to appear on television all day and every day, one possible way of doing so is to become Ministers. Eventually they should do so. [Interjections.] This is the factual position. This is not only the case in South Africa; it is the case in any other country in the world. Nothing can be done about it; we must simply accept it. Why, do hon. members think, is a Minister invited to a treeplanting ceremony or to any other function? People would like to turn such an occasion into a newsworthy event. The mere presence of the executive officer of a department, who is present there in his official capacity is very meaningful to people. That is why they invite the Minister. That is how the public see it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In many cases it is done in that fashion. It is only when a Minister makes a statement which is considered to be of news value against the background of the specific occasion that it is dealt with with the necessary equipment at the function.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, I should like to make a serious appeal to hon. members. We are all responsible people in this House. If hon. members have other questions in mind that they would like to put in this regard, they are welcome to put such questions to me in private. However this is a matter which we must settle now, because it is not in the interests of the country that we carry on with it in this way.</p>

<p>But hon. members touched upon another point, a point in regard to which we on this side of the House, as well as hon. members opposite, are sensitive. This is another matter which we have to clear up here. It concerns the broadcasting of the television programme &#x201C;Bakens op die Republikeinse Pad&#x201D;. As the name of the programme indicated, and as it was also presented, it concerned nothing but the milestones on the road to a Republic. Politically we must please not see it in the wrong light. Nor do I want to elaborate on it in greater detail now. The fact of the matter is that it happened to be the National Party for whom it was the ideal&#x2014;since as long ago as 1910&#x2014;to establish a separate, free Republic in this country. Politically it so happened that the Opposition were eternally opposed to it, until, of necessity, a referendum had to be held in which people had to answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; to the question of whether or not they wanted a Republic. It was then that all those blighters all voted &#x201C;no&#x201D; and now want to climb on to the bandwagon, every last one of them! [Interjections.] If anyone therefore compiles a very objective programme on the milestones on the road to the Republic&#x2014;thus when it does not involve the economic and political contributions of people, and their other contributions&#x2014;then it involves, simply and solely, the chronological recording of the history of these developments since the days of the French Huguenots to 31 May 1961, when South Africa became a Republic. That is what the compilers of the programme did. They presented the historic facts on the subject. Incidentally, this is the way in which that programme took shape. It was also right that the programme was broadcast in that way. Now hon. members must not climb onto the bandwagon afterwards and wish very complacently to share our journey. [Interjections.] Hon. members must please understand that that programme did not deal with the economic, the educational or other developments in South Africa. Nor did it deal with the undoubted part which the English-speaking and other language groups of our population in South Africa also played. That is also very important, and programmes in that regard will definitely be broadcast in future. This will happen, as surely as twice two is four. However, this programme was broadcast on Republic Day and, as its name indicates, it dealt with the milestones on the road to the Republic. In addition I still want to say &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; hon. members must not become so heated about this. It is the SABC &#x2026;</p>

<p>In the short time the television service has been in operation, great progress has already been made in various fields in regard to television, and on this occasion I should like to announce that additional transmitters are planned at places such as Piketberg, Grahamstown, Potgietersrus, Oudtshoorn, Nelspruit, Volksrus, Bethlehem, Zeerust, Kuruman and Houtbosdorp. I know that this will be welcome news to hon. members in whose constituency these areas are situated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton referred to the abolition of external examinations. I want to point out to the hon. member that the matter has very wide implications. Until now the universities have, according to law, and it is important to note that it is according to law, required an external admission examination, <span class="col_8025-8026" refersTo="page_1343"/>and attempts to do away with this in the past have always miscarried. In fact, section 15 of the Universities Act empowers the Joint Matriculation Board to conduct, control and impose conditions for the matriculation examination. However, I want to point out to the hon. member that the Joint Matriculation Board has allowed experiments in regard to internal examinations and it could be that the results would lead to a new approach. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member that one must allow the teacher to come into his own here. Therefore the principle is entirely acceptable to me. If we proceed from the standpoint that the teacher must come into his own, I hope that the experiments will be so successful that we will hopefully arrive at the desire which the hon. member correctly expressed.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppe discussed the question of &#x201C;remedial education&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to tell the hon. member that I consider this to be a very important matter. I have a letter on my table in connection with this matter. I have already asked the hon. member to let me have further details, and all I want to say at this stage is that I have more information, but due to the shortage of time I merely want to tell the hon. member that I will give the matter the necessary attention.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Bloemfontein North made a very good contribution. I have already replied to most of his questions. The ideas which he expressed on the possibility of interspersing the English and Afrikaans television services by way of an experiment, have been conveyed to the SABC. They will give their attention to the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley North, a former teacher and therefore a person who can speak with authority on this matter, discussed the gifted child. From the nature of the case this is a very important matter and I should like to inform those hon. members who are interested in it that the Human Sciences Research Council has informed me that a first report in regard to this problem is at present being printed. The contents of this report deal primarily with educational systems overseas for these gifted children. Furthermore, attention is being given to matters such as the criterion for identifying such children, how the programmes function and benefits implicit in these programmes for the exceptionally gifted child. The second phase of the investigation on gifted children, which now follows, concerns file question of working out, in conjunction with the education departments, additional principles and in particular programmes for the highly gifted child. Good progress is currently being made in this regard, and I have also received representations from other quarters. It is a really important matter and I am therefore pleased the hon. member raised it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast discussed a very important matter, viz. the question of technical education. He referred to the diminishing numbers at the technical high schools. However, I want to inform the hon. member that since technical education at school level is now the responsibility of the provincial authorities, this field of study is no longer being offered at technical high schools only, but at the ordinary high schools as well. This might be the reason why the numbers have diminished at the technical schools. I view this matter in a very serious light, and I can give the hon. member the assurance that, in the national interest, I shall ensure that a very penetrating investigation is instituted into it.</p>

<p>In my opinion the hon. member for Gezina made a very important speech. I agree with him entirely on the question of the authoritative role of the woman as against that of the man. This is really one of the major problems in education. The hon. member is a person who can speak with authority on this subject. In addition we must pay constant attention to the question of the viability of the youth. This is one of the very important matters, and the fact that it was raised here, enables us to ensure once again that the authorities concerned institute a thorough investigation into the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni referred to the S.A. War History Museum in Johannesburg, and I want to inform that hon. member that those people have been in touch with me. I accepted an invitation to pay them a visit soon. They also asked me whether they could comment on the report of the commission. I said that they could do so with the greatest pleasure. But I shall go and see for myself, for I am interested in the matter. I am now awaiting their comment and the necessary attention is being given to this matter. Consequently I want to thank the hon. member for <span class="col_8027-8028" refersTo="page_1344"/>his positive and important contribution in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein East also discussed matters of cardinal importance in a very positive way. I realize the value of camping sites very well, and I want to tell the hon. member that I shall try to provide the maximum assistance as far as this matter is concerned because I realize how valuable it is and because I have a great deal of sympathy for it. I can also assure the hon. member that the other matters which he raised will receive the necessary attention.</p>

<p>I have already replied to most of the arguments put forward by the hon. member for Parktown. However, I want to refer to the question of Crossroads. I am not ashamed to mention this, but in my parental home I was always taught that one should avoid anything that involved going to extremes. The programme in question did not refer specifically to any organizations. I have the whole of it in front of me here. I do not want us to go to the other extreme by exaggerating the matter. However, I have discussed this matter with the SABC and have asked them to be careful not to go to extremes in presenting these matters on television, even though they are the individual opinions of people; it is eccentric, and it has incensed many of our people. I know from experience that two good people who served on this council went off the rails as a result of this kind of thing, to the detriment of themselves and also to the detriment of the country.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Carletonville, owing to his intense interest in our young people and in education, is a true stalwart and a pillar of strength to us in the education group. That is why we listened once again with great pleasure today to the very striking ideas of the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown begged to be excused for not being able to be present here this evening, and in his absence I want to say that he made a very fine contribution on the &#x201C;Die Stem&#x201D; parsonage. The matter has already been raised previously. I have here a long report from Prof. D. J. Kotz&#x00E9; of the Cape Regional Committee of the HSRC. We have already made a great deal of progress with this matter, for the house in which the Rev. De Villiers composed &#x201C;Die Stem&#x201D; is a place we all hold dear and attach exceptional value to. I appreciate the way in which the hon. member raised the matter here. I want to assure the hon. member that we are already very close to the stage at which it will be possible to declare this building an historical monument. We have already made considerable progress in our negotiations with the Departments of Community Development and Public Works in regard to purchases and various possible methods of procedure in regard to the buildings. I do not want to go into any details now, but I want to assure the hon. member that I will remain in close touch with him and will let him know how we are progressing. If possible, we shall make use of his assistance to find the right solution as to how to use that building. His contribution was a very effective one, and we are very grateful for it.</p>

<p>Lastly, the hon. member for Johannesburg West made a very fine contribution. I just want to inform him that the JMB has been given a statutory instruction to reconsider the matriculation examination. If it does not carry out its task effectively, the Committee of Heads of Education has to devote the necessary attention to the matter. Consequently the matter is receiving attention at the moment. At present we are also enhancing the status of the colleges for advanced technical Education, but this cannot be done in one day. However, considerable progress has already been made in this regard. The University Advisory Council is giving attention to the liaison between the Colleges for Advanced Technical Education and the universities. A committee has been appointed to give proper consideration to the recommendations of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission. In addition the Committee of Heads of Education has already carried out curriculum studies at school level, and examinations are at present receiving attention from the departments. I want to thank the hon. member for his positive contribution.</p>

<p>I have now come to the end of my reply, and I just want to say:</p>

<p><span class="col_8029-8030" refersTo="page_1345"/>&#x2020;The mind is the master of man. They can who think they can. One cannot run up the ladder of success with cold feet.</p>

<p>*If we get down to the task of education in this spirit and with this attitude, education will undoubtedly be victorious. I should now like to conclude with what I consider to be the essence of everything when we are discussing education. What is this? The essence of our education in the Republic is neatly and effectively stated in the National Education Policy Act, 1967, which provides that education in our schools shall have a Christian character as well as a national character. I should like to quote a very fine passage from the book by N. V. C. Jeffreys entitled &#x201C;Education&#x2014;Its nature and purposes&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indeed, without Christianity, it is impossible to imagine the modern world at all. Without Christianity there would have been no light in the darkness when the Roman Empire disintegrated, no power to civilize the barbarian, no twelfth-century renaissance, no fifteenth-century renaissance, no Reformation, no modern science, no modern democracy, no welfare State, no basic human rights; in fact, since Marxism is Christian theology turned upside down and the opposite and the antithesis of it, without Christianity, no communism.</block>

<p>By way of summary it may be said: The ideal of Christian education may really serve as the highest ideal and the ultimate goal of all education because it points the way to the summit of all things and to the truly final. Consequently this is precisely where the strength of our ideal lies, also as far as education and the training of our children is concerned. To give education a broad national character entails that good citizenship must be built into education as an objective, for God is the creator, not only of individuals, but also of peoples and of nations. Seen in this way, we believe as a people, as we profess every day in this House through Mr. Speaker, that every nation has its own objective, function and destiny. The Christian and broad national character of our education is where not only the strength of education lies, but also the strength of our nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I request the privilege of the half hour. I propose this evening to discuss with the hon. the Minister what I believe is his primary function, i.e. the promotion of sport and recreation and not so much the control, management and direction from Government offices. His efforts in the direction of the promotion of sport have produced results which are generally welcomed by the vast majority of the public, results achieved by the same enthusiasm which the hon. the Minister has displayed during an earlier debate, the hour and a half or more this evening, of which we know he is capable. But when the hon. the Minister feels obliged to enter into the field of the control of sport to any extent, i.e. the control of the administration of competitive sport, and especially amateur sport, I want to warn him, thinking of the advice that his mother gave him, that his popularity declines as rapidly as a balloon running out of hot air over the Drakensberg. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that we know that in sticking to the promotion aspect of his responsibilities he has problems. We know that he has to be circumspect. He has a resolution of the federal council of the NP to consider and to apply, but we ask him in all seriousness to use the ingenuity of which he is capable to interpret that resolution in the interests of sport and the sportsmen of South Africa and not in the interests of <i>the status quo</i>. The federal council of the NP is unfortunately the all-powerful body which is even now going to decide what the government has to do regarding the Theron Commission, instead of Parliament or the Cabinet making that decision. That resolution of the federal council I am sure the hon. the Minister is able to interpret in the way we would like him to, and in the way the country would like him to, and in perhaps the way, I am sure, he would like to.</p>

<p>This resolution is that sport is to be practised and administered on a separate basis at club, provincial and national level by the respective population groups. All I ask the Minister to do is to apply, in interpreting that resolution, the ingenuity and the approach which he applied in his young days in writing a thesis and which he has applied in various other aspects of his life since that time. We have achieved, in spite of this resolution, <span class="col_8031-8032" refersTo="page_1346"/>which is a rather wide one and is not a closely interpreted resolution, much in certain sports, to the credit of this Minister, for which we thank him. The acceptance of the concept of South African representative teams is one such development. Whichever name we want to choose to describe those teams, they are multi-racial teams which have played in South Africa and outside South Africa. All I can say is that I hope that those, who would strictly and conservatively interpret the binding resolution of the federal council of the NP, will realize that with what has taken place, particularly in the last year, the foundations of our civilization remain quite firm. Not a hair-crack has appeared in the ramparts that we thought we should build around the maintenance and protection of our so-called civilization. Sir, this has been achieved&#x2014;and I acknowledge it&#x2014;through the Minister&#x2019;s preparedness to approve concessions, if I might put it that way, if not to change his basic policy.</p>

<p>But we have one further step to take and that is the step which he advised should be taken when he addressed the yachtsmen before they left for Rio, and that is that we have to take politics out of sport. Those were the Minister&#x2019;s words here in Cape Town. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that this achievement which we have had in our South African representative sides has, I think, brought to the front for our consideration the necessity of establishing one department of State to be responsible for the promotion of sport and recreation for all the communities of our population. Sir, the annual report of the department refers to a first step in this direction. On page 11 of the report, in paragraph 9.3, there is reference to an inquiry into the sport and physical recreation of the population groups in South Africa. It goes on to state that the report has shown &#x201C;which sports facilities are available and indicates in realistic terms which are required.&#x201D; That is in respect of all population groups in the country. I trust that the hon. member for Fauresmith, who will no doubt follow me in this debate, will be consequential as to what he has said before in this House and that he will support this plea I am making for a central Department of Sport for all our communities. I want to refer to the fact that he made noises in this direction when he spoke in this House on 14 October 1974. I hope that he will unequivocally support my plea for all sport promotion for all population groups to be entrusted to this hon. Minister of Sport and Recreation and his department.</p>

<p>The budget before us presents a picture of a totally unacceptable disparity of funds provided under the heading &#x201C;Promotion of Sport and Recreation&#x201D;. If anyone looks at the estimates which we have had tabled, he will find some startling figures which, I say immediately, are not a true reflection of the position. One will find, for instance, in Vote 6 on page 18 that for Bantu there is provision for R50 000 for the promotion of sport and recreation of which R20 000 are grants-in-aid. If we proceed to Vote 17, on page 1 we find that for the promotion of sport and recreation of which amongst Whites there is an amount of R2 480 000, of which R1 627 700 are grants-in-aid to provide sporting facilities. If one looks further at Vote 41 on page 4, one finds an incredible figure, in that for Coloureds there is the princely sum for the promotion of sport and recreation of R100. I should like to emphasize the fact that this is what one sees when one looks at the estimates which have been tabled in this House by the Minister of Finance. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Innesdal must not get excited. I have already said I realize there are other funds which are made available. There are, for instance, as far as the Bantu are concerned, funds which are derived from their beer halls, etc. There are funds which are made available indirectly through the Coloured Representative Council. However, the point which I am making is that without having a centralized directorate, any person who looks at these estimates of expenditure finds no word of reference whatsoever to the additional amounts that are derived from other sources for the Bantu and the Coloured people. I am sure that the hon. member for Innesdal who was getting so agitated when I suggested that there was only R100 available for the promotion of Coloured sport will agree with me that the best way to dispel any of these illusions and false conceptions is to ensure that sport is under one head, under one directorate, so that one can readily see all that is being done for the various race groups. This discrimination and apparently inadequate provision of facilities for all our communities can only be eradicated by adopting what I have suggested, namely the establishment of such a centralized department.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal specifically with <span class="col_8033-8034" refersTo="page_1347"/>umbrella control of specific sports. My suggestion is that there should be an umbrella control of all sports of all communities under the Minister. The hon. the Minister himself has publicly welcomed the establishment of one governing body for cricket. The various cricket unions have got together and they have appointed what I might term the &#x201C;committee of nine&#x201D;. I would like the hon. the Minister to give us an assurance this evening that the steps which are being taken by the administrators of cricket to sort out the differences and problems so that we can have truly representative South African teams, will be encouraged in every way by the hon. the Minister. A statement of his attitude towards the co-ordination of this very vital sport in South Africa would be welcomed, I am sure, by sportsmen throughout the length and breadth of the country.</p>

<p>I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that his path is becoming a little easier than it used to be. He was troubled by two persons with the name of Andries. I see that the one has retired from politics&#x2014;I am sure that the Andries from Marico has retired&#x2014;and I am sure that the Andries who sits here, who hails from Waterberg, can be convinced of the necessity of this overall umbrella control of sport.</p>

<p>If one looks at the last paragraph of the report, one finds a further innovation which we welcome. That is that the question of the issuing of permits for attendance under the Groups Areas Act at sports functions is now entrusted to this hon. Minister. I think that is to be welcomed. I know that he cannot do that officially, and that he cannot have the power delegated to him, but at least if the hon. the Minister of Community Development would listen to this hon. Minister I am sure that we would have less trouble in this connection. Perhaps we would even have the advances speeded up, as was the case when certain facilities for non-Whites were allowed, for instance, at the Green Point stadium. This has not only been of great assistance, but has helped considerably in stamping out lawlessness at sporting functions in that area.</p>

<p>The limited time we have available for this debate does not permit me to deal at any length with other matters, but there are one or two questions I want to raise with the hon. the Minister. These questions are causing some concern to those involved in sport. I hope the hon. the Minister, who has an unlimited amount of time to reply, will deal with these questions more fully than I can in the limited time I have at my disposal.</p>

<p>The first question involves dealing with applications for grants-in-aid to sporting bodies. It appears that the total number of requests received by the department involve some R8&#x00BD; million. The department has available for this current year an amount of R1 627 000. We would be interested to know by whom and in what manner the priorities for the expenditure of this money are to be determined. In the report for last year I find that R500 000, nearly one third of the total amount available for grants-in-aid, was assigned to one project, and that was the water reticulation scheme in the Upington area. I think there must be some justification necessary for providing one third of the total amount available for the whole Republic for the purposes of one scheme. I think that some justification is owed to those who are waiting for help in other directions. I hope the hon. the Minister will deal with this matter.</p>

<p>I now want to come to another point. With the largesse of hand-outs to municipalities all over the place, I believe there is a great danger that we run the risk of becoming a sort of sports welfare State. In the past history of South Africa local authorities, sporting bodies and persons interested in sport have accepted a great deal of the responsibility for providing sports facilities. One has municipal golf clubs all over the country and there are municipal areas set aside for other sports all over the country. However, if the current procedure is to be such that nothing need be provided by the local population since we are able to go to the Father Christmas Minister and ask him for hand-outs for what we need for the establishment of sport facilities, we are courting danger. I have always held the view that facilities which are provided with great generosity by some distant source do not engender the appreciation and care for the said facilities which is evidenced when those facilities are provided by the efforts of the people who themselves are involved in the sport concerned.</p>

<p>In this specific sphere I want to refer to one further matter, and that is a matter of which the hon. the Minister is fully aware. I am speaking here of the necessity for adequate harbour facilities for pleasure craft. I do not want to go into this matter at any great length, but I do <span class="col_8035-8036" refersTo="page_1348"/>want to mention the fact that these harbour facilities have a dual purpose. On the one hand these facilities facilitate indulgence in the sport of sailing and boating but there is a more important factor. Where one has outlets at specific places, one is able to ensure that safety regulations are observed by the people who put out to sea. After all, if a boat is launched from a controlled harbour launching area, at least there is an opportunity for the people concerned to ensure that when a power boat or yacht is launched it is complying with the primary needs for safety, such as the need for life-jackets and other devices laid down in any regulated club. I am particularly pleased to see in the report that the Government has agreed to an investigation by the CSIR of a project study of the Grainger Bay facilities at Mouille Point. It is a matter I raised many years ago with the hon. Mr. Ben Schoeman when he was still here as Minister of Railways. The matter has now been transferred to this hon. Minister&#x2019;s department. I do want to thank the hon. the Minister for the deep personal interest which he has shown in this particular project. The power boat enthusiasts of the Cape Peninsula and Western Cape are appreciative of what is being done. I think that they have shown their appreciation and that they have demonstrated that they do not expect the department to do everything, by the not inconsiderable amount of money which they have collected themselves and which they have spent already on what one might call the preliminary works for the pleasure boat harbour. As the hon. the Minister will, I am sure, realize, this amenity will be of great value not only to the Peninsula but also to tourism generally, bearing in mind the growing use of these facilities by overseas travellers. We shall be pleased to hear from the hon. the Minister in due course&#x2014;although he may not even at this stage be able to give us an indication&#x2014;to what extent he will be able to assist the Oceana Power Boat Club in this particular venture of theirs.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that I would be failing in my duty if I did not, on behalf of this side of the House, and I am sure also on behalf of all members of this House, pay tribute to our sportsmen and sports administrators in South Africa. In times which have, I suggest, been made difficult by Government stubbornness and hesitancy in making adaptations in the control of sport, they have been able to continue to maintain sporting standards as high as one could possibly imagine them being maintained outside of full world competition. This has meant a great deal of dedication of time and energy on the part of these people, and the hon. the Minister himself has, time and again, paid his tribute to these persons who are involved in the various aspects of sport. I believe that they have used their utmost endeavours to overcome the estrangement of our sportsmen in other countries. Their achievements have been meritorious in that regard. I see the hon. the Minister nodding. I am sure that he agrees with me that that is so.</p>

<p>Surely, when we see what these people have been able to achieve in spite of the problems with which they have been faced, we must realize that the time has come when sportsmen are able to administer their own affairs effectively, that they will administer those affairs in the interests of sport and that they will administer those affairs in the interests of South Africa. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister and his party to accept that the time has come for the Minister to devote himself to his primary function, viz. the promotion of sport and recreation, and for the sports administrators to take over the control and the running of their particular sports, both locally and internationally, without any interference from Parliament or from the Government in any form whatsoever.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the speech by the hon. member for Green Point this evening was so encouraging to me. However I do not know why he did not make the statement he really wanted to make, viz. to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the outstanding way in which he handles sport in South Africa. He might as well have said it in so many words and have done with it. Sir, in the course of my speech I shall come back to some of the points mentioned by the hon. member. I should also like to associate myself with the congratulations addressed to our sportsmen for their achievements in recent years. The hon. member repeated an appeal made by the hon. the Minister and said that we should keep politics out of sport. I am sorry, Sir; I should have liked to support that appeal, but I do not think the world is allowing us to do so.</p>

<p>The best examples I can mention of the way in which politics play a role in sport every day <span class="col_8037-8038" refersTo="page_1349"/>is the coming of the All Blacks and the change of Government in Australia. There is a different Government, and now the All Blacks can come again. There is a different Government in Australia, and now those people are prepared to receive us under certain conditions. A year ago the President of the S.A. Cricket Association was unable to obtain a visa to go and put his case in Australia. I therefore fear that it is wishful thinking to say that politics should be kept out of sport. But in spite of the fact that after 1960 we were barred from the Olympic Games, our sportsmen, our sports administrators and our instructors have not let the grass grow under their feet, as the hon. member also said. They put their shoulders to the wheel. Their achievements have been of world stature. The sportsmen have forced themselves on the attention of the world so that the sporting world had to take note of them. We have progressed a long way. Since 1966 38 State President&#x2019;s Awards have been made to individual sportsmen and these are all people who have achieved world standard as a result of exceptional coaching. And that is not even to speak of the Springbok team of my friend Dawie de Villiers, Hannes Marais&#x2019;s Springbok team and the men&#x2019;s hockey team which have also received awards. We have achieved outstanding results through the policy of the National Party in the implementation of the policy of the NP.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the policy of the NP, not a single Black man would have taken part in any of our bicycle tours. As far as bowls are concerned, can we let this occasion pass without a word of, I am tempted to say, glorification of our bowls people? Their achievement in having won all the world championships at stake, was absolutely phenomenal. As far as golf is concerned, surely we all know Gary Player. We have also heard of Dale Hayes. But is it not phenomenal that on the same day that Sally Little won a tournament in America, Vincent Tshabalala won the French tournament?</p>

<p>What about the Van der Merwes?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the Van der Merwes now. Nor must we let the fine achievements of our mountain climbers in the Andes go unnoticed. I am not referring now to the group of Van der Merwes who lost their way in the Cedarberg. I think their feet were not tough enough. What I find most encouraging, and what gives me hope for the future, is that while we on the Government side believe in separate development and while it is our policy, we also acknowledge at all times that there is a certain area, which I want to call a grey area, in which White and non-White will always make contact. It has often been said that sport is a very emotional subject. It probably is emotional, but why is it emotional? It is emotional and has a hold on people because it was the first area outside politics which was a grey area in which the various peoples had to learn to coexist. Under the leadership of the hon. the Minister and in accordance with the policy of the NP we have entered this grey area and, as the hon. member for Green Point also said, this has been done with outstanding success. These things have been achieved&#x2014;and this is still the most important point&#x2014;without a single incident. The NP has stated that its future aim is and always has been to eliminate friction as far as possible. At this level the NP has eliminated friction and achieved success. One of these days the Transkei will become independent and when that happens, then under the policy of this Government the Umtata team will be free to come and tour in this country just as Gloucestershire is touring here now. We have progressed a long way. When I consider matters&#x2014;I do not want to play prophet; there are many other prophets opposite&#x2014;it seems to me that the next sphere to come under attack&#x2014;a sphere which is outside politics&#x2014;is going to be the sphere of the church. I have sympathy for them; a great deal of sympathy. It is going to be an uphill struggle.</p>

<p>In order to develop this success further, I believe it is necessary for sportsmen to be trained even more; for further research on sportsmen to be carried out; for sports administrators to be taught how to administer sport. I have time for those people who sacrifice their days and nights for the sake of sports administration. In this regard I want to associate myself with the words of the hon. member for Green Point. I do not want to advocate that the Department of Sport should <span class="col_8039-8040" refersTo="page_1350"/>become an umbrella department. This would not fit in with the policy of the NP because the NP believes that the Coloureds, the Indians and the Black people must administer their own sporting matters, coaching and administration. However I believe that it must be made possible for the Department of Sport and Recreation to assist with the training of non-White sports administrators* and coachers&#x2014;even though it be on an agency basis, as is the case in the Department of Health. In this case I have in mind the Coloureds, the Indians and the Black people. The department must assist them in the coaching of those sportsmen and in further research and provision of aid. The successful development of the policy of separate development and of sport, as developed by the NP, must never allow a situation to develop in which it could be said that the NP follows a static policy. If changes have to be effected in South Africa, then the NP can do so. I believe that this would be appropriate and a good thing, because in my opinion, it is essential for the full development of the NP&#x2019;s policy, that the administration of the non-White sporting bodies should receive assistance, that aid should be given with regard to the coaching of sportsmen and with regard to the research which must necessarily be carried out. In that regard I should like to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Green Point. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in his speech the hon. member for Green Point hinted here and there that he was making an honest effort to serve sport. We on this side of the House have much appreciation for this.</p>

<p>This evening I want to exchange a few ideas about those who do not serve sport. In this instance I am choosing my words in a different way to that in which the hon. member for Green Point chose his. I want to discuss the abuse of politics in sport. It is undoubtedly true that there are few acts more reprehensible than when a person or body uses its power or influence or abuses its aims in such a way as to destroy the ideals of other people who are making an honest effort to build something up. I believe, too, that there is nothing which engenders so much aversion as disloyalty. Therefore, since we are living in strange times, in which there is often rejoicing when someone undermines and destroys, I believe that we too can make a new appeal in this House this evening, not only to the sport administrators of the various population groups in South Africa, not only to the various sportsmen of the various population groups in South Africa, but also to the whole sporting world. To all these people and bodies we can make a new appeal for a new loyalty; in this case loyalty to sport for the sake of sport. We in South Africa have some of the finest examples of people who often do not agree with the policy of the Government but who give their all to build and create opportunities for the young to allow talents they have been endowed with to develop in one field of sport or another. If one does not want to mention those sport administrators by name this evening, then it is not because they are not well-known, but because one is afraid one might leave out deserving people. However, it is also true, unfortunately, that in South Africa&#x2014;to a lesser extent fortunately&#x2014;and throughout the whole world, there are innumerable people who leave no stone unturned to bedevil sporting relations.</p>

<p>I have here before me a Press statement issued earlier this year by &#x201C;the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa&#x201D;, of which Mr. Ordia is the president. I am only going to quote a single sentence from the Press statement which was issued after New Zealand had invited a South African softball team to its shores&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If New Zealand are determined to resume participation in apartheid sport against the wishes of virtually the entire world, they can expect a much harder time internationally, as the nations demonstrate their disgust. Their recent action is a wicked demonstration of a deliberate slap in the face of the entire Third World.</block>

<p>In an introductory letter under cover of which he sent this Press statement to the chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid of the United Nations, Mr. Ordia writes the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My council is at one with your committee in the conviction that only total isolation can bring the racist South Africa to her senses. We have consequently laboured against odds to get her expelled from nearly every international sports federation, including the Olympic movement. This has not been easy <span class="col_8041-8042" refersTo="page_1351"/>because she has some few but very powerful supporters.</block>

<p>When one looks at these things, one wonders whether sport is being served by these deeds and words and whether the young people who want to use the time when they are still young for achievements in the world of sport, are being rendered a service. In the same Press statement it is stated that certain countries have already withdrawn from the softball tournament in New Zealand. He adds the following to this statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Filbert Baji &#x2026;</block>

<p>This Tanzanian athlete&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the 1 500 metre record holder was billed to challenge John Walker, the current New Zealand one-mile world record holder &#x2026;</block>

<p>Owing to the fact that Tanzania decided not to take part in the meeting because South Africa had been invited, the race is no longer going to take place. One wonders how it can be justified that a promising athlete in Tanzania should be deprived of the privilege of running against a world record holder from New Zealand simply because the people in Tanzania do not agree with the political policy followed in South Africa. After New Zealand had accepted the invitation of the All Blacks to South Africa, the attacks and onslaughts against New Zealand increased.</p>

<p>In <i>Die Volksblad</i> of 31 May this year, only a few days ago, one reads that the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Mr. Ramphal, said that the international consequences of their decision to allow the All Black rugby team to go to South Africa would not necessarily be neutralized by a statement that New Zealand was still opposed to apartheid. He said that New Zealand could be facing isolation. In <i>Die Volksblad</i> of the following day, there is a report entitled &#x201C;New Zealand facing isolation&#x201D;. In the subsequent edition of the newspaper, a further report appeared entitled &#x201C;Sportsmen do not want to appear on TV with Ordia.&#x201D; This is the same Mr. Ordia, the president of the council to which I have already referred, who accepted an invitation by the Press of New Zealand to appear in a television programme in New Zealand with the chairman of their Olympic committee and with some of their sportsmen. Then Mr. Lans Cross, the chairman of the New Zealand Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association, said that his association believed that bridges had been built and they were not prepared to follow the example of other countries by misusing sport for political aims. &#x201C;If Ordia comes to New Zealand to discuss sport, I am prepared to speak to him, but it is reprehensible for Ordia to want to use newspapers to initiate negotiations with New Zealand,&#x201D; he said. Furthermore, Mr. Walker, who is referred to in the Press statement as a world record holder, was asked to appear in a television interview together with Mr. Ordia. His reply was: &#x201C;I shall not. I want to run; I do not want to get involved in politics.&#x201D; If we want to take up the cudgels for New Zealand to a certain extent this evening, then we must convey our appreciation to that country and its Government, not because they have given up anything by allowing the All Blacks to come to South Africa, not because that country is doing us a favour, but because New Zealand is prepared to set an example to the world, is prepared to create opportunities for its young people and prepared to allow sport to take place for sport&#x2019;s sake. We want to tell the world today that we have appreciation for New Zealand specifically because it was strong enough to set an example and we can only hope that other countries will follow it. Now it is interesting to know that some of New Zealand&#x2019;s sportsmen, too, will suffer as a result of this. To me, the unfairness here lies specifically in the fact that those who are prepared to serve sport will also suffer if Mr. Ordia and others who feel as he does get their way. We must accept that New Zealand wants to create the finest opportunities for its young people, and by so doing wants to afford the young people of South Africa, too, the opportunities to take part in sport. I think it is necessary for the sporting world to take cognizance of the fact that we in South Africa ask that meaningless abuse of sport be ended. Nothing will ever be achieved thereby, because sport eventually will triumph. In the meantime, however, young people who are unable to use their opportunities suffer, because other people want to misuse sport for political ends to realize other ideals which are not sport ideals.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fauresmith pointed <span class="col_8043-8044" refersTo="page_1352"/>out that South Africa&#x2019;s isolation began when in 1964, for the first time since 1908, we were absent from the Olympic Games. It has been since the enemies of South Africa&#x2014;I think it is also necessary that we refer to them as the enemies of sport&#x2014;began to achieve success at the Olympics at Tokyo that the attacks on South Africa began. It is this very state of affairs which has inspired our sport administrators to give their all to put South Africa back in the international sporting arena. The successes they have achieved are illustrated by the fact that in 1973 there were 73 types of registered sport, only ten of which did not enjoy international participation. Last year it was only 11 out of 83. I see my time is up and I conclude with the positive thought that the Free State can still win the Currie Cup this year.</p>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I agree largely with most of the points made by the hon. member for Bethlehem. I think he is absolutely right when he says that politics should be kept out of sport as far as is humanly possible. However, I think he has taken a somewhat one-sided look at the matter, because it is no good blaming the rest of the world for the ills that befall South Africa. I believe that it might be necessary&#x2014;it is necessary from time to time&#x2014;that we look at ourselves as sincere people and see if we cannot make improvements in the interests of the country.</p>

<p>The hon. member called for a new loyalty. I now want to talk about a group of sportsmen, I think, who have the greatest loyalty to South Africa. In doing so, I should like to follow one of the points made by the hon. member for Green Point. It seems like only yesterday when I sat in the grandstand at Kingsmead on a bright morning and watched Barry Richards score 90 runs before lunch against and Australian side. That South African side of some years ago went on to win the match and then went on to win the series, in magnificent style. Those were the days of Barlow, Proctor, Goddard, centuries, victories and champagne. All that has changed. No country today in the entire cricketing world is prepared to play against us and spectator interest in cricket has dwindled. We have to be content with unofficial tours to South Africa, but not away from South Africa. And now it is not only Blacks, Indians and Coloured cricketers who must seek their opportunities overseas. The White cricketers are facing the same misfortune and have to seek their opportunities overseas as well. They are suffering the same bitter frustration as their Black, Coloured and Indian counterparts of years gone by.</p>

<p>In the few minutes still at my disposal I should like to sketch a scene and make a very sincere appeal to the hon. the Minister, specifically to this hon. the Minister, in the interests of some 70 000 cricketers in South Africa, enthusiasts and spectators, young and old.</p>

<p>As isolation loomed for cricketers in South Africa in the 1960s, White cricket administrators made tentative contacts with their counterparts in Coloured, in Indian and in Black cricketing circles, with bodies of men who over the years have enjoyed none of the glory and none of the opportunities of cricketing decades gone by. However, a start was made, perhaps timidly, in building better relationships and in building mutual trust between the various races in the cricketing community. This was no simple task, because prejudices and animosities die hard. Initially there was but little success, and some years ago cricket at all levels amongst the races suffered and went into decline. However, a measure of goodwill still survived amongst men of goodwill. Within each of the three major unions, the S.A. Cricket Association, the S.A. African Cricket Board and the S.A. Cricket Board of Control&#x2014;Sacboc&#x2014;there were senior persons who persevered and who devoted their time in persuading, in the first instance, the people within their own unions and within their own clubs, as to the urgent need for and the benefit of working together to lift cricket for everyone out of the doldrums, and also to put South Africa back on the international map. In all these unions they succeeded, because on 18 January 1976, as a culmination of years of work, a resolution was passed in the face of setbacks and dissidents.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, but I have no time to answer questions. What does the resolution say? It says that Sacboc and the other two unions&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; hereby adopt the principle that cricket in South Africa be played on a normal basis <span class="col_8045-8046" refersTo="page_1353"/>under the controlling aegis of one united governing body in South Africa, the name, composition and constitution of which will be agreed as soon as possible. Normal cricket shall mean at this stage participation of and competition between all cricketers, regardless of race, creed or colour in cricket and club level in one provincial governing body.</block>

<p>The next clause relates to the implementation of that and the setting up of the 9-man committee.</p>

<p>This resolution met with mixed public reception. Mr. Hassan Howa decried it; the HNP decried it; the Press welcomed it; cricketers in enormous numbers welcomed it; and the Minister, in my view, very wisely held his counsel and his comments. This in itself was a great encouragement to the cricketers concerned. However, the task does not end there. At provincial level the different bodies have met together as have, I believe, the committee of nine. We have already seen the first fruit of these meetings. There have been three unofficial tours this year. There have been the Datsun Double Wicket, the Derrick Robins Tour and, the Richie Benaud&#x2019;s International Wanderers&#x2019; Tour. For the first time Blacks, Coloureds, Indians and Whites played together on an invitation basis at international level, but this time with the full and formal blessing of the unions concerned. What did we see? Despite the stumbling block created by people who did not agree with this move, despite the voices in the dark that called out that this was wrong, we saw Ebrahim Babu, a man we have never heard of, take six wickets against an international side.</p>

<p>We saw Baboo Ebrahim. White and Black spectators found a new unity in supporting wholeheartedly a South African side. The fears of friction proved groundless. The moderates of the cricket world were vindicated.</p>

<p>However, the task does not end even there. Encouraged by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s helpfulness and spurred on by the successes of the season, the ground work envisaged in the resolution gone forward. The committee of nine will no doubt very soon, if not already, be wanting to see the hon. the Minister to put to him their proposals.</p>

<p>I bear no knowledge of what they are going to say to the hon. the Minister, but I would like to ask the minister that when he sees the committee&#x2014;and I hope he sees them very soon&#x2014;to bear a few very important aspects in mind: firstly, that the coming 1976-&#x2019;77 season will be crucial and that it is a fast approaching season. The Minister must move rapidly to meet with this committee and should, if necessary, take the initiative, to see them, and break his silence on what they are trying to achieve. Secondly, with the cricket d&#x00E9;tente achieved, after all these years of trying, that the trust built up between the various executive bodies is a fragile d&#x00E9;tente which will crumble, if no tangible progress is made. Thirdly, that the men of goodwill who control Black, Coloured and Indian cricket, and who seek ties and competition with Whites, will themselves only be able to maintain sway within their own unions, will only be able to survive, if their good intentions are proved successful and if their attitude of conciliation is vindicated in the eyes of their own supporters. Fourthly, failure by these people to succeed now will mean only a rapid return to the old animosities, to the polarization of races within the cricketing community, and in the long term, to the isolation of all South African cricketers.</p>

<p>Finally and fifthly, I want to tell the Minister that from what I can see and from what I have been told, the cricketers have in fact reached an agreement. They have reached an agreement on broad consensus. They have reached an agreement on method, and they are going to put a form of agreement to the Minister. In other words, the ball is in the court of the Government and not in the court of the cricketers. The ball is in the court of the hon. the Minister and it is up to the Government to see to it that cricket goes forward in the spirit in which the cricketers themselves would like to see it go forward. I pray that this Minister at this moment will not let us down.</p>

<speech by="#de_beer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. DE BEER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, both the hon. member for Green Point and the hon. member for Sandton have intimated that progress has been made with our sports policy, but now I want to make the statement that that progress could only have been made under the leadership of our energetic Minister and because we on this side of the House are aware <span class="col_8047-8048" refersTo="page_1354"/>of, and convinced that, sport can play an important role in the establishment of sound ethnic relations. That is why we on this side of the House want to use sport to establish and develop these ethnic relations, because we believe that sport can make friends for us. That is why we see sport as an instrument placed in our hand so that this aim may be achieved. In this connection I should like to refer to a report issued by an extremely authoritative international research institute known for its outstanding research work. This is the report concerning &#x201C;Black/White relationships in Soweto&#x201D;. What does this report say? It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The results give cause for optimism. A higher proportion of the Soweto people feel that Black/White relationships in South Africa are improving rather than getting worse.</block>

<p>This researcher inquired about the ethnic relations among Blacks at various levels of education and remuneration, and the largest percentage of Blacks questioned, replied that the most important reason why White/Black relations had improved, was to be found in the opportunities afforded by sport. In this regard, therefore, sport development has indubitably played an important role in improving relations. Sport is therefore something which may serve the best interests of all the peoples of South Africa. Sport, more than anything else, affords the various population groups the opportunity to develop mutual recognition and respect for the human dignity of each. Sport results in knowledge and understanding of each other. These fruits have already been reaped to a large extent by the large number of multi-national tournaments arranged over the past few years.</p>

<p>Now, it is easy for countries overseas to talk and criticize, but ultimately it is South Africa that has to solve its own problems. With our eight different Black population groups as well as Indians, Coloureds and Whites, who not only vary enormously with regard to their cultural background, but are at various stages of development, this is no small task. These population groups also have their own preferences with regard to sport development. I believe that the fact that a report of this nature and one to which I have just referred could have afforded such positive evidence, represents an exceptional achievement. It is an achievement which owes its success solely to the sincerity of our Government in bringing about a better mutual understanding among the various population groups. These achievements also arise out of our desire to create opportunities for other population groups to develop to the full their practice of sport. That is why it is our standpoint that the sound development of sport on a multi-national basis is in the best interests of the peaceful coexistence of the various peoples within South Africa. In this way sport can also serve as a powerful stimulant for the physical and social development of the various peoples. Cycling tours such as the Tour of the Winelands and the Rapport Cycling Tour are eloquent examples of this. Between Pretoria and Cape Town more than 300 000 people viewed the Rapport Cycling Tour. It was an international, multi-national cycling championship which was effectively presented. If this cycling tour had not been presented on a basis of multi-nationalism, not a single Black team could have competed because the Black peoples have not yet reached the standard necessary to be able to do this.</p>

<p>That is why we say that our policy is a policy of development, development of the Black man, the Coloured and the Indian and, in conjunction with this, the development of the White as well. That is why it is our intention with regard to sport development that sport be exercised and administered by the various population groups at the various levels within the national context. The various peoples are also proud to do so, just as they are proud of their own sportsmen and women. When we talk about sport development, we mean that the national sport bodies of the various population groups, each of which is on the road to self-determination, must establish separate relations with similar sporting bodies of other peoples. By sport development we mean that individual sportsmen must be able to progress to the highest international level and also that within South Africa, full opportunities must be afforded for inter-nation and international meetings, taking into account the customs of South Africa. That is why the statistics of the Department of Sport and Recreation also indicate that the number of international multi-national meetings is increasing annually. In this way all sportsmen in South Africa are afforded the opportunity of competing at the highest level. By sport <span class="col_8049-8050" refersTo="page_1355"/>development we mean that there will also be co-ordination at the highest management level among the sporting bodies of the various population groups. Furthermore, by sport development we also mean that organized sport must always&#x2014;and this hon. members on that side of the House must also bear in mind&#x2014;relate to the course of social and political development in South Africa.</p>

<p>This year is once again an Olympic Year. With regard to Olympic types of sport, it is our standpoint that an inter-nation team, comprising the best sportsmen from among all peoples in South Africa, could represent South Africa under the South African flag. When, in time, some of the Black peoples achieve independence, they too will be able to establish their own sporting relations, just as Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland do at present. However, there is a further example of the positive influence of sport in establishing sound ethnic relations. I refer here to the presentation of the Champion of Champions soccer series. In this series the various population groups of South Africa were given the opportunity to play against each other on a knock-out basis. Not only did this contribute towards the quality of the sport being substantially increased as a result of the higher level of sporting practice but the presentation of this series also afforded the sportsmen of the various peoples of South Africa the opportunity of building up mutual understanding and respect for each other. That is why it is our conviction that as far as this development of our sport policy is concerned, we are making a definite contribution to the establishment of better ethnic relations. By doing so we are making a definite contribution to the furtherance of the best interests of the peoples of South Africa. Undoubtedly there are more important matters than sport, but as long as sport can serve the interests of South Africa, we must and shall use it for this purpose.</p>

<speech by="#mills">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. W. MILLS</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, there he is. It was interesting to hear an hon. member telling us how well Nationalist sports policy has developed. I agree with him that they have come a long way over the last 20 years, but the last 20 years have actually been a backward step and they have not even reached the point where the UP left off. I would like to see some of the &#x201C;ontwikkeling&#x201D;, which the hon. member for Geduld spoke about, getting under way. It seems to me that Nationalist sports policy&#x2014;or let us say South African sports policy&#x2014;falls into three phases. Up to 1948 we did have separate White sport, and Black sport was played under White patronage or guardianship. We also do have on record the awarding of Springbok colours to the occasional Black man. However, during the first 20 years of Nationalist rule radical sports apartheid was enforced as a policy for the first time in South Africa, and it was during those years that South Africa lost its international ties of friendship and sporting contacts. Now we have reached the 70s and it is interesting to see the development of a new phase in our sports policy, and here I am referring to the idea of multi-national sport. As far as we are concerned, however, the position is still in a state of flux and experiment. In this state we still have exceptions and discrepancies manifesting themselves. At best, I would say the policy could be called a non-policy, and I think it would be kind to call it a muddle. I should like to give some examples of the present muddle, a muddle which causes embarrassment on occasions and also racial tension.</p>

<p>Last year we saw the Black team Kaizer Chiefs playing the White team Hellenic. This was the epitome of the Nationalist&#x2019;s multinational sports policy. During this game which was played at Hartleyvale in Cape Town, we saw fights and barricades broken down. Even the international referee said that he would rather have had the sides mixed than separate in multi-national teams. Since then we have had a change. The Government has moved&#x2014; and I again use the word &#x201C;ontwikkel&#x201D;&#x2014;and we now have Blacks and Whites playing together in the same side. This certainly was a change, and for the first time we had Black and White spectators roaring their approval here at Newlands when we saw a combined rugby XV beating the French. At Kingsmead we also saw Baboo Ebrahim thrilling the crowd by taking a number of wickets against the International Wanderers side with his spinners. It was interesting to see that Sacboc were so proud that they seemed to have second thoughts about suspending their players for having <span class="col_8051-8052" refersTo="page_1356"/>taken part in that game. One would think that this was now a satisfactory state of affairs, but it is not.</p>

<p>One need only look at the comments of the players who took part in those games. What were their views? &#x201C;Not again for us. We want normal cricket, and not these internationals. This is just window-dressing.&#x201D; Jock Mahoney, a Coloured bowler from the Eastern Province, had this to say: &#x201C;We have done sufficient to prove to the Government and to South Africa that normal cricket can be played in this country without any difficulties.&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, this was proved a long time ago. The Aurora side, which is a mixed side, has been playing league cricket in Pietermaritzburg for the past three seasons without any trouble. But, Sir, the point is: What does the future hold? No definite policy has been mapped out. We have this impasse between Government policy, with its difficulties and dangers, on the one hand, and on the other hand the successes of the experimentation and what the players want. This impasse must be resolved. The answer has already been suggested by the sportsmen, and this suggestion has recently been supported by Prof. Gert Scholtz, who is a professor of physical education at Potchefstroom. In an interview in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 6 May he had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To my mind merit selection is a logical</block>

<p>result of the multi-racial approach.</p>

<p>We are very pleased to hear that, because the UP has always maintained that there should be a policy of merit selection in sport. In fact, we go even further. We say that the control of sport should be left in the hands of the sportsmen, as in the case of the paraplegics who recently organized their own tour to Canada without any trouble.</p>

<p>The point is that while the Government delays, team sports, and particularly cricket, suffer. For instance, we have had no test cricket in this country for six years. Our experienced and blooded test cricket players will consequently all be going out together. We will be seeing the end of the Pollocks, the Richards and the Barlows. By the time they reach 36 or so they will be finished, and how will they be replaced once they have all gone out together? We are not blooding any more test cricketers because they are not getting the experience. We do not find a reservoir of players coming through. The reason for this is that international sides will only come here if they can play fully mixed merit selected sides, which is not Government policy.</p>

<p>But apart from test cricket, what about the building up of the other sports? If we accept merit selection, we will find that a man like Pele will be able to come out here and play for a team like Cape Town City or that a man like Bobby Moore will be able to join Kaizer Chiefs, which would improve these sides. If this were done, one could have such invitation players coming here. It is not foreign for us to see Black players in South Africa. A lot of racially mixed sides have come here. We have had Black tennis players like Ashe coming here; we have had boxers like Galindez and we have had cricketers like Shepherd. We see them on the soccer field. In fact, when the New Zealand rugby side comes out here, we will probably find that many of the New Zealand players will be Maoris. I hope that this is going to condition viewpoints in the benches opposite and in the Cabinet to accept the change which the hon. member for Fauresmith claims can take place under Nationalist policy. We have here at home players who want to gather together to get competition while playing together.</p>

<p>At present the S.A. Cricket Association is negotiating with the hon. the Minister towards this end. We hope that his decision will favour South Africa and South African sportsmen in the future. We are aware that the hon. the Minister is trying very hard to normalize our sporting relationships. He has been making a great individual effort, but he cannot be everywhere to handle all the individual queries and problems that occur. Without stating the logical goal of the Government&#x2019;s policy, all his efforts could be doomed. We can see the policy and where it is heading. We shall encourage it along this path, but we do ask whether the Cabinet sees it and, if the Cabinet does see it, whether they will accept and encourage the logical development of the sports policy. The present hon. Minister might not always be there and his successor may not be able to steer around the artificial barriers of Government policy. If that were to happen, we would be back at square 1. We hope the Government will take up the lead given by the hon. the Prime Minister when he pledged at the opening of the men&#x2019;s world bowls championships in Johannesburg that he would further <span class="col_8053-8054" refersTo="page_1357"/>the interests of sport &#x201C;because&#x201D;, he said, &#x201C;it knows no social difference and brings people of different races and religions together&#x201D;. This was quoted in <i>The Daily News</i> of 19 February 1976. There may of course be resignations like that of the MPC for Marico, but this should not stem the tide and the flow of history.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are a couple of points I should like to raise in the remaining time available to me. The one is the televising of sport. There has been a lot of controversy over this and in fact a warning has been given by the S.A. Rugby Board that if attendances at games drop, they will consider restricting television coverage. To our mind this question should not arise because the sports administrators are in the magnificent position where they are able to collect from SATV on the one hand and from the firms who want to sell their products by advertising on the grounds on the other hand. These firms have been quick to benefit in their advertising. A few Saturdays ago I watched the game between Boland and Western Province in Wellington and it was funny to see how a firm, when it realized where the cameras were, removed their advertising banners and rushed around the field to obtain the maximum advantage from those TV cameras. All the sports administrators have to do is to negotiate with these firms for one day or for a particular spot on the ground. I think that from this they could reap more than from a large attendance.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North again pointed a finger at the Government and accused us of being the cause of South Africa&#x2019;s not competing internationally in many spheres. My knowledge of sport is probably not very good, but I remember that the first post-war cricket team led by Dudley Nourse, or was it Alan Melville&#x2014;I cannot quite recall&#x2014;played test matches against England and also against Australia. I want to ask the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North why test matches were not played against West India, India and Pakistan in those days. After all, they also had test teams by that time. I want to ask the hon. member why Coloureds and Bantu were not included in the White cricket teams before 1948. Surely they also had good players in those days. In other words, when that party was in power, they did not do it either. But now they want the Government to do it straight away so that everything in the garden may be rosy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#badenhorst">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Not now. Mr. Chairman, over the past year the emphasis in sport has fallen upon South Africa&#x2019;s exclusion from those international gatherings. On every occasion the Government was made the scapegoat for our exclusion from those international competitions. I think that two things are being overlooked. The first is that sport does have a place in Government policy. Sport is not something which can be practised outside the Government&#x2019;s policy. In every country in the world sport forms an integral part of the policy of that country and of that Government. This Government has a policy and with this policy it went to the voters and received a mandate from the voters and, since sport is a part of that policy, the Government is implementing its policy in respect of sport as well. The second thing which is being overlooked is that in many countries and for many people sport has become an instrument of political propaganda. There are people who use sport solely to achieve their political aims. This Government, in spite of opposition and in spite of the boycotts, has continued to develop its policy of multi-national sport so that today it is possible for everyone in South Africa to reach the highest rung of the ladder. I should like to challenge the Opposition parties here tonight. I should like to challenge the hon. member for Sandton to give me the names of players in South Africa, both Black and non-White, who cannot reach the highest rung of the ladder. I should like to hear their names. If sport administrators in South Africa would act within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s policy, we would have made much faster and far more progress than has been the case up to now. I believe it is essential that we should, on an occasion such as this, remind certain sport administrators in South Africa once again that they should not abuse their position, that they should not use their particular sport as a means of furthering their personal political views.</p>

<p>Therefore what I actually want to say is that they should not use their sport as an instrument for political propaganda. I do not begrudge any player or any sport administrator in South Africa his own political standpoint and his <span class="col_8055-8056" refersTo="page_1358"/>own participation in politics. Any such political participation, however, must be exercised outside the sporting arena, and not within it. I am convinced that this is possible, should we bear a few things in mind. The first thing which we must bear in mind, when we are discussing sport, is that the practice of sport is a gift which man receives. Therefore it is a pity that this gift should be dragged into the political arena. It is a gift which is designed to give one a healthy, fit and strong body. Such a body will also accommodate a healthy spirit. Two things are of the utmost importance for every South African&#x2014;Black, White and Brown&#x2014;namely, a healthy body and a sound mind. In essence, sport is also a form of relaxation. I know that we cannot eliminate the element of competition. I believe it is very good that this should be so, but sport is relaxation for the body and the spirit; something which in its turn aims at a higher productivity. It also aims at bringing about greater determination, greater resilience and greater preparedness.</p>

<p>However, there is something else which we must bear in mind. This is that sport has an tremendous influence on the relationship between people and between nations. I believe that sport offers a form of communication, communication which builds bridges of friendship and which promotes mutual respect. Sport offers the opportunity for encounter. I want to state that it is not necessary to draw a line through our traditional practice of sport. It is not necessary to do this in order to meet one another. Nor is it necessary for White, Black and Brown to participate in one team in order to meet one another. However, we must continue to practise our sport as we have been doing. We must continue to receive the New Zealand Rugby team in South Africa. We must afford them the opportunity of playing against a Bantu team, a Coloured team, against the Whites, as well as the opportunity of playing against an invitation team. What more do we want? Should we now intermingle at every opportunity? Is this necessary? Should we integrate our lives? After all, we can continue to practise sport in the same way as we did before. We can find one another, can meet one another in the same process.</p>

<p>I believe that sport in South Africa is a powerful factor for bringing together the peoples of this country; by means of which the people of this country can be brought together. But then the Opposition parties must keep politics out of sport &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I only made that statement to determine whether hon. members of the Opposition are still awake; whether they are still here. Their voters would very much like to know whether they still exist.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is another matter to which I should like to refer. In South Africa approximately 10&#x0025; of the White population regularly participates in some or other form of organized sport extramurally. If we compare this figure with that of the Scandinavian countries, we note that they have already reached the 50&#x0025; mark. Therefore we are to a far greater extent a nation of spectators. I believe it is necessary to encourage all the thousands of spectators throughout the country to participate regularly in some or other form of physical activity themselves. Our endeavour in South Africa should be &#x2026;</p>

<p>Our endeavour in South Africa should be to inspire the large crowd of spectators at sports meetings to mass participation in some or other form of physical activity. Our people should not simply sit on the grandstand. It must also be made possible for them to participate themselves. I believe that this opportunity already exists today. However, I also believe that the authorities should pay attention to this matter and that a national committee should even be created, a committee which can do research on how everyone in South Africa may be afforded an opportunity to participate in sport in order to keep the body fit and the spirit healthy.</p>

<p>First of all, he tells us that it is the policy of the NP to bring sport into their political concept, but at the same time he asks us not to talk about politics in sport. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I remember&#x2014;and I have a longer memory than the hon. member&#x2014;a nation who brought sport largely into its politics before the Second World War. That was something which only ended in tragedy. I cannot see how dragging sport into politics can do us any good. The more sport can be kept out of politics the better. [Interjections.] Let it not be said that I have joined the &#x201C;dank-die-Minister-koor&#x201D;. However, I think it would be very petty of me if I did not pay tribute to this hon. Minister and his department for the part they played in making the world bowls championship turn out the great success it was. [Interjections.] It is only just and appropriate that the oldest and most sociable of all organized games should have been chosen for that famous and historical occasion. We are also very mindful of this hon. Minister&#x2019;s and his department&#x2019;s work in the interests of the paraplegic bowlers. We are most grateful to him for the help he has given them. We only hope that we may count on his assistance in future.</p>

<p>In the annual report of the Department of Sport and Recreation&#x2014;Item 11(a), on page 21&#x2014; it is acknowledged that a great need exists for harbour facilities for pleasure craft. That is most gratifying. However, it is not good having this admission, without some action being taken. I trust that we are going to see some action taken in this respect. We therefore look to this most capable hon. Minister to secure the necessary funds from the most reluctant Treasury in order to achieve this aim. [Interjections.] One shudders to think of the trouble which the hon. the Minister of Finance is piling up for himself by all the work he is back-dating and through all the promises he is making. Nevertheless we do hope that funds will be forthcoming so shortly. My purpose this evening is really to establish the priority of Natal South Coast once funds become available. I do not do this for selfish reasons, because the benefit of this facility will not only be shared by us, but by fishermen from the Transvaal and the Free State, as well as boat owners. This will also inculcate in our young people a love for the sea and an understanding of the sea, as we live in a country with one of the longest coastlines in the world. We have seen a remarkable growth in the ski-boat population on the South Coast. This is not only because of the growing love for the sea and the sport, but also because of the loss of the Mozambique coast and those very famous beaches. The South Coast is far different to the Cape coast, because on the Cape coast there are many small, sheltered bays, whereas on the Natal coast for instance between Durban and Port St. Johns, there is not one single sheltered bay. On the lower South Coast, within a distance of 50 miles, there is not even five miles of sandy beach which could be used for the launching of ski-boats and which could also be used for people who want to swim. It should be noted that in this 50 miles there are about 450 resident boat owners, but during the season this boat owner population swells to anything from 2 000 to 5 000. Imagine what can happen on a busy summer&#x2019;s day on these very limited beaches when 20 000 to 30 000 bathers get mixed up with 2 000 to 3 000 ski-boats. It is not only the capital investment that is involved here, although 2 000 ski-boats at an average price of R2 000 represent a great <span class="col_8059-8060" refersTo="page_1360"/>deal of money. It is, however, also the sporting facility that is lost if these boats cannot be used. To use these boats, launching facilities are required at the best open, sandy beaches. Most of the popular sandy beaches are equipped with off-shore anti-shark nets. These beaches are crowded with women and children who are bathing at the time these boats want to take off. The only time one uses a ski-boat is on a nice quiet day when people want to swim, and unfortunately, we have not been able to arrange it in any other way. I am sure that if the National Party were in control in Natal, they would probably make some arrangement. There are one or two little bays which are used by ski-boats, but these are virtually taken over by ski-boat clubs which have a limited membership and which cannot take more members because of the limited space available.</p>

<p>The local authorities who have control of these beaches are becoming more and more worried about the use of these beaches by ski-boats because of the inherent danger involved in trying to launch a ski-boat in the surf when people are bathing, particularly when the people who are trying to launch the ski-boat are not fully conversant with the danger that is involved, particularly when they are taking off. Coming in is not so difficult, but when these boats take off many spills are seen and these very powerful boats with their two outboard motors can cause severe injuries amongst people. It is becoming a problem to such an extent that many of the local authorities are trying to ban ski-boats from their beaches. There is also the added nuisance of the cars and the trailers they use to tow these boats. These vehicles plough up the beaches and they go rushing through the bathers, and on top of this, they take up the very limited parking space that is available on the beaches.</p>

<p>In many cases the underlying reason is the lack of control over these ski-boats and their crews. Many of the boats are not seaworthy and are poorly equipped. Many others are owned and operated by persons who have little or no knowledge of the sea or of the safety measures that should be taken when going to sea. Some form of control is urgently required and there must be some method of exercising this control. This can only be done from a controlled area. For all these reasons it is now very necessary that a ski-boat launching area is established, and there would be nothing better than a sheltered harbour built for this purpose which could be under the control of somebody who would then exercise control to see that the boats are properly equipped and that the people know what they are doing. There is added expense too, as we have seen lately, because not only are boats involved in accidents at sea; they also get lost, and a very expensive search or rescue operation has to be organized. The local authorities are becoming more and more reluctant to take part in these rescue operations because of the cost involved.</p>

<p>The first problem is the question of whom one negotiates with. I suggest that the hon. the Minister should take the first step in this respect. The local authorities are reluctant to negotiate, the province is reluctant to take on this added burden, and the only people who in my opinion can take on this burden is the organization which is responsible for coordinating all the activities of the power-boat clubs in South Africa, namely the S.A. Power Boating Association. This association cannot of course force people to join it. However, if this association were to become the body through which the hon. the Minister would be prepared to negotiate to find a suitable launching site, and if the association would then be prepared to control this particular area, then I am sure that ski-boat owners would join the association. I ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not bring his many charms and his much-vaunted influence to bear on these people, and ask them to proceed along these lines to enable as many members as possible to be enrolled.</p>

<speech by="#niemann">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. NIEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have seldom in my life agreed to wholeheartedly with anyone as I agree with the hon. member for South Coast, not only in regard to the beginning of his speech, but in regard to its content as well. In particular, I want to thank the hon. member for having expressed thanks and appreciation towards the hon. the Minister and his department from the UP side. One so seldom hears any appreciation expressed by the Opposition for what is done by hon. Ministers and their departments. I too want to thank the Cabinet for having decided in its wisdom that harbour facilities for pleasure boats will henceforth fall under the Department of Sport and Recreation. It was a wise decision and a step in the right direction.</p>

<p><span class="col_8061-8062" refersTo="page_1361"/>The second matter concerning which I think the Cabinet should take a decision very soon is the allocation of funds to the Department of Sport and Recreation. It appears from the annual report&#x2014;and the hon. member for Green Point has already referred to this&#x2014;that the grant-in-aid for the provision of basic sport and recreational facilities amounted to only R200 000 in respect of 100 applications, while the total amount applied for by the 100 applicants amounted to more than R8 million. This shows that there is a tremendous need and a shortage of funds on the part of the Department of Sport and Recreation. As far as my own constituency is concerned, I received two applications for assistance of this nature, one from Barkly West and the other from a sports club in Kimberley, the Pirates Rugby Club. These applications amounted to more than R200 000. If the Government really wants to render meaningful assistance, quite a few millions of rand will have to be allocated to this department.</p>

<p>The subject of pleasure boats has often been raised in this House in the past, and it has been raised again tonight. A great deal has been said about yachting in South Africa, with particular reference to what it means to South Africa in many fields, as an important source of foreign exchange, for example, and as a tourist attraction. I could go on mentioning one example after another. If there was a problem in respect of facilities for yachts or pleasure boats two years ago, then I want to give hon. members the absolute assurance that there is a much greater need at the moment because there are more boats than there were two years ago. There is a desperate need for berths, not only on the Natal South Coast at Durban, but especially along our Cape coast. Since the hon. member for South Coast referred to the position in Natal, I shall leave it at that. Yet I do want to refer to it in passing by saying that the Durban harbour is overcrowded and that there is no room for further berths for yachts or for pleasure boats. If the mooring facilities were to be expanded, for example, to provide a further 72 berths, the dredging costs would amount to more than R300 000. In the Cape Town harbour, the position is just as bad, because the boats are lying side by side. For this reason, we are very grateful for the fact that a project study has been undertaken for the eventual construction of a harbour for pleasure boats at Grainger Bay. However, once again a start is made with a small amount of R100 000. I am sorry that the hon. the Minister of Finance is not in the House at the moment to hear how we are pleading the case of this department and asking for a little more money from him. We cannot argue that those who take part in yachting and boating do so only for their own pleasure and that consequently they must bear all costs themselves. The provision of harbour facilities is extremely expensive. The cost will vary from one place to another, of course, depending on the nature of the terrain and on the effect of the surf.</p>

<p>However, I want to point out that the construction of a slipway alone can cost between R30 000 and R50 000. A slipway with slipway cradle can cost between R70 000 and R100 000. These figures do not include the cost of sheltering walls, roads, drainage within the harbour areas, fencing, offices, toilets and other essential buildings. In many cases, project studies will be required. This in itself is an expensive item, and a project such as the one at Rumbly Bay, which will include a slipway, sheltering wall, windlass and access roads, is expected to involve a total cost of R256 000. Everywhere along our coast, from the south-western coast up to the Natal coast, there is a struggle at all the holiday resorts to enable the owners of ski-boats to launch their boats. There is a shocking lack of facilities, and I want to agree with the hon. member for South Coast that a start should be made by the divisional councils and municipalities. They should ascertain needs, in consultation with the Department of Sport and Recreation, and they should then try to provide these facilities in the immediate future. I shall leave this subject at that, for my time is running out.</p>

<p>I also want to refer briefly to the events at Newlands during the past long weekend, on the occasion of the interversity between our southern universities. This is a matter of great concern to me and for this reason I feel that I must mention it here. I must refer with the greatest contempt to the behaviour of some students at Newlands on Monday. From all quarters, by spectators and by students, the incident has been sharply criticised. I am not a narrow-minded person; I like students to have fun, but I cannot defend rowdy behaviour by students in public. I can only condemn it in the strongest language.</p>

<p>It was not only Stellenbosch, it was the Ikeys as well. However, I do not want us to level any reproaches; I want us to learn a lesson from this. We are about to have a tour by the All Blacks, who will travel all over the country. They will be accompanied by literally hundreds of supporters from New Zealand. If we do not appeal to the rugby unions to see to it that no people are allowed to appear on the field before any match, there can very easily be incidents which will harm the good name of South Africa, its rugby players and its spectators. I want to appeal to the rugby unions to take precautions against mass hysteria on the field before the start of the All Black tour.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say that I agree with the hon. member for Kimberley South. Having served on the executive of one of the provincial rugby bodies for several years, I know the problems experienced in the Transvaal with spectator control. As far as I know, the rugby authorities are giving very serious attention to that. On the other hand, I believe that we should not exclude children from the playing enclosure of the fields.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised the question of Intervarsity and in this connection I should like to put one very serious question to the hon. the Minister. What plan has this hon. Minister in mind to resurrect the rugby of Stellenbosch University after its defeat? I trust that the hon. the Minister has a plan in mind, because the national catastrophe &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley South spoke about the allocation of moneys. I am very glad that he raised this matter, because I should like to give the House some of the figures which we have extracted during the past few months. Earlier this year the following question was put to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What amounts were paid from public funds in each of the past five financial years to further sport amongst the Indian population of the Republic?</block>

<p>The following answers were given&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">1970, R834; 1971, R10 000; 1972, R890; 1973, R2 000; 1974, R7 400 and 1975, R1 200.</block>

<p>This amounts to a total of some R22 724 over a period of six years, i.e. an average of R3 787 a year. If one looks at the question in regard to the Coloureds, the position looks slightly different. The amounts were: In 1970, R50 000; 1972, R39 000; 1973, R82 000; 1974, R137 000 and 1975, R333 000. This gives a total of R643 000, i.e. an average of R128 798 a year. If one tries to obtain the figures for the Black population of South Africa, it is not quite so easy. The figures are somewhat more obscure, their funds emanating from different sources, e.g. from the S.A. Bantu Trust, from the profit from the sale of liquor, from the Bantu Administration Boards, a few local authorities and of course from charity gifts made through the S.A. Bantu Sport and Recreation Fund. It looks however as if it is running at the present time at something like R&#x00BD; million or a bit more being spent per year out of Government funds on Black sport.</p>

<p>If one looks at the answers to questions Nos. 113 and 114 put earlier this year, one will see that the Government spent a direct sum of R1 217 612 on White sport, excluding enormous indirect sums, donations and sponsorships, which ran into millions in so far as White sport is concerned. I should like now to make a few what may be grotesque comparisons. While the Department of Sport spent R1 217 612 in 1975 in assisting and promoting White sport, only R1 200 was spent by the Department of Indian Affairs out of public funds to assist Indian sport during the same period. If one looks at the figures, the sum of R42 600, was spent on White gymnastics. On waterskiing the sum of R39 000. These two sports are participated in South Africa, according to answers to questions given this year, by only 300 and 500 White persons respectively. And all this money was paid out of public funds. More money, therefore, was spent on these two little sports, gymnastic and waterskiing, than the money spent to cover all 65 plus kinds of sports for the entire Indian population. Comparisons of expenditure in specific kinds of sport with regard to money spent on Blacks and Coloureds are equally odious and disadvantageous to all except the White group.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has said on several <span class="col_8065-8066" refersTo="page_1363"/>occasions that international competition is open to members of all races. This fact was reiterated, I think, by the hon. member for Oudtshoorn a little while ago. This is true. All races have in fact competed in international sport recently. In 1975, 331 Bantu, 135 Coloureds, 58 Asiatics and 6 393 Whites competed in international events. And now, to read further the answer to this particular question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My department is also aware that in respect of quite a number of sport types non-Whites participated in eliminating contests, but could not attain the goal to participate in international tournaments.</block>

<p>What the department is actually saying is that there were many more people who were eligible but they did not attain the standard required in order to enable them to take part in international sports. The question I ask is: Why is this? What chance is there of this deficiency, which has been admitted to by the department quite willingly, being remedied and overcome in the short term and even in the long term? I say that one cannot remedy the deficiency &#x2026;</p>

<p>This deficiency&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My department is also aware that in respect of quite a number of sport types non-Whites participated in eliminating contests, but could not attain the relevant standards.</block>

<p>The fact is that the standards of the non-Whites are far below the standards of the Whites. What I want to know is how we are going to go about trying to remedy these. I say that one cannot remedy it while large sums of money for development, training and coaching are available only to one group. Development in the other groups will, in this way, be restricted. Unless there is competition between the races, one cannot expect the less skilled races to raise themselves. Mr. Wimpie de Klerk of the <i>Transvaler,</i> who has a relative in the House agrees with me. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dat die Swartes tans nog nie daartoe in staat is om ordentlike teenstand te bied teen gedugte mededingers nie, is geen gronde vir argument teen die speel van sulke wedstryde nie.</block>

<p>He was speaking about a cricket match that took place in Soweto against an international team&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wat saak maak, is dat hulle deur middel van gesonde wedywering gebrei moet word om by die boonste sport uit te kom. Dit kan slegs geskied as hulle die kans kry om op klubvlak teen Blankes te speel. Met gesonde beplanning en wedersydse samewerking kan ook so &#x2019;n proefneming daar slaag. Daarsonder sal Nieblanke-sport in elk geval gekniehalter bly.</block>

<p>This is what Wimpie de Klerk said. If we are going to have that equal opportunity in sport the hon. the Minister is so often talking about, we must realize that that phrase is in fact meaningless and bears no relation to the fact while these gross differences in expenditure in fact still continue to exist. Surely the time has come&#x2014;and here I want to support the hon. member for Green Point&#x2014;that the furtherance of sport by the Government should be overseen and co-ordinated by a single authority and not by four different departments. At the very least, positive steps should urgently be taken to ensure that Government moneys for this purpose are fairly distributed for the general good and not for the good of only one race.</p>

<p>This is not so impossible at all. The department has the information at its disposal of what is needed. It has not yet released it to the public, but the information is in its possession. It has a departmental section which already deals exclusively with non-White sport and thus can easily be converted to a broader base. Positively, I should like to say that it is in the hands of the Government now, with the equipment and information it has, to create a new era in sporting goodwill. It is in the hands of the hon. the Minister to open the doors to new standards of sport for all the races of South Africa. Negatively, however, I should like to say that if the present sorry state of affairs relating to completion and to the allocation of moneys and the discrimination which still exists in the department continues, <span class="col_8067-8068" refersTo="page_1364"/>we will never win the friendship of the Coloured, Indian and Black sportsmen of South Africa, nor will we find a true re-entry into the international sporting scene even remotely possible.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_sport_and_recreation">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if the hon. member wants to speak of a new era in sport, I may tell him straightaway that the NP and the National Government have already ushered in a new era for all the sportsmen and sportswomen in South Africa and that we have already made great progress in this regard. The beauty of the new era is that it rests upon firm foundations, that it is developing according to fixed patterns and that for this reason, it is following a proper, normal and evolutionary course of development. This is why it has not led to any incidents up to now. One is deeply grateful for this.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me what I was going to do to make Stellenbosch beat the Ikeys. This question reminded me of something which you will allow me to relate, Mr. Chairman, for we are dealing with sport, after all. The other day I went to a rugby match at Stellenbosch. Hon. members may know that Dr. Danie Craven has a dog called Bliksem. The dog ran up and down the field that afternoon. The rugby players are very scared of Dr. Craven, who was standing next to me at that moment. When a few of the rugby players arrived to go on the field and saw the dog, Bliksem, running about there, one of them said, &#x201C;Oh heavens, there is Bliksem; the thunder is not far off!&#x201D; Now I am very grateful, because it does not seem to me that either of those two elements is present in the debate! This testifies to the really good progress which is being made in sport in South Africa.</p>

<p>However, I believe that the hon. member for Sandton committed a serious error of reasoning in connection with the matter which he raised. If I understood the hon. member correctly, he said that the non-Whites would never qualify if they were not enabled to play against the Whites. That is what the hon. member said, I think. The hon. member alleged that they would not be able to qualify. I want to point out quickly to the hon. member how wrong he is, by mentioning just one case, that of soccer. As far as soccer is concerned, we have established by means of a scientific investigation in Soweto that 88&#x0025; of the inhabitants are interested in kicking a ball about and in soccer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>That is the only example.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not the only example. That same investigation also established that the interest taken in cricket in Soweto was 0,01&#x0025; and that the interest in rugby was 0,01&#x0025;. If 88&#x0025; of a million people are interested in soccer and they have games amongst themselves and they kick a ball about amongst themselves, the result is what we have seen, when those Blacks gave the best White team a beating on the soccer field on the last occasion. So it is not at all correct to proceed from this premise. If we analyse the matter further, we see that as far as other forms of sport such as cycling are concerned, the Bantu are very interested in these. They want to manage their own affairs, and this is something we must not forget or lose sight of. For this reason, when I say that we on this side of the House are normalizing sport in South Africa, I mean that we are doing something which is done by every other country in the world. I have spoken about this matter before in this House. How is this done by the Americans, the British, every other country and every other nation? They arrange for the people of their country to play amongst themselves, and when they have finished playing amongst themselves, they choose the best team and then they play against the other countries and nations. In our case it is just the same. The Transkei will become independent in October, and then it will be a country and a nation on its own. It is proper that they should play together and practise sport together. We say that our whole policy rests on a multinational basis. In this way we are normalizing sport in South Africa on these firm foundations.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I shall reply in detail&#x2014;I do not want to do so now&#x2014;to the questions about cricket, etc., that hon. members have asked me. However, I want to use the few minutes still available to me to express a word of thanks and appreciation and of great praise to the Secretary of the Department of Sport and Recreation in the first place. There we have a man who devotes his energies to sport day and night because he cares about it and because he <span class="col_8069-8070" refersTo="page_1365"/>takes an intense interest in it. Because this is so, he sets a splendid example which filters through to the officials all over the Republic. They are mostly young men, and I want to speak with the greatest appreciation here tonight of the officials who are in the service of sport in South Africa, I want to pay tribute to them and to thank them sincerely for their outstanding contribution and their achievements in connection with sport, and, therefore, in the interest of South Africa as well. Had it not been for them, it would not have been possible to achieve the success in sport which we have achieved.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to express a word of sincere thanks to the Opposition for the responsible way in which they are conducting this debate on sport. When one thinks of the position in connection with sport four years ago, and one looks at the position tonight, one is deeply grateful, and I am sincere in saying this and in conveying my thanks to the UP. I also want to express my thanks to the PRP for the responsible way in which they conducted the debate. I mean this, and I am an honest and a sincere man. I know what I am talking about and that is why I do this. It is fitting that it should be done and that I should do it.</p>

<p>In the third place, I want to express my great thanks and appreciation to the Press and the SABC in the Republic for the responsible way in which they handle the delicate matter of sport. Had it not been for this, the progress we have already made in connection with sport would have been impossible. The enemies of South Africa would then have achieved their objects with South Africa. But the unanimity and the assistance which is given behind the scenes are almost incredible. I am aware of this and I should be neglecting my duty if I should fail to express a word of heart-felt thanks and appreciation to the Press and to the radio and television in this connection.</p>

<p>Then, most important of all, I want to pay a very sincere tribute to members on my side of the House, the Nationalists of South Africa. I want to identify myself with what has been said by one of our great leaders, i.e. that great demands are made upon the Nationalists. There are few things that have made greater demands on the representatives of the NP than sport. Therefore I want to thank the men on my side of the House very sincerely for their assistance and understanding, for without it, the progress that has been made up to now would not have been possible. These are the men who have to go out and explain matters to the electorate, and this is not always easy. My friend on my right hand has often experienced this. When they ask him at a National Party meeting in the evening what the present sport policy is, he says: I last saw Piet Koornhof at nine o&#x2019;clock this morning, so I do not know what the sport policy is at the moment! That is the problem. The men who most deserve our thanks, therefore, are really the men on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Of course, I want to thank the sportsmen and sportswomen as well, and here I include the sport administrators of the Republic. Those people went through very difficult times, times in which they showed the greatest responsibility and circumspection on the sports grounds of the world and conducted themselves like true ambassadors for the Republic of South Africa. In a little while I shall furnish figures to indicate how we are really competing on an international level today, but first I want to ask a very simple question here tonight. In the four years I have been Minister of Sport and Recreation, when have we ever heard of any sportsman or sportswoman&#x2014;whether White or non-White&#x2014;who has been guilty of misconduct at an international sporting event? I have not heard of a single one. Therefore we must pay tribute to our White and non-White sportsmen and sportswomen. We may be proud of them, and of the administrators as well, for their beneficial influence and sacrifices, and we must remember that they receive no remuneration for this. They make great sacrifices. For this reason I thank them very sincerely. I get only the very best co-operation from White and non-White sportsmen. I am glad to be able to say this tonight, and it is necessary for me to do so, because the hon. member for Oudtshoorn and the hon. member for Kimberley South mentioned the fact that sport is an instrument which can be used for establishing good relations. The hon. member for Geduld spoke here of the report on Soweto in which it was said that the Black man believed that relations between White and non-White were improving. In their opinion, sport is the chief reason for this. No matter where I move&#x2014;whether among the Black people of Soweto, whether among the Indians of Natal, whether among the Coloured people of the Cape&#x2014;everywhere I get an ovation because of the appreciation <span class="col_8071-8072" refersTo="page_1366"/>they have for the progress there has been in the field of sport. So we must be grateful for this measure of goodwill which exists in South Africa as a result of sports relations.</p>

<p>Oh yes, undoubtedly. Now I should like to give an indication of how we have progressed on firm foundations in terms of a correct policy of national development among the various peoples. Forty-nine multi-national events took place in 15 different forms of sport. Between January 1976 and the end of March 1976, 25 multi-national events took place, and 22 multi-racial events have already been approved for the rest of this year. It is estimated that a further 25 such applications can be expected for multi-national events in forms of sport such as football, tennis, golf and boxing. This would bring the expected number of multi-national events for 1976 up to a total of 72, which would mean an increase of 30&#x0025;. Earlier this evening, the hon. member for Fauresmith mentioned the fact that in spite of the many multi-national events that have been held here in the Republic, there have been no incidents at any of these events. This is really a feather in the cap of the sportsmen, White and non-White, who have conducted themselves with the greatest responsibility at these multi-national events. I can tell you, Sir, and the Secretary for Sport and Recreation will bear this out, that there are very few of these events which I have not attended, and to see the Whites, the Blacks, the Coloureds and the Indians there, each of them representing his particular population group with so much dignity on the sports ground and away from it, is something which causes me to say, as I have said in public as well, that it gives one courage for the future, because it testifies to a reservoir of goodwill between the various races in the Republic of South Africa which is just waiting for further development. It is a wonderful thing which we must develop, because it augers well for us.</p>

<p>Therefore I endorse what has been said here by other hon. members about the importance of sport as a means, a God-given instrument, for establishing good relations in the Republic of South Africa. For this reason, Sir, I do not hesitate to say again tonight that none of the parties in this House should try to make politics out of sport. Therefore I am very grateful for the progress which is being made, and the progress is being made precisely because we have learnt to be responsible and to try not to make politics out of this matter.</p>

<p>Sir, I know a good deal about these matters. The sportsmen are my friends, and when I hear the hon. members opposite talking about cricket, etc., then I smile, because I know perfectly well&#x2014;and I say this with the greatest modesty&#x2014;that what they are still dreaming about, I knew three years ago. [Interjections.] It is absolutely true. The sport administrators come to cry on my shoulder, and we discuss matters very frankly. Where do hon. members think the events in respect of cricket originated? I am referring, for example, to the South African teams which played the team of Richie Benaud and the events on various fronts in connection with cricket. We maintain the closest contact when acting in this connection, and because these matters are extremely delicate, I want to say that it would not be possible to make any progress if there were to be a continual harping on political affairs and if the Press were to be mischievous. All kinds of interests are at stake. The Coloured people have their interests; some of them are threatened with death. I know this, because they come and tell me so, and then I feel as bad as they do, because it is a very bad thing for a man to be threatened with death, Sir. [Interjections.] Sir, one can see that none of the hon. members on that side has ever been threatened with death! [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#vlok">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to open the debate this morning on a very positive note, in consequence of a remark made by the hon. member for Bethlehem in this House yesterday evening. I want to assure the hon. member that I am convinced that Northern Transvaal is simply going to win the Currie Cup again this year! [Interjections.] Yesterday evening the hon. member for Sandton asked the hon. the Minister to do certain things, and I want to dwell on this for a moment. He asked, <i>inter alia,</i> that the hon. the Minister do his best to promote the interest of the cricket players and that the hon. the Minister try to bring about better relations as the ball allegedly was in the court of the Government. He also asked that the Government try to raise the standards of non-White sport. However, the hon. the Minister has been <span class="col_8075-8076" refersTo="page_1368"/>doing this for a long time. Since he has taken over this portfolio, he has seen this as his task and he is achieving resounding success in this regard. He is building bridges and improving relations. He is playing the ball. However, I want to ask the hon. member this: What is he and his party doing to help the hon. the Minister in this regard? What do they tell Mr. Howa and Mr. Middleton of Sacboc when they speak to them? Does everything have to come from our side alone? I think they, too, have a task of assisting us in this regard.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about a completely different matter, however, and that is the question of more financial aid for research, more specifically for research into recreation in South Africa. The appointment last year of a co-ordinator for sports research in the Republic, was an occurrence of which one took cognizance with much joy. I am referring to paragraph 11(b) of the Department&#x2019;s report. The further fact that sports research in South Africa which is being undertaken by universities and other bodies, is already yielding results in the sphere of sporting achievements for South Africa, is a gladdening aspect. In this regard I am referring to John van Reenen&#x2019;s world record in discus. The sports research which is being undertaken at present, is chiefly aimed at the physiology, mechanics and techniques of sport.</p>

<p>The department is also geared for rendering service to the people of South Africa in respect of recreation. For this reason I want to ask today that more attention be given to this aspect of the department&#x2019;s activities. With the increase in population amongst all our peoples here in South Africa, we are faced with the accomplished fact that our natural resources for recreation are disappearing. South Africa has areas with natural, attractive scenery, picturesque mountain ranges&#x2014;those of us who had the privilege of taking walks over the weekend, will be able to testify to this&#x2014; mineral baths, forests, woods, lakes and attractive beaches. These places are the heritage of our people and do not exist for individuals only. They ought to be protected and looked after like a jewel, for the present and future generations.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it is a reaction against increasing mechanization or an attempt to escape from the artificial atmosphere of city life, or whether it may be attributed to higher incomes or possibly to other reasons, but it remains a fact that during the last decade people throughout the world have shown an ever-increasing and unparalleled interest in those forms of recreation which bring them into contact with nature and life in the open air. Technology and the machine age have robbed us of many valuable creative opportunities. Manual labour is being replaced more and more by machines and we are drifting into a direction of physical decline, poor health and a lack of energy. Prosperity amongst the masses has led to the many attractions and temptations of harmful and degenerating forms of commercialized recreation being brought to the doorstep of most people. Particularly constructive recreation is the ideal and in many cases the only possible way of solving this multitude of problems. Nor are the benefits of wholesome recreation limited to providing compensation deficiencies of our times. Its rehabilitative and preventive characteristics in the sphere of crime, physical well-being and child safety have been proved time and time again by surveys and research in various countries. In the light of what I have already mentioned, I should like to address an appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider the establishment, as in the case of sports research, of a national advisory committee for recreation research. The Department of Sport and Recreation, of Planning and the Environment, of Tourism, of Water Affairs, of Forestry, of Agriculture, of Bantu Administration and Development, of Coloured Relations, of Indian Affairs as well as the provincial administrations and other bodies which the hon. the Minister may deem necessary, should have representation on that committee. In my opinion an urgent inquiry should be conducted into the recreational needs and facilities of South Africa, and in this I include all its population groups&#x2014;White, Brown and Black. What do we really know today about the recreational needs of the various population groups living here in South Africa? Very little in my opinion. Therefore I think it is essential that planning be undertaken on a national, provincial and urban basis for the recreational needs of everyone in South Africa, for the immediate future as well as for many years to come. We know this hon. Minister as a man who does more than talk; he also acts! Because this matter is of such importance to the well-being of our people, I have every confidence that he is also going to do something in this regard.</p>

<p>I should like to bring the debate back to the question of sport and politics in the world of today, of the year 1976. This subject is one which is often raised in this House. We hear remarks such as, &#x201C;Keep politics out of sport&#x201D; and &#x201C;Do not drag sport into politics&#x201D;. Only yesterday we often heard this type of thing in the debate. I know the subject of sport and politics is, from the nature of the case, a very delicate matter. I also know that one always has to approach this matter with calm responsibility, and I shall try to do this. For logical dialogue and debating it is essential that we agree with one another on three basic principles concerning the matter of sport and politics. Then we shall be able to conduct a logical dialogue. What are these three basic principles and facts? Firstly, there is no room at all in sport for petty party political gain, for narrow-minded party political manoeuvring and for the exploitation of sport for political gain. There is no room at all for this among sportsmen themselves, among politicians themselves and among politicians and sportsmen. We can all probably give examples of how we have participated in sport ourselves without our dragging politics into it. In 1957-&#x2019;58, in the backyard of the Regent Private Hotel, Pretoria, in view of a large number of Black workers and waiters and a large number of the residents I boxed against a Black man from Mamalodi. Surely one does not drag politics into something of this kind.</p>

<p>I can mention another example. I play cricket for the Parliamentary team. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is my president, the hon. member for Simonstown is my captain and the hon. member for Pinelands my team mate. [Interjections.] But thank heaven, Piet Koornhof is still my Minister!</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. the Minister made certain remarks about newspapers which I support wholeheartedly. I must say I do not have much of a choice. The hon. the Minister will probably forgive me for saying that there are the unfortunate exceptions as well. I should just like to point out one example. Last year on 7 July we had a match at Newlands between an invitation team and the French. A Sunday newspaper had banner headlines on its front page the following morning. I do not hold this against the newspaper because it was a great historical occurrence. One could say it was the sporting event of the year. There was also a lovely big photograph. Everything was very nice. Below the photograph, however, there was a short report and I should like to quote some of it. The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was enough to make any verkrampte shudder. Rugby, South Africa&#x2019;s traditional game and the last bastion of sporting apartheid, had finally gone multi-racial, albeit briefly as a token only.</block>

<p>I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Today the four men who played for the South African invitation fifteen against France returned home knowing that they had been part of a little bit of history in the making. In their kitbags were jerseys reminding them of their brief break from apartheid.</block>

<p>And then the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was back to their own group areas, to carrying a pass, to separate sport; the gates of apartheid are closed behind them.</block>

<p>I say this is petty politicking, an attempt to make petty political capital out of sport. What do the sportsmen themselves say? In the same report the following appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But each one&#x2014;Cushe, a clerk, Tsotsobe, a tyre factory worker, Noble, a messenger and Shields, a truck driver, told me in his own sincere way: &#x201C;I am very proud to be part of this. &#x2019; &#x2019;</block>

<p>The opinions of the sportsmen themselves are a sharp contrast to the pettiness of a newspaper reporter who does not want to see the matter in the correct light. I shall leave it at that as far as this aspect is concerned, except to say that the first important matter is to ban this type of pettiness from our sport.</p>

<p>The second fact I want to state is that the <span class="col_8079-8080" refersTo="page_1370"/>ideal, although it is something of a Utopian ideal, is to separate sport and politics completely from one another. We must strive after that deal, everyone must strive after it and I am completely in favour of it. I say it is idealism. However, idealism must be accompanied by realism. The important point which I want to make, is that throughout the world&#x2014;no matter whether we like it or not&#x2014;the position is that a country&#x2019;s policy and system of government have a connection with sport. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South quoted Prof. Gert Scholtz yesterday evening. I am not in complete agreement with certain of Prof. Scholtz&#x2019;s political views, but the fact remains that he is an expert in the field of sport and politics. I quote him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar presies wanneer ontstaan daar bemoeienis tussen politiek en sport? Presies wanneer is hierdie bemoeienis ongewens? As die Amerikaanse sport die kenmerke adem van die demokraties-kapitalistiese regeringstelsel van daardie land, is daar dan sprake van politieke inmenging? Of as die Russiese of Oos-Duitse stelsels deur en deur in harmonie verkeer met die kommunisme van hul onderskeie lande, beteken dit dat politiek in sport figureer? Hierdie vorm van bemoeienis moet as gebruiklik deurgaan want die sport het hier geen ander keuse en verantwoordelikheid as om te gedy in samehang met die politiek-staatkundige gebruike van die land waarin dit bedrywe word nie.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daarteenoor kan mens nie van die werklikheid af wegkom dat die sport en die politiek-staatkundige bestel van elke land nou met mekaar vervleg is nie.</block>

<p>Therefore, what I am saying, is that we must accept these principles and realize that in the world of today sport cannot be separated 100&#x0025; from politics. This type of policy of: &#x201C;Leave sport 100&#x0025; to the sportsmen and politics 100&#x0025; to the politicians,&#x201D; simply cannot work. It is nothing more than a pipe dream. It is really not realistic. We cannot discuss sport on the basis that sport and politics have nothing to do with each other. On the contrary. The two have a great deal to do with each other.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. the Minister, the department and the sportsmen and women of South Africa most sincerely for what they are doing to keep South Africa in world sport and to have us readmitted to those types of sport from which we have been expelled in world sport. Hon. members have pointed out the very important role which sport is playing in the world. The hon. members for Oudtshoorn and Geduld went into this matter very extensively yesterday evening. They referred to the motto &#x201C;a healthy mind in a healthy body&#x201D; and to the good human relations which sport promoted. I say that sport is the sphere in which people of different languages, faiths and views may meet and associate with one another without&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014;their surrendering their own identities or sharing political power over themselves with others.</p>

<p>I conclude by pointing out one example of what world sport is doing. Last year in October the body-building world championships were held in Pretoria. On that occasion a television film of 25 minutes was made. The film was shown to 500 million viewers throughout the world. A third of the time of a large American firm&#x2019;s sports programme was devoted to this film. I quote from what one Mr. Van der Vet, editor of the well-known Dutch <i>Algemenen Dagblad</i> wrote. This editor undertook a tour of our country and subsequently published a series of articles in that newspaper over a period of three months. He wrote very positively about South Africa and I should like to quote the third paragraph of his first article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In dat (viersterren)-hotel was een wereldcongres van &#x201C;body-builders&#x201D; aan de gang. Een zeer veelvolkig gezelschap van spierballen-vertoonders uit vele landen: blanke en bruine en gele en zwarte spierbundels spanden zich bij &#x2019;t hanig lopen onder ultra-nauwe broekjes en hemdjes. Nog maar een paar jaar geleden zou zoiets in Zuid-Afrika onmogelijk zijn geweest.</block>

<p>This sporting event was not arranged with political motives. This body-builders&#x2019; congress was not arranged for political gain, but the fact of the matter is that it has had an enormous effect throughout the world. The fight between the Black Bob Forster and the White Pierre Fourie and the fight between the Black Richie Kates and the White Galindez&#x2014;I must say Galindez is a little &#x201C;off-white&#x201D;&#x2014;meant <span class="col_8081-8082" refersTo="page_1371"/>a great deal to South Africa all over the world. I say it was worth millions of rands to us, although the fights were not arranged for political purposes. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the course of his speech the hon. member for Kmgersdorp referred to the relationship between sports and politics. He has certain specific views in this connection. I think it is fair to say that sportsmen are not interested in politics. They are not politicians. There may be a few individuals who later go into politics for one reason or another, but basically when they are sportsmen, they are sportsmen and not politicians and they could not care less about what is going on in the political world. They are more interested in playing the game and in seeing how far they can get in the sport of their particular choice. On the other hand, there are newspapers and politicians who are also interested in sport. They are interested in sport for obvious reasons. Sport in South Africa plays an enormously important part in our social life. However, some politicians and newspapers are also interested in sport for ulterior motives. They use sport for their own particular objectives. I think it is high time politicians kept their noses out of sport as far as possible. I must concede that, while I think it is a generally accepted principle that sports administrators should run their own affairs and that sportsmen should get on with the game, there has to be a certain amount of control on the part of any Government of any country over the exercise of sporting authority. However, I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that such interference as there is&#x2014;I do not like using that word&#x2014;such interaction as there is between governmental bodies and sports bodies, should be kept to an absolute minimum. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that I think that in so far as he is concerned, he has built up a good relationship with most sporting bodies in South Africa as far as I can see. I commend him for that. I think it is important that the hon. the Minister should never lose sight of the fact that sportsmen must get on with the game they have chosen to play, that the sports administrators must run those games and that there should be as little interference, or even interaction, as possible between governmental bodies and sports bodies.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with two matters. The first is the question of the new responsibility of the Minister and his department for the building of small boat harbours. I do not have to repeat again what I have said so often in the House, viz. that it is vitally important not only for strategic reasons but also for recreational reasons that there should be more controlled outlets to the sea than there are at present. Quite apart from that, there is the dangerous situation to which reference has often been made in the House, viz. that a great many people take to sea in small boats which are not really suitable for going to sea in. They go with inadequate equipment and inadequate apparatus. I wish to deal now with the recreational aspect. The hon. the Minister must realize that there are hundreds of thousands of South Africans who take part these days in aquatic sports in the marine sphere and who did not take part before. This involves a growing international sport. Therefore it can be of great benefit to us in an international sense if we provide sports facilities for fishing and small-boating off our coasts.</p>

<p>Talking of the Cape alone, it seems to me that there are two distinct areas for small boat harbours. On the one hand, there is the False Bay area and on the other hand there are the Hermanus and Mossel Bay coastal areas. I would say that Mossel Bay should cater for the South-Western area. In so far as False Bay is concerned, there is an investigation under way at the moment by his department into the best sites for small boat harbours. The hon. the Minister is an educated man. He took Latin at university!! I want to tell him that he must remember the old Latin saying, <i>quot homines tot sententiae</i>. Therefore the hon. the Minister must give a lead in this matter. He cannot wait for every single sports body and individual to come to him to ask for a harbour to be built at a particular site. He must get on with the job. In this connection I want to say to him that he cannot do better than consult the engineer of Viscor, Mr. Grobbelaar, who has made an intensive study over many years of possible harbours along the west coast and along the south-western coast. Naturally, he has come to the conclusion that Kalk Bay is the best site in the False Bay for such a harbour! In addition to Mr. Grobbelaar&#x2019;s own expert assessment, there are surveys that have been carried out since the beginning of the century by various marine engineers into the most <span class="col_8083-8084" refersTo="page_1372"/>suitable sites for small boat harbours. I would hate the subcommittee that has been appointed to waste its time with investigations when the work has in fact already been done and he could be using the expertise of Mr. Grobbelaar and his department.</p>

<p>May I now refer to a different matter altogether. I have said earlier that I believe sport should, as far as possible, be left in the hands of the sport administrators. I, therefore, advocated that there should be no interference. However, there are certain aspects of sport which, I believe, must be ventilated here in Parliament and I am going to ventilate a couple of them today. I want to start with the administrators of sport. As I see things, there has been an enormous increase in the number of people who have become sport administrators over the years. They now have blazers and ties of their own; they attend official functions; they run into tens, if not into hundreds, in some of our major sports, and I believe the situation is getting out of hand. I believe that there are far too many people who have been given privileges or prerequisites in the sporting sphere as sport administrators; far too many of them for the efficient handling of the sports concerned. One may think, for example, of the expense of entertainment with the vast number of administrators and&#x2014;if I may put it crudely&#x2014;their hangers-on, all of them attending entertainment given by various sporting bodies, which amounts to an increase in the costs of the administration of sport. As a result, this has to be passed on to the public. The public has to pay ridiculously high admission prices for rugby matches, cricket matches and other sporting matches. It is because of a sort of sports bureaucracy that is developing, particularly in the field of administration. It also leads to&#x2014;what I think is a most unhealthy development in sport&#x2014;the unhealthy dependence on advertising. One now goes to watch sport and one is constantly embarrassed by the apparent necessity to advertise goods and particular products in order to obtain financial contributions for the administrators to be used for the exercise of their sport. This, in turn, leads to exhibitionism among both administrators, referees, umpires and players themselves. In connection with the players I wish to say that there is a most unhealthy tendency developing in South Africa, of players of all sports embracing and kissing each other after scoring a goal or a try, as the case may be. That is something completely foreign to our sport and it is part of the general exhibitionism which is engendered by advertising to finance sport.</p>

<p>Referees and umpires are there to enforce the rules of the game they and the players that are playing love. For goodness sake, cannot the referees take their courage in their hands and say that when a man is guilty of dirty play he must be sent off the field without any more ado? If a referee does take that decision it should be incumbent on the administrators of that particular sport to back up the decision of the only man in a position to take such a decision, namely the referee or the umpire.</p>

<p>As regards decisions of referees and umpires, I must say that I am horrified&#x2014;when watching a game of rugby or cricket&#x2014;to see players protesting against a decision given by the umpire or by the referee. I believe that the vast bodies of administrators which exist now in the field of sport, should give very earnest attention to such matters as these, namely the discipline of the players under their control, the enforcement of decisions by umpires and referees and, what is more, looking after the cutting down of expenditure by themselves in the administration of their sport.</p>

<speech by="#hoon">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. HOON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree with the hon. member for Simonstown, especially with regard to the last part of his speech, which dealt with referees. We do find that the players often act very critically towards a referee in a match. Sometimes one also hears many snide remarks about the referee from the spectators on the stands. I want to endorse the ideas expressed by the hon. member for Simonstown. I agree with him and I also believe that a player on the field must accept that the person appointed to ensure fair play on the sportsfield, give decisions that must be respected.</p>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. the Minister and say that I am very grateful for the fact that very little fuss has been made during this debate about politicking in sport. I believe the fact that so little criticism has been expressed is due to the fact that the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation has been handling this division of his department in a very brilliant way for the past few years.</p>

<p>Today I want to refer to another division of the department which, in my opinion, is of far greater importance to the interests of South <span class="col_8085-8086" refersTo="page_1373"/>Africa than the politics which are practised here in Parliament, in the newspapers and abroad in order to get at South Africa. I am referring to the function of the Department of Sport and Recreation of creating a strong, healthy and fit nation in South Africa. Here are two quotations from the report of the Department of Sport and Recreation which are very important to me. On page 8 I read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Republic the term &#x201C;sport&#x201D; is automatically coupled with competition and rivalry. It is estimated that outside the school context a mere 10&#x0025; of the country&#x2019;s White population participates in some form of organized sport.</block>

<p>The other quotation on page 2 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is also fitting to refer in this report to the progress which has been made in making South Africans more conscious of national fitness and to encourage them to become a nation of participants rather than mere spectators.</block>

<p>It is really shocking to learn that in South Africa only 10&#x0025; of the Whites participate in some form of sport. Never before has it been as essential as it is now to make our nation aware of the absolute necessity of physical fitness. The principle of &#x201C;a healthy mind in a healthy body&#x201D;, has never been as true and essential as at this very time. The fast pace of modern life makes extremely high demands on the intellectual ability of people. The intellectual and physical abilities of people are not contradictory, but complementary. What do we find in practice today? In our movement-bereft working lives in which growing intellectual demands are made on us, our physical abilities are wasting away and intellectual abilities must necessarily suffer because of this. I think everyone in this House and everyone in South Africa should ask themselves whether we are not using our bodies, the temples of God, merely as a hanger for fine clothes. Is modern man not inclined to confine our physical activities to pressing a button in order to reach our office on the fifteenth floor? Are we not, as the hon. the Minister of Agriculture rightly said&#x2014;digging our graves with our teeth at fancy luncheons, dinners and functions? When we look at what is happening around us and when we observe the physical and spiritual attacks launched at our nation, then we can say without any fear of contradiction that what South Africa needs on its road ahead is a people which must be physically strong and healthy, spiritually strong and motivated and prepared and able to meet the challenges of the future. In order to point out where one finds one of the most important training grounds for the young man and woman whom South Africa needs on its road ahead, I quote the following from the confession of a famous sportsman&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sport het my onteenseglik geleer dat die sportveld die kweekakker van my karakter is. Dit is die plek waar ek geleer het om die oorwinning oor myself te behaal, die oorwinning oor my menslike drange om altyd minder te wil doen en toe te gee and di&#x00E9; drange wat nie tuishoort by &#x2019;n ontwikkelde mens nie. Deur toewyding en doelgerigtheid het ek geleer dat &#x2019;n mens alles in die lewe kan bekom as jy net wil, maar om te wil, moet daar ook entoesiasme wees. Dit is die suurdeeg wat jou hoop laat styg, die vonkel in jou oog, die veerkrag in jou stap, die greep van jou hand. Dit is die onweerstaanbare drang om jou idees uit te voer. Entoesiaste is vegters en hulle het die geloof en moed om aan te hou. Entoesiasme is die fondament van alle vooruitgang. Met dit is daar verwesenliking en sonder dit, net verskonings en teleurstellings. Wanneer my drange om terug te sit, geneig is om te se&#x00EB;vier, het ek steeds volhard, want ek het geweet dat dit &#x2019;n wonderlike gevoel is om teen &#x2019;n sterk wind aan te beur en vooruitgang te maak ten spyte van sy krag. Maar ek het ook geweet dat &#x2019;n innerlike oorwinning my doelwit is en om te kan se&#x00EB;vier oor my sielsvyande, het my &#x2019;n gevoel van oorwinning gegee wat &#x2019;n duisend maal heerliker is.</block>

<p>And then he comes to the most important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daarom het ek die sportveld as die belangrikste kweekakker van my karakter beskou, nie om te kan wen nie, maar om meester van my siel te kan wees.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister and his department deserve the highest praise for their dynamic attempts over the past number of years to activate our people and to inspire us to become <span class="col_8087-8088" refersTo="page_1374"/>a nation of participants instead of a nation of spectators. In this connection I have in mind particularly the success achieved by the national fitness scheme under the guidance of the department. The department has only 64 professional officers who do the work, but in spite of that the department offered 2 003 projects in 1975 which represented an increase of 62,7&#x0025; on those of the previous year. In 1975 there were 124 065 participants involved in the 2 003 projects whereas projects in the previous year involved only 65 000 participants. This is an increase of 88&#x0025;.</p>

<p>However, in order to participate there must be facilities, or facilities must be made available, facilities which, in the words of the well-known athlete, moulded his character. We welcome the investigation into the state of sport and physical recreation amongst the population groups of South Africa which was conducted under the chairmanship of Mr. Beyers Hoek, the Secretary for Sport and Recreation. The investigation also covered the utilization of sports facilities. I want to put it on record today that we are grateful for the amount of R200 000 made available by the Department of Sport and Recreation to sports clubs for the creation of sports facilities. We want to express the hope&#x2014;and together with the hon. member for Kimberley South I want to say that it is a pity that the hon. the Minister of Finance is not here&#x2014;that with the benevolence of the hon. the Minister of Finance the amount to which I have just referred will be increased substantially in future.</p>

<p>However, I also want to say that we should see to the utilization of the existing facilities. There are real problems for the ordinary man who would like to get fit. Either he has to jog in the street, or he has to get into his car and drive a considerable distance before he reaches an area where he can practise. If he wants to join a gymnasium, it will cost him R10 or R20 per month at the moment and now I pose the question: How many school gymnasiums are not being used in the evenings and during school holidays? I am convinced of the fact that it is high time that sports and recreational centres be established for the convenience of the public. Has the time not also arrived for staff to be appointed who are qualified to accept the responsibility for a centre of this kind? A further question: Is adequate use being made of the sportsfields and gymnasiums of educational institutions throughout South Africa and of the services of their coaches? Since the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation is also the Minister of National Education, I want to ask him whether he and his two departments could not perhaps bring about a practical arrangement making these facilities available to the public as well.</p>

<p>I should like to quote from a book by Dr. J. W. Postma, a former lecturer at the University of Stellenbosch&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the bottom of most fears are, according to Link, usually an over-active mind and an under-active body. Hence, I advised my people in their quest for happiness to use their heads less and their arms and legs more in useful work or play. We generate fears while we sit. We overcome them by action. Fear is nature&#x2019;s warning signal to get busy.</block>

<p>In the offices of our Government departments and in the offices of our large business undertakings today there are thousands of people who have over-active minds while their bodies are under-active. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_sport_and_recreation">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have now come to the end of the discussion on the Sport and Recreation Vote, and those hon. members who have been sitting in this House of Assembly for many years will readily agree with me that this has probably been the most pleasant sport debate we have ever had in this House of Assembly. It has been a debate which has testified to good relations and to a desire to keep politics out of sport as far as it is practicable, and which has shown that we approach this matter&#x2014;which is certainly not the most important matter to which this House could devote its attention, but which is, nevertheless, an important one&#x2014;in such a serious spirit because we wish in this way to serve the best interests of our country and our people. Further to what was said by the hon. member who has just sat down, I also want to say that where we are dealing with sportsmen and sportswomen and where success on the sportsground is so important to them, I have often asked myself what success really is.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I believe, Sir, that success is doing the best you can under all circumstances, and what goes for the sportsmen, goes for us: doing the <span class="col_8089-8090" refersTo="page_1375"/>best you can. Success is certainly also being just to your fellow-men. I believe you cannot have success if you are not also just to your fellow-men. Success is struggling on with a will to win. I am a great believer that, as the hon. member for Kuruman has just said, if there is a will then so many problems that seem to be unsolvable become solvable. Therefore the will to win must be there. Then, of course, knowing that you cannot always win, I think success also means taking defeat with a cheerful grin. I think that is very important. But I think success is more than that. It is also being true to the faith you profess, and success to my way of thinking, therefore, is doing your noblest best under all circumstances. That, I think, is success and I think our sportsmen and sportswomen, as I said last night, deserve warm praise for the way in which they are conducting themselves, and that goes for White sportsmen as well as for non-White sportsmen.</p>

<p>*Reference has been made here to the fact that permits have now been allocated to the Department of Sport and Recreation. I want to tell the hon. members that between September 1975 and the end of March 1976, my department handled 143 applications for permits, and of these 16 were not recommended. One is grateful for the fact that the position has developed to a point where we have achieved such understanding in respect of this matter&#x2014; the granting of permits&#x2014;that we have that measure of co-operation in South Africa. I think this is splendid. You will allow me to point out that we had five world championships here in South Africa last year and this year, and that six more will take place this year, bringing us to 11 World Championships in approximately 18 months, something for which one is really grateful, because it proves the confidence which international sport bodies have in the South African sport administrators. This is emphasized by the fact that we had five world championships in South Africa during 1975. We had the world bowling championships, for example, and hon. members will agree with me that no one who saw that event on television or was privileged to attend it can ever forget it. The people from overseas were at a loss for words in their praises of that tournament, of the outstanding organization and of the pleasant atmosphere that prevailed there. The chairman of the international body said&#x2014;and this was accepted with acclaim by all the bowlers who attended the tournament&#x2014;that he did not think the organization of those world bowling championships in the Republic of South Africa could ever be equalled.</p>

<p>I mention this here because it is symbolic and because it highlights a very important fact, i.e. that this was made possible by the close and excellent co-operation which existed between the bowling administrators, myself and the Department of Sport and Recreation. Had it not been for that co-operation, which extended over a period of four years&#x2014;these world bowling championships were organized over a period of four years&#x2014;the event could not have taken place in the way it did. But I am able to say today that the co-operation took place in the very best spirit. Other kinds of sport in South Africa would do well to take a leaf out of this book of the bowling people. They are mature people, sensible and wise people, people who know how to administer. If they go and talk to those people, they will hear and they will know that it pays to have co-operation, because it ensures success. And there is no problem between the Government and these sportsmen which cannot be solved if the necessary co-operation exists. I am very grateful for the co-operation which already exists, and we must develop it. Therefore I appeal once again to sport administrators, White and non-White, to whom my door is open 24 hours a day, and I say to them that if we maintain that co-operation, we shall solve our problems to an even greater extent, as I shall try to indicate to hon. members in a little while.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. I can assure the hon. member that I have a great deal of time left for them. The casting championships for anglers were held in South Africa. I attended the event. It was beautiful. One of our men won four gold medals on that occasion. The Gymkhana world championships were also held here. As far as motor racing is concerned, the world championships were held at Kayalami, and who will ever be able to forget the victory of Jody Scheckter in his Tyrrell Elf in March 1975? And many thousands of people were privileged to witness this. And the <span class="col_8091-8092" refersTo="page_1376"/>world body-building championships&#x2014;what a success those were!</p>

<p>We look forward to the following world championships this year: The billiard world championships, the tug-of-war championships, the hang-gliding world championships, the powerboat world championships, as well as the model-boat world championships. I have been present at model-boat championships. It may sound like a minor and an unimportant matter to hon. members, but attend one, and hon. members will find it a most pleasurable experience. Furthermore, the model aircraft world championships will also be held here. I want to point out to hon. members that during 1973, we were visited by teams representing 48 kinds of sport. During 1974, teams representing 50 kinds of sport visited South Africa from overseas, and in 1975 the number grew to 52. During the first three months of 1976, sportsmen practising 24 kinds of sport visited South Africa. The number of countries involved in these visits was as follows: In 1973 there were 44 and in 1974 there were 37. The number went down slightly because the S.A. Games were held in South Africa in 1973. In 1975, however, it went up to the greatest number we have ever had in our history, 53. During the first three months of 1976, the countries whose sportsmen visited South Africa numbered 33, and there is no doubt about the fact that last year&#x2019;s record is going to be surpassed.</p>

<p>When we look at visits to foreign countries, we see that 43 kinds of sport were involved in such visits in 1973. In 1974, the number was 42; in 1975, 43; and in the first three months of this year, 17. The number of countries involved in these visits were 25 in 1973; 26 in 1974; 34 in 1975&#x2014;a record. During the first three months of 1976, the number came to 21. The kinds of sport which were involved in international participation&#x2014;and there are only about 78 kinds of sport&#x2014;numbered 62 in 1973. In 1974, the number was 65; in 1975 it was 68; and during the first three months of 1976, 35 had already been involved. However, I am not trying to create the impression that we are being completely successful in our attempt to enter the international arena. I am simply saying that we are making excellent progress. I mention this for the specific reason that it brings me to a point which I should very much like to emphasize on this occasion.</p>

<p>Before coming to that point, I want to point out to hon. members that a mere three years ago, when professional boxing and wrestling were transferred to the Department of Sport and Recreation and to me&#x2014;it used to fall under other departments&#x2014;there was a legal prohibition in South Africa on professional boxing and wrestling between the population groups, i.e. between White and non-White. There was a legal prohibition on this. It was my task, which I performed with the greatest pleasure, although not without difficulty, of course, to get that ban lifted, and three years ago it was in fact lifted. This is a very important fact. A law which had been on the Statute Book for years and which prohibited professional boxing and wrestling between the various population groups in South Africa was repealed. After that we had the first fight between Bob Foster and Pierre Fourie. It was an excellent fight and I remember it very well. I could tell a very interesting little story about that event, but I should prefer to leave it for a later occasion.</p>

<p>As a Minister, I must be very careful in what I say, for if I tell a joke, there may be people who think that this is now the law. The opposite is also true, namely that when I make a law, there are people who think I am joking! Less than three years after that ban had been lifted, what happened? We had a fight for the world boxing title between two Coloured people in South Africa. I am referring to the fight between Galindez of Argentinia and Richie Kates of the USA. Galindez is an outstanding boxer, and so is Kates. Galindez grew fond of South Africa and South Africa grew fond of him. A man who can show so much courage as that boxer&#x2014;I was able to attend that fight&#x2014;holds out a lesson to the spectator. He fought against Richie Kates, a Negro from the United States for whom we also have the greatest appreciation. This was a wonderful achievement for South Africa, three years after the ban had been lifted. It underlined the enormous changes which had taken place in the field of sport in South Africa within a mere four years. These have been great changes and positive changes. There is not the slightest doubt about the fact that they were changes which are a credit to us all, a credit to all the population groups, changes which have brought about good relations in South Africa, as the hon. member for Geduld pointed out in such a striking way last night with his reference to the scientific investigation <span class="col_8093-8094" refersTo="page_1377"/>which had taken place in Soweto. If I were to tell hon. members how many boxing matches of that nature have taken place since 1973&#x2014;and there has been no trouble at any of those boxing matches&#x2014;then I would say that we are really making good progress.</p>

<p>This brings me to the point which I should very much like to emphasize on this occasion. I have already underlined the great changes which have taken place in the field of sport in South Africa, changes which have enabled me to address a letter to Prof. Ludwig Guttman. I quote the following extract from a letter which I wrote to him on 7 March 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir Ludwig:</block>

<block name="quote">You are given the absolute assurance that the South African paraplegic team will be selected purely on merit, regardless of colour, race or creed. The official policy of the South African Government is to give to each sportsman and sportswoman, regardless of race, creed or colour, full opportunities to reach the top in sport, to participate against the best sportsmen and and sportswomen, without reference to creed, race or colour in South Africa and against the best in the world, also on an equal basis. All sportsmen and sportswomen from anywhere in the world are most welcome to participate in South Africa on an absolutely equal basis in every respect, as is the case anywhere in the world, regardless of race, colour or creed.</block>

<p>Sir Ludwig Guttman is a wise old gentleman, a splendid person! He showed this letter to various parties. I know he showed it to the British Prime Minister, for he informed me of this, and he showed it to the British Minister of Sport as well. They were very surprised to see it, he told me. The other day I wrote a similar letter to Messrs. Day and Emmett of our squash team, and it received quite a lot of publicity in England a week or two ago. This has brought about a great change in respect of those forms of sport. These people then took up the cudgels for South Africa. As a result of this they said, for example, that if Canada would not receive the South African team at the Olympic Games for paraplegics, the games for paraplegics would not take place in Canada. They said they would then hold those Olympic Games elsewhere. The result was that it was decided that the South African team would in fact take part in the games for paraplegics in Canada. I give that team my blessing and I wish it every success. It is an experience to go and watch those people, who have certain physical defects, while they are practising sport. It is a wonderful experience! I want to take this opportunity of appealing to the public to assist this team financially, because they are still short of funds. The Department of Sport and Recreation has done what it could, but more funds will still have to be found. So I am making an appeal on this occasion for funds to enable this team to participate in the Olympic Games.</p>

<p>The communists are causing a very serious disruption in the international sport situation. There is not the least doubt about what they are trying to do. The communists are using sport in the international sphere to achieve political ends. I want to make an appeal from this House of Assembly to the Western countries, because we on this southern tip of Africa may be better able to see very clearly what is happening. We can do so because we are so directly involved in these methods applied by the Russians and because we have to a large extent fallen a prey to them. For this reason I want to ask the Western countries to take a good look at what is happening in international sport. The communists are exploiting sport in a disgraceful way to achieve political ends which suit them, in Southern Africa as well. This applies to other countries in the world as well. They began with South Africa. Then they dragged in Taiwan, then came Israel, and now they are getting at New Zealand. Where is the line going to be drawn? Which country will be next?</p>

<p>&#x2020;They will continue involving one country after another. The time has arrived for the Western world to awaken to what is happening in the world of sport. I have no doubt about the fact that I am correct in what I am saying because I have made a very intensive study of the matter.</p>

<p>*Because I am so sure of this, I have also discussed the matter with my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I address a formal invitation to Mr. Ordia, the president of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa, to visit South Africa as a guest of the Minister of Sport and Recreation of the Republic of South <span class="col_8095-8096" refersTo="page_1378"/>Africa, and to acquaint himself with the changes which have taken place with regard to sport in South Africa in recent years. I shall roll out the red carpet for him and we shall guarantee his safety. He will enjoy his visit. He will enjoy the hospitality of South Africa. He should come and see for himself what the position here is. He should come and see how we are making an honest attempt here, before God and man, to normalize sport and how we are trying to get away from race discrimination in the field of sport. He should come and acquaint himself with the facts. Then we can join forces and together we can make a substantial contribution to international sport. Then we can make sport that powerful instrument again which it was intended to be over the years. In accordance with the idea which was so well embodied in the Olympic charter at the time by Coubertin, sport can again become a powerful instrument for achieving and developing good relations between peoples and nations, between races and between individuals all over the world. South Africa is honest in saying: &#x201C;We want to do those things; we want to help the world to use sport in this way.&#x201D;</p>

<p>We say again, as the hon. the Prime Minister has very strongly emphasized, that any country in the world&#x2014;any country in Africa or any country in the East, or Russia or China&#x2014;is very welcome to come and practise sport in South Africa. We shall receive them here as equals, irrespective of race, colour, creed or anything else. We shall receive them as true sportsmen, as we did on the occasion of the body-building world championships and others, which were all enormously successful. Forty-four countries competed in the bodybuilding world championships, and the participants included representatives from countries behind the Iron Curtain. I must admit, however, that I took a great liking to the people who represented countries behind the Iron Curtain and that I went out of my way to form personal friendships with them. I used to be Minister of Immigration, but fortunately I still have some influence as far as that department is concerned, and as I said at the bowling world championships, if there are any of the bowlers who would like to immigrate to South Africa they are very welcome. I said the same thing on the occasion of the bodybuilding world championships, but at that stage, of course, I was still Minister of Immigration as well. I can say this morning that I have in fact received such applications from bowlers. Those people would like to settle down here permanently. I am dealing with those applications at the moment and I must say that my hon. colleague from Immigration is very sympathetically disposed towards them. [Interjections.] A man and a woman who visited South Africa at the time of the body-building world championships and who live in a country behind the Iron Curtain have applied to me for permission to settle permanently in South Africa. This is the kind of good relationship which can be created by means of sport.</p>

<p>I really hope that Mr. Ordia will not just disregard the invitation I have addressed to him, because the invitation was made in an honest and sincere spirit. The hon. members are free to look up my speeches in Hansard, the speeches I have made as Minister of Sport and Recreation in the course of years. From the outset my slogan has been: &#x201C;Let us get on with the game.&#x201D; I have said that we should keep politics out of sport and I am still trying to do this to the best of my ability. Hon. members can testify to the wonderful progress which has been made in this respect. Nowhere will hon. members find that I have denigrated or criticized Mr. Ordia and his people in any way, because I have looked forward to the day when we would be able to show them the fruit of what has been achieved in this field in the Republic of South Africa. I have looked forward to being able to invite them and to show them what is happening here. I am not saying that what is happening here is perfect, but if they come here and if they are honest, they will certainly not be able to deny the following: Tremendous changes have taken place here, we are making an honest attempt, and they need not co-operate with the communists in exploiting sport in order to achieve political ends. If the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa is honest, it can come and acquaint itself with the facts in the Republic of South Africa and it need not try to get New Zealand kicked out. In any event, I do not think that council will be able to do this. If that council comes to us in an honest frame of mind, it can do much more for sport in co-operation with the Republic of South Africa. I really hope that this will bear the desired fruit.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to a few questions <span class="col_8097-8098" refersTo="page_1379"/>which have been asked by hon. members. I want to point out to the hon. member for Green Point that I realize that there are shortcomings as far as training in non-White sport is concerned. I have already given attention to this matter. It is a matter which it has not yet been possible to finalize, unfortunately, but we are very sympathetically disposed towards it. The department gives all the assistance of which it is capable and it is directly involved in all the multi-national sporting events. However, this is a very complicated matter and we must handle it with great circumspection. Fortunately I am able to say that we are making progress. I must point out once again that we must go about this with circumspection because it is a delicate matter which cannot just be settled before breakfast tomorrow morning. The hon. member also referred to the sport facilities at Upington. In this connection the hon. member&#x2019;s figures are quite wrong. Does he accept that this is so?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the money which was allocated was less than I alleged. The figure I quoted reflects the total anticipated expenditure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct. Therefore I need not go into this matter any further.</p>

<p>As far as harbour facilities are concerned, I want to say that both I myself and my department are thoroughly aware of the great need for harbour facilities for pleasure boats along our coast. As the hon. member will know, a small amount has been made available for the first time in this financial year, and naturally we shall only be able to give our favourable consideration to the most urgent financial applications. However, I am very sympathetically disposed towards this matter. I had a serious discussion about this with my colleague, the Minister of Finance. Initially, Finance did not see its way clear to appropriating any amount in this connection, but we persevered and eventually we were fortunate enough to get a certain amount. However, we shall follow this up. As far as the Oceana Powerboat Club is concerned, I can tell the hon. member that we shall give them financial assistance. However, I cannot say at this stage what the amount will be, but we shall finalize this matter as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister if he is aware of the fact that in the last three or four years an amount of R1 million has been set aside under the Commerce and Industries Vote for the development of extensions to the harbour at Kalk Bay?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am certainly aware of that fact. We are good friends of Mr. Grobbelaar and we collaborate closely with him. These matters are receiving our very serious attention and we hope to make an announcement as soon as possible in this connection. However, since these matters are being investigated at the moment, we are not in a position to make such an announcement yet. I promise to make the announcement as soon as it is humanly possible. We know how serious the situation is and we shall seriously try to bring relief as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask further, if the Department of Industries builds the extension to the harbour at Kalk Bay, will the hon. the Minister take it over from them as a small boat harbour?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<p>We shall have to have discussions with that department and if we can arrange to take the harbour over, I can tell the hon. member that we shall be only too happy to do so.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Green Point also said that the sport administrators should administer their respective kinds of sport themselves. Other hon. members also referred to this. I want to make a point we must not lose sight of, i.e. that all the sport bodies in South Africa are autonomous bodies and are not controlled by my department. My department renders a service to these sport bodies. We are trying to render as good a service as is humanly possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also referred to umbrella bodies in the field of sport. Certain kinds of sport such as athletics, rugby and several others have already established such umbrella bodies. My department and I are continually working in this direction and we give valuable advice and assistance to the sport bodies, because it is in accordance with policy that such umbrella bodies should be established on which the various population <span class="col_8099-8100" refersTo="page_1380"/>groups should be represented. I shall come to cricket in a little while and I shall give the hon. member some information in that respect.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fauresmith is the chairman of our sport group. I want to say that he renders invaluable services to us in that capacity. I want to thank him, not only for those services which he renders, but also for the very good speech on sport which he made yesterday. I agree with him wholeheartedly and it is very important to underline here that we do not have a static policy, but a dynamic one. There are few things in which this is so strongly underlined as in sport. The hon. member referred to the fact that we should assist the administrations of non-White sport bodies. Within the framework of the existing set-up, my department and I try to provide as much assistance as we possibly can.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem emphasized the exploitation of sport for political and other unholy ends. I agree wholeheartedly with what he said. It is true in most cases that the people who speak so lightly of South Africa in this connection are not acquainted with the facts. The hon. member made a very important point which I want to underline here.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As I did under the National Education Vote, I want to appeal to the United Party, the PRP, the Press, the SABC and SATV and all our news media to carry this message out into the world so that the world can take cognizance of the tremendous changes that have taken place in sport in South Africa. I know what I am talking about. I have dealt with newsmen from the <i>New York Times</i> and from Europe, from England and from different other countries. I know that it has become quite a problem to get them to understand something of the tremendous changes that have taken place in the Republic in this regard. I have tried my best to inform them, and they are usually quite perplexed when they hear about it. They are reluctant to believe it, yet it is true. It is absolutely true.</p>

<p>If you do not know, visit me and I shall give you all the particulars. [Interjections.] My appeal is a very fair one. I appeal to hon. members and to all other people to keep the world informed about these things. It is in the interest of our country. That is the reason why I am so pleased with the discussion of this particular Vote. I am glad that we have not dwelt on a detailed analysis of a lot of trivial things. Heaven knows, I am so glad that I was not called upon to do that. We understand each other and we know what the policies are that are being followed in South Africa. I reiterate that we want to normalize things, and I promise the Opposition parties that, if they play the game, their contribution will not go unnoticed. South Africa can only benefit by that. There is no doubt as to that. My appeal to hon. members is that they should help the Government in this respect.</p>

<p>*If they fail to do so, the devil will take them. That I promise them! [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Sandton, as well as the hon. member for Green Point and several other hon. members, asked me questions in connection with cricket.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to state that there is no one in this hon. House, that there is in fact no one in South Africa, who will be more pleased to see South Africa returned to the international cricket fold than this man, Piet Koornhof, speaking to you now. Cricket players and cricket administrators all know that. They know that I have done everything humanly possible to accomplish South Africa&#x2019;s return to international cricket, and I shall continue to try and accomplish just that. I sincerely and genuinely mean it. However, it is quite a complicated issue. With all the goodwill in the world, it still remains a hell of a complicated issue.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, it is like a fellow who goes fishing early at 4 o&#x2019;clock in the morning, and who gets a devil of a crow&#x2019;s nest in his fishing tackle. He has come to do some fishing, but the moment he gets that crow&#x2019;s nest, he knows that his chances of catching a fish in the next few hours are absolutely nil. In the case of cricket it is very much the same. There a man must sit down and try patiently for hours on end to disentangle the crow&#x2019;s nest with his cold fingers. When at last, after two breakfasts, he has succeeded in disentangling it, he can finally start fishing. In cricket the position is just the same.</p>

<p><span class="col_8101-8102" refersTo="page_1381"/>&#x2020;Therefore, hon. members must please understand that there is a tremendous reservoir of goodwill. There is &#x2026;</p>

<p>You are one of them. There is a tremendous measure of goodwill and many efforts are being made to get South Africa back into the international cricket fold. I have had discussions with cricket authorities in England, in Australia, and all over the show. There is a tremendous amount of goodwill both outside and inside South Africa. If we handle this very delicate issue carefully enough, I have no doubt whatsoever about the fact that we shall get back into international cricket shortly.</p>

<p>*Now I want to say to the hon. member for Sandton that obviously I have a very intimate knowledge of the Committee of Nine, which has been constituted from the ranks of Saca, of Sacboc, of the South African Bantu Cricket Association and so forth. There is not a single one of those people whom I do not know very well personally and who has not been in my office on several occasions. Just before the latest Richie Bernaud tour, I requested Mr. Varachia to invite the people who were giving him problems&#x2014;this is to say, those on the extreme opposite side&#x2014;to come and talk to me personally in my office. They came to see me and I can assure hon. members that it went off very well. So I am obviously well informed and I am glad that these bodies have finally got together. I also trust that we shall be able to solve our cricket problems. This committee of nine is corning to see me shortly, and I shall listen to their plans with great interest and try to help them to do what is required to get us back into the international cricket fold.</p>

<p>There are many other things I wanted to say, but I shall have to reply in writing to the arguments of hon. members on this side of the House to which I have not replied. I undertake to do so. My time is running out. I should have liked to give every one of the hon. members on the other side of the House a reply as well, but if they will accept it, I shall reply in writing to their requests as well.</p>

<p>I want to conclude, therefore, by thanking all the hon. members very sincerely for the positive discussion we have had here. I want to do so in two phrases which mean a great deal to me personally, to the sportsmen and to the sport administrators in South Africa. If we take this as our premise, all will be well with us, and this applies to the field of sport as well. The first one is very well-known, i.e.: &#x201C;When that great Scorer comes to mark against your name, he asks not whether you won or lost, but how you played the game.&#x201D; Another thought which means a great deal to me is this: &#x201C;Over and beyond the eating and the sleeping, the mere living and dying, one after another, the spirit, that is what is inside us, invents, creates what is better than what was before. We are a thrust upwards amidst the problems of our time. We strive towards the growth of the human spirit, and we do that up to the last moment of possibility.&#x201D; I think that as far as sport is concerned, we have managed to do so in this debate, and for that I want to express my sincere thanks to hon. members.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I ask for the privilege of the half-hour.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that we should like, on this occasion, to have a discussion on the important report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Marketing Act. For this reason it is a pleasure to me on this occasion to express my appreciation, in the first place, to the members who served on that commission, i.e. the hon. member for Bethal, the chairman of the commission, his colleagues, and especially those hon. members on this side of the House who also served on the commission, i.e. the hon. members for King William&#x2019;s Town and Pietermaritzburg South. Dr. Moolman, who is no longer a member of this House, also served on this commission. I think that these gentlemen did an excellent job and that the experience they gained on their overseas trips was also of great value to them in drawing up this report. I think that in the future, when we have intensive discussions on marketing in this House, it will be of even greater value to them. I believe that the passing of the legislation in <span class="col_8103-8104" refersTo="page_1382"/>1937 was a milestone for orderly agricultural marketing in South Africa. I need not remind hon. members of the fact that it was the UP Government which created that basis for orderly marketing in South Africa. In 1947 it was once again necessary for a commission to give attention to the control schemes which were applicable in terms of the Marketing Act. I have said that I should like to express my appreciation to the hon. members who did this work. If one looks at the schedules to the report, one comes to the conclusion that they must have worked through an enormous amount of written documents and that they must have heard an enormous amount of evidence.</p>

<p>However, I do not think it will be possible on this occasion today to discuss in detail each recommendation made by the hon. gentlemen. What will finally have to be done is that the major recommendations of the commission will have to be properly examined by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, and the necessary amendments will then have to be made to the Marketing Act of 1968. As time goes by, one will be able to judge accurately which recommendations are valid and which are not.</p>

<p>However, I want to express my opinion even at this early stage in respect of certain recommendations which have been made. I consider the Marketing Council to be at the root of proper agricultural marketing in South Africa. I consider it to be the body which must give the necessary guidance, not only to the hon. the Minister, but also to the farmer of South Africa, so that the farmer, who for decades has been production orientated, may be provided with further training and may be made more marketing orientated. Of course, the council must also provide the farmer with proper marketing for his product. It is strange that the commission has had to point out that although the marketing of agricultural products has expanded so greatly over the years, the council has actually had a shortage of officials and has not received proper attention from the side of the authorities.</p>

<p>Such an important body, therefore, such an important spoke in the agricultural wheel, had to be reduced to a state, as it were, where the commission says that the Agricultural Marketing Council cannot carry on unless it can be properly accommodated, with regard to officials and to its functions, for example. For this reason, I also think that it should not only be a properly constituted body&#x2014;the commission made certain recommendations in this connection as well&#x2014;but that the Marketing Council should be in a position to perform its function. We have had repeated discussions in this House on the question of an agricultural planning council as an umbrella body which will be able to plan agriculture in a proper manner. Here one has a body, the Marketing Council, which must be able to provide one with projections of what the future requirements of agriculture will be. To a certain extent it must be able to say exactly what the production costs are and what the possibilities are, not only in the domestic market, but in the foreign market as well. There are many functions which the body will have to perform.</p>

<p>We can produce the best Marketing Act, therefore, and we can give the Minister all the necessary powers so that he will not only have a veto, but will have the final say in the determination of prices. I do agree with this. However, we can do all these things, but if the Marketing Council does not function properly, we cannot have orderly marketing for our agricultural products in South Africa. For this reason, the liaison which he wants with other control bodies, such as the control boards, is also closely related to the size of his staff and the qualified professional people who serve on the Marketing Council. I want to say to the hon. the Minister and to the hon. member for Bethal, who was the chairman of that commission, that there can be no doubt about the recommendations aimed at achieving this end. A start must be made; that is the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>As regards certain other recommendations, such as those concerning the power of the hon. the Minister, I have already said that we can undoubtedly think in that direction. I am sorry that the commission had to express its opinion at one stage on the subject of the subsidizing of agricultural prices. The attitude of this side of the House is very simple. We have never found any way of narrowing the gap between the consumer and the producer in connection with certain vital agricultural products other than a consumer subsidy. We have never found any other solution to this. For this reason, I found it surprising that the commission felt that consumer subsidies in South Africa would have to be gradually reduced at <span class="col_8105-8106" refersTo="page_1383"/>some stage and that the money used for the consumer subsidies should rather be used in a different way for stimulating production. Now I want to say at once that as far as the foreseeable future is concerned, I honestly cannot see&#x2014;and this is embodied in our agricultural approach which we stated more than ten years ago&#x2014;how one can ever get away from the situation of having an enormous group of people in South Africa who live on or under the breadline. Because of our racial composition in South Africa, that situation will endure. Therefore one must keep a check on the prices in order to help those people.</p>

<p>Secondly, when the farmer&#x2019;s price has to be increased because of higher production costs, inflation, etc., this has to be done; it cannot be refused. The farmer&#x2019;s price cannot remain constant either, nor can it go down. This has happened in the past, and it has caused producers to leave the country. Consequently we may forget about taking steps which will reduce the farmer&#x2019;s income. One should rather take steps to ensure that his prices, too, will keep pace with the rise in production costs. If this is done, and you have to protect the consumer at the same time, what solution is there other than to have these consumer subsidies? My study of agriculture, not only in this country, but in other countries of the world as well, has always shown me that the other countries, too, have only been able to proceed from the standpoint that a consumer subsidy is necessary under certain circumstances. If they think it is a sound practice, how much more essential a consumer subsidy is in South Africa, with the position we have here! For this reason I want to say at once that as far as I am concerned, I am unable, in the final analysis, to give my support, and, I believe, the support of my party, to the abolition of consumer subsidies. Under the present circumstances this cannot be done. I must say that the commission covered itself quite well and did not think either that it could be done overnight. But I want to go so far as to say that it will not be possible to accept a measure aimed at reducing it now.</p>

<p>While we are on the subject, I just want to refer to the latest announcements by the hon. the Minister in connection with the maize price. Here one has a situation where the hon. gentleman has to increase the maize price by R6 a ton to R65 a ton. That difference of R6 is paid in the first place by the State in the form of R3 a ton, and the other R3 has to be paid by the producer. According to the information available to me, very little criticism has yet been expressed against the fact that the State has to pay this amount. What has given rise to criticism? The criticism comes from the maize farmer himself, because he has to pay the R3 a ton from the Stabilization Fund and the profit which he has made on his product during the past year by means of export. I do not blame the maize farmers, for I think they are absolutely correct, because this is money which belongs to them. However, is it so impossible for that difference also to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund? Then only will one be able to do justice to the consumer as well as the producer. I do not want to say much more about the report, because the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town will raise further matters in connection with it.</p>

<p>I should like to devote my attention to certain objectives which agriculture as a whole ought to have today in the prevailing circumstances. It has been said before in this House that the function of agriculture is not only to feed the nation and to stimulate industrial development which centres around agriculture. The purpose of agriculture is not only to provide for the immediate needs of South Africa. This House, the hon. the Minister and his departments, must be prepared to take concerted action to break new ground. When the hon. the Minister makes speeches from time to time, I do not disagree with him on this matter, because I know that he, too, is prepared to venture a little further than we are at the moment. A previous Minister of Agriculture often told this House that surpluses were a problem in agriculture. Hon. members on this side of the House told him that surpluses were temporary, while shortages could be permanent. However, the hon. the Minister has indicated his approach in this respect by pointing out that he, too, considers surpluses in the agricultural industry to be temporary, and that he would not want the industry to have shortages in the long run. When we say that we should break new ground, what is it that is worrying hon. members on this side of the House? What is worrying us is that 80&#x0025; of the farmers are responsible for only 20&#x0025; of the agricultural <span class="col_8107-8108" refersTo="page_1384"/>production. Hon. members on this side of the House believe that all our work, planning and energy must be aimed at improving the vertical potential of the 80&#x0025; of the farmers who may be small, average and perhaps even inefficient farmers.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The 20&#x0025; of the farmers who are producing 80&#x0025; of our agricultural production, are, of course, important to us. Under normal circumstances you will find, however, that the 20&#x0025; of the farmers who produce 80&#x0025; of the agricultural production are people who are, from a capital and financial point of view, normally very strong indeed and very independent. Invariably you will find amongst the 20&#x0025; of highly productive farmers people who have had a good agricultural training. They have had expert training. You will also find that if they did not have the training themselves, they are in a position to pay others as foremen, as managers, others who are trained to help and assist them with their agricultural production. You will also find that this 20&#x0025; are not only financially independent and strong, but they know not only the right people but also the right instances, banks, financial institutions and they have an entr&#x00E9;e to the most important people in South Africa who are dealing with the agricultural industry. You also invariably find that they are in a position to pay for their labour. They can provide the best housing and the best facilities for their farm labour.</p>

<p>*From the nature of the case, they are in a privileged position in being able to do all those things. However, let us now look at that man who does not belong to that 20&#x0025;, the man who belongs to the 80&#x0025; which is responsible for only 20&#x0025; of the agricultural production. He does not have that influence. He does not always know the right bodies. He does not always know the right people and usually he cannot provide the best housing for his labourers. Often his credit standing leaves much to be desired, but he has to contend with tremendously high production costs, just as the big farmer does. Often he has a shortage of working capital. Our appeal to the hon. the Minister today is that we should take another look at the true position of that type of farmer. After all, many of us have seen people rise from small beginnings to achieve success. Such a person began on a holding, for example, and made a success of it. Then he obtained assistance from the Land Bank and from the Department of Agricultural Credit, and in the long run, by winning all the time, that man made a success of his farming operations. Some people began as managers or foremen of established farmers, and after a few years such a man struck out on his own, and eventually he became an established farmer.</p>

<p>This is a matter of concern to this side of the House, if we want to break new ground, if we want to push up our agricultural potential in a vertical sense, if we want to feed all the mouths there will be in the future: Are we giving enough attention in South Africa to that 80&#x0025; of the farmers who may be small, who may be average and who may be inefficient in some respects? What can be done for these people? My request to the hon. the Minister is that we should make a survey of these people at some stage. This will have to be done soon, because the demands are there, the requirements are there, the future demands which will be made upon agriculture are not growing smaller; they are becoming greater and greater. It is quite clear that the numbers of these people are steadily declining. I read in one of our agricultural publications that some people believe that there are approximately 50 000 farmers left at the moment. I doubt whether this is so. The number must be a little higher than that. However, the number of farmers is considerably smaller than it was some years ago. Can we not make a survey of these people and see what their potential is? What are their requirements? What is their personal potential? What initiative do they have? What are their managerial abilities in this respect? What handicaps do those people have? Can those handicaps be removed by training and guidance? Are those people handicapped by a shortage of working capital which will enable them to expand, to grow in a vertical sense? When we have made a survey of this kind and when we have obtained future projections, our whole approach to agriculture must be aimed at helping this kind of person. Large parts of the country can support stock-farming as well, even the grain-producing districts of the hon. the Deputy Minister, the grain-producing districts of the hon. member for Malmesbury and of the hon. member for Moorreesburg. Dozens of examples could be mentioned to illustrate this point. However, are those people financially able to carry on stock-farming on <span class="col_8109-8110" refersTo="page_1385"/>an intensive scale&#x2014;not necessarily on the land itself&#x2014;in order to increase our milk production in South Africa and to increase our meat and wool production in South Africa?</p>

<p>I could say the same about the extensive parts of our country which still have a tremendous potential. However, I believe that some farmers have already become too big. The business of that kind of farmer has become too big for him to handle by himself. Then there is the large number of average farmers and small farmers who do not have the necessary capital at this stage, because capital is tremendously expensive. Although they do not have the capital, the possibility of developing does exist for them. This is the way the situation will have to improve, in our opinion. Farmers do not have the necessary capital today, because of the fact that capital is so expensive. For this reason I want to repeat what we have said before. The Land Bank and the Department of Agricultural Credit should in actual fact be the Department of Agricultural Financing. This could be a kind of development corporation for agriculture. Not that it would want to buy farms and to carry on farming operations itself. After all, the IDC conducts a thorough investigation into the potential of the industrialist, whether he be a small or a big industrialist, and it sees what can be done for him. We on this side believe that impetus can be given to the agricultural industry in this way. By doing this, we shall be able to give new vitality and a sense of purpose to this 80&#x0025; of the farmers, who presently account for 20&#x0025; of our agricultural production, and then that hon. Minister and others in this House will achieve what has to be achieved, and that is to ensure that we never have any food shortages in South Africa.</p>

<p>However, this involves another requirement as well. This is something I have already pointed out. Those people will have to be given the right kind of guidance. I was terribly shocked to see the truth, which we have long known, stated in such uncompromising terms as was done by the Secretary of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services in his latest report in connection with agricultural scientists. On page 3 it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Agricultural scientists in South Africa are very scarce, and during the past decade the accession from universities has either been static or has declined. But it is the agricultural extension service in particular that has been hard hit by the shortage of agricultural scientists. Not only is the accession of graduates to the service limited, but there is also a considerable drain of officers to the private sector.</block>

<p>And now comes the important sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In consequence, the departmental extension service has been weakened to the point where the continued existence of the service is hanging in the balance.</block>

<p>People speak of advance planning and they speak of the tremendous demands that are made upon agriculture, but then we are faced with the truths which are conveyed to us by the Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services. &#x201C;It is hanging in the balance.&#x201D; Something will have to be done about this kind of thing. It will not serve any purpose for us to make surveys and to be concerned about 80&#x0025; of the farmers who produce 20&#x0025; of the production if we find that this is the situation. Surely the ideal should be that there should be no magisterial district in the rural areas in South Africa which does not have at least an agricultural extension officer and a technical officer. We must take account of the fact that only 20&#x0025; of our farmers have had formal agricultural training, and then the question arises of who is to provide instruction and information in the agricultural sphere and who is to fill the vacuum which has been left by the fact that so few farmers have enjoyed formal agricultural training. Who is to assist in the extension services and who is to address the farmers? Surely these people are the ones, and if we have a shortage of them, we cannot expect to make a success of agriculture in the long run.</p>

<p>There is a second matter which I want to raise with a view to assisting that 80&#x0025; of the farmers, not only financially, but in other ways as well. We shall have to look at the training facilities that are available for the labourers of the farmers. I recently read in a magazine&#x2014; anyone who is involved in agriculture know that this is so&#x2014;that of the 230 000 people who drive tractors, only 13 000 have had any training in the proper handling and maintenance of a tractor.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Newton Park referred <span class="col_8111-8112" refersTo="page_1386"/>with appreciation to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Marketing Act, and also praised certain of the recommendations the commission made. He had misgivings, however, about certain recommendations the commission made. In the course of my speech I shall refer to some of the recommendations, and react at the same time to some of the statements made by the hon. member.</p>

<p>It is probably a high-water mark for any commission of inquiry when, after three years, it has reached the stage when its report is submitted and tabled in this House. As chairman of the commission I want to express my thanks to the members of the commission. Despite the fact that the members of the commission were divided in their political attitude&#x2014;this must inevitably be the case since we are politicians who represent different parties&#x2014;we gave proper consideration to the matter we had to investigate and to the terms of reference we received. We drew up a report to the best of our ability which, as far as the essential recommendations are concerned, was unanimously agreed to by the commission. There are certain matters in regard to which we differed with one another, and hon. members have probably noticed the occasional footnote in this regard.</p>

<p>On this occasion I should like to express my thanks to the secretariate of the commission. I am referring in particular to the secretary, Mr. Van der Westhuizen, the deputy secretary, Mr. Van Wyk, and the advisers, Mr. Schalk du Toit of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, Dr. Gregory, vice-chairman of the Marketing Council, and Dr. Claude van der Merwe whom we were privileged to be able to co-opt into the activities of the commission last year for a short time after he had resigned as Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing.</p>

<p>In point of fact the commission began its activities on 30 May 1973 when its terms of reference were published. After the publication of the terms of reference we received a large number of written representation and memorandums. To give hon. members an idea of the extensiveness of our activities, I could point out that we received written memorandums from all of the 21 control boards, as well as from the Meat Trade Control Board of South West Africa. At that stage the latest control board, i.e. the Cotton Board, was not yet functioning properly. We also received written representations from 22 producers&#x2019; organizations, from agricultural unions and from agricultural co-operatives. In addition 36 representations were received from particular associations representative of commerce and industry and the manufacturing industry. Representations were also received from 11 Government departments and statutory bodies and from 10 consumer organizations. A total of 76 documents were received in this connection of the 76, 45 organizations also gave oral evidence before the commission.</p>

<p>After the commission had obtained and studied all these particulars, the <i>modus operandi</i> it adopted was to draw up a provisional standpoint. Subsequently we made a study of 15 marketing systems in the Western World, including those of the USA, the EEC, Australia, the United Kingdom, etc. The investigative material which the commission had its disposal therefore extended over a very wide field. We collected a great deal of information to enable us to carry out our terms of reference.</p>

<p>Since the introduction and application of the Marketing Act of 1947, after the then commission had investigated the marketing system in South Africa, tremendous development has taken place. In 1947 there were only nine control boards and nine schemes. Today we have 22 control boards, and some of the larger control boards control as many as three schemes. The entire control scheme has therefore developed tremendously since that time, so much so that almost 90&#x0025; of the value of agricultural produce today is controlled under the Marketing Act. Our task was therefore far greater than that of the 1947 commission. We had to have serious regard to the fact that, over a period of 29 years, a marketing structure had developed in South Africa with the control board system as basis. We have 22 of them, with their various schemes, and all of them have a measure of autonomy. Over this entire system we have, as umbrella organization, the National Marketing Council, which performs a co-ordinating function and which advises the Minister from time to time on the application of the large diversity of schemes. The control board system has also, over this period, become firmly established. A recommendation which would bring about a radical change in the present system would be anything but in the interests of agriculture. The commission therefore <span class="col_8113-8114" refersTo="page_1387"/>proceeded upon the standpoint that, fundamentally, the present control board system had to be adhered to, and that the problem we were dealing with was a •structural problem and that it was therefore simply a question of adaptations and adjustments in order to rectify the entire position. Therefore the commission is not coming forward with any radical recommendations. The recommendations of the commission are, we believe, practicable. We also believe that the recommendations are acceptable.</p>

<p>The commission gave very high priority to the element of the acceptability and practicability of its report. We did not want to introduce a report which would be shelved. We wanted to introduce a report which could be used. We feel that it should be administratively possible for all bodies dealing with the implementation of this report&#x2014;if the recommendation should be accepted&#x2014;to be geared to it administratively. All the control boards, all the various departments, have the organizational machinery to be able to put it into operation immediately. However, it is also important to realize that the commission is desirous that the Government should regard its report as a unity, and not as a group of isolated recommendations, because most of the important recommendations are interrelated.</p>

<p>I want to point out certain of the key recommendations, the essential recommendations, and the first one to which I want to draw attention, is the one to which the hon. member for Newton Park also referred. This is the position of the National Marketing Council. This is the pivot on which the entire system turns. The evidence which the commission obtained in this regard was overwhelming. It indicated that the need existed for the National Marketing Council to be expanded, both in status as well as in expertise. The commission therefore set itself the task of achieving that object. The weakness in the structure lies in the very fact that the National Marketing Council does not have the powers nor the expertise to carry out its co-ordinating function properly and satisfactorily, particularly in view of the fact that it is dealing with a tremendously extensive marketing system involving 22 boards. One could almost say that those boards have already become &#x201C;empires&#x201D;. I am of course saying this with great respect, for many of those boards have done extremely valuable work. During our investigations overseas we in fact encountered few marketing systems which were in any way comparable to those in South Africa.</p>

<p>The danger that began to develop, however, was that as a result of the great diversity of control boards, with their specific degree of autonomy, a sectional viewpoint was beginning to gain ground in the world of agriculture. This was something which in the long run could inevitably create an imbalance in production, and it had to be prevented as quickly as possible by remedying this matter. The commission also tried to expand the composition of the National Marketing Council to eight members, of whom six have to be economists. The exclusive function of the council is the handling of agricultural economic matters. Therefore it is not becoming a council which is representative of certain organizations. It is primarily a council of experts. The commission also discussed one of the other major deficiencies&#x2014;and on this I want to place very heavy emphasis. These are the services which have to be rendered to the National Marketing Council if it is expected to continue with its co-ordinating and advisory task. The services which the council is receiving at present are being rendered by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. These are agricultural statistical services. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am rising merely to afford the hon. member for Bethal an opportunity to complete his speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. member for Newton Park. It was found, if the National Marketing Council had to be expanded, those services would very definitely have to be improved; in particular the agricultural economic statistical services would have to be improved. We ourselves recommended that if this could not be done by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, a special bureau ought to be established from which the National Marketing Council could obtain its information, so that it could process the information properly.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will understand that, if the National Marketing Council is expected to fulfil a co-ordinating function, and if all price recommendations are sent to the National Marketing Council, the council should have <span class="col_8115-8116" refersTo="page_1388"/>the power and the knowledge to be able to process them. In its very important liaison with the control boards the National Marketing Council has access to most of the meetings concerned with prices, and in fact to the discussions held by the control boards. It is therefore clearly apparent that the liaison in that respect has to be very sound.</p>

<p>The commission also made another very important recommendation in regard to the National Marketing Council. This was in connection with one of the things we saw overseas, a system which is being applied in Canada, in Australia and elsewhere. Under that system the overseas counterparts of the National Marketing Council hold annual or biannual conferences on agricultural prospects. This ties in with the idea expressed by the hon. member for Newton Park, i.e. that this matter could to a great extent be termed a planning function. It is a function which will be fulfilled by the annual submission of agricultural prospects to the organizations concerned, the various departments in agriculture, commerce and industry, as well as to the Land Bank and to the Co-ordinating Consumers Board. The conferences are attended by representatives of all the abovementioned bodies. The various reports are made available to every representative. They are discussed there, information is furnished and all the various bodies make their contributions in regard to the planning in the light of the prospects which were presented. This is a very important function of the National Marketing Council. Now, hon. members will understand that the functioning of the National Marketing Council relies very heavily on the statistics and services it has to receive from the department. We trust that the hon. the Minister will give attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The commission, in its considerations and recommendations, also had proper regard to the two most important parties in the entire marketing set-up, i.e. the primary producer, who is the first starting point of marketing and the consumer, who is the terminal point of the marketing process. The producer in South Africa has always considered the Marketing Act to be his security when it comes to the marketing and prices of his produce. Over the years he has developed a confidence and obtained a vested interest in this control board. For this reason the commission unanimously decided that we should adhere to the statutory majority of agricultural producers on the control boards. However, there are certain problems in this regard; they are probably only human, and I am not reproaching our producers because of them. To ensure proper co-ordination the commission naturally deprived the control boards of certain powers of recommendation in regard to prices. The control boards now simply recommend prices to the National Marketing Council. This does not mean that the producer has no further say or participating in the pricing of his product. He still has liaison with the National Marketing Council. The commission foresaw this problem and for that reason made a recommendation to the effect that before the National Marketing Council goes to the hon. Minister with a maize price, for example, with which the control board does not agree, then it is the idea of the commission that the control board in question should first be consulted again. All problems must be ironed out at control board level and at National Marketing Council level, so that when the price eventually reaches the Minister, it will be a well-considered price in the interests of agriculture, and not only in the interests of agriculture, but also in the interests of the country. We have also given added status to the National Marketing Council by proposing that its chairman should be a member of the Economic Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister. Therefore, our producers need have no fear that their say in the price formation will be prejudiced in this way. There will merely be a better co-ordinated form of price determination.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to refer to the position of the consumer. If one considers the recommendations of this commission, they seem to be drastic because we have abolished consumer representation on the 22 boards. We have done this for one important reason, the reason being that it is in the interests of the consumers themselves. We received overwhelming evidence in this regard. The isolated consumer representative who serves in boards with a membership of 22 to 23, by rights has very little to do in the actual activities of that control board with consumer matters. For this reason the commission has recommended that we should rather do away with these representatives and in their place should recognize an existing statutory body, the Co-ordinating Consumers Board, and require the National <span class="col_8117-8118" refersTo="page_1389"/>Marketing Council by law, which is now a body with greater expertise, to hold talks annually or biannually with the Co-ordinating Consumers Board so that they may specifically and in a specialized way discuss consumer problems in the marketing set-up of agricultural produce. We think we are in that way creating a far better dispensation for the consumer in South Africa. We also saw this in England, where there are no consumers serving on the control boards. In fact, the position there is that the control boards consist only of producers, but a statutory obligation is imposed on the control boards to hold negotiations with consumer organizations from time to time. Consequently the consumers, in my opinion, are in a far better position.</p>

<p>To satisfy the consumer I have a single proposal to make to the hon. the Minister. The National Marketing Council consists of eight members, and it has already been recommended that the hon. the Minister should also nominate two economists from the private sector on a contractual basis. The Minister could, with the appointment of these two economists, consider discussing this matter with the Co-ordinating Consumers Board. Perhaps he could ascertain what their opinion is and whether they feel that the persons who are appointed have sufficient knowledge of consumer matters. To achieve confidence in the scheme, the confidence of the consumer has to be gained, as well as the confidence of the producer.</p>

<p>I want to conclude my requesting the hon. the Minister to accept and to implement the recommendations of the commission as soon as possible. We believe that they are sound recommendations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a particularly pleasant privilege for me to speak after the hon. member for Bethal, the chairman of this commission, whose report is before the House today. In the first instance, as member of the commission, I want to express my thanks and appreciation to the hon. member for Bethal for the very competent way in which he acted as chairman of the commission. As someone who was in very close contact with him, I can assure hon. members of the fact that he worked day and night on the report. He spared no trouble, nor did he hesitate to do everything in his power to make a success of the recommendations and the report. Therefore I know that the report will in future be known as the Wentzel report, and that it will be of immense value to agriculture in South Africa. I also believe that the recommendations of the report will be referred to as recommendations which ushered in a new era in agriculture in South Africa as far as marketing is concerned. I should like to thank my hon. colleague sincerely for the way in which he acted and for the competent way in which he presented the matter in the House today. Everyone in the House will agree with me that the hon. member summarized the recommendations of the committee very concisely and correctly, in a nutshell in fact. We want to thank him very much for doing so.</p>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. member for Bethal that the recommendations should be seen as a whole. Many of the recommendations are far-reaching and are aimed at improving the system. But after all, they are not so drastic that they cannot be accepted. Since we have had development over a long period of 40 years, it is not easy to come forward with recommendations which will solve the problem, as we see it, and at the same time satisfy both the producer and the consumer and give the hon. the Minister the opportunity of accepting the report. In my opinion the commission succeeded very well in this. I should like to express the hope and confidence that, since we have already been working on this report for three years and since agriculture in South Africa, like any other branch of the national economy, is dynamic, the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to accepting the report as a whole and implementing it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I am very pleased that the hon. member for Newton Park said that this commission did an excellent job of work, and I know that he meant it sincerely. The hon. member mentioned quite a number of matters here. <i>Inter alia</i> he also mentioned the agricultural planning council once again. It is my considered opinion that the National Marketing Council which has been recommended by the commission, will be able to fulfil and meet fully in its essence and in its normal activities, the ideal which the hon. member for Newton Park has of establishing an agricultural planning advisory board. I think that if we could expand this national marketing council in this way, the hon. member would be quite satisfied with its <span class="col_8119-8120" refersTo="page_1390"/>activities and with what will be accomplished through the activities of that council.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the subsidizing of agricultural products in South Africa and we know what the hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint in this connection has been over the years. I do not want to differ with the hon. member once again today. I think that we should seek other methods, because there are a few deficiencies in this high rate of subsidization of agricultural produce prices. He mentioned the example of the maize price, where the consumer price is R6 per ton cheaper than the producer&#x2019;s price. I just want to mention two problems. These are that at the moment&#x2014; there are the figures which I received from the department&#x2014;a 90 kg bag of sifted flour costs R6,55 here in the Cape complex, a bag of unsifted flour R6,55, while a 90 kg bag of yellow maize meal costs R6,67. In other words, we can see that there is a very fine balance in regard to how far one can go with subsidies. Where the intention is to transfer the subsidy on wheat in the interests of the consumer, one can very easily have the situation where one makes wheat so cheap that the farmer in the Western Province will feed his pigs on flour instead of maize meal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is correct, but I am sorry that people here in the Western Province&#x2014;we as Freestaters realize this very well&#x2014;do not make as much use of maize meal as in the Free State. [Interjections.] The hon. member said that we should stake a further claim in agriculture. As far as a difference of R6 per ton in the price of maize is concerned, where we have a free customs union agreement with our Bantu states and with Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana, we must remember that that major difference, in which they are participants, is actually a discouraging factor with respect to production in those countries, as well as in our homelands which we are now trying to get off the ground as far as agricultural production is concerned. As long as we have such major differences between the producer&#x2019;s price and the consumer&#x2019;s price, it will be very difficult to inspire and activate these people in regard to production. Therefore we have to be very careful about adopting the standpoint which that hon. member adopted in this connection.</p>

<p>But I also want to agree with him on another matter. Agriculture has become very important today, and as a result of world food shortages, inflation and other reasons, agriculture and farming have actually become much sought after professions today and people are inclined, since they know that agriculture has such a great future, to invest in it. Therefore the competition in agriculture will become keener. In one of my speeches the other day I pointed out that there is sound competition in agriculture, that agriculture is probably one of the industries in which there is the best and soundest competition, but that we should be concerned about the large number of small farmers who are producing less and less and who will find it more and more difficult to compete. But I also referred on a previous occasion to the fact that we had identified the bottlenecks in this connection and that the NP Government was making provision, not only at the time, but had been doing so for a long time prior to that, for the requirements of the smaller farmers, so that they could be economically strong and sound and could make a contribution towards a competitive economy. Therefore I just want to add, to what the hon. member said, that we should be aware of this fact that we shall have to look after these people in future, and I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to do his best so that, as far as agricultural credit is concerned, we do in fact ensure that the necessary funds are available for the purchase of land so that we can consolidate these people further.</p>

<p>I have now devoted a great deal of my time to the hon. member and I should like to refer to the report once again. When one studies this report, it is essential to look at the terms of reference of the commission first. The first term of reference deals with the task of co-ordination. Since agriculture is dynamic and since it has also developed over a period of 40 years, it has been found that in places things are a little out of kilter in agriculture. Therefore it was the commission&#x2019;s task in the first place to try and eliminate these bottlenecks. Therefore one of the most important terms of reference of the commission was to investigate the task of co-ordination. As far as this is concerned, and attempt was made to make this task an integral part of the task of the National Marketing Council. Unfortunately time does <span class="col_8121-8122" refersTo="page_1391"/>not permit, but I could present many reasons why agriculture should have an even, orderly development, as is the case in any other sphere. Therefore the commission accepted certain principles. The first principle is that control is essential in agriculture. Hon. members may read this in the report. The application of control in terms of the general economic policy, is a matter to which the commission also gave high priority. Our point of view is that the measures in terms of the Marketing Act should be in line with the general economic policy.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Heilbron and the hon. member for Bethal have dealt with the recommendations of the commission of inquiry, and I want to say quite frankly that they have done it very well. I want to come back to certain matters mentioned by the hon. member for Heilbron in his speech. I just want to express my appreciation to the hon. member for Bethal for the competent and firm way in which he acted in his capacity as chairman of the commission, for the way in which he performed his duties and led the commission and for the way he handled the commission. It must be said that had it not been for his firm conduct, the commission would have sat for many more months, if not years. He was always tolerant and he always took minority standpoints into consideration, but he never did so to the point of weakness. When it was necessary to silence talkative members, he did not hesitate to do so. I am glad that he did so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron expressed some disagreement with the standpoint of the hon. member for Newton Park, and now I am afraid that I must also disagree with the hon. member for Newton Park, because he disagreed with me. This is about the question of consumer subsidies. I supported the recommendations of the commission with regard to consumer subsidies. Hon. members must remember that the commission&#x2019;s standpoint is that the commission cannot give its unqualified support to the principle of a general subsidy on selected products. As a general principle, the majority of the commissioners recommended that it should be the policy, as in the case of butter, to reduce systematically the subsidies on flour and maize, bearing in mind that these form part of the price structure and that a sudden reduction of the subsidy may cause disruption. I support this standpoint of the commission, because subsidies is an expensive way of subsidizing the underprivileged. It is a subsidy for the underprivileged, after all. The hon. member for Heilbron defended this standpoint well, but I can defend it even better.</p>

<p>I want to point out to hon. members that as far as the price of bread is concerned, every cent of the subsidy on the price of bread costs the taxpayer of South Africa R15 million. If the R65 million which is spent on subsidies at the moment were to be given to the pensioners instead, the pensions could be increased by 50&#x0025;, and the Government would derive much greater advantage from it. If this amount were to be spent on education, so that people could be trained in order to earn a better salary, it would be much better spent than it is today. I still proceed from the point of view that I am no socialist. If a man cannot make a decent living in this country, unless he is old or infirm or disabled, there is something wrong with him. These subsidies create a complete inbalance between the prices of products. The low price of maize, which is not only low because it is subsidized, but which is also low in comparison to the world price, has caused the consumption of chicken to be just as high as that of beef and pork together. This has an adverse effect on beef products.</p>

I am not going to say any more about the recommendations of the commission at this stage, because this report has been lying on the Table for a month, and anyone who is interested in it could have read it over and over again. We can argue here about what we should accept and what we should not accept, but we cannot deal with the report now. We can only deal with the criticism. Let me say right at the outset that I am very disappointed indeed about the little comment there has been on this report. One would have thought that the South African Agricultural Union would have reacted long ago. One would have thought that the Meat Board and all the other boards and bodies which have been affected would have commented on this. However, we <span class="col_8123-8124" refersTo="page_1392"/>have had no comment. The <i>Financial Times </i>published a fine summary of it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I also assisted in drawing up the report. I want to recommend <i>the Financial Times</i> of 14 May 1976. It contains an excellent article on this subject. The article appears under the headline &#x201C;Agriculture tackling a root problem&#x201D;. Unfortunately I have lost a cutting of an article which appeared in the <i>Farmer&#x2019;s Weekly,</i> and nowhere in the entire Parliamentary building have I been able to obtain a copy of this edition. I have been informed that it will only be available in a month&#x2019;s time. The gist of the criticism expressed in that article is more or less that there are too many control boards. I shall have more to say about this matter in a moment. <i>Die Landbouweekblad</i> was more or less favourable in its comment. Its greatest criticism was that we were giving too many powers to the Minister; in other words, that the final price determination was entrusted to the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says he agrees with <i>Die Landbouweekblad</i>. However, someone must bear the final responsibility for the price determinations. If the determination is done by the control boards alone, sectional interests will come into question, for that is only human. So one cannot leave it at that. The Marketing Council is not responsible to this Parliament. The only person who is responsible to this Parliament is the Minister, so he is the person who should bear that responsibility. In the past, under the old system, the Minister always had the veto, and if he was unable to accept the prices recommended by the farmers, the recommendation was referred back, but in the end the Minister determined the price in any event. However, this caused long delays and a lot of fuss and bother. Now we say that the Minister should do the work and accept the responsibility.</p>

<p>The greatest criticism was that we had not reduced the number of boards, that the 22 control boards were far too many. When we began the work of the commission our first objective was in fact to reduce the number of boards, these empires of which people spoke. We wanted to do this, but we could not. At any rate, we tried. We have 22 control boards, while Canada has 122, and they do not think they have too many. The annual cost entailed by these 22 boards is R13&#x00BD; million, while they control 80&#x0025; of the total agricultural products to the value of approximately R2 500 million. They do this at a cost of R13&#x00BD; million a year, which amounts to 0,6&#x0025;. This is a small amount indeed. There is a saying to the effect that one must not have control merely for the sake of control. Similarly, one cannot combine merely for the sake of combining. Surely there must be a good reason and a clear purpose to the whole set-up. We then considered what we could really combine. I think it was the <i>Farmer&#x2019;s Weekly</i> which said that the Maize Board and the Wheat Board should be combined, but the Maize Board and the Wheat Board each has its own buildings. So if those two were to be combined, a whole new complex would have to be built to accommodate all the officials, and what would this cost in these times of inflation? We even considered whether we could not use a joint computer service. We appointed an interdepartmental committee to investigate that possibility. Do hon. members know what they found? We found that not even this would be possible, because it would not pay.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think anyone will disagree with me if I say that the farmers of South Africa are proud of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. After all, they have good reason to be proud of him. I think that the whole of South Africa may also be proud of our agriculture, and when I refer to agriculture, I do not only mean the farmers who produce. I also mean the whole agricultural structure in which the various departments of agriculture are involved. This afternoon I want to convey my appreciation to the departments of agriculture that made it possible for us to institute inquiries into the marketing systems which are followed in South Africa and in other countries. Hence our appreciation for the work these departments have done,</p>

<p>There may be people who adopt an honest approach to agriculture; there are probably many people as well who have the interests of agriculture in South Africa at heart. However, <span class="col_8125-8126" refersTo="page_1393"/>I do not know of anyone who adopts a more honest approach to agriculture or who has the interests of agriculture more at heart than the hon. member for Bethal. Therefore, we as members of the commission were proud of him as chairman. Allow me to express appreciation to all the members of this commission for their enthusiastic cooperation. It was a privilege to be able to work together with those people. I also think that over the years that we worked together, a bond of friendship developed&#x2014;and here I am also referring to the bonds of friendship between members on that side of the House and members on this side of the House. It is a bond of which we, who served on that commission, are proud and for which we are also very grateful.</p>

<p>While we were carrying out this inquiry, we had the privilege of meeting agricultural leaders throughout the world. We were also able to hold intensive discussions with officials of various agricultural departments in various countries. One is grateful to be able to testify that we did not meet better farmers than those in South Africa. Nor did we meet officials anywhere who were so concerned with the interests of agriculture as the officials of the departments of agriculture in South Africa. They are among the most outstanding people one could hope to involve in such an industry as this.</p>

<p>On our return from our overseas tour we brought back a realization of the qualify of our farmers and administration. I think I shall be permitted to make a few general remarks at the outset about the report of this Commission of Inquiry into the Marketing Act. The following question may occur to the uninformed as well as to the outsider: Could this commission not have tabled a more dramatic and spectacular report? If one looks at our terms of reference superficially as well as our sphere of inquiry, it is probably possible to wonder whether this commission could not have tabled a more spectacular and dramatic report.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before we adjourned for lunch I was expressing appreciation of various members who cooperated to make this commission of inquiry possible for us and to make it a water-tight one. However, I unfortunately omitted to mention two people, for which I crave forgiveness. I should now like to express my appreciation towards them. In the first place I want to refer to our Deputy Minister, Mr. Malan, who took part in a portion of the inquiry and who, especially when we were overseas, gave us as members of the commission confidence with his dignified conduct and in this way also presented an image of South African agriculture overseas, which was sound and strong. We want to thank him for this. In the second place I want to refer to Dr. Claude van der Merwe, to whom reference already has been made. In the past week or so we heard that Dr. Van der Merwe lost his wife, and I think it is no more than right that we, as members of the commission as well as members of this House, should convey our sincere condolences to Dr. Claude van der Merwe. We want to assure him of our prayers at this time which cannot be an easy one for him.</p>

<p>Sir, before the adjournment I said that seen in a superficial sense, the uninformed person could possibly ask whether we could not have tabled a more dramatic or spectacular report. I think that one can react to this by saying that, had we not remained true to the terms of reference to which I have already referred and had we not been honest towards agriculture and the various control boards and marketing systems, it may perhaps have been possible to table a more dramatic and spectacular report. Consequently we could, in a report like this, have given wider powers to the control boards, or emasculated the control boards entirely. We could have also recommended that more control boards should be strictly limited and amalgamated. Had we done this, agriculture and the producers in South Africa would, however, have paid for it, and the consumer would have suffered as a result. I think that this is the spirit in which this report must be judged, because it was always the ideal of members of the commission to recommend nothing which would mean that the farmers in South Africa would suffer as a result or that the consumer in South Africa would have to pay more for it.</p>

<p>Sir, I think we agree that there was not much wrong with the marketing system and <span class="col_8127-8128" refersTo="page_1394"/>the system of control boards in South Africa. The more opportunity we had of studying other schemes and systems, the more we realized that in South Africa, something had developed which was suited to South African circumstances. I remember that the hon. member for Heilbron said jokingly on one occasion in Britain, after he had inspected their system, that the more people one meets, the fonder one becomes of one&#x2019;s dog. I think that this was also true of the system in South Africa. The more we saw, the more we realized that things have been created in South Africa which rests upon foundations which in turn had their origin in agriculture.</p>

<p>Sir, it is clear to me that, throughout the entire world, even in the EEC countries, there is a striving towards stability in agriculture and stability as far as food is concerned. This stability may be achieved by making sure of a few factors. The one is to create a sound price structure for the producer and on the other hand also to ensure that fair prices are paid by the consumer for food. This is a problem which is not experienced in South Africa alone, but which prevails throughout the world at the moment. Had the situation in South Africa been such that one could simply follow the economic law of supply and demand in a slavish manner, the problem would probably have been less significant. However, the circumstances in South Africa are of such a nature that one cannot adhere strictly to this law. This is as a result of the interindependence of the various commodities or the various branches of the industry but also as a result of the agricultural structure in South Africa which, other than in other countries, is to a large degree aimed at exporting surpluses to the free West. Because we in South Africa are faced with this problem, it is necessary that we should be doubly careful here and guard carefully against introducing artificiality into our agriculture.</p>

<p>In his speech the hon. member for Newton Park indicated that he is opposed to the recommendations of the gradual removal of subsidies. Unfortunately, one of the factors which is responsible for artificiality in the agricultural industry is in fact the subsidy system. I am afraid that we shall have to look at all forms of subsidization because subsidies make it very difficult to determine the real power of the producer or of the industry. On the one hand it is just as difficult to give an opinion of the buying ability of the consumer or the consumer demand. Therefore we want to ask that the gradual elimination of subsidies also be used to remove artificiality from the agricultural industry in South Africa, because we will end up in a maze with this artificiality so that when we have to return to reality, the shock to the producer on the one hand and the consumer on the other will be all the greater.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bethlehem was quite correct when he said that there is a degree of disappointment at the fact that the commission did not find it possible after their exhaustive analysis of the situation to put forward more radical proposals for the changing of the marketing situation in South Africa. I think it is natural that there should be disappointment because before the commission sat to investigate the position there was a general belief on the part of both producers and consumers in South Africa that there was a great deal wrong with marketing in South Africa. From the point of view of the producer, who felt the pinch with increasing production costs and who saw the difference between the price received for his products and the price at which the same products were being sold to the consumer, it was naturally believed that there was something very wrong with the marketing system in South Africa. Indeed, there was a great deal of suspicion and criticism in respect of the control boards, the Department of Agriculture and all other organizations and people involved with marketing.</p>

<p>It is equally true that the consumer in South Africa, who is under tremendous pressure as a result of inflation and the erosion of the value of money, is also aware of the wide gap between the price the farmer received for his produce and the price the consumer had to pay over the counter for the same produce. The consumer was also of opinion that there was something very wrong with the process of marketing, the process of distribution and the retail process as far as agricultural produce was concerned. Naturally, since it was the marketing system that was under suspicion on the part of both the consumer and the producer, there was the expectation that the report of the commission would put forward proposals that would radically change the <span class="col_8129-8130" refersTo="page_1395"/>marketing system in South Africa. I want to emphasize that there is disappointment that such a change did not come about but that at the same time the criticism has been muted. In other words, the critics of this report have not found any glaring examples where the commission failed to carry out its responsibilities.</p>

<p>After having studied the commission&#x2019;s report, having read all the criticism that is available and having generally looked at the situation, I believe that under the circumstances the commission has done a good job and that its recommendations will in fact lead to an improvement. However, I believe that what we should be doing in this debate is to ask ourselves whether the commission has gone far enough and whether its proposals will bring about, firstly, an improvement in the income of the producer; secondly, whether it will bring about an improvement in the efficiency of marketing and of distribution; and, thirdly, whether it will bring about a stabilization in the prices the consumer has to pay. I believe it is important that in this debate we should apply ourselves to looking at the recommendations and attempting to analyse to what extent the recommendations will meet the requirements that were set out for the commission at the outset. The commission gave attention to the relationship between the producer on the one side and the control boards and the National Marketing Council on the other side. The commission came to a number of conclusions. One of the most important conclusions is embodied in one of the recommendations made by the commission, namely that the National Marketing Council is to be considerably strengthened in respect of its status, its powers and the work it is going to do. I believe that this is one of the good and meaningful recommendations made by the commission. They have now created a marketing council which will have more status and more power, and which, we hope, will be more effective in controlling the marketing processes in South Africa. They have defined the task of the marketing council as being essentially economic in nature, and they have decided that there should be six full-time competent economists on the council. Obviously, by also deciding that the Minister will be the final arbiter or final decision-maker as far as prices and margins are concerned&#x2014; based on consultation with the marketing council after receiving recommendations from the boards&#x2014;they have also created a situation which can result in more stability, in decisions being taken sooner and in a more effective process of marketing.</p>

<p>I would like to deal with a few of the recommendations made by the council. One of the recommendations touches on a difference of opinion between the hon. member for Newton Park and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. That is the recommendation which deals with the interests of the consumer, particularly as far as consumer subsidies are concerned. I believe that, in a country like South Africa, where a large percentage of the population live below the breadline and are finding it increasingly difficult to afford even the minimum essentials as far as foodstuffs are concerned, we must be very careful indeed before we do away with the subsidy in terms of basic necessities, such as butter, bread, mealie meal and so forth.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. member for Newton Park is correct in this respect. These selected, basic and absolutely essential foodstuffs are vital for a large percentage of the population of South Africa in order to keep body and soul together. Remember that the hon. the Minister himself said at Gazankulu that thousands of people in South Africa were starving. Of course, he was correct in saying that. In respect of subsidies on those foodstuffs, it is an essential socio-economic service that the Government has to render to tens of thousands of people in South Africa living below the breadline, and it would be wicked if subsidies in respect of those foodstuffs were to be abolished.</p>

<p>Although the commission has recommended that consumer representation on the control board should be removed, I believe that it is a bad recommendation. The important point is this. All consumers are vitally affected by agriculture, by the purchase of the products of agriculture and by the distribution of the products of agriculture, as well as by the processing of the products of agriculture. It is all very well to say that consumers will have an opportunity&#x2014;once every six months, or once a year&#x2014;of consulting with the National Marketing Council or its chairman. However, that will be more by way of a post mortem of the results of increased prices than by an actual analysis of what can be done about things before increases occur. I believe that consumer representatives should sit in on the decision <span class="col_8131-8132" refersTo="page_1396"/>making processes, when decisions are taken in order to enable them at that stage to bring to attention their requirements or the requirements of the people that they represent.</p>

<p>I believe it is very important that this particular point should be carefully considered. I would like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to see to it that this is done, that the consumer in South Africa will not be left out of the process of decision making which affects the pricing, the processing and distribution of consumer products. The consumer should be a vital and integral part of the processing all along the line. It cannot be done by a casual meeting once every six months or once a year between the National Marketing Council and the Consumer Council. One of the other recommendations I think one should comment on, is in regard to the levies which are raised by control boards. I should like to underwrite the relevant recommendations in the report which say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The control board should raise only such levies as are essential and reasonable to carry out the administration of their bodies and they should not seek to raise large reserve funds by way of levies.</block>

<p>The most important recommendation of all is most probably the one dealing with the merging of the Dairy Board and the Milk Board. I believe that the most important recommendation of that commission relates to this field, and the hon. the Minister should react on that recommendation immediately.</p>

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the chairman of this commission may pat himself and the members of his commission on the back for the report which they brought out, especially if it satisfies the members of the party sitting on the benches next to mine. It is an exceptional achievement to satisfy even this party, which is so critical of everything being done in this country. I should like to take this opportunity to thank the hon. member who has just resumed his seat for his fine, positive contribution in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to a few points which he criticized. Perhaps I can put matters in the correct perspective. As far as consumers&#x2019; representation is concerned, I think the hon. member for Bethal has already dealt with this. I should like to add that the meeting with the Co-ordinating Consumers&#x2019; Council which is envisaged, will not be a post-mortem, but a meeting which will take place at the initial stages, at the beginning of the year, before prices have been determined. In other words, the consumers will have a full say in the matter of determining prices, the flow of the product, etc., at the start of the season concerned.</p>

<p>A point in respect of which the hon. member, in my opinion, was somewhat wide off the mark relates to the fact that the commission recommended that control boards were to have as little as possible to do with the further processing of agricultural products. In other words, since the report states that the processing of agricultural products should be chiefly in the hands of the private sector, it is only right that as far as the processing of the product is concerned, consumers are to have very little say on control boards.</p>

<p>I should also like to express my gratitude and appreciation for the fact that I could serve on this commission. One is amazed at one&#x2019;s ignorance when one participates in an in-depth inquiry, such as the one we made. One is also amazed at the scope of agriculture. I should like to agree with the hon. member for Bethlehem that agriculture is one of the most comprehensive industries in this country, and to me it was a privilege to have served on a commission of this kind. I should also like to express my appreciation to the Government for having afforded us the opportunity of making a short study of agricultural marketing abroad. Once again I want to agree with several other members that, although we learned a great deal during our visits abroad, we are also grateful for the fact that we may be agriculturalists under the provisions of our Marketing Act and under our Ministry of agriculture. I think that we are privileged in this.</p>

<p>One aspect of the commission&#x2019;s report which will most probably elicit most discussion and most criticism, is the recommendations concerning the meat scheme. I should like to go into the recommendations in some detail. Hon. members will know that an investigation was conducted into the meat scheme, as mentioned in the commission&#x2019;s report, from as far back as 1950-&#x2019;51. Reading the reports as well as the recommendations contained in them, one sees that all of them wanted to move away from too much control. In other words, all the commissions, and some <span class="col_8133-8134" refersTo="page_1397"/>of the minority reports as well, recommended a freer marketing of meat in the country. The 1972 commission made a few recommendations, especially in respect of auction service abattoirs in the controlled area of Johannesburg and Pretoria, so as to make it possible that animals be sold by means of negotiation prior to such animals being slaughtered. Another recommendation was that private bodies be enabled to bring cattle for slaughter to their own abattoirs for their own account. The hon. the Minister immediately approved of these two very important recommendations, but for various reasons they were not implemented and the auction service abattoirs were never built. The point I want to make, is that the 1972 commission also felt very strongly about creating a freer marketing system for meat in the country. By means of this recommendation they tried to bring this about although, as I have just said, this was never carried into effect.</p>

<p>Our commission, together with the 1972 commission as well as many others, was of the opinion that there should be a change-over to a free system of marketing, at public service abattoirs as well. Our recommendations in this connection are briefly as follows: Firstly, we recommend the total abolition of the compulsory on-the-hook auctions&#x2014;in other words there is to be no obligation that meat supplied, has to be auctioned&#x2014;secondly, producers are to be allowed to slaughter livestock at the service abattoirs and sell the meat by means of negotiation; in the third place, however, commerce should also be allowed to bring livestock for slaughtering, livestock for which they have concluded negotiations with farmers in advance; the fourth point is not really a recommendation, but a statement that the commission foresees a day when slaughtering will take place in the production areas and carcasses will be graded in those areas and sold in the controlled areas by means of a catalogue.</p>

<p>For the record I should like to rectify something with regard to a report which appeared in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> and <i>E.P. Herald</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Farmers should also be allowed to slaughter on farms and bring the carcasses, which must be properly graded, into the towns for auction or private sale.</block>

<p>I forgive these gentlemen for this statement, because the report may be somewhat difficult for them to read. I do feel, however, that the matter should be rectified. It creates a very poor impression if it is said that farmers will be allowed to slaughter on their farms and transport the carcasses to the controlled areas. With the development of marketing, and especially with the development in respect of the fattening of cattle, it can now be made possible for producer to enter into contracts with certain dealers in advance and to deliver over a period at an agreed price of course&#x2014; that is to say, if the recommendations are accepted. After all, this is a modern approach to marketing and also creates confidence in an industry if one is able to do something of this kind.</p>

<p>Sir, my time is running out and I should still like to say something with regard to butcheries. Here our recommendations are revolutionary, but I think we need revolutionary action in this regard now. In past years, there was good reason for the limited powers of registration of the Meat Board. However, the commission is of the opinion that it is no longer in the interests of the meat industry for the Meat Board to have limited powers of registration henceforth, but that there should be a form of formal registration only. We have a Hygiene Act which lays down in any event how meat is to be marketed in a butchery, and we do not think it is in the interests of the industry that these powers be exercised any further and consequently we recommend that it be abolished altogether. I do not believe we have ever given supply and demand a full opportunity of coming into its own in this respect in the past. In addition we recommend that restrictions on butchery hours, which are very limited at present, be abolished. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, like the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet, I should also like to express my thanks for the fact that the commission had the privilege of visiting overseas countries and of comparing our system and the systems there. It was a great privilege and the visits produced valuable information. I should just like to mention here that each of the groups drew up a separate short report on their findings. These reports could naturally not be included in the main report, and I just wondered whether the hon. <span class="col_8135-8136" refersTo="page_1398"/>the Minister could not consider making these short reports available to interested parties at a convenient time because they really contain very important information.</p>

<p>I should like to give the House a few of the impressions produced by the overseas visits, because I think they should be placed on the record. The first thing which I want to mention is that we found throughout the world that agricultural marketing must be co-ordinated and that this is supported by the various Governments. We found that in the European Economic Community in particular they go so far as to protect their producers against imports, for the specific purpose of guaranteeing a stable price and income for their producers. I think it is very important that countries which concentrate so much on their own economies should give such priority to agriculture. I just want to point out that the EEC is going to gain in importance in future. It began as an organization of nine member countries which broke down internal walls. Today it has developed to such an extent that apart from the nine member countries, there are another 47 associated countries. This shows us that the EEC is going to occupy a very important place in the marketing of agricultural products in the world in future. I think it will become the predominant power bloc as far as agriculture is concerned. I know it will be very difficult for us here in South Africa to become an associated member of the EEC, but I think that this is something which we should always bear in mind. We must make every attempt to be admitted to it. They are going to become a completely independent bloc which will need nothing from anyone else, because they are so large and because they will have such an immense coverage.</p>

<p>Another important impression which I received during the visit abroad was the important role which co-operatives play in organized marketing, the attention which is paid to them by the Government when it comes to price determinations, to negotiations concerning imports and exports and to all the other measures which are taken in connection with agriculture. Agricultural corporations also have a wide coverage in other countries. One finds in our own country that the co-operatives are very easily criticized. The matter was recently raised in the newspapers once again when co-operatives were accused <i>inter alia</i> of being octopus-like. We found that in other countries co-operatives play a role in many spheres which they have not yet even entered in our country. For example, as far as banking is concerned, co-operatives provide for their own financial requirements there. I think that co-operatives are very important and that this is the case throughout the world. We saw that in other countries co-operatives have succeeded in entering spheres which have not yet been entered in South Africa. As far as the marketing of perishable products is concerned, we saw, for example, that in the Netherlands, co-operatives market flowers successfully, and that co-operatives in Italy market vegetables in a very successful way to the advantage of their producers. We need not be afraid of giving our full support to co-operatives, because they are a very essential and a very necessary means for marketing agricultural products.</p>

<p>A third impression I received was how essential it is for us to obtain more coordination in connection with our exports. I think that we in South Africa still give too little attention as a rule to earning currency for our country by means of agriculture. Agricultural products are the only commodities which renew themselves. For this reason it is essential that there should be greater coordination in our exports. An inquiry has been conducted as to whether it is not perhaps possible for the control boards which already have export organizations to act in concert. It will not be easy to bring this about, but I think that this is a sphere which must be investigated. I think this is one of the tasks we can entrust to the new Marketing Council, to try and do more in connection with export and in connection with its co-ordination. It appeared, for example, that France has a collective sales drive known as Sopexa which does tremendously good work. It is a voluntary organization of which anyone may become a member, not only producers, but manufacturers as well. The organization has collective offices and accomplishes a great task.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the great asset which exports can be as far as the earning of foreign currency is concerned. This was proved to be the case in Israel in particular, where they have an organization known as Agrexco which goes so far as to tell the farmer what he should plant, something we have always fought shy of in South Africa, they find a market for the farmer&#x2019;s product and they guarantee him a price for the product. I think that we have <span class="col_8137-8138" refersTo="page_1399"/>always been a little too careful, with the result that we have not gone far enough in helping the farmers in this way in order to promote exports. Another impression which I received is in connection with the marketing of products which have hitherto been free of control and the possibilities of creating marketing arrangements for these products as well. In the United States with its free economy they have what they call &#x201C;marketing orders&#x201D; which enable a group of farmers to get together and obtain legal powers to market their products collectively. Meetings of all interested parties are held and a scheme is drawn up. Once the scheme has been drawn up, it is a collective attempt and may be used by the farmers to co-ordinate their marketing. This works very well, and I think that provision should definitely be made in the new Marketing Act for uncontrolled products and especially perishable products to make use of this type of system. I just want to say that if we have schemes like this, we must remember that the best background for a scheme like this is still the agricultural co-operative, where the farmers come together voluntarily and decide to market their products collectively. I also want to express my thanks, just as other hon. members have done, towards the chairman for the way he led the commission. It was not an easy task. We worked for hours and hours at a stretch, and his patience was tried on many occasions. The work which was done by commission reminds me of what the chairman of the Belgian Farmers&#x2019; Association told us after we had been in conference with them for hours. I may just say in passing that it was not an easy conference, because they had a whole lot of cigars on the table and everyone smoked. After a while the room was so dark that one could not see anything. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet dealt with the meat position and the hon. member for Humansdorp with the vegetable position. In the nature of things of course, because I served with them on the commission, I agree with them.</p>

<p>When the time for my previous turn to speak expired I was dealing with the criticism expressed by various organizations in regard to the report. I was in the process of saying why it was not possible for us to amalgamate more control boards. I dealt with this in considerable detail. During the lunch adjournment I again read the criticism expressed by <i>Die Landbou Weekblad,</i> and they specifically mentioned why we could not amalgamate the Wool Board and the Mohair Board, and also why the Deciduous Fruit Board, the Dried Fruit Board and the Canned Fruit Board could not be amalgamated. At first glance, it seems very easy to amalgamate them. But take, for example, the Dried Fruit Board. The general impression is that it deals with ordinary fruit. However, that is not the case. It deals with raisins, sultanas, prunes and other produce grown along the Orange River, products more properly associated with the wine industry, and not at all with deciduous fruit as such. The result is that it is virtually impossible to amalgamate the two boards. If one takes the example of the Wool Board and the Mohair Board, they appear to be the two which may most logically be amalgamated. But the Mohair Board functions exceptionally well and has its head office in Port Elizabeth. The head office of the Wool Board, however, is in Pretoria. New buildings will therefore have to be erected. If the Mohair Board had to be incorporated with the Wool Board, it would have to receive representation on the Wool Board. We have already tried to keep these boards as small as possible and to limit them to a maximum of 11 members. Everyone is aware that a large body cannot function. So we left the door open, and said that in certain cases the Marketing Council could investigate the matter further and see whether they could not perhaps bring about an amalgamation. Merely to speak of amalgamation in the air simply does not work out. <i>Die Landbouweekblad</i> went on to say that the commission could have said more about the waste product story. In this respect I want to agree with them wholeheartedly, namely that it was entirely impossible for us to have investigated the waste product story, quite apart from the fact that it did not fall within our terms of reference either. However, I think the Wool Board has caused the matter to be investigated. It is imperative, and I think the hon. the Minister has the report in that regard. Something drastic will have to be done in regard to the waste product story, for the position prevailing there is scandalous.</p>

<p>The other point of criticism, the most poisonous criticism, came from the &#x201C;Business Times&#x201D; section of the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 23 <span class="col_8139-8140" refersTo="page_1400"/>May 1976. This was an article written by Mr. Toni Koenderman. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Free enterprise lashes out at octopus grip of the co-operatives.</block>

<p>I want to say at once that an investigation into the co-operative movement did not fall within the scope of the terms of reference of this commission. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Though the report makes some concessions to private sector sentiments, these are dismissed as window-dressing which fails to come to grips with the real problems. Probably the worst iniquity of the present system is the legally enforced domination of agricultural control boards by producers, almost all of whom are members or even directors of co-operatives.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>No, in fact I am now going to criticize him. He makes it clear that what he is objecting to is the producer majorities on control boards. Are the farmers that produced the wheat or raised their own sheep&#x2014;and who have paid their levies&#x2014;not entitled to be in the majority on the control board? Would the industrialists under the FCI or any industrial body allow producers to be in the majority or would they themselves retain the majority representation? Could we have been expected to have arranged the system differently? That hon. gentleman was making a distinct insinuation when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; control boards by producers, almost all of whom are members or even directors of co-operatives.</block>

<p>I concede that to a certain extent he has a point there. There are many of those control board members who are directors of co-operatives. However, in this commission, we went out of our way to make it impossible for them to discriminate against private enterprise. We removed the determination of the final price from the control boards and placed it in the hands of the hon. the Minister. That was consequently why the <i>Landbouweekblad</i> was criticizing us.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Are they a disgrace? Well, then why do you not stand up and speak about that. I shall prefer to ignore that argument of course, because it comes from &#x201C;big business&#x201D;. We have also done away with restrictive registration, as the hon. member for Graaff Reinet mentioned here. Free enterprise may now take its course, except of course in a few cases, for example in the case of wheat millers, bakers, the distributors of milk and in certain cases the packers of dried fruit. These are all cases where we have retained it. Where we have retained it, however, the control board no longer has the final say. We have established an impartial body, with a person with a legal background as chairman. What more should we have done? As far as quotas are concerned, the control boards cannot favour the cooperatives either, for we have made the allocation of quotas subject to the approval of the hon. the Minister. What more should we have done? On this matter, however, the hon. gentleman has this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; these are dismissed as window-dressing.</block>

<p>What more should we have done? He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Rising fury in the private sector at the growing power of agricultural co-operatives was intensified this week by the publication of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Marketing Act.</block>

<p>How can he say a thing like this when we have in fact made major concessions to private enterprise? Is that fair? In regard to the producer majority, he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission not only says this should be perpetuated, but even recommends that consumer representation on the board should be scrapped.</block>

<p>I think the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet dealt with this very well. After all, we went out of our way in this regard, and I now want to ask the following question: What exactly must a consumer do on a control board? What <span class="col_8141-8142" refersTo="page_1401"/>must he do on the Wool Board? What must a woman representing consumers do on the Wool Board? What must such a person do on the Lucerne Board or the Maize Board? The price is no longer being determined there, and we have gone even further. After all, we have devised a far better plan than that. As the hon. member said, the Marketing Council, the body which recommends the prices, holds talks every year with the Co-ordinating Consumers Board. At that conference on agricultural prospects they can discuss the matter of prices. They have representation there and are able to state their case there. This is also the reply to the hon. member for Bryanston. But, Sir, this writer went further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The result of the existing system is that the producers have been able to fix their own prices.</block>

<p>Sir, that is simply not true. We have placed this in the hands of the Minister. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to congratulate the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town on two very responsible and well-considered speeches he has made today. I do not wish to give him the kiss of death, but I should like to tell him that those speeches would have been excellent as maiden speeches here in the NP benches.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to devote myself today to a different aspect from those that have been discussed by hon. members up to now. Firstly, I should like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed listening to persons who had been involved with the Commission of Inquiry into the Marketing Act. They have described the position to us in a wonderful way today and I thank them for it. However, I wish to confine myself to the problems of the small farmers or, as they are often called, the owners of uneconomical units. I am very much aware of the general tendency in the world, and especially in America, where they say, &#x201C;Get bigger, get better or get out.&#x201D; I want to say that that tendency is perhaps catching on very strongly in South Africa. Sir, I do not for one moment wish to defend bad farming methods or incompetence in agriculture. On the contrary. I believe it is true that only the most competent farmers will survive, but that picture also has a reverse side, and it will not do us any harm to dwell on that for a few moments.</p>

<p>Before I proceed with my argument, I should like to pay tribute to our Minister and our Deputy Minister. I have found them tremendously sympathetic every time I have gone to them with a specific case of hardship. That applies especially in respect of the smaller farmers. I thank them for this, and it has given me the confidence to make a plea to them today to give attention to a big problem which I know is very important to them. In this regard I should also like to suggest a solution with due deference.</p>

<p>When we talk about the small farmer, the farmer with the so-called uneconomical unit, we should ask where we usually find these farmers. There is no standing rule, but we find them most often in those parts of the country with a low rainfall, with an irregular rainfall, and in remote places on river banks where transport is not available and the markets are far away, for those places do not offer good investment possibilities to the big investors of capital. Therefore, those farmers live in remote, drought-stricken parts of the country. Let me put it this way: You will not find them on those farms about which they say, &#x201C;There the farming is done by the windmill and his neighbour. &#x2019; &#x2019; Perhaps there are people who will say that it is generally known that a very large percentage of our very capable officials and industrialists come from those areas where the small farmer with his uneconomical unit is to be found, so perhaps it would be wise for the other brother, too, rather to come and work in the Public Service or in industry. My immediate reply to that is a loud and clear &#x201C;No&#x201D;. There are various reasons for my saying that. In the limited time available to me I shall refer to a few of them. The first reason is that South Africa cannot do without them. When we consider that 80&#x0025; of the agricultural products are produced by 10&#x0025; of the farmers&#x2014;the hon. the Minister must correct me if I am wrong &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>All right, let it be 20&#x0025;. This being the case, we realize that there are a large number of farmers who are responsible for the other 20&#x0025; of the agricultural produce. Without that 20&#x0025; South Africa will not be able to cope. Without them we <span class="col_8143-8144" refersTo="page_1402"/>shall have a shortage of food. That is my first argument. My second argument is that those farmers are pioneers. If we had not had those farmers in the arid parts of Namaqualand, for example, i.e. in the hardeveld, we would not have had the mines there today. They have done pioneering work. There is another reason I should like to suggest. They did not only open up that part of the world; they are maintaining it still. They maintain the church and the schools there. Large parts of South Africa will fall into disuse if we do not have those small farmers to support and maintain them.</p>

<p>The most important reason is perhaps that South Africa would suffer an irreparable loss of character and human material if those people had to leave the country to come and live in the towns, for then they would become different people. Those young men and women who come from the rural areas and who suffered hardships there introduce a leavening agent into our national life and our cities. I always feel very proud when I think about the time when I made a remark about the excellent behaviour of the girls in one of our hostels, and the headmaster of the hostel told me: &#x201C;You know, these are the girls who come from those parts where the small farmer comes from.&#x201D; The hardships had made these girls examples to others.</p>

<p>I should like to leave it at that. I wish to hurry to get to the solution, because time may catch up with me before I come to that. The first solution always remains the consolidation of the worst cases&#x2014;but then I wish to add that I am speaking about voluntary consolidation. I should like to pay tribute to the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure for the manner in which they go out of their way, the manner in which they almost lean over backwards to render assistance in cases of consolidation. I appreciate it. I believe that every person in South Africa will have appreciation for it, appreciation for the manner in which the department goes out of its way in order to be of assistance. I should like to thank the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister for the way in which they have time and again gone out of their way to be of assistance whenever I have come to them with problems of this nature.</p>

<p>However, that is not all I wish to speak about. Many people try to create the impression that the small farmer should not be assisted, because he will then be kept in the rural areas. As far as I am concerned, this is a wrong approach. I believe that we should assist those small farmers who are in the rural areas and who see their way clear to remaining there and to leading an independent life. The form of assistance to them I should like to advocate here today is not financial assistance, although people are often too much inclined to think about that only.</p>

<p>Let us analyse the big problem of the small farmer today. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to identify myself with the hon. member for Namaqualand and to congratulate the Wentzel Commission on their enlightening and important report. For practical reasons I am able to support all the recommendations&#x2014;with one exception&#x2014;which are included in the commission&#x2019;s report. Unfortunately I do not have time to quote all the paragraphs concerned for the purposes of my argument. However, they are found in full on pages 79 and 80 of the report. It concerns the principle of statutory contributions from agricultural control board funds to the S.A. Agricultural Union. With respect, I should like to say that in my humble opinion it did not fall within the terms of reference of the commission to seek sources of revenue for the S.A. Agricultural Union. I should like to read one paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die georganiseerde landbou beklemtoon die belangrikheid van &#x2019;n sterk landbouorganisasie. Na sy mening baat alle produsente by die verbeterings wat deur sy toedoen daargestel word. Alle produsente moet dus deel in die koste van die organisasie.</block>

<p>The commission heard evidence in favour of these arguments, and also against it. The commission then made this recommendation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die kommissie beveel nietemin aan dat die beginsel aanvaar word van &#x2019;n statut&#x00EA;re insameling van fondse ter gedeeltelike finansiering van die organisatoriese uitgawe van die S.A. Landbou-unie.</block>

<p>I disagree with the S.A. Agricultural Union&#x2019;s contention that all farmers should share the <span class="col_8145-8146" refersTo="page_1403"/>costs of this organization because they benefit by its activities. I am definitely not denying the service which the S.A. Agricultural Union renders to agriculture in South Africa; in fact, I have a very high appreciation for it. However, I object to the principle of a compulsory statutory contribution. Everyone in this country enjoys the benefit of law and order, of progress and prosperity and of security and stability created by the rule of the NP. However, not all voters are members of the NP; in fact, the NP has many enemies and has to persuade people to join it by means of its policy and its actions. Even then they have a free choice whether to contribute towards its funds or not.</p>

<p>The S.A. Agricultural Union, which is a voluntary organization, ought to carry out its self-imposed task with the assistance of its registered members. It should persuade people to join it by means of its policy and its actions. Whatever the service rendered by the S.A. Agricultural Union to agriculture in South Africa, or to State departments, or to control boards, as is implied in the report&#x2014;just as the NP Government serves the whole South Africa&#x2014;there can be no question of a compulsory statutory contribution. I trust that the hon. the Minister will not accept this particular recommendation, because there are literally thousands of farmers, in all the branches of agriculture, who are not members of organized agriculture. Why should we anger them by accepting a recommendation of this nature?</p>

<p>I shall leave the report at that. I should like to refer to the importance of the maize industry in South Africa. While I am referring to this, I should also like to express my regret at the failure of the negotiations which took place with a view to a reconciliation between the S.A. Agricultural Union and the S.A. Maize Producers&#x2019; Institute. I know that the hon. the Minister exerted himself for a reconciliation of this kind for three years and I am sorry that it did not succeed. I believe that it would have been in the interests of the maize industry had a reconciliation like this been brought about. I also hope that the final possibilities for negotiation have not disappeared. I should also like to express my regret at the fact that, rightly or wrongly, Sampi has been identified as a political pressure group.</p>

<p>If one looks at the large contribution made by the maize industry to a variety of sectors within our national economy, it can be best illustrated by the following paragraph, which I am now going to read from <i>Mielienuus</i> of October 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die mielienywerheid speel &#x2019;n belangrike sosio-ekonomiese rol in die volkshuishouding. Dit bied die land sy belangrikste voedselbron in sowel volume as waarde. Deur middel van uitvoer bring die nywerheid waardevolle buitelandse valuta in. Van ewe groot belang is die feit dat dit werk vir baie duisende mense verskaf en &#x2019;n groot afsetgebied vir kapitaal-en verbruikersgoedere bied, en aldus tot die maatskaplike en ekonomiese stabiliteit van platteland-Suid-Afrika bydra.</block>

<p>This is the importance of the maize industry and our future position with respect to food production in South Africa is connected with this. I now want to read from <i>Food Industries of South Africa</i> of February 1976, in which the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There has been a spectacular decline in world grain stocks over the past few years and the inadequate long-term production performance is cause for grave concern about the world&#x2019;s food situation. World food production now totals around 1,3 milliard tons of grains and cereals, 87 million tons of meat and 70 million tons of fish and shell fish&#x2014;which will all too soon be grossly inadequate to feed the booming population. Already experts and analysts are calling the looming decade the &#x201C;Empty Eighties&#x201D; and calling for urgent measures to deal with a situation which will see South Africa facing a grain shortage of 1,8 million tons by 1985 and a probable deficit of 7,3 million tons by the year 2000.</block>

<p>Therefore the world has every reason to be concerned about its food position, but South Africa must be doubly concerned about it, because hunger, much more than relations problems, may become the cause of violence in South Africa. The statistics and the projection I have mentioned give cause for concern even now. For this reason South Africa has to move quickly in order to ward off the danger, because this danger is even greater than any foreign threat which we have experienced until now. The statesman of the future will be the one who encourages and enables his people to <span class="col_8147-8148" refersTo="page_1404"/>produce sufficient food. In the future it will not be Russian weapons which will be the instrument of negotiation, but a daily portion of food for every hungry person. Therefore it is extremely important that a highly specialized and co-ordinated development programme, with a view to the production of food, should be brought into being even at this early stage between South Africa, the homelands and its neighbouring States, as a part of the economic power bloc for Southern Africa to which the hon. the Prime Minister has already referred. We can rightly tell our neighbours that South Africa can produce successfully under the most extreme climatic conditions, because we have the necessary technique and knowledge. We are prepared to share that knowledge with Africa in an attempt to make this mighty continent a better, happier dwelling-place of this for all.</p>

<p>In view of the extreme climatic conditions to which I have referred, I should like to say a few words as a result of the abundant rains of the past season, about the particular problems which arose in my constituency. During the 1973-&#x2019;74 harvest the crops failed as a result of drought. However, this was followed by two good harvests and we succeeded in settling our debts to a large extent. However, we had not yet recovered financially when this year&#x2019;s natural disaster once again struck a large part of my constituency. In one single magisterial district, namely Bothaville, where I live, the harvest losses of maize oil seeds and grain sorghum has been conservatively estimated at R18 million. This is apart from the immense damage as a result of soil erosion and soil exhaustion. It will take us another two or three years to settle the new debts. In practice it means that for four years, our farming operations have gained us nothing as far as personal income is concerned.</p>

<p>I should like to make the statement that many farmers in my constituency will not survive this, because the financial effect of the new debt is not only limited to the next two or three years in which we have to repay it, but we shall have to struggle with it for years to come, because machinery and implements are worn out after a period of about six years. These will have to be replaced with expensive capital if we want to continue to produce. In the course of a good number of years to come, many of our farmers will go out of business as a result of the disaster years which we experienced. This will not be because we are impractical or uneconomic farmers. No, some of our best and most efficient young farmers will fall in this group. It is no use telling me that I am being over-pessimistic. I know the industry and the people I am talking about. Therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister for his personal assurance that not one of these afflicted farmers will be bought out as a result of the agricultural debt which has piled up against him during the two disaster years. I ask this because every one of them has a task to fulfil in South Africa&#x2019;s giant food production programme, now and in the future. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Parys ended with a plea to the hon. the Minister that he and his department should at least have some sympathy towards the members of the farming community who have suffered two years&#x2019; loss in a row.</p>

<p>I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that the hon. member for Parys carries our wholehearted support in what he had to say.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parys also spoke about the mealie industry, an industry which is important to all sectors of agriculture in this country. It is for that reason that I added a footnote to that section in the commission&#x2019;s report which stressed that when either the hon. the Minister or the Cabinet committee I recommended decides on the price of maize, it has to decide on that price in conjunction with the prices of other commodities as well. The prices of other commodities are dependent on the price of maize. It is important that those prices should be announced to be considered and announced simultaneously. The hon. the Minister knows that this is not only my own personal viewpoint. He knows that he has had representations along these lines from the S.A. Agricultural Union as well. I believe the hon. the Minister has to give very serious consideration to the footnote I added to that particular recommendation of the commission, particularly because of the very points that were mentioned by the hon. member for Parys.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parys started by querying one of the recommendations of the commission which was decided on unanimously. I am referring to the recommendations that control boards should be allowed to levy their members a certain amount based on the value of their products and that they should be <span class="col_8149-8150" refersTo="page_1405"/>allowed to hand that money over to the S.A. Agricultural Union to help it with its administrative costs. The hon. member for Parys is wrong with the construction he has placed on that recommendation. This is not a mandatory recommendation at all, but a recommendation that the hon. the Minister should empower the boards voluntarily to do so. I ask hon. members with tears in my eyes: If the producers of that particular commodity are happy and satisfied&#x2014;because they have a majority on their control boards&#x2014;to pay such a levy to be handed to the S.A. Agricultural Union, I cannot see the hon. member for Parys having any arguments in regard to this.</p>

<p>While talking about this, I should like to get something else off my mind. I believe that every farmer and every producer in this country today has a duty to belong to the S.A. Agricultural Union. He can do that through his local farmers&#x2019; association, through his provincial union and so through the S.A. Agricultural Union. My appeal to every single farm in this country is to get together behind organized agriculture, behind the one body which can speak on behalf of all agriculture in this country, and that is the S.A. Agricultural Union. For the first time it has been recommended that the S.A. Agricultural Union should be acknowledged statutorily in regard to the whole question of the marketing of agricultural products and the fixing of prices. This I believe is another reason why every farmer should now become a member of that organization. Sir, I repeat my appeal to every farmer to join his agricultural organization. Before I go any further, I should like to place on record my appreciation &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, I am glad that the hon. member hangs his head in shame &#x2026; [Interjections.]&#x2026; and that he is now leaving the Chamber. Sir, I was about to speak of the hon. member for Bethal, who was the chairman of this commission, and to place on record my appreciation of the way in which he handled the proceedings of that commission, of the work he personally put in and also for the way in which he conducted the proceedings. I must say, as the minority representative on that commission, that I appreciate the way in which he conducted affairs, particularly his patience although it must have been sorely tried on many occasions. There were times when discussions became a little heated but yet he never lost his temper. I also want to express my appreciation to my colleagues on that commission for the friendship that existing in that commission. Out of that has come this report, a report which I believe is going to be good for agriculture, on condition that the hon. the Minister accepts what the hon. member for Bethal said and in regard to which I want to support him. He says that this report has to be looked at as a whole.</p>

<p>*The Minister must please not peck at this report, single out a few items at random, reject this and accept that. He must please consider the report as an entity and apply all the recommendations in the report.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I wish to say that although he knows that there are eight or 10 footnotes which have been added in my name, where I had a slight difference of opinion with the majority of the members of the commission, I want to urge the Minister that when he considers that report he can apply either of two alternatives which are placed before him in each of those instances. If we deal with the Marketing Council, for instance, where the majority of the members suggested that the Marketing Council should consist of six full-time members, I want to put it to him that I believe that agriculture requires <span class="col_8151-8152" refersTo="page_1406"/>the knowledge and the expertise which can be brought to the marketing of agricultural products through representatives of commerce and industry, of the consumers in whatever guise, whether processors, industrialists or even housewives. I believe that the place for that representation is not on the control board, as we have it today, but that it is on the National Marketing Council. That is why I made the recommendation which I made. I do not believe that it is necessary for all the members of the National Marketing Council to be there full-time. I believe that the six full-time members recommended can act as an executive, and that the part-time members can meet in general meetings and there give the benefit of their advice. I also believe that, while dealing with the marketing council, there is one other point where I cannot agree with the majority of the members, and that is on the question of the report which the marketing council should submit to the hon. the Minister. The position at the moment is that they should report every two years. This has been observed, unfortunately, more in the breach than in the observance. I find that the last report which was submitted by the National Marketing Council was in 1965 and covered the period from 1950 to 1964. I want to say this, that if this council had reported every two years and if the Minister and his predecessors had taken note of what the National Marketing Council had to say about agriculture, I do not believe that this commission would have been necessary. Let me refer him to RP 40 of 1965, to paragraph 51. Before dealing with that, let me say that I believe that the two most important things which have come out of this investigation are the suggestion that we should now do away with restrictive registration of commercial undertakings where it is outside of the agricultural sphere and the recommendations regarding changes to the meat scheme. Paragraph 51 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whilst the Marketing Council supports the basic objective of the scheme, it is of the opinion that compulsory auctioning on the hook, as the sole method of sale in controlled areas, is not in the best interests of the meat industry as a whole.</block>

<p>Paragraph 125 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Marketing Council considers the whole question of restrictive registration should be reviewed as soon as possible.</block>

<p>That was in 1965, 10 years before this commission was appointed. I believe that for this reason, the National Marketing Council is closer to agriculture than anybody else, with all respect to the hon. the Minister and to the officials of his department. It is closer to these particular problems and they know what they are talking about. For that reason I believe it is important that they should be compelled to report to the hon. the Minister, to Parliament and to agriculture as a whole, at least every two years. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise only to give the hon. member the opportunity to continue with his speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for his kindness, and while I am thanking him, may I say that I omitted in the thanks which I expressed earlier, to thank the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister for the assistance they gave to members of the commission and also the officials of both departments for the assistance which they rendered to members of the commission.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of the commission&#x2019;s report which was mentioned by other members. That relates the question of consumer representation. Evidence before the commission was unanimous on the point that representation on the control boards was absolutely useless. It serves no purpose whatsoever and it is for that reason that the commission has suggested that such representation should be removed. Yet I believe that consumer participation in one form or another is necessary. If we are to have an effective marketing organization or scheme in this country, it must have the support of both the producer and the consumer, regardless whether the consumer is the distributor, the processor, the manufacturer or the housewife ultimately consuming the particular commodity. We need their support and I believe that they cannot be left out of the whole scheme of things. This is why I have said to the hon. the Minister that I hope he is not going to take bits and pieces out of the report, for although it is recommended that the <span class="col_8153-8154" refersTo="page_1407"/>consumer should lose his representation on the control board, this recommendation is subject to the proviso that the control board should lose the power to fix prices and that they lose the power to restrict the registration of persons who deal in their particular commodity. I want to add that consumer representation must be given on the National Marketing Council. It is imperative that there should be at least two consumer representatives on that council. I further believe that the National Marketing Council, as is also recommended in this report. The consumer participation in the conference of agricultural prospects is something which is absolutely essential. The final point that I believe must be looked into is that the final fixing of the price of the agricultural commodity must not be the sole responsibility of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. When I say that I do not mean the present hon. Minister personally. It must not be the sole responsibility of any one person to do that.</p>

<p>I believe that this should be a collective responsibility. I understand that it is at the moment a collective responsibility in that the Cabinet decides before the hon. the Minister announces the price. It should however be written into the Marketing Act that it should be done by a Cabinet committee of at least five members, two of whom should be the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, who should act as the chairman of that committee, and the Minister of Economic Affairs to represent the consumers. The other three members should be Ministers concerned with prices and the marketing of agricultural products. I believe it is imperative that one should draw these people into this matter as well. It is for that reason that I say that the hon. the Minister must look at all the recommendations.</p>

<p>Much has been said, and there seems to be a little confusion or at least disagreement here, about the question of the subsidization of prices. I have placed on record my attitude in the report, and I want to place it on record here, that I believe it is essential that there must be subsidization of the consumer prices of products. The social and economic circumstances of South Africa are such that a large mass of our people are under-privileged and fall within the lower-income group. If we all had high incomes, it would have been all right, but we do not all have high incomes. It is for this reason that I believe that basic food products, such as maize, wheat and milk, should be subsidized, even if it does result in increase in taxation. It is the higher income group people who are paying the taxation and they can afford to pay. However, I believe you have got to subsidize the lower income group of people. There has just been an increase in the price of milk. I believe that it is totally unjustified to increase the price of milk to the consumer. I do not believe that the producer has received enough, and the hon. the Minister is facing the problem with regard to milk today because he has not been prepared to accept the principle of subsidizing the price of milk to the consumer, most of whom are lower income group people. If the farmer does not receive enough for his milk, he is not going to produce enough milk for the needs of the country. We are going to face a milk famine in this country and we are about to face it; it is on the doorstep.</p>

The money can be found, even if, as I have said, it means increasing taxes. It has got to be found to provide food at a reasonable price to our lower income group people.</p>

<p>Butter is no longer a problem, because there is an alternative. While we are on this subject I should like to say to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture that he has done the lower income group of people a disservice in allowing an increase in the price of margarine. The price of margarine is almost the same as that of butter today. I do not believe that that can be justified either because there are large commercial undertakings which are making the profit out of that and not the primary producer. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to have another look at the milk question. He must look again at the producer and the consumer and look again at the middle man and see if he can really justify the tremendous gap of 11 cents between what the producer gets, when he gets 16&#x00BD; cents, and what the consumer has to pay.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that it is 11&#x00BD; cents. Can that be justified? That is one of the reasons which resulted in my supporting the recommendation of the majority of this commission, namely that the restrictive registration on distributors of milk should be lifted. Today it is in the hands of a few large concerns and it amounts almost to a monopoly. When the hon. the Minister in all good faith and honesty asks them for prices so that he can determine the gap between the producer&#x2019;s price and the consumer&#x2019;s price, he is at the mercy of these monopolies. They can produce any figure and the hon. the Minister cannot gainsay them. If he opens this to free enterprise on the other hand, I want to guarantee the hon. the Minister that that gap will narrow. Immediately there is competition, one will get a more efficient production, a more efficient distribution of milk and one will find that the gap between the producer&#x2019;s price and the consumer&#x2019;s price can be narrowed. That could almost be counted as a subsidy for the consumer, so that he will get a cheaper product anyway.</p>

<p>There was one other subject that I wanted to discuss with the hon. the Minister. Although my time is running out, I shall try to deal with this matter, the matter of veterinary services, very quickly. The veterinary services in Natal at the moment are in a parlous state. The Department of Agriculture does not have half the number of veterinary officers in Natal that it should have. The hon. the Minister nods his head; he therefore agrees with me. It is a problem which he has, and I do not have the solution to the problem. I want to identify the problem, however, and ask him to do something about it. When I refer to Natal, I refer only to the White parts of Natal. I believe that veterinary services in KwaZulu have completely broken down, even to the point where the movement of stock from one dipping tank to another is no longer registered. There is free movement of stock and the hon. the Minister knows what lies on the border of KwaZulu and the border of Natal. There is Mozambique, where there is foot and mouth disease and every other disease that one can think of. We also have the game reserves in Natal. The dangers which are posed by the breakdown of veterinary services in Natal and KwaZulu cannot be overstressed, the threat that is posed to the livestock of South Africa, KwaZulu and our game reserves. I do not know what the solution is. I do not have it. I heard one hon. member who spoke earlier in this debate talk about the small number of students qualifying from Onderstepoort and the other training colleges. That is one of the problems. However, I believe that we have sufficient veterinarians in this country, or we have a lot more than are available to the department. They are being drawn away through the money which is provided in the cities where they go and become cat and dog men, instead of being veterinarians. Can the hon. the Minister not do something to attract those people back to the department where they can provide a service to the people of South Africa, not only to the agricultural sector, but to the consumers as well. I plead with the hon. the Minister to please find a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before reacting to what was said by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, I first want to read out the following passage of the commission&#x2019;s recommendations concerning the donation of funds to organized agriculture&#x2014;i.e. to the South African Agricultural Union&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission recommends that the principle of statutory collection of funds for the partial financing of the organizational expenses of the South African Agricultural Union be accepted. Interested parties can work out the finer details in due course.</block>

<p>When this commission commences its task, it faced serious issues. Certain evidence criticising the system of control, evidence submitted to the commission, had to be answered. To be able to do this, the commission had to follow the path of its conscience, and any member of this commission can defend every recommendation in this report with a clear conscience. These are the norms by which this commission was guided. The commission realized in advance that some of the recommendations it would make, would bring fire and brimstone down upon it. However, it was the unequivocal standpoint of the commission that it would not allow itself to be led in its decision-making by pressure exercised upon it from any quarters. It decided that in its <span class="col_8157-8158" refersTo="page_1409"/>decision-making, in the interests of the agricultural industry, it would allow itself to be led by its conscience alone and this is what the commission did. I am speaking as a farmer when I say that in the interests of the farmer and agriculture in South Africa there should be one organization and its affiliates as the recognized mouthpiece of the farmer in South Africa, and from an historical and traditional point of view, this is the South African Agricultural Union. If abortions occur in the process, it is not for this Government to deal with those abortions. It is for the bodies within organized agriculture to get their house in order. Today I am not choosing sides between the S.A. Agricultural Union and splinter organizations. However, we cannot expect this hon. Minister and the Government to recognize every Dick, Tom and Harry or every splinter party of the farmers. We can only recognize the S.A. Agricultural Union. It is for organized agriculture, in the broad sense, to get its own house into order. It is not for the commission or for the hon. the Minister to act as referee and to decide who will be recognized and who not. Consequently I stand by the recommendations of the commission. We recognize the S.A. Agricultural Union as the recognized body which speaks on behalf of the farmers in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>If I did perhaps use other words subsequently the fact remains that I did state the matter clearly initially, and I still subscribe to the point of view that funds may be collected statutorily for the partial financing of the expenses of the S.A. Agricultural Union. And then I want to repeat: If abortions did occur in the process, it is not for the commission to return those abortions to the womb of organized agriculture. It is for organized agriculture itself to set the matter in order.</p>

<p>In consequence of our investigation, as well as our investigation abroad, I want to say that there is one matter which is as clear as a pikestaff, and that is that the system of control as it exists and has developed in South Africa, is a very good system of control. Indeed, it is one of the best in the Western world. Therefore, in respect of the development of control in South Africa, I as a soya bean producer, want to avail myself of this opportunity today, to extend, on behalf of the soya bean producers, our sincere thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture for the establishment of a one-channel pool scheme for the marketing of soya beans. Through the establishment of a one-channel pool system for the marketing of soya beans, a new day has dawned for the soya bean producers in South Africa. A marketing system has now been created for us which will enable us to negotiate better prices for our products and to ensure the future of this important source of protein for South Africa, in view of the fact that it will be needed more and more in future.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to say that the general impression exists that agricultural control boards are established solely for the benefit of the producer. This is a wrong impression. In South Africa we believe in a free, capitalist system, and allow the free market mechanism of supply and demand to determine prices throughout the entire economic sphere. But in the case of agriculture, the position is that there is a radical statutory interference in this mechanism and that we employ control boards and the Marketing Act for stabilizing these prices. These actions of control boards are aimed at bringing stability to the industry. It is aimed not only at negotiating a better price for the producer, but also at narrowing the gap between producers&#x2019; prices and consumer prices. One of the basic points of departure of <span class="col_8159-8160" refersTo="page_1410"/>the Marketing Act and of the entire system of control is to benefit not only the producer, but also the consumer in equal measure and afford the consumer the guarantee that there will always be sufficient food available in South Africa at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>The critics of the Marketing Act and the control boards overlook this aspect for the most part. The advantages to the consumer are not emphasized and not pointed out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bryanston made mention of the fact that consumer representation on the control boards was to be abolished and replaced by giving the Co-ordinating Consumers&#x2019; Council a seat at the annual conference held on agricultural prospects. I want to point out in passing that producers are not the only people who are represented on the control boards. There are also industrialists and representatives of commerce, and all those people are consumers in their own right. Moreover, the voice of the consumer is also heard and the interests of the consumer are looked after at the level of the National Marketing Council. The six non-farming members of the Marketing Council are in fact no more than consumers of agricultural products. The particular interests of the consumer are being looked after at a very high level and with competency. I should like to ask the hon. member for Bryanston, who objected to the removal of the existing representation of consumers on the control boards, who will represent consumers&#x2019; interests more effectively: a woman, an ordinary housewife who has been nominated&#x2014;I do not want to say that there are no competent women&#x2014;or professional people like economists at the level of the National Marketing Council, people who are in a position to judge and who may be able to point out very competently the consequences which certain price adjustments will have on the consumer? The commission is of the opinion that the consumers&#x2019; interests are served much more effectively by professionally schooled people at the level of the National Marketing Council than by arbitrary housewives in individual control boards.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, most of the speakers in the agricultural debate up to now have been members of the Wentzel Commission. Three years ago the Minister of Agriculture appointed this commission to investigate, bring out a report and make recommendations on the functioning of the Marketing Act.</p>

<p>This commission set about its task with enthusiasm and in all earnest and, in my opinion, tabled a very fine report. Sir, you yourself heard today how they reported on their findings. I have great appreciation for the fact that the commission, which consisted of members from both sides of the House, went to so much trouble and made so many personal sacrifices to assemble and process a vast amount of evidence, to make a study of marketing in other countries and after much consultation and consideration bring out a report which, above all, was also unanimous. It is clear to me that the chairman, and his commissioners succeeded in this report, as was also very clearly apparent today, in elevating agriculture above party politics and by so doing making of this report a piece of work from which it will still be possible to derive a great deal of good for agriculture. The searchlight has been thoroughly focused on our marketing system, and it was also tested against other systems. Arising out of that quite a number of recommendations were made. Today hon. members heard here what those recommendations were. I also read in the report, even though it is between the lines, that there is not really very much wrong with our well tried marketing system. This did not come as a surprise to me because I know from my own experience that there is a particular interest in our marketing system in overseas countries. If one pages through the Hansards of previous years, one notes that the Marketing Act has frequently been called the <i>Magna Carta</i> of the farmer. The report which is being discussed in this House today, once again emphasizes this truth. I agree, in common with Oom Gerhard Bekker that this is in fact the case.</p>

<p>A discussion of the Agriculture Vote revolves primarily around bread, bread in the wider meaning of the word. We are living in a blessed country&#x2014;a country of sunshine and a country flowing with milk and honey. We have an abundance of that. Starvation and a lack of bread are completely unknown to us. Since the day of the great judgment, i.e. that in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread, was passed on mankind, its supplication has been &#x201C;Father, give us this day our daily bread.&#x201D; In South Africa these words from the great prayer <span class="col_8161-8162" refersTo="page_1411"/>are quite frequently misapplied; they are quite frequently misinterpreted, and become a mere prolixity. The seriousness of this truth passes us by. In these times in which we are living we have reason to be grateful that we are living in South Africa. I want to state this candidly to the PRP. In South Africa there are not very many people who are famished. Indeed, if there are people who are famished, there are in fact organizations, there is a system, there is machinery for providing those people with food.</p>

<p>The world population is increasing at such a rate that, if Malthus had been living today, he would definitely have grabbed at his pen in great haste to rewrite his famous essay, with which he so shocked the world in 1798, with far more incandescent adjectives. To the world the physical availability of bread&#x2014;and I am once again using the word in the broader sense&#x2014;has exceeded the safety limit. For 800 million people on earth, there is no longer enough daily bread. The population increase is taking place at the bewildering rate of two per second. That is during the period of ten minutes in which I am making a short speech here, there will be 1 200 extra mouths asking for food. The world&#x2019;s reserves of bread has already been so low that there was only enough for 28 days. This is truly a terrifying idea. Only approximately 5&#x0025; of the world food production&#x2014;and now you should listen very carefully&#x2014;is being channelled by the producer countries, in excess of their own consumption, into the trade flow as a surplus. This fact must be very thoroughly appreciated, particularly by those who so readily seize upon the argument of importing of food as an alternative to self-provision at a higher cost. Five per cent of the total world food production, in volume, is an enormous quantity, but seen against the background of the fact that we have only, in terms of our Joseph&#x2019;s policy, kept back approximately 10&#x0025; of our maize supplies in expectation of the new crop, and that we regard an over-production of 10&#x0025; in the fresh milk industry as normal for our consumer requirements, then 5&#x0025; of the food production as a supply in the trade is a dangerously low and risky source to be relied upon in times of shortages.</p>

<p>Against this background I think our concern in regard to sustained production at a sustained growth rate is fully justified. Against this same background our view of a total involvement of the entire population in an ensured supply of food is definitely a relevant one. I am speaking of total involvement. With that I mean in particular those who comprise the links in the entire chain of food production. However, I want to take it even further and allege that the consumer himself is an important, and is becoming an increasingly more important, link in the chain, because it is he, who, after all, has to pay for everything.</p>

<p>Modern farming is an economic industry in which normal business principles apply and in which the entrepreneur invests, with gain as his point of departure. With this point of departure the farmer shares the view of the entrepreneur who conveys, processes, packs, stores, and finances food, and handles it in the wholesale sphere and distributes it in the retail sphere. From the farmer to the retail distributor each individual renders a service for which the consumer creates the market and for which the consumer is prepared to pay. As a general statement we have to accept that the more luxurious the taste of the consumer, the longer the chain, and the more expensive the product. I want to present a fine little example here.</p>

<p>If you purchase milk from the milk farmer you will pay 14 cents per litre for it. If the milk is delivered to your home in a returnable container, you will pay 28 cents per litre for it. If you buy milk in a plastic container at the caf&#x00E9;, you will pay 32 cents per litre for it. If the chain becomes even longer and you were to drink the milk at the caf&#x00E9; in a glass, you would have to pay 48 cents per litre for it. If, in addition, you wanted a glass of hot milk, you would have to pay 54 cents per litre for it in the caf&#x00E9;. We must therefore realize that the longer the chain becomes the more we shall have to pay; the more luxurious our taste, the more we shall have to pay for it. Besides the production costs of the primary producer, the consumer undoubtedly plays a decisive role in the supply and the price of food. His demands in regard to freshness, appearance, taste, packaging, delivery, serving and hygiene are all price-determining factors. But surely everyone realizes that the fewer the links in the chain between the farmer and the consumer, the cheaper the product. The farmers in South Africa have, by means of co-operative action, shortened the chain considerably. There is no doubt about this; there is a great deal of evidence for this. In other <span class="col_8163-8164" refersTo="page_1412"/>countries, considerable success has been achieved in respect of food by the consumers by shortening the length of the chain by means of co-operative consumer action. In South Africa, however, this action meets with little support.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. member for his gesture. A certain measure of antipathy is even being built up against the agricultural co-operatives. I am afraid that the time has arrived when an emphatic warning has to be issued to the effect that the consumer, in so far as he participates in the destructive criticism of the cooperatives, must realize that he is in that way helping to lengthen the food supply chain and is in that way going to have to pay more for his food if the co-operatives were to be hurt or were to disappear. This matter is of real importance these days, and I am therefore pleased that I have been afforded this opportunity of issuing this warning in good time. In these times in which we are living, in which inflation and the attendant production cost increases and price increases of food are inevitable, a greater involvement of the entire population is essential. It is clear that everyone should do everything in his power not only to curb price increases, but to seek and to apply price saving measures.</p>

<p>I should like to mention a few possibilities in this regard. I have already mentioned the shortening of the chain. A second possibility is judicious food purchases by the housewife. She should do this on a basis of food value, and this ought to be the consideration to which priority is given by the woman purchasing foodstuffs. For example, it is alleged that cool drink is the drink of the worker and of the poor man. However, I doubt this very strongly. I think it is merely a clich&#x00E9;. This year our people are going to spend R198 million on it, and in comparison cool drinks, on a basis of food value, are probably three to five times more expensive than milk. Speaking of drinking, I just want to say that the present consumption of alcoholic liquor in this country is in the region of R1 132 million per annum. I accept the allegation that it is the poor man who is hardest hit by increases in food prices, and that it is he who can least afford these, but alcoholic liquor to the value of R1 milliard represents an enormous quantity of liquor. If only those people who, according to the Opposition, are able to afford higher milk, butter and bread prices, were to drink this, then truly the wealthy people in our country are all living on spirits. Tonight I want to allege that liquor is food and that an average liquor consumption per capita, i.e. of man, woman and child&#x2014;whether, poor, Black, White or Coloured&#x2014;of R50 per annum is grossly injudicious spending. In terms of bread it means that each person could afford one wholewheat loaf per day. What do we spend on bread? We spend only R168 million on the standard bread&#x2014;white, brown and wholewheat. What we spend on our tobacco consumption is twice as much, i.e. R399 million. For the money which the packet of 50 cigarettes in my pocket costs me &#x2026;</p>

<p>I agree. And then there are people in this House who complain about the price of bread in the Republic; and not only do they complain about the price of bread, they do not say a single word about the price of cool drinks, about tobacco or alcoholic beverages. They do not say that the prices of those articles are too high. Even our spending on bread is as injudicious. For example, 68&#x0025; of the bread we eat is white bread, as against 31&#x0025; in respect of brown and wholewheat bread put together. [Interjections.] And then I am not even talking about &#x201C;French loaves&#x201D; which the hon. member for Houghton certainly has on her table occasionally, and which cost twice as much as brown bread. The buns which are so tasty and which we eat so frequently costs three to four times as much as an ordinary <span class="col_8165-8166" refersTo="page_1413"/>brown loaf. It is really deplorable if a man with a glass of whisky costing 38 cents per tot in his hand argues with me about the high price of bread in South Africa. If he takes soda in his whisky, he can exchange that tot for more than three white loaves or more than a litre of milk. One can exchange a loaf of brown bread for two apples. For the price of a mango&#x2014;which I myself have bought in Houghton or in Sea Point&#x2014;one can buy three loaves of bread. One can exchange one kg of beef, as one buys it in the supermarkets, for ten loaves of bread. Surely, I do not think the Opposition and the news media can be serious when they carry on in this way about the price of bread and milk in particular.</p>

<p>There was an interesting development as far as the Sunday newspapers are concerned. Previously one could buy a loaf of bread for a sixpence, and a newspaper in which to wrap the bread for tuppence. Apart from the hygienic aspects, one simply cannot afford it any longer today, for with the price of one Sunday newspaper one is almost able to buy two loaves of bread. A person who buys a newspaper every day, Sundays included, spends 85 cents a week&#x2014;the price of 6&#x00BD; loaves of bread. A man cannot live on bread alone, but without bread the sods are soon raining on your coffin.</p>

<p>In the times in which we are living, in which food throughout the world is becoming expensive and scarce, the aspect of the wasting of food most certainly deserves the attention of us all. What gives rise to concern on my part is the wasting of food in the consumers&#x2019; hands. Hon. members can convince themselves of this by simply taking note of what is happening around them. For example, observe how much of the food which is served up on a plate for one in a restaurant, is sent back to the kitchen. At receptions, clubs, hospitals and in the hon. members&#x2019; own homes we find the same thing happening. Unconsumed food is thrown into the garbage bin. This type of wastage, together with the excessive use of foodstuffs, is costing South Africa vast amounts of money. To illustrate this, bread serves as a very good example, perhaps for the very reason that bread, as the result of its low price, is given the least consideration, and is treated with the least respect. Suppose all the bread which become stale, which is tasted and then not used again, plus the crusts &#x2026; [Interjections.] Yes, we use a little of it in bread pudding, but we do not eat bread pudding every day. If all the wastage represents only the crusts on the two sides of a loaf of bread, it is already bad enough, but then we already have to add more than that, for we must consider that the cat and the dog must also have something to eat. This is a wastage and not something for which we should like to see a subsidy being paid, or for which we are willing to pay taxes. Just consider our dog population. Recently I saw a report in which one of the suburbs of Cape Town complained that there were approximately 40 000 stray dogs. How many more there are that are not strays I do not know, but the point is that if one takes these two crusts of a bread as representing a bread which is wasted, then it means that if one is able to obtain 20 slices from a loaf of bread and two crusts are thrown away, then what is being wasted is 10&#x0025;, and 10&#x0025; of the subsidy which is included at present in the Estimates, means that R9 million is simply being thrown into the garbage bin. I think it is time we give serious thought to these things, for they cry to high heaven. In these times in which public funds are so vitally necessary in many spheres, a great deal can be achieved with R9 million. We heard yesterday that we would be able to send 3 000 students to university on it, or could afford 3 000 farm labourers houses, on it, and do so every year. Sir, you are also aware that if we had to increase the price of the cheapest loaf of bread in the world, i.e. the one in South Africa, by one cent, then the State would be spending R15 million on a subsidy.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with interest to the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister and I would ask, in reference to it and perhaps in defence of the tobacco farmers and the wine farmers in this country, that he looks with a little sympathy on the failings and the foibles of mankind, perhaps one could quote to him the Biblical text that man does not live by bread alone.</p>

<p>I want to say a word on behalf of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. We believe that pets do play a part in the life of mankind and I do not believe, therefore, that they should be denied a little bread. I agree with him entirely, of course, that there is far too much wastage of food, of bread, and it is really very painful indeed to think that people who are throwing away bread, are throwing <span class="col_8167-8168" refersTo="page_1414"/>money and good food down the drain. The hon. the Deputy Minister in the earlier part of his speech referred to the absolute necessity for a healthy agriculture for the production of foodstuffs in the world today. There, of course, we have every sympathy and agree with him. He also spoke about shortening the marketing chain, and I think that this is very important indeed. My hon. colleague, the hon. member for Bryanston, has expressed the views of the members in these benches in regard to the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry into the Marketing Act. He has made particular reference&#x2014;and this is what I want to talk about&#x2014;to the recommendation that the Dairy Board and the Milk Board be combined into one board, covering the whole operation of the dairy industry. I think it is necessary for the hon. the Minister to do something about this as soon as possible. I think he has to do something about implementing this recommendation as a matter of extreme urgency. I suggested it last year, and I think many other people in this House have been suggesting it for some time, that it is ridiculous that we should have two boards, and I think it is now up to the hon. the Minister to take steps, which I believe could in fact have been taken a long time ago. Perhaps, if he had combined the two boards earlier, the dairy industry would not have found itself in the difficulty which faces it at present and the housewife would not be forced to pay the disgracefully high price for milk which she is being forced to pay today. To my mind it is an absolute disgrace that we in South Africa have to pay the price that we do for milk, one of the highest prices in the world for this very basic commodity. It is imperative for the good health of all in South Africa that milk does not become so expensive that people, and particularly the poorer section of the community, are deprived of it or are unable to buy sufficient milk to maintain the health of their children and themselves.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the hon. the Minister has paid adequate attention to conditions in the dairy industry, particularly in so far as the marketing of milk is concerned. Increases in the price of feeds and transport costs have forced farmers to ask for a higher price, which is something which I believe they are entitled to. There is no great profit in dairy farming today even for the most efficient and the most competent farmer. The terrible indictment of the marketing operation is that the farmer, for the most part, is getting less than half of the price which the consumer pays over the counter. The hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned details of this. The average farmer is getting 14 cents per litre, and yet one has to pay 32 cents over the counter for a litre of milk.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to give very serious attention to a matter that I raised last year. I believe that there would be great possibilities for more efficient marketing if a greater percentage of the total quantity of milk sales was uht, or ultra-high temperature treatment or long-life milk. The pattern in many other countries of the world is that there is a greater consumption of long-life milk in relation to fresh milk. I understand that in some cases it is approaching 40&#x0025;. There are of course many advantages and many disadvantages, but as far as South Africa is concerned, the advantages, to my mind, far outweigh the disadvantages. Firstly, it could well be the answer to the problem of seasonal milk shortages. The surplus fresh milk in summer at present is largely used for the production of powdered milk. I believe that a lot of this milk could be processed as uht milk, which could then be stored and used in times of shortages. It must be remembered that uht milk has the full nutritional value of fresh milk and is in no way inferior, although it has a slightly different taste, whereas there is a considerable resistance to the use of powdered milk.</p>

<p>I was interested to read a report in one of the Sunday papers last week which provided interesting statistics. In the summer of 1974 more than 72 000 million litres of surplus fresh milk were used for the production of powdered milk, cheese and ice-cream. Yet there were shortages over most of the Transvaal that winter. The annual production of uht long-life milk is just over 30 million litres, and when one equates that figure with a surplus production of 72 000 million litres, it is very little indeed. I appreciate that there are problems. The storage of large quantities of milk will be difficult because of the enormous storage area that would be required. This will probably present a very difficult problem to some of our urban dairy distribution centres. I do, however, believe that this difficulty could be overcome and I will come to that a little later in my speech.</p>

<p>The second advantage of uht milk is that it <span class="col_8169-8170" refersTo="page_1415"/>does not require refrigeration. This has obvious advantages to vast numbers of the poorer section of our population who do not have facilities to keep milk cold, so much so, that if long-life milk was available at a reasonable price, and I stress &#x201C;reasonable price&#x201D;, the demand for milk among the poorer sections of the community would actually increase. The third major advantage depends on the hon. the Minister and how far he is prepared to go to encourage the production of uht milk, because it concerns decentralization of the production facilities. At present much of our milk for bottling purposes is produced fairly close to urban areas where the majority of the consumers are. Land in these areas tends to be more expensive and is not necessarily ideal for the cheap production of forage and is not necessarily ideal grazing land. Feeding is that much more expensive because feed has to be purchased and transported from other areas. Farmers&#x2019; costs are higher. The difficulties of producing milk for major markets are obvious, although milk can be produced at a lower cost far away from those major markets. The hon. the Minister has on several occasions in the past refused to consider subsidizing milk.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>You are in favour of a subsidy, but you do not have the money or the facilities. The hon. the Minister has explained his difficulties and we understand his difficulties. My suggestion to the hon. the Minister is that he should consider ways and means of assisting with the capital cost, in the setting up of decentralized uht production units with adequate storage facilities. He should encourage a change in our costly milk distribution system, which at the moment is not a very efficient distribution system. By encouraging the production of uht milk at a reasonable price, he could do this. At present uht milk is far too expensive, and the price is not controlled. The milk is also very difficult to obtain. I have tried to get some in Cape Town. I walked down a street and tried at every caf&#x00E9;. Most of them have never heard of it, and I did eventually find it at one of the major supermarkets where it was selling at 35 cents a litre. It would seem that one can purchase uht milk at anything from 34 cents to 39 cents a litre, depending on the whim of the particular shopkeeper.</p>

<p>I believe that if properly handled, it should be possible to produce uht far more economically, particularly if the hon. the Minister, although he is not prepared to subsidize milk because that would cost too much, were prepared to subsidize or otherwise assist with the setting up of these decentralized production units for uht. This would be an obvious advantage to dairy farmers and to the consumer as well. I think we could end up with a totally new milk scene. I would like to commend this idea to the hon. the Minister for investigation by his department. I do believe that it has got very great possibilities. It is only by taking a very major initiative that the dairy industry is going to be restored to a healthy situation. At present dairy farmers are unhappy and milk production is dropping. The consumer is even more unhappy at the terrible price he has got to pay. I believe that the hon. the Minister has to act very speedily to try and set matters right.</p>

<p>All in all there is a very heavy responsibility on the shoulders of the hon. the Minister at the moment. The speedy implementation of the recommendations of the Wentzel commission might just have an effect on the unbelievably high prices of food. Incidentally, I was grateful to hear the attitude expressed by the chairman of the commission, the hon. member for Bethal, with regard to consumer orientated representation. I think this is a step forward and a step in the right direction and I would commend to the hon. the Minister his suggestion that certain members of the National Marketing Council should be consumer orientated or at least independent.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. J. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Orange Grove spoke about milk. Unfortunately I cannot continue and speak about honey. This afternoon I have to speak about something which is perhaps less pleasant. Years ago an English economist said: &#x201C;In most countries and at most times the farmer could at least count the poets on his side&#x201D;. We in South Africa have been fortunate in that agriculture has not only had the poets and writers, but also the Government on its side for many years. It is a good thing to have the poets and writers on your side, but it is also good to have the Government on your side. I am sure that we still have the Government on our side, but I am not so sure whether we still have the poets and writers on our side.</p>

<p><span class="col_8171-8172" refersTo="page_1416"/>Over the years the State has introduced a system of regulation and control of agriculture by means of legislation and regulations, by means of which agriculture was not enslaved to the State, but was able to develop into a valuable partner in the national economy. It now seems to me as if it has become the popular practice today to criticize and to level accusations at or cast suspicion on agriculture and its organizations. Here I should like to agree with the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town who spoke this afternoon about the unjustified criticism which is being levelled at agriculture and its organizations. One asks oneself whether those who are trying to get at agriculture, think that in this way they are also able to get in a blow at its partner, the Government. On this matter, however, everyone has to judge for himself. There are the uncalled for, unfair articles in the Press, such as those to which the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town referred, but there is also far more. It creates a feeling of dissatisfaction with, and even antagonism on the part of agriculture against those sectors from among which these attacks come. In these times in which we are living, we must not attack one another. We must not make war upon one another; we must co-operate. But then there must not be uncalled for and unnecessary attacks on agriculture and agricultural organizations. As we have already heard today, the State has been taking action for a very long time to apply measures and regulations in the interests of agriculture, but also in the interests of the country, and in future control will still have to be exercised by the State in the interests of national welfare. Without a healthy agricultural industry the Republic of South Africa is doomed. I do not know of any country in the world where agriculture can exist without a certain degree of intervention on the part of the State in the form of control.</p>

<p>One becomes annoyed if people who know nothing about agriculture, express opinions about agriculture which are quite unfair. Recently, during the last week in April, when the hon. the Minister of Agriculture introduced legislation to regulate the purchase of grapes, he was accused by the hon. member for Yeoville of furthering State intervention in the wine industry. The NP policy is not a policy of socialism. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs have said this on several occasions. They have themselves spoken out against socialism. We believe in free competition. I am sure that all of us in this House believe in it. However, we believe in free competition to the benefit of the country. However, what is to the benefit of the country? A well organized agricultural industry, which gives the farmers in the industry financial stability, so that supplies may be made readily available to the consumer at reasonable prices, is to the benefit of the country. For the industries which use agricultural products as raw materials, too, it is important that there should be a stable agricultural industry. We believe in free competition, and for this reason we still have 80 000 farmers in the country.</p>

<p>However, free competition can also lead to problem situations. Americans discovered this as long ago as the last century when it was realized that those who should actually have been competing with one another, began to become too friendly with one another. As long ago as 1890 the Americans had to pass the Sherman Anti-Trust Act so that they could have countermeasures against monopolistic conditions.</p>

<p>This brings me to the question: What is behind these attacks on organized agricultural co-operatives and control boards? I ask myself whether the people who launch those attacks could be people who advocate free competition so that they can build agricultural empires by means of vertical integration and the large-scale application of capital in an industry whose Achilles heel is in fact capital provision and capital formation.</p>

<p>I can mention many examples. One example is the millers industry. There is also the meat industry and the wine industry. Let us take the wine industry as an example. In the 19th century there was a great deal of instability in this industry. Over-production was rife. There were petitions to file Government. In 1904 there was a commission of inquiry. In 1909 nine co-operatives were established. Today six of them still exist. Even the establishment of co-operatives, which took place with the encouragement of the State, could not succeed in eliminating the problems of the industry. It therefore remained an unstable industry until the KWV was established as an umbrella organization in 1918.</p>

<p>What was the purpose of this organization? Its purpose was to control over-production on <span class="col_8173-8174" refersTo="page_1417"/>the domestic market and to draw off surpluses by requiring members to deliver their surplus supplies to the KWV. In 1924 control on this basis by way of legislation was established in the industry. Today the KWV is not a control board like the other 22 control boards on which this commission reported. It is a control board in its own right by way of legislation. The marketing of wine has since the earliest times been left in the hands of free trade so that the product could be marketed on a competitive basis. We have great appreciation for what free trade did, but what, however, happened in the trade? Today one company handles 70&#x0025; of the industry&#x2019;s good wine and another purchaser handles 80&#x0025; of the industry&#x2019;s distilling wine. Seventy co-operatives produce 80&#x0025; of the total wine harvest, but they market only 1,84&#x0025; themselves directly to the consumer. The question may now be asked whether these two powerful organizations, which control 70&#x0025; or 80&#x0025; of the industry, are satisfied with conditions as they are today. The answer is that they are not. The two of them together are ten times as strong as the KWV, but they are not satisfied. They want to be even more powerful. They want to control the production sphere. They are buying farms and they are buying grapes and making wine themselves. They want to achieve a system of vertical integration by means of which they can bring the entire industry under their control.</p>

<p>Therefore I say that although free competition is a good thing, problems can arise from it. However, it seems strange to me that no criticism is levelled in the Press at these large monopolistic organizations. The cooperatives, who have travelled a long, hard road, are being attacked today. They are being accused and the Government is being accused. While the Government is bringing about regulation and control, it is accused of intervening in a private industry and acting in a socialistic manner. Sir, it is in the interests of the country that agriculture should be kept on a sound basis so that the nation can be fed, and this is also being done for the sake of the State Treasury. The wine industry produces R90 million every year in the form of excise duties, and agriculture is an important earner of foreign currency. However, this can only remain so if there is proper control and regulation, so that agriculture does not end up in the hands of the big money moguls who can enter and leave at will and over which one has no control.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. M. VAN A. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Malmesbury must forgive me if I do not react to his sound arguments. I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to quite a different matter. By means of the stock withdrawal scheme which was introduced by this department some years ago, we achieved a marvellous recovery of our natural pastures in those parts and on those farms to which the system was made applicable. Along with this fine recovery which resulted from the stock withdrawal scheme, we had abundant rains during the past three seasons, and these have given us the most marvellous pastures imaginable where there used to be very sparse vegetation only. These are grasslands in which one may take real delight. But these also brought along dangers because, this lush vegetation, is a source of danger, the danger of veld fires, which, in my part of the world and throughout the country, had assumed large proportions at the end of 1974 and even larger proportions at the end of 1975. For instance, we find a fire breaking out on a certain day. The next day the farmer reports that, in spite of all the attempts made by him, 23 000 ha were totally destroyed by fire. A week later we find another fire breaking out. The farmers again report that a further 30 000 ha were destroyed by fire, in spite of all the attempts which had been made to prevent the fire. Under these circumstances the farmer is absolutely powerless. Our experience was such that such fires and sparks from them, driven by strong winds which usually accompany these fires, jumped 60 metre wide stretches such as roads and fire breaks. The farmer is absolutely powerless against this, in spite of the fact that he receives every assistance from his neighbours.</p>

<p>Allow me, Mr. Chairman, to address a special word of gratitude and praise in this regard to the men of the Defence Force in those areas, who were always prepared to lend assistance in putting out these fires. However, we shall have more of these fires. It is an annual occurrence in our country to have veld fires, uncontrolled veld fires, fires which cause damage. The average area damaged by uncontrolled fires in South Africa is 434 000 ha per year, and such damage is calculated at approximately R3 million&#x2014;it is very difficult, <span class="col_8175-8176" refersTo="page_1418"/>of course, to determine the damage to pastures caused by fires. This means that the farmer is constantly exposed to the risk of a veld fire. His whole farm may bum down which would mean that he would be completely ruined. Fortunately the damage to crops by fires in South Africa is still relatively small, but without meeting trouble halfway, I want to say that in the times in which we are living we must have regard to the fact that our harvests, and to a much larger extent our fields, may be the sphere in which sabotage can be committed. Then the question is: What protection do we have against these destructive fires? Now it so happens that another department also has to deal with the problem of veld fires. I am referring to the Department of Forestry, which also experiences extensive damage being caused by fires annually. I make special mention of the Department of Forestry, as this brings me to the plea I want to make this afternoon. In view of this ever present danger of fires with which the Departments of Agriculture and Forestry have to contend, I want to ask that a inter-departmental committee be appointed from these two departments to investigate the possibility of making an aircraft service available for combating fires. In Canada a special aircraft has been designed for fire fighting. It is a type of aircraft which is relatively manoeuvrable and which can take in five tons of water in a matter of ten seconds. I do not want to elaborate on all the excellent qualities of this aircraft. I just want to ask that we consider appointing an inter-departmental committee to investigate the possibility of an air service of this kind, for the protection of the pastures and crops of our farmers as well as for the protection of our large forestry plantations and our catchment areas in the mountains.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to follow up on what was said by the hon. member for Kimberley North, except by saying that I support his plea in connection with veld fires. Recently I was in the Northern Cape where, particularly during the winter months, there is a great danger of fires starting in the dry grasslands. I should also like to thank the hon. member for Orange Grove for the contribution he made in connection with uht milk. The hon. the Minister knows that I am very interested in uht milk and I should like to advise him to put into effect the recommendations of the commission in connection with the Dairy Board and the Milk Board as soon as possible. Should he reorganize the controlled and uncontrolled areas, it will greatly facilitate the distribution of uht milk.</p>

<p>In this Parliament it does not often happen that a member of the Opposition praises a Cabinet Minister. However, I do want to do so today. When the hon. the Minister was appointed as a Deputy Minister some years ago, his hair was pitch black. Now it is grizzly. That does prove that he worked hard. I am obliged to say that this hon. member&#x2014;and we on this side of the House appreciate it&#x2014;has piloted more legislation in favour of and for the benefit of the farmer through this House during the short time in which he was Minister and Deputy Minister than all his predecessors since 1948 put together. We appreciate this, because this is in the interests of the farmer. This hon. Minister appointed a Marketing Commission and today we have a well-considered and informative report from that commission before us, a report that we are able to discuss here fully. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report will also be in the interests of the farmer. On behalf of all the farmers in South Africa, we thank the Minister for it. We hope that he will remain in that post for a long time. I would even say that when we win the next election he may as well walk over to our side; we shall appoint him as Minister of Agriculture again. [Interjections.] There are thousands of South Africans who are thankful for the role he and his officials played in saving the Bushman&#x2019;s River by removing the rubbish and the silt from the river bed. It is also their thanks I want to place on record here today.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to a plea which I made here during the Second Reading of the budget Bill, a plea which is mainly directed towards the hon. the Minister of Finance, but which, I believe, is very definitely and essentially also the concern of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. What I ask for&#x2014;and what I also asked for earlier&#x2014;is that special funds should be made available to assist young farmers in the released and proclaimed areas of this country who wish to re-establish themselves elsewhere. That is absolutely essential, as some of our best and most productive farmers are virtually frozen <span class="col_8177-8178" refersTo="page_1419"/>into those areas, because of the application of the Government&#x2019;s policy. They must be afforded the opportunity of being able to move out of the released areas when the bad or aged farmer has to pull out. Also in this connection, I believe that it is of the utmost importance that an agreed and accepted formula for valuations in those areas should be worked out between the Department of Agriculture Credit and Land Tenure, organized agriculture and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture, I believe, would earn the sincere appreciation of many thousands of farmers affected throughout the Republic if such a formula were to be found. I do not wish to detail the shortcomings of the present system, as my time is limited. However, in the knowledge that these problems have been brought pertinently to the notice of the hon. the Minister, I would like to move on to what I regard to be the most important factor, namely the financing of agriculture.</p>

<p>*We are all faced with the decentralization of industries and commerce. The oldest, the most important and the most decentralized industry in the world is agriculture. It is the outpost of civilization, of the welfare and the defence of any country, and it is of cardinal importance that the financing of agriculture should take place on a healthy basis. The farmer should be encouraged to stay on the land, and to stay on the land productively, otherwise our civilization and mankind will die out.</p>

<p>I want to express a few ideas for the attention of, and for serious consideration by, the hon. the Minister. In the first place I believe that agricultural financing should be consolidated under the auspices of one single organization. In other words, that the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure and the Land Bank should be amalgamated to deal with agricultural financing and all related matters. It is essential that there should be one organization to do all this financing. In the second place provision should be made for tax exemption in respect of moneys invested by agriculture in this body, in the same way money that can be invested in a building society. The money of farmers who do have savings is invested in building societies today, not because they receive a good rate of interest there, but because their investments are tax-free. I want to ask that it should also be done in the same spirit in respect agricultural financing.</p>

<p>Because agriculture is the most decentralized industry in South African and because agriculture is the largest border industry in South Africa, this sector should also have concessions similar to those enjoyed by commerce and industry in border areas and at growth points.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This is not a light-hearted suggestion made without thought or consideration. Why should commerce and industry alone benefit from tax holidays, transport concessions and low interest loans if they move to decentralized areas? The young farmer who today starts farming, whether he purchases the land or whether he inherits it, has to carry a very heavy load of debt in respect of the cost of the land or, if he has inherited the land, as a result of death duties and possible family adjustments that have to be made in accordance with the estate. The farmer who develops his farm for greater productivity must incur debt. The farmer who suffers a drought, a flood or &#x201C;misoes&#x201D; must incur debt in order to survive and to keep his livestock alive. There is no tax holiday for such a man. Every cent he pays back in interest or in redemption of his debt, is taxed as profit. I believe this hon. Minister should speak to his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, in this connection. After all, when one goes to a border industry area or to a growth point one gets a tax holiday, one even receives assistance to establish oneself there. Why can similar concessions not be granted to farmers who are making improvements or starting out, or to farmers who have experienced serious setbacks like we have so frequently in South Africa as a result of droughts and floods?</p>

<p>It is all very well to say that subsidies and loans are available, but what is available is not sufficient and I firmly believe that if these suggestions of mine are accepted, we can possibly phase out a lot if the subsidy systems which are in existence today. After all, of one can be assured that the profits on investments in one&#x2019;s own agricultural finance organization will not be taxed and if one can be assured that whatever one pays back on debt incurred to establish oneself on the agricultural map is not going to be taxed as profit, then one does not need a subsidy. One can farm comfortably, at <span class="col_8179-8180" refersTo="page_1420"/>peace with oneself and one can develop. This is what the young people of South Africa need.</p>

<p>*Surely our farmers form a border industry and in future they are going to become more of a border industry in South Africa. They are the outposts of our country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member must excuse me if I do not react to his argument. However, I should like to urge our hon. the Minister preferably not to avail himself of the kind offer. I feel that we in this House will not survive the bad day of a UP take-over. If the hon. member feels so attracted towards the hon. the Minister, the solution would probably be that he should make a move on his part. However, we share the hon. member&#x2019;s sentiment with respect to the position in which our hon. Minister finds himself.</p>

<p>I should also like to agree with what the hon. member for Bethlehem said, namely that the hon. the Minister and his deputy are in high favour with the agricultural sector. Indeed he and the Government are the friends of the producer. Since this is the case, I take the liberty of presenting a few bottlenecks in the agricultural industry to hon. members.</p>

<p>If there is a sector in agriculture which we can describe as problematical, it is definitely the meat industry, and the red meat industry in particular. Since the most important producing areas are situated far away from the markets, they are hit the hardest by increases in, for example, transport rates and general price increases as well as the decrease in the value of money. Assistance of some form or another is extremely necessary to help the producer on the short term. There must be assistance to prevent more and more producers leaving their farms to find a livelihood elsewhere. We can only hope for action on the part of the Government to prevent an eventual collapse of this industry.</p>

<p>Of course there are measures which the producer himself can and must make. In the first place we think of absolutely effective farm management and, in the second place, of the increase of the calf percentage, which is alarmingly low at the moment. By increasing the calf percentage effectively, the producer can increase his income without additional capital investment. In the third place, only good breeding material must be used. Quality must be our motto.</p>

<p>According to the most recent report of the Meat Board it appears that 46&#x0025; of all slaughterings produced meat of a second grade or lower quality. This means that more than half of all the cattle which were slaughtered, were not ready for the market. Take a large, remote area like South West Africa. Here everyone is dependent on natural food resources and natural grazing. The price of maize, and added to that the high price of railway rates, make it impossible to fatten the cattle economically in this case. The producer in the far off areas must therefore market the product as is. However, in my opinion, an important aid in this connection is included in the recommendations of the Wentzel Commission. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet has already referred to this extensively. By doing away with the compulsory carcass auction, we can obtain art increase of approximately 10&#x0025; to 15&#x0025; in our meat production without additional numbers. Just think of the possibility of cattle which are not yet ready for the market being disposed of in Cape Town, sold and prepared for the market, before being slaughtered. The meat dealers will now be able to buy selectively and will even be able to purchase in the production areas. This will undoubtedly have a great influence upon our rural auctions, which is very essential.</p>

<p>A further recommendation of the commission which is going to affect the consumer and producer, is the abolition of the compulsory registration of abattoirs, the compulsory hours, etc. The question is always posed: Why are there all the limitations on red meat and why is there all this discrimination? I should like to congratulate the commission on a very enlightening, practical report. I should like to agree with previous speakers and ask the hon. the Minister to accept the report, because it is definitely in the interests of both producer and consumer.</p>

<p>As far as red meat is concerned, we have the product. Important aids are being recommended here now, but we still need publicity. It does not help to have the finest schemes and <span class="col_8181-8182" refersTo="page_1421"/>the best product, if they are not advertised and introduced, or offered in an attractive way. To my knowledge the Meat Board spent approximately 0,04&#x0025; of finances in the meat industry on advertisements last year. Far more will have to be done. The question arises whether the Meat Board should not also institute self-inquiry. We can consider the Wool Board and what is done there for the producer. If we consider the Maize Board, we find that the maize producers, no matter where they are situated, whether in the Western Transvaal, Eastern Transvaal, in the Free State or wherever they may be, may take their product to the nearest depot and receive the same price for it. There is equal treatment and no railage. If we look at the Karakul Board which succeeded, by means of its publicity abroad, in creating a market for the pelts and even forcing Russia from the market, then the question arises: Cannot the Meat Board come up with imaginative suggestions? Should the product not be presented very much more attractively at all times, both raw and cooked? We wonder why the chicken factory, the breeders of broilers, for example are favoured with State subsidies in the form of cheap maize and State controlled fishmeal prices, while the same means are not granted to the red meat producer. If we look at the increase in meat prices over the past years, it seems impressive. It is indeed impressive if we mention that meat prices rose by 180&#x0025;, but as against that we must also mention the increase in production costs, and if we go into this, we find that those costs amounted to far more than 200&#x0025;. I want to mention a few examples. In South West Africa, with its long distances, a roll of wire cost R7 in 1970, but now it costs R22. Whereas railage per head of cattle was R7, it is now R28. A litre of petrol costs as much now as a gallon did in 1970. Therefore I want to make a request to the hon. the Minister and ask whether it is not possible to have the rebate on the conveyance of livestock reintroduced. Would the hon. the Minister not make a request to the hon. the Minister of Finance to see whether he will not be prepared to grant short-term aid? We are grateful to be able to say that the present adjustment in floor prices is already having a favourable effect. The rural auctions are already showing an adjustment, and my information is that there is an increase of as much as 15&#x0025; in our rural auction as a result of this new adjustment for which we are very grateful to the hon. the Minister. But we must also look at the fluctuations in floor prices. I should like to present these to the committee very briefly. I am just referring to grade 1A beef and to the fluctuation of one day. On 31 January this year meat prices varied between 94 cents and 110 cents per kilogram. On 27 March of this year they varied between 82 cents and 104 cents per kilogram&#x2014;on one day. This is an upward tendency, and amounts to R44 per carcass of 200 kg. The producer cannot afford this, but fortunately the present adaptation will force this graph down, and the more we can reduce this curve, the more economical and acceptable it will be for the producer to produce on the long term. Cattle can only be marketed after a period of three years. We therefore have a product which is very sensitive. We trust that the hon. the Minister will have a sympathetic ear for this matter as well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. B. SCOTT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Omaruru will pardon me if I do not react to his arguments, although I support him enthusiastically in the arguments which he presented.</p>

<p>Since the maize industry is such an important factor in our national economy, I should like to say a few words about it. Maize is still the staple food of our country today. Apart from human consumption, it also serves as a very important ingredient in feeding animals. Unfortunately, when the price of maize rises, it also has a chain reaction upon the price of many other types of food, namely the price of meat, milk, eggs, cheese, etc. In other words, maize plays a very important role in the basic price structure of food.</p>

<p>The role which food is going to play in future, has been thoroughly emphasized by the hon. member for Parys and I do not want to repeat it. I think that everyone will agree that to have enough food for every country, should be the first priority. To be able to produce enough food, the producer must receive a price for his product which makes it worth-while for him to produce. However, what is important, is that he must receive prices for his product which will make it possible for him to continue to produce.</p>

<p>Something which causes me a good deal of concern is that we have now reached a stage in which the urban consumer and the producer are moving away from one another. There is a <span class="col_8183-8184" refersTo="page_1422"/>gap between the consumer and the producer which is fast becoming wider. I should like to refer to what the Chairman of the Housewives&#x2019; League said after there was an increase in the milk price last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As die suiwelboere meer doeltreffendheid aan die dag wou l&#x00EA;, was die verhoging van melkpryse nie nodig nie.</block>

<p>After an adjustment in the milk price this year, the same woman said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die prysverhoging was onnodig en is onregverdig teenoor die verbruiker.</block>

<p>When the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town spoke about inexpensive chicken, I could not help thinking of the reaction of the consumers belonging to his party, who opposed him in this connection. This illustrates what I said, namely that that gap is becoming wider. On the one hand, the producer must receive a worth-while price for his product, and on the other hand, the city dweller wants to obtain his food as cheaply as possible, with the result that the one group is pointing a finger at the other. I should like to say very clearly that the time of cheap food is past. Although I sympathize with the urban consumer, I ask him also to understand the problems of the producer.</p>

<p>A fact which cannot be overlooked, is that food in our country was relatively cheap in the past. The breadwinner of a family in South Africa spends an average of 17&#x0025; of his earnings on feeding his family. In some countries overseas this figure is as high as 50&#x0025; and in some places it is even higher. I should like to spell it out very clearly that we in South Africa were spoilt with cheap food in the past. Since food was so easily available and cheap, we did not learn to proceed judiciously.</p>

<p>We find that an immense wastage of food takes place in this country. I could not find the figure which indicates what the wastage amounts to per year, but a certain Mr. Verheem of the S.A. Co-ordinating Consumers Board recently said at Stellenbosch that in South Africa R500 million worth of food is being wasted every year. I do not want to guarantee that that figure is correct, but I should like to agree with what the hon. the Deputy Minister said when he pointed out that if one looks at hotels, restaurants and holiday resorts, one is amazed at what is thrown away in the rubbish bins. At entertainments, even private entertainment, one finds an immense wastage. Everyone will agree with me that we waste food worth several million rands in our country every year.</p>

<p>I said that I sympathize with the city dweller, but I must point out that the careful housewife does not simply complain about high food prices; she makes an active attempt to control the expenditure on food and nevertheless feed her family well. The careful housewife tries to balance her budget by purchasing her family&#x2019;s requirements more judiciously. The careful housewife does not simply load her trolley with articles or products which she thinks she is going to need, she does not allow herself to be caught by the fine packaging of a product, or by a &#x201C;special offer&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The maize producer feels, correctly or incorrectly, that his product which has such a great influence on the price index of various types of food, should be kept low, so that the cost of living may be kept low. One must take into consideration the fact that maize farmers are large earners of valuable foreign exchange. During the 1874 export season maize export earned an amount of more than R200 million. For the 1975 season it is expected that this will increase to R300 million. In the difficult times of inflation and bearing in mind the drop in the gold price, these amounts earned by maize abroad, were of immeasurable value for our country. I think that the maize producer deserves a compliment for his contribution towards combating inflation.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to thank our hon. Minister and our hon. Deputy Minister on behalf of the maize producers for what they have done for the industry. It is surely unique in the history of the country that the Opposition praises a National Party Minister, especially on matters of agriculture. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that he has the full confidence of the maize producers, and the maize producers in this country see him as a partner in their industry.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Winburg who has just resumed his seat has drawn pertinently to the attention of this House the great wastage of foodstuffs that takes place. I think that the hon. the Deputy Minister raised the same subject <span class="col_8185-8186" refersTo="page_1423"/>and that they have done a service to the country and to agriculture in general by bringing this important factor to the attention of the public. I think the wastage which does take place is simply shocking. When we talk about prices of foodstuffs and the cost of living, we must take into account the factors that were raised here by the hon. member and the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>We refer to our agricultural policy as being one of the optimum utilization of national resources. That is correct, and I believe that is what we are all striving to achieve. Having said that, however, I think we must also reckon on making optimum use of the feed and foodstuffs actually produced. In this respect I think the public is often very neglectful.</p>

<p>It is my intention to say a few things about the agricultural industry in general. One is aware that during the last decade agriculture had made greater progress than during any other time in the history of South Africa. This period of progress coincides very largely with the term of office of the hon. the Minister. I do not want to say that he is wholly responsible.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not want to make him blush either. I do think one can say with a reasonable degree of fairness, however, that he has played a big part, and I should like to record my appreciation for what he himself has done for agriculture.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to study the statistics that are available to one in journals, magazines and official documents to realize the extensive progress that is being made. Anyone with an experienced eye who takes a trip through South Africa today, whether it be into the north-west or through the Western Cape, the Karoo, the Free State or the Transvaal, can immediately see the great progress that is being made. Not only is one struck by the quality of the livestock one sees&#x2014;the quality of the cattle, sheep and goats in the veld. The quality of the crops is also impressive.</p>

<p>One is also impressed by the great progress that has been made in our country in the combating of soil erosion. Twenty years ago soil erosion was becoming so bad that it was virtually strangling the agricultural industry in South Africa. It is my belief that very largely through the combined efforts of many people representing many facets in our agricultural sector, we have, to a large extent, brought soil erosion under control. In saying that, I am not apportioning the credit to any single individual. I think one must acknowledge that the hon. the Minister and his department have played a big part, and I think they deserve any compliments that are going in this regard. They have come to light, in my estimation, with sensible forward planning and sensible schemes like the stock reduction scheme, a scheme which I think has played a very big part in stabilizing our agricultural industry. The effects of that wise move will, I think, be long felt to be to the benefit of agriculture.</p>

<p>I think organized agriculture itself has played a significant role. The farmers have worked together and done their best in the interests of agriculture. As a member of the agricultural community, and knowing a lot about our farmers, I can say with a measure of pride that I gladly count myself amongst that group of people who call themselves the farmers of South Africa. I think they have played a remarkable role in placing our agriculture on the forefront throughout the world. I say this with pride because this is not a country richly endowed with agricultural resources. We have had to establish our agricultural industry the hard way. I think it has been a tremendous co-operative effort, and today I think we are reaping the rewards of high production as a result of dedicated efforts by all those who are involved.</p>

<p>Sometimes we find that certain sectors of our farming community are perhaps a little upset about certain things. Here I have in mind a minority group in the wool-farming industry. In spite of the fact that in my opinion our wool scheme is playing a great part in stabilizing the wool industry in South Africa, some individuals have decided that this scheme is not functioning as well as it might. My own view is that they are people who have not played a dominant role in organized agriculture, and if they feel that there are things wrong with the wool scheme, my advice to them is to get into the wool organizations and operate through the recognized channels of production.</p>

<p>However great our progress may be and with whatever satisfaction we may review the situation, we must never be complacent. There will always be room for improvement. I think one of the facets of our industry in which there is great room for improvement is the extension services. What I want to say now is no <span class="col_8187-8188" refersTo="page_1424"/>reflection on those extension officers who I believe are doing a wonderful job, but I wonder whether we use our extension officers in the correct way. I believe the department is doing quite a good job in keeping farmers well informed about the latest scientific developments and practices. We have the various media, such as radio and television, and pamphlets, publications and magazines are distributed to the farmers, but I believe that there is no substitute for the personal visit of an extension officer to the farmer. I think the Minister and his department should give this matter serious consideration. In the annual report there is reference to the fact that they cannot get sufficient numbers of trained personnel to do this job. I realize that this is a problem. I believe that we should make use of bursaries and whatever other means we can find in order to encourage people to perform this service in the extension field, and I believe that we in this House who are interested in agriculture should also play our part in encouraging young farmers to become properly trained, so that they can perhaps start their agricultural careers as extension officers. I believe that it is important that where we have trained technical and professional people functioning as extension officers, their time must be devoted very largely to doing extension work amongst the farmers. The hon. the Minister will tell me, I know, that they do have farmers&#x2019; days and that these extension officers attend those farmers&#x2019; days and give lectures, etc. I believe that they should visit the farmer himself and discuss with him whether he is farming with the right crops, whether he is using the right breed of livestock, and advise him on the latest developments resulting from the extensive research which we have available to us. Generally, the extension officers should advise those farmers who are in need of advice. I do not believe for one moment that our production is at optimum level. I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree with me that on every farm one will be able to find things where improvements can take place. The trained eye of the extension officer, the man who has experience in agriculture, will pick those things up. The farmer may think that he is doing everything in the best possible way, but it may then be pointed out to him that there are certain improvements which can take place. If such improvements are carried out, production will be increased and this is in the interest not only of the individual farmer concerned, but also of the country as a whole. This is a matter which I believe should be further investigated.</p>

<p>Another matter which I think is causing problems in agriculture is the standard of training of the work force. I think there are far too many workmen and labourers on the farms who have too low a level of experience in handling agricultural machinery. The agricultural industry is dependent very largely on the smooth and efficient operation of expensive and highly sophisticated machinery. Very often this expensive machinery is left in the hands of people who are totally untrained to handle that kind of machinery, and it is costing the country millions of rands in repairs. My plea this afternoon is for the Minister to consider whether it is not possible, at the agricultural colleges which are under his control, to make short courses available for the training of workmen on the various farms.

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to react to the speech made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth-Central. There are a few specific points to which I wish to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister. I do not wish to talk about producer prices either, since I feel that the Government and the Minister have fulfilled their obligation to the farming community and the producers. Therefore I do not want to complain about it, although one likes talking about it and it is the popular subject for discussion. I do believe that we as farmers also have a duty not to expect the Minister and the Government to adjust the prices to our obligations but that we as farmers should also undertake to adjust our obligations to our produce prices.</p>

<p>There are a few matters which I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister today because they are causing the farmers a great deal of financial harm. We should like to see something being done about the plagues and pests which farmers have to contend with. Counter-measures have to be found. I refuse to believe that means cannot be found to counteract the problems which farmers in certain regions are experiencing today. In the region of the Western Free State and the Western Cape our farmers are prone to certain infestations of pests and plagues which have occurred recently and which are causing <span class="col_8189-8190" refersTo="page_1425"/>the farmers heavy financial losses. The specific plagues are causing the farmers in our meat production regions a great deal of harm as a result of which the meat production in these areas has dropped considerably. These are regions in which one could say that we produce only meat.</p>

<p>In the first place we have had excessive rains, and our veld is overgrown and recently certain perennial plants have died. The vegetation, i.e. the short-term plants and the annual plants, have changed to such an extent that they no longer have the capacity which our previous plants had which was adapted to nature. That is why we find in the report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services that, because the grass variety and other plant life which one finds there at the moment does not have the sugar content which the previous vegetation had, sheep and cattle are no longer able to build up the sugar quantity in their blood after the excessive growth of grass had had a detrimental effect on growth.</p>

<p>In a few cases as well as plague of midges is being experienced. This plague of midges is such that from September the animals no longer graze during the day, regardless of whether there is food for them or not. They rub bare patches on their heads, necks and bodies, and lie flat on the ground to get rid of the midges&#x2014;which settle on them in such numbers that one can scrape them off with a trowel. Now, it is also true that when the plague of midges diminishes in January, the plague of mosquitoes begins. The mosquitoes suck the animals&#x2019; blood to such an extent that when one decapitates a sheep or a calf, all that flows out is a watery pink fluid. The mosquitoes settle on the animals&#x2019; heads and legs and around their eyes, and suck all their blood out.</p>

<p>In addition there is the internal parasites which occur far more frequently today than previously. That plague is also responsible for ewes becoming sterile, with the result that the farmers&#x2019; lamb percentage deteriorate tremendously. I can call upon members of the Other Place who can testify that they suffered a loss of 80&#x0025; on their lamb crop. In addition it happens that there is a 50&#x0025; and 60&#x0025; mortality of those lambs which are born, although the farmer does not have the opportunity of marketing the remainder in time, and has to keep them for longer periods than was previously the case. Those which remain are left with a defect which makes them permanently unsuited for the market. That is why I believe that the department has to obtain certain means of counteracting this plague. Remedies do in fact exist today. There is, <i>inter alia,</i> a nine-purpose preparation on the market, a preparation which may be administered to pigs and to cattle. There are seven different preparations for horses, and 42 for sheep, cattle and goats. The manufacturers of those preparations have turned the farms in our part of the country into a financial battlefield. Their preparations are tremendously expensive. Whereas we were previously able to administer doses of these preparations to our animals twice annually, we are now obliged by circumstances to administer these doses to our animals every 21 days. Hon. members from the Free State can testify to the truth of this statement. A 5-litre container of this preparation at present costs R120. No farmer is able to carry on in this way any more. No one can afford such an expensive preparation any more.</p>

<p>Since there is great doubt among farmers today about the effectiveness of all the available preparations, I want to make a request to the hon. the Minister to ensure that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services tests the effectiveness of that preparation in order to establish whether it is really as effective as the manufacturers claim. I want to submit that certain preparations should be placed on the market again. Farmers should be allowed to apply DDT again for certain purposes. It is an essential aid for farmers. In the second place there is the Gouws preparation. I really do not know what harm the Gouws preparation can do. I am not alleging that it is an effective preparation against internal parasites, but it is in fact a tonic for animals. Farmers used it as a tonic, and were then deprived of it. However, I want to allege that a better substance as a substitute for the Gouws preparation will never be found. I want to recommend that farmers should be permitted to obtain the Gouws preparation under a special permit or under a special licence The mosquito plague in particular is not only a danger to animals but is a danger to human beings as well. It could even be a fatal danger. Many of our Coloured labourers became so ill from mosquito bites this year that if medical aid had not been rapidly available they would <span class="col_8191-8192" refersTo="page_1426"/>have died. In fact, there were a number of deaths among them.</p>

<p>Something must be done by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Someone requested me the other day to ask the hon. the Minister to do something, even if it was only to give us a shotgun and a few cartridges so that we could simply start shooting in order to rid ourselves of our frustrations. We must definitely do something. If something is not done, scores of our farmers in the Northern Cape and in the Free State will go under. They will not only suffer hardships. They will go under, simply because they have no means with which they can defend themselves against the plagues afflicting them.</p>

<p>It is alleged that the Orange River is the cause of it. Pans and valleys are filled with water from the river, and the mosquitoes breed in their millions among the reeds, in the stagnant water. Even during the winter months not all the mosquitoes die off. A large percentage of them remain and are a nuisance even during the winter. The hon. the Minister must please not think that I am raising this matter simply in order to have it placed on record. I am not speaking about it simply to be able to say that it was in fact raised in Parliament. I am speaking about it because it is an urgent need and because requests have even been made at the meetings of agricultural unions to the effect that the Government should give serious attention to this matter. No matter what it costs, something will have to be done. It is impossible for a farmer to stand by and watch his animals dying, while he is powerless to do anything to change the situation. I am certain that there is something which can be done. Where there is a will, there is a way.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to follow up what the hon. member for Prieska said, although I have sympathy for his problem. This is a problem with which we also have to deal, and I should like to receive that shotgun from the hon. the Minister, if only he would load it with poison gas so that we could shoot the midges with it.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to listen, throughout a long afternoon, to an agricultural debate which was conducted in such a calm manner. It was very clear to us today that things are going well with South Africa, its farmers and its agricultural industry. One ought to be very grateful for that. For that not only our hon. Minister, who is in charge, has to be thanked. Nor is it only our farmers who are good &#x201C;whizz-kids&#x201D; on their farms, who have to be thanked, but also a Supreme Being, who has blessed us so richly these past few years, and this year as well. Sometimes the blessings were so abundant that they sometimes turned into plagues. However, the blessings are even greater than if it had not rained and there had not been any. We in South Africa are fortunate that agriculture enjoys so much attention. If we sit still and think about it for a moment, we will realize that this is true. Today we have obtained a report from a commission here, a report dealing with our agricultural matters. I think that agriculture is probably the industry in which the bulk of the population are engaged. A very large number of these people are serving in this industry free of charge as a result of their fondness for it. In this regard we think of all the associations which are active in our agricultural industry. I think for example of the farmers&#x2019; associations, the wool growers&#x2019; associations, the meat producers&#x2019; associations, and all the boards which we have heard about today. A large majority of these thousands of people are helping to make a greater success of the agricultural industry. Many of them are doing it out of fondness for agriculture, and one can admire many of our agricultural leaders. Some of them are sitting in this House. They make so many sacrifices, out of their love for farming, and in order to make a success of it. We ought to be grateful that there are so many people who are selling agriculture in this way without expecting any remuneration for it. We are also grateful for a Department of Agriculture, with its officials, which is providing us with such a good service. In this regard we can boast that we in South Africa are using some of the most modern methods in respect of agriculture. As this research and modern methods increase, <span class="col_8193-8194" refersTo="page_1427"/>we shall reach a stage where the hon. member for Namaqualand need no longer be concerned about the small farmer. A period is going to arrive when the hon. the Minister of Agriculture need no longer concern himself about uneconomic units. We are aware of the fact that, particularly in irrigation areas, an economic subsistence can be made today on a very small piece of land. This is partly as a result of the modern farming methods which are being employed.</p>

<p>Today I want to mention a few examples of how agricultural organizations can serve the farmers. A few years ago, during the 1970-&#x2019;71 and 1971-&#x2019;72 seasons, there was a serious textile recession in our country. It was obvious that such a situation had very detrimental effect on our wool. The situation was so bad that the Wool Board for the duration of those two seasons, had to plough back approximately R12 million into the market out of the stabilization fund annually so as to achieve the floor price for that wool. During those two years the income from wool consequently diminished considerably. The example I should really like to mention is perhaps a lesser commodity in the agricultural sector, i.e. karakul fur. In those years we did not know what to do with karakul fur. It was simply not possible for us to place it on the market. We could not afford to send it down to the coast to be marketed there, because the price was too low. The price was not even good enough to cover the railage. That was before the latest rates increases. We were saddled with the karakul fur on the farms, and sometimes when we were building roads and the sand troughs were too deep, we used the karakul fur as a filler In those times the wolves which are forever threatening to devour the farmer when he does not have an organization through which to market his product, came down on the fold. One allowed one&#x2019;s fur to be taken away for two and three cents a kg, and one was only too pleased to have it taken off your hands. Karakul fur was harder hit than merino wool.</p>

<p>It was in this time, in the 1972-&#x2019;73 season, that a new marketing system, i.e. the take-over or the pool system, was introduced. As I have already said the karakul farmers were at their wit&#x2019;s end. They placed their confidence in the Wool Board, one of our biggest organizations. It was decided in future to leave the marketing of the commodity entirely to the Wool Board. The farmers trusted the Wool Board and said: &#x201C;What you are able to get for us we will be satisfied with.&#x201D; Today we are laughing happily up our sleeves at this. The Wool Board feels very happy about it, but the farmers feel even happier. They do not want to tell me what the price of karakul fur is these days, but if I were to say that it is approximately 50 cents a kg today, I would probably not be far wrong.</p>

<p>The Wool Board made special efforts. A study in regard to the requirements of the trade was made. The karakul fur was graded into various types, and in this way the trade was satisfied, because they could in that way select the types they wanted. Even the foreign market was explored. Someone was sent overseas to make publicity there, and to advertise karakul fur there. The excellent results are there. Today we are very grateful that the Wool Board placed karakul fur on the market at a very satisfactory price, and did so by means of a satisfactory marketing system. Today many valuable articles are being manufactured from the fur to which no value was attached in the past. That is why it is a privilege for me today, as a karakul farmer, to extend my sincere thanks to the Wool Board on behalf, I think, of thousands of our karakul farmers for what we have achieved in respect of karakul fur. That is all I want to say about that matter.</p>

<p>I should like to associate myself with what my colleague, the hon. member for Omaruru said. I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Agriculture that those of us who are situated in the remoter areas of South West, have been very hard hit recently by the increase in the railage rates.</p>

<p>It is not only the cattle farmer who has been affected, but also the transportation of karakul fur and of small stock, etc. I do not want to spend time on this topic, nor do I want to be difficult about it, but I do want to address a request to the hon. the Minister to support our organizations in those parts of the world and <span class="col_8195-8196" refersTo="page_1428"/>give them guidance and assistance as far as the solutions for which they are seeking are concerned. They are indeed engaged in seeking solutions and in new schemes. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the hon. member for Prieska and confirm what he said about the problems of the farmers in the Northern Cape as well as in the northern parts of the Karoo. I was one of those farmers who experienced how sheep died as a result of the plague of midges and mosquitoes in that area. The problem was caused by the tremendously high rainfall we had there. Normally the average rainfall there is between 10 to 12 inches. During the past two years it has risen to almost 40 inches per year. There are farmers who say that they know how to weather a drought, but do not know how to cope with that kind of flood damage and rainfall. The stock losses were tremendous, primarily as a result of the midge problem and the mosquitoes. As the hon. member for Prieska said, it prevents the sheep from grazing. They cannot eat and they are so tormented by the insects that the other problems which the hon. member mentioned here, follow. But apart from the problems he mentioned here, there are also the diseases carried by these insects, diseases such as Rift Valley fever, blue tongue and all the other diseases that go with it. The farmers have inoculated as never before, frequently with great success, and here we have to thank Onderstepoort for the wonderful work they have done in at least making those various vaccines available to us to cope with these problems. I am also grateful to the researchers for the various preparations which they have made available to us. It seemed to me as if the hon. member for Prieska was complaining because there were too many preparations on the market today, and yet asked for additional preparations with which to combat these problems. I want to testify that I found those preparations extremely effective. The problem is sometimes that the farmers do not take the necessary precaution of administering those substances in a scientific way. I see so often that farmers administer doses, at great expense, to their entire flock of 2 000 or 3 000 sheep, and then return them to the same infected camp which has been infected by thousands of internal parasite eggs. After all, one cannot expect those sheep to remain uninfected for long.</p>

<p>I have discovered that the secret is to apply pasture rotation, as recommended by the extension officers, and to place them in camps which have been ungrazed for six months or a year. I have found that a single dosage of these modern preparations protects them for two to three years from internal parasites during times of normal rainfall. Under the present circumstances I have found that one or two doses were sufficient, but then one should have the necessary scientific approach. The preparations are in fact exorbitantly expensive, but they are effective. I feel that the problem is not all that simple to control&#x2014;I am referring now to midges and mosquitoes&#x2014;as one might imagine. On the Ghaap plateau there are thousands of pans of water, and in each all the depressions made by the hooves of cattle there are pools of water in which these mosquitoes and midges breed. Consequently control by means of spraying will be an impossible task. In my opinion the only possible solution will be to find a systemic preparation with which we can dose or inoculate the sheep so that these blood-sucking insects can be killed if they come into contact with the body of the live animal. I should request that research be concentrated in that direction. At the same time this would control blood-sucking flies and ticks as well. During these years of heavy rainfall we also had a tremendous tick plague in the Northern Cape. This also caused tremendous problems. Together with all the problems the farmers experienced we also found that it would seem that our lands were leached to such an extent by the abundance of water that we are now experiencing shortages of trace elements, for I do not believe that the tremendous problems we have been experiencing with the livestock in that area were attributable only to the blood-sucking insects.</p>

<p>There was a tremendous polemic in the Northern Cape and in Griqualand West in <span class="col_8197-8198" refersTo="page_1429"/>regard to the shortages of trace elements. There was a stage when we were urged not to provide trace elements, but subsequently we were, on the other hand, urged to do so. At an even later stage, a halt was called to this, and at present everyone is awaiting the thorough investigation which the department was to have arranged to establish what trace elements are in reality required in large parts of South Africa. At present it is felt that there is a serious shortage of zinc among the livestock. On the one hand we were warned against the supplementary feeding of zinc, and on the other hand we were told what wonderful results the addition of zinc to the diet had produced.</p>

<p>But what I am very pleased about is the new biological approach of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services to the problems of the farmer. I believe that the biological control off insect pests such as mosquitoes and midges plays a tremendous part in eliminating these temporary plagues. Those who are engaged in the farming industry have already seen how dragonflies water spiders, as well as grey flies have just about eradicated certain mosquitoes in the Northern Cape. Where a person has protected the natural enemies of these pests, a relatively rapid reaction has been obtained and frequently these problems were very soon overcome.</p>

<p>In the excellent report of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services one sees how the department has concentrated on the biological control of various plagues, particularly plagues dealing with imported weeds such as the imbricate cactus, hakea and the ordinary cactus. Outstanding results have been achieved in the past with biological control, and I believe that this is the other approach which ought to be adopted in respect of these insect plagues. This approach should be adopted not only in respect of weeds, such as hakea and the various Australian acacias which have proliferated in this country, but that this approach also be adopted in respect of insect plagues. This is the only long-term control measure which will be effective.</p>

<p>Another problem which is being experienced in the Northern Cape is that farmers&#x2019; sheep frequently die without it being possible to establish from what causes they died. These sheep are rushed down to Kimberley where samples are taken to be sent away to Onderstepoort. Eventually after months of waiting, the report comes back, and the farmer is informed that the sample disintegrated en route. The ice melted and the sample purified and it was consequently not possible to establish from what causes the animal died. In the meantime the farmer has used every vaccine he was able to get his hands on, and applied shotgun methods to try to control further mortality. For this reason I should like to make a serious appeal to the hon. the Minister to see whether it is not possible to establish a bacteriological laboratory in Kimberley. I understand that a post does in fact exist, and that something of this nature can in fact be done if the necessary facilities can be obtained there to enable the farmer to bring his samples in to the laboratory. It will be possible to carry out the post mortem there and then, it will be possible to take samples and it will be possible to carry out the bacteriological examination <i>in loco,</i> without any need to send the samples away.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. H. VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Benoni will probably pardon me if I do not take the subject which he discussed any further. I believe that he will receive a favourable reply to his representations from the hon. the Minister. Those who are engaged in the agricultural industry are very blessed, we are blessed with a wonderful hon. Minister, an equally wonderful hon. Deputy Minister, as well as equally wonderful officials who manage the departments. However, I make so bold as to say that the hon. the Minister, the hon. the Deputy Minister and the officials would not have been such excellent people if it had not been for the exceptional calibre of farmer with which South African agriculture is blessed. The South African farmer is a man who does not hesitate to work six days of the week, or even seven days of the week, particularly farmers in the dairy industry. It is this type of man, this farmer, who does not hesitate to work and to <span class="col_8199-8200" refersTo="page_1430"/>venture, so much so that we can say this afternoon that things are going well with the South African agricultural industry. Things are going well, but not because the good things fell into the farmers&#x2019; lap. We are dealing here with a person who is hardworking and enterprising, a man who is courageous, and with him there is the farmer&#x2019;s wife who is ever at his side. Truly, we in South Africa are blessed with farmers who have, during the past decade or two, achieved exceptional results. I am thinking here in particular of the production during the past decade, a production which progressively increased, so much so that the Republic of South Africa is one of the few countries in the world which has an agricultural surplus. Together with that, I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central who discussed the matter of veld improvement. We were blessed with excellent rain years, we were blessed with a livestock reduction scheme, but if it had not been for the ingenuity of the South African farmer as far as veld conservation was concerned, that measure of veld improvement would not have taken place. The achievements in agriculture have been excellent, for we must take into consideration that the land available for agriculture is extremely limited. Together with the limited amount of agricultural land we have a limited quantity of water for irrigation purposes. Together with this there is the fact that the South African farmer is faced with extremes of climatic conditions.</p>

<p>In addition to the tribute I wish to pay to the South African farmer, I also wish to pay tribute to the approximately 8 000 officials of the Department of Agriculture who are constantly engaged in research in the sphere of agriculture. Their entrepreneurial skill has contributed to field husbandry production being virtually doubled since 1960, while the production of certain horticultural crops, over the same period, was increased by approximately 300&#x0025;. Together with that we have the exceptional achievements of the livestock farmers in regard to the livestock industry.</p>

<p>This morning the hon. member for Newton Park referred to the shortage of extension officers. This is a fact we have to face up to. However, what I find wonderful is that in spite of the limited number of extension officers, we still have the fact that we have had continuous expansion in the sphere of agriculture as the result of extension. I would therefore like to state here that we are exceptionally fortunate in having had this calibre of extension officer at our disposal. These achievements are all the more noteworthy if we take into consideration the risk factor with which the South African farmer has to cope. In this regard I want to mention the fact that the farmer not only has to contend with the elements and with nature, these elements which frequently cripple the farmer, as has recently become apparent again from what the hon. member for Prieska and the hon. member for Benoni had to say here. There is also another factor with which the farmer has to struggle, i.e. that the price of his produce cannot be determined in advance, but only after he has already produced it. This is a factor which really causes the farmer many problems, so much so that he cannot always plan his production well. In this regard I also want to refer to the production of red meat. It is a fact that there has been a drastic fall-off in the total slaughterings in controlled areas since 1970, while the price of red meat has risen tremendously; in other words, while slaughterings decreased&#x2014;smaller numbers of livestock were slaughtered&#x2014;the total amount earned rose tremendously. This is excellent. One is grateful for that. The other factor which we have to take into account is, however, the phenomenal increase in the production costs of the farmer. Here I want to mention to you what has already been mentioned repeatedly in this context. I am referring to the 50&#x0025; increase in railway rates for the conveyance of livestock, the third increase within three years. This is a factor in the farming industry which requires our positive attention. If the agricultural industry does not continue to plan through research, I do not see how we will be able to maintain our production in future.</p>

<p>In regard to planning through research I should like to mention something which is developing in the Great Fish River Valley. That valley, with its wonderful possibilities for field husbandry and horticultural production, <span class="col_8201-8202" refersTo="page_1431"/>is being crippled by a lack of knowledge in regard to planning. As a result of the high water level in that valley, that area is in reality being crippled. There have been requests for the establishment of at least a trial plot in that valley, and although the department is sympathetically disposed towards such a step, the necessary manpower and funds are not available for such a trial plot. My plea to the hon. the Minister is that further attention should be given to this matter, in spite of the shortage of manpower and funds. This problem requires immediate attention.</p>

<p>However, there is another factor in regard to planning through research. It has been found that sugar cane can be cultivated very effectively in the lower Sundays River Valley. Soil tests have already been carried out in this regard. Climatological tests have also been made, and it has been found that the entire set-up there lends itself admirably to the cultivation of sugar cane. It is a commodity which we believe is going to be in short supply in the near future as the result of the increase in the buying power in this country. The individual farmer is not in a position to launch this project. Therefore I am advocating once again an investigation through research into the cultivation of sugar cane in this area of the lower Sundays River Valley, which lends itself admirably to this industry.</p>

<p>I also want to mention the numerous plagues&#x2014;which we have just heard about&#x2014; with which the farmers are having to cope. I am thinking, for example, of the increase in plagues such as jointed cactus Nazella grass and the silver-leaf bitter apple, against which no counter-agent exists, but which are in fact encroaching on thousands of hectares of beautiful agricultural land. With this wideawake department of ours I believe that we are keeping pace with developments, and we are proud of the fact. However, I want to bring the above-mentioned matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hefer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. HEFER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to congratulate the hon. member for Somerset-East on his interesting speech. Unfortunately I cannot react to what he said about the wide variety of plagues, from mosquitoes to jointed cactus. We in the Eastern Transvaal have been spared those plagues. There were a few previous speakers in this debate who referred to the dairy industry and to dairy products, and I just want to make a few observations in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, in his very fine, positive speech on the problems, referred <i>inter alia</i> to subsidies in agriculture with the object of helping the lesser privileged. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South also emphasized the objective of subsidies to assist the lesser privileged. The farmer from &#x201C;Lemoenkloof&#x201D;, i.e. the hon. member for Orange Grove, also referred to the subsidy as support for the lesser privileged. This is the intention with the subsidy, but we are convinced that that subsidy does not work out that way in practice. I want to quote a single example. I think that the subsidy on white bread is a subsidy for the rich and for the gourmets. I think we should prefer to have white milk form part of the diet of a family rather than to have white bread on the table. That subsidy on white bread is costing our government R90 million, which is a very expensive investment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg-South also asked for the free distribution of milk. However, there is one problem attached to the relaxation of control over distribution, and that is the pollution of the milk as such. Sir, milk is simply a product which one cannot wash and then use. If it has been polluted, it is polluted, and it is dangerous to use that milk.</p>

<p>To return to the producers themselves, I want to say that they are the producers of a commodity which is essential in the diet of our people. I cannot see how we can cease to prescribe milk as a very essential component in a balanced diet. It is really of great importance to the growth and physical development of our children. We find, however, that there is a drop in the number of milk producers. In the annual report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing we find statistics which indicate that there has in fact been a decrease in the numbers. Why has there been such a decrease? I think that we <span class="col_8203-8204" refersTo="page_1432"/>can summarize the reasons into three main points.</p>

<p>In the first place it is an industry with a large measure of uncertainty as regards its continuity and its continued existence. It is capital intensive and requires a large investment of capital for the necessary machinery, construction of buildings, plans and productive animals.</p>

<p>It is an industry with major labour problems. As the hon. member for Somerset East indicated, it is this industry in which a farmer works seven days a week. I do not even want to tell you how many hours per day such a farmer works, Sir. There is simply no manual labour available any more. It is therefore necessary to convert to an ever-increasing measure of mechanisation, which requires a considerable degree of capital investment.</p>

<p>The next problem is the distribution problem, which pushes up the cost of the product. Basically we have those three problems in this industry.</p>

<p>There are certain recommendations which, in all humility, I want to submit to the hon. the Minister. In the first place I want to recommend, in support of previous speakers and also in support of what is mentioned in the report of the Wentzel Commission, that the two boards be amalgamated. We find that the two boards already have total funds of approximately R15&#x00BD; million at their disposal. Those funds may be combined, to the benefit of the producer as well as the consumer. I think that this would lead to a cost saving for our farmers.</p>

<p>The following recommendation I want to make is the registration of all our dairy farmers. There has to be compulsory registration. We find that in the summertime there is a surplus of supply because those whom we could call the summer farmers, who are not regular milk producers, then market their products. This causes a surplus on the market, and as a result of that we find price fluctuations and price factors which have a detrimental effect on the regular milk producer.</p>

<p>Another recommendation is that a certain standard should be laid down for all cowsheds and for all dairy herds, so that all milk which is delivered may qualify as fresh milk.</p>

<p>We must not draw a distinction between the present fresh milk and industrial milk, for what happens when there is a shortage of fresh milk? In that case, the industrial milk is fed into the fresh milk channel in any case. On the other hand, it happens today, as a result of our distribution problems, that when the container unit arrives too late at the central depot, that milk is no longer accepted and is rejected as industrial milk. This is a great loss to a farmer who has equipped his cowsheds for fresh milk production. Although his product complies completely with the standards, it is rejected as industrial milk because of the refusal to accept delivery. Most of our farmers who produce industrial milk&#x2014;I am speaking with a reasonable knowledge of our farmers in the highveld region&#x2014;have equipped themselves in this way in any case, because it is to their advantage, and because they are more easily able to retain the services of their labour if they equip their cowsheds in such a way that these cowsheds qualify for the production of fresh milk in any case. If it were possible to arrange matters in this way, it would also be possible to facilitate the distribution of milk, for it would then be possible for the distribution points to be the nearest source of delivery. It will then be possible to eliminate the separate delivery of fresh milk and industrial milk. Arrangements can then be made in such a way that the nearest zone delivers fresh milk, while the remoter places will be able to deliver milk at the same price to our industries so that provision could be made for the other products. This would make a great cost saving possible for the farmer.</p>

<p>We would also like to request a re-appraisal or reconsideration in this regard in order to help our dairy farmers. We have very competent and skilled people among our number, and if we are able to erect large grain silos at high cost&#x2014;we do not begrudge the cultivators of our field crops these facilities&#x2014;I want to ask whether we cannot also appropriate money for the establishment of central depots in our large consumption centres to serve as receiving units to enable the cheaper distribution of milk. We also want to request that a marketing <span class="col_8205-8206" refersTo="page_1433"/>promotion campaign be launched in respect of our milk production, so that the Housewives League do not organize a resistance movement, but help to educate the people to buy milk instead of liquor. If one visits the squatter camps and similar lesser privileged areas, one notes with astonishment what quantities of liquor are being consumed there. We have to launch a marketing promotion campaign to place milk on the market as a nutritional product for our children, a product which may be consumed with pleasure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Kimberley North has dealt with subjects that are very close to my heart, and I am afraid I am going to allow myself to be led astray and to deal with some of the subjects he has dealt with, instead of the subject that I wished to discuss with the hon. the Minister. I hope I shall have time for that as well. When he says that he would rather have white milk in a household than white bread, I agree with him entirely. Since the last increase in the price of white bread, when the whole of that increase was taken out of the pocket of the housewife and put into the pocket of the Government, we have had no white bread in my house at all. We never have white bread and I must say that we are much better off having brown bread.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider the implication of what the hon. member for Standerton has said and of what I am saying now. I wonder if the time has not come for the hon. the Minister to halve the subsidy on white bread and to double the subsidy on brown bread. Let us reduce the price of brown bread and let us increase the price of white bread. I believe that the hon. the Minister will be surprised at the result of such a step. I also believe that that will be the proof of the argument which he and I have had over the years about my submission that the primary factor in selling a good product&#x2014; accepting that the quality is always there&#x2014;is the price. Coupled with this, I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister to ask the CSIR, together with the Division of Nutrition of his department, to go into the question of making brown bread more palatable for the Black people. Black people have certain likes and dislikes when it comes to taste. One can ask any commercial firm to verify this. One dairy concern is at the moment producing magou with a ginger beer flavour. Magou, the traditional drink of the Black people&#x2014;a drink produced from mealie meal&#x2014;is being produced with a ginger beer flavour because market research discovered that Black people were buying magou together with ginger beer and mixing the two. Now, magou is being produced with a ginger beer flavour. I commend this idea to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>This is part of the marketing concept, part of what we meant when, in our commission&#x2019;s report, we referred to the fact that the boards, the department and everybody else must become more marketing orientated. The boards must forget about controlling; there should not be control boards. Production must not be controlled. Marketing must not be controlled. Products should be put on the market, and for that to be done, the department must find out what the farmers can produce, what the consumer wants and then marry those two things together. That is what must be done. I commend that idea to the hon. the Minister. He has disagreed with the recommendation of the commission. One of his main objections is the alleged contamination which can result if there are to many distributors. I cannot agree with him, because every distributor of milk is subject to the health regulations of the local authority wherever he is situated. I believe that the local authorities can look after half a dozen distributors here in Cape Town, instead of only the three they have at the moment. I also believe that they can comply with exactly the same health regulations, whether there are 6 or 26 distributors. I am glad to have the support of that hon. member with regard to the problem of distribution costs. That is something we shall have to look into.</p>

<p>The hon. member has also raised the question of compulsory registration of dairy farmers and of standard specifications for stables and dairies. If he looks at the report, he will see&#x2014;in paragraph 81.3&#x2014;that we have <span class="col_8207-8208" refersTo="page_1434"/>suggested that a committee should be established on which both sections of the dairy industry must be represented, together with the department of the hon. the Minister, in order to go into these very points. We felt it was outside the terms of reference of the commission to go into the details of the implementation of the recommendation, but we have made the recommendation in all sincerity and we would like to see it carried through.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the poultry industry. I believe this industry is to be congratulated in this time of inflation, because if there is one sector of agriculture which has kept prices down more than any other, it has been this one. While the cost of living has increased since 1971 by 78&#x0025;, the average retail price of eggs has climbed by only 35&#x0025;&#x2014;from 31 cents a dozen in 1971 to 42,7 cents a dozen in 1976. During the same period of time the average net realization to producers has risen by 45&#x0025;. This indicates that we have here an industry which has become more efficient in the production of its product. The producer has received a higher return, while, at the same time, the industry has kept the increase to the consumer to a minimum. I believe this is the ideal we should all aim at. However, the increase to the consumer could have been even lower had we had some way of controlling the massive surpluses which will result and which have resulted from this greater efficiency of production within the industry. The surpluses have resulted, not because there has been a decrease in consumption but because there has been an increase in the efficiency of production.</p>

<p>I stress that point. We in this House were forced to pass legislation in order to curtail the production of eggs. The hon. the Minister knows that I have been critical of the way in which he and his department have administered this Act, because despite the provisions of this Act, we have continued to have surpluses which have grown from 369 000 cases or 11 million dozen eggs in 1971 to 880 000 cases or 26 million dozen eggs in 1976. This means an increase of more than 100&#x0025; in the surplus in five years&#x2019; time, while the consumption has, in fact, more than doubled as well. That has happened despite the Act. When we look at the report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing, we find the following on page 48&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Egg production continues to rise, despite the Egg Production Control Act, which came into operation in 1970.</block>

<p>Further on we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the course of the season it became clear that great care will have to be taken in reissuing permits to producers registering their poultry farms as companies.</block>

<p>The most significant statement of all was the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The main reason for the record production is the fact that producers have utilized their existing permits to a greater extent than in the past.</block>

<p>With respect to the hon. the Minister and his department, for the first time I can see the problem which the hon. the Minister and the department have. It would appear that he has been issuing permits to farmers to produce eggs, which the farmers did not use. The hon. the Minister should introduce an amendment to the Egg Production Control Act to provide that if a farmer does not take up the quota which is granted to him within a reasonable time, that quota shall be taken away from him, because for the first time I realize exactly what the problem has been. It is apparent that these producers have obtained from the department, in one way or another, permits for birds which they had no intention of keeping. Now, as the prices have increased over the years and as their efficiency has increased, they have increased their flocks within the limits allowed by the permit, but above the requirements of the country.</p>

<p>I believe the hon. the Minister has a duty to balance the number of birds allowed in terms of the permit with the requirements of the country. We have to aim for a small surplus; we all accept that. We have to aim for a <span class="col_8209-8210" refersTo="page_1435"/>surplus, because there will be times when production is going to drop and we shall need any surplus we can get. However, I do not believe that we need to have produced in this country 26 million dozen surplus eggs which are going to be exported or disposed of, by whatever means, at a loss of R5 million. R5 million is an awful lot of money. It represents 3 cents for every dozen of eggs the housewife in this country has bought. The consumption of eggs has more than doubled during the last four years. The egg price can be reduced by 3 cents a dozen if we can balance production with consumption as the hon. the Minister will concede, because then we can do away with the levy. If we can reduce the price of eggs by 3 cents a dozen, we shall redouble the consumption of eggs again in the next four years. I believe we shall then enter the so far untapped markets&#x2014;in particular the Black markets&#x2014;in this country. If they can obtain a product at a lower price, they will buy it. I have proved this in my supermarket and I have told the hon. the Minister this before. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#simkin">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. H. W. SIMKIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member must forgive me if I do not react to his argument. The importance of pedigree stock breeding was realized by the State as far back as 1814 when Lord Charles Somerset imported pedigree cattle from the United Kingdom. In 1815 he also introduced pedigree merino sheep from Spain into the country. Since that time large numbers of pedigree stock of various breeds have been imported from various parts of the world. More than adequate numbers of stock have been brought into the country since that time. The then departments of Agriculture of the various colonies participated in the importation of such animals to a large extent. They even established research stations at Potchefstroom and Standerton for the purpose of making available to the South African stock farmers improved genetic material through stud farms. Consequently the need to establish a South African Stud Book Association of our own was realized by all. Mr. Alex Holm, who was on the staff of the Potchefstroom branch of the Department of Agriculture at that time, exerted himself for the establishment of our own South African Stud Book Association as well as various Stock Breeders&#x2019; Associations. As long ago as 1903 a meeting of stock farmers representing the various colonies as well as the various departments of agriculture was called at Bloemfontein at which a decision was taken in favour of the establishment of our own South African Stud Book Association. In 1905 the S.A. Stud Book Association was established for the purpose of keeping record of animal husbandry and for promoting the development and the improvement of the livestock of the country.</p>

<p>During 1920 provision was made by means of legislation for the incorporation of the S.A. Stud Book Association and of societies affiliated thereto engaged in the evolution of any new breed of livestock. Consequently the S.A. Stud Book Association was incorporated on 21 April 1921. Since that time, in terms of various ordinances of the then protectorates and the Rhodesias the S.A. Stud Book Association has been rendering all the necessary services in this regard in the territories and the countries concerned, as is still doing today. Ever since its establishment the S.A. Stud Book Association and its affiliated breeders&#x2019; societies have exerted themselves with dedication for the upgrading of all farm livestock through the provision of breeding stock to the livestock industry with a view to raising the general standard of the country&#x2019;s livestock.</p>

<p>At the celebration of its fifteenth anniversary in 1971 the S.A. Stud Book Association, in view of the rapidly changing conditions and needs, deemed it necessary to undertake an in-depth investigation at a high level so as to determine in what way the pedigree livestock industry could make bigger and even more constructive contributions to livestock improvement. Consequently at the instance of the then Minister of Agriculture, it took the initiative, in close co-operation with the Animal and Dairy Science Research Institute to determine the shortcomings in and the needs of the livestock industry and to find possible solutions so as to enable it to keep abreast of <span class="col_8211-8212" refersTo="page_1436"/>the scientific and technological developments in order to be able to meet the future needs of the country. Like the Department of Agriculture, the Stud Book Association conducted a thorough investigation into organized livestock industries in various leading countries in the world so as to enable it to determine the best possible system for stock improvement applicable to South African conditions and circumstances. New approaches and the need for improvement, not only in the methods employed by the pedigree livestock industry, but also in the necessity to place all facets of the livestock industry on a properly coordinated level in order to enable the entire livestock industry to meet future needs became apparent from this investigation. The need for new legislation consolidating all facets of livestock improvement, was very clear to the S. A. Stud Book Association and especially the establishment of an advisory council for animal production for the purpose of assisting the Minister of Agriculture in an advisory capacity in respect of planning and development in the livestock industry.</p>

<p>The increase in the relative importance of animal production and animal products in the economy of developing countries in particular, has become a feature of recent times and this can only be effected by applying modern science and technology to an ever increasing extent. Even in countries such as Sweden and France, it was found necessary to make urgent adjustments by amending existing legislation and even by introducing special legislation. Consequently it is regrettable that the consolidating legislation for livestock improvement cannot be piloted through Parliament this year already. The S.A. Stud Book Association in particular, and the livestock industry as a whole, owe the hon. the Minister of Agriculture an enormous debt of gratitude, however, for the fact that he has already agreed to the appointment of an interim advisory council for animal production. I trust that it will be put into operation as soon as possible, because I have no doubt that the council will do very good job of work.</p>

<p>As far as the S.A. Stud Book Association itself is concerned, it was realized after thorough investigation that although the pedigree livestock industry may look back with satisfaction to the contribution it has made in the sphere of livestock improvement over the past 50 years, it will have to accept ever greater responsibilities in respect of livestock improvement. The association realizes that the task of the pedigree livestock breeder to provide the livestock industry with breeding stock which has the necessary genetic potential, will necessitate major sacrifices and adjustments. The pedigree livestock industry therefore sees its future task not only as keeping records of pedigree, but it sees pedigree livestock breeding as the nucleus of the livestock industry which has to provide the necessary genetic seed material to the livestock industry. In order to be able to do this, it is essential for it tom have all achievements and other information at its disposal. The industry owes the hon. the Minister a debt of gratitude for the various achievement test schemes which have already been put into operation.</p>

<p>The use of an electronic computer for record keeping and data processing is essential, however, so as to render it possible that such processed data can be used as an additional aid in selection programmes. Therefore, the use of an electronic computer by the pedigree livestock industry is essential, but the high costs involved in such mechanization cannot, however, be financed by the industry itself. Because of the responsibility which the State also has in respect of the development of the livestock industry, it is essential that the State provide the necessary financial aid so as to enable the pedigree livestock industry to obtain the required computer facilities so that they may be able to serve the livestock industry even more efficiently. Therefore I should like to address a friendly but urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister to give the S.A. Stud Book Association the necessary financial aid.</p>
