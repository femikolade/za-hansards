<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I come to the motion of the hon. member I feel compelled to say that I listened to the discussion in this debate as often as my duties allowed. In the course of this week we discussed very delicate matters. We discussed matters which could even be described as very contentious, and I as a parliamentarian, in common with you, was very proud of the fact <span class="col_347-348" refersTo="page_0190"/>that Parliament discussed these delicate and contentious matters in the manner it did. I think it redounded greatly to the credit of this Parliament that the discussion was at all times conducted on such a high level.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition saw fit to move a motion of no confidence in the Government and in myself, a motion which stands on three legs. Naturally the Leader of the Opposition has the right to move a motion of no confidence in the Government, but I feel that my friend failed to read the signs of the time correctly. As far as this Government is concerned, there may be differences of opinion and opposition as regards the handling of the matters which were mentioned here, as well as other matters. Sometimes a great number of questions are even asked about these matters. I readily concede that. However, there is no lack of confidence in this Government. No, Sir, there is understanding among the general public; there is support among the general public; there is confidence among the general public. Therefore I believe that the motion of my friend does not in any respect reflect the feeling which is prevailing in this country. In fact, Sir, your announcement of the unopposed election today, in an urban electoral division in Bloemfontein, of a National Party member, correctly reflects the confidence which exists.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader based this motion of his on three legs. Perhaps it was because the motion was so shaky and would have fallen on only two legs that the hon. member gave it three. It deals, firstly, with Angola; secondly, with the economy; and thirdly, with the relations issue. I think the hon. member will agree with me that I should allow the main emphasis of my reply to fall on the Angolan situation. I do not think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will take it amiss of me if I therefore refer only in passing to the other two legs. I am not doing this because I do not think that they are important. They are indeed very important, but they are certainly being overshadowed at this moment by the Angolan situation. I am doing this in the second place because I believe that the Opposition on the other side has already been provided with satisfactory replies in respect of the other two matters.</p>

<p>With reference to the economy the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economic Affairs have furnished specific replies, with which I am in full agreement, to the questions which were put to them. I know of no one of any significance who ever doubted, or doubts today, that South Africa acted correctly in devaluing when it did and to the extent to which it did. I do not think we need argue about that.</p>

<p>Replies with which I am also in full agreement were furnished in regard to the question of inflation. As is fitting, the Government has devoted more of its attention than ever before to these matters. Nor did the Government simply leave it at that; it proceeded to take positive action. I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express my special appreciation for the way in which all our people have co-operated in combating inflation. I think it was a unique achievement in the history not only of South Africa but probably of most other parts of the world. It was an achievement that we were able to bring employer and employee together around the conference table, and that cordial co-operation between them was achieved. Worker and employer, farmer and urban dweller, consumer and manufacturer, clerk and businessman, housewife and industrialist, all co-operated cordially in regard to this matter. That is also why the results, as has been indicated, did not fail to materialize. It is not a matter which one can solve overnight, for it is intimately bound up with what is happening in other parts of the world, and a very large part of our inflation is being imported from those countries. I maintain that the positive results which have been achieved and the spirit which emanated from that co-operation augurs well for the future. I do not know, nor do I think that anyone in South Africa can say, precisely what is in store for us and how matters are going to develop during the next few months. I do not want there to be any panic; indeed, there is no reason for panic, whatever may happen in future. But I want to say, with all the conviction I have at my command, that during the coming months in particular, there is every reason to exercise moderation, vigilance and care, moderation in our demands, moderation in the expenditure we incur, not only as State or as corporations, but also as individuals. I believe, and there is abundant evidence supporting this from all over the world, that South Africa&#x2019;s economy may be considered to be strong and healthy, and that South Africa may still be regarded as one of the best areas of <span class="col_349-350" refersTo="page_0191"/>investment in the world. This was proved by the inflow of capital last year, and noticeably so towards the end of last year, precisely the time one would perhaps have expected investors to have been discouraged. Naturally one would have liked the situation to have been more favourable, but under the circumstances I believe, in view of the problems we had to overcome, that the Government has done well on the economic front, and hon. members may rest assured that we shall maintain and stimulate the economic growth to the best of our ability, as we have in fact been doing over the years. From time to time we experienced setbacks, if one looks back over the years we have been governing South Africa, but we consistently overcame those setbacks. As far as I am concerned the trend is still a progressive one and the graph an upward one. Occasionally there will be a downturn&#x2014;this is to be expected; it has always been the case and is the case in other countries of the world. But it is not important whether there is an occasional downturn; what is important is whether the trend is an upward one. The same applies to political parties. What is important is not whether they occasionally fare worse in a constituency; what is important is who they bring in through that door. We have the reply to that question, Sir.</p>

<p>As far as race relations are concerned, I want to state that basic relations in South Africa are sound, in spite of what is being said and written. Let us consider the Coloured situation for just a moment. My colleagues have already dealt comprehensively with the CRC aspect. I am in full agreement with the dismissal of Mr. Leon. Let us consider the matter honestly. After the dismissal of Mr. Leon there were meetings, there was incitement, and the most reckless things were said. Thousands of people attended the meetings. But I make bold to say, and I keep my ear very close to the ground as far as this matter is concerned, that there was no fit of agitation among the ordinary people. There was not that fit of agitation some newspapers wanted to make out there was. Certain leaders, yes; certain newspapers, yes. Speaking of the leaders, Sir, I held talks with Mr. Leon and his Executive. Hon. members know that I have issued invitations to them over the years, and that they never wanted to come. Recently they did come, and I held talks with them. I explained my offer to them personally. I spent a lot of time on them. My door is open to them at all times. It is my duty to receive them at all times and I shall receive them at all times. I made my offer to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Was that after the dismissal?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it was before the dismissal. They left and were to have returned, for they were to have discussed the offer I had made them with their people; they were to have consulted their people and then return to me. I regret to have to say, Sir, that they did not go and consult their people; they went to incite their people.</p>

<p>Time does not permit me to deal with this in full today, but I do want to say this: The Progressive Party played its part in that connection. On other occasions, such as my New Year&#x2019;s message, I dealt with that offer and the circumstances in full. My past, the nine years I have been holding this office, proves that my door is open at all times. I am prepared to hold talks and negotiations at any time. No one can level any reproach at me in that connection. But in spite of that hon. members such as those come forward and poison not only the situation here in South Africa but also in the outside world by accusing me and saying: Yes, there is a relaxation of tension on the foreign front; there is d&#x00E9;tente on the foreign front, but why is there no d&#x00E9;tente within South Africa? Such hon. members are not seeking d&#x00E9;tente; they are seeking surrender. I am not prepared to do that; I am not at all prepared to do that. I say that I am in favour of talks and I am in favour of d&#x00E9;tente at all times, and I do not like threatening people. Nor am I doing so in that spirit today. I am merely stating this as a fact. When it comes to consultation everyone will find me willing at all times to hold consultations with them. But I have never yet flinched from the confrontation other people wanted to force on me. I do not seek it, but if other people wish to force it on me I am not going to run away from it. I think it is good that we understand one another as far as that matter is concerned. I made my offer. Owing to a lack of co-operation I am unable to carry out part of that offer. I shall carry out that part which I am in fact able to carry out; I shall proceed with it whether or not there is co-operation from the leaders of the Labour Party.</p>

<p><span class="col_351-352" refersTo="page_0192"/>I come now to the Indians. I think there is a firm understanding between them and us; the co-operation is good. I made the same offer to the Indians. They are prepared to accept it and I am therefore proceeding to implement it in practice.</p>

<p>Then there is also the question of the Bantu. Over the years the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has levelled the accusation at my predecessors and at myself that our policy has failed, that it is not practical and feasible, that it is &#x201C;a pie in the sky&#x201D;, that we are not in earnest about it, and so on. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has always tried to imply that the fragments of that policy are lying scattered around the feet of my predecessors and myself. If we were to piece together all the fragments which have fallen around my hon. friend I would not be able to see him today; there would have been a hill between us. Our policy has not failed; our policy has succeeded in spite of the obstacles which were placed in our path. This year not only South Africa but the world as well will see that that policy of ours, of self-government for the homelands leading to independence, is acceptable and practical and that it will in fact reach completion this year.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect of this matter which is very interesting. Over the years, after we had convinced them, hon. members have been saying that it is perhaps practicable for a homeland that has been consolidated into one contiguous area. There it might work. However, it cannot work for the others, and what is more the others would not touch it with a barge-pole. Bophuthatswana is not consolidated into one contiguous area. On the contrary. Its component parts are widely separated. But Chief Mangope has announced&#x2014;and his council has approved and ratified this decision&#x2014;that in spite of this&#x2014;we considered and discussed the matter&#x2014;he was also going to request independence. It is wrong, some people say, to become free. People are not unfree; they are not unfree because it is the policy of the Government&#x2014;announced by me a year or two ago&#x2014;that every homeland is at liberty to choose its own time to approach this Government and say that the time has arrived and that it wishes to have its full independence. That policy of ours has succeeded. There is no one who can form a different judgment. One considers with gratitude the statements of homeland leaders on communism and terrorism. The Progressive Party would like to set themselves up as the mouthpiece of the urban Bantu in this House. Therefore they should also take cognizance&#x2014;I did not seek this&#x2014;of the findings of the Bantu newspaper, <i>The World.</i> An article in this newspaper happens to concern my person. However, one cannot divorce the person from the party or from the policy of the party; they are inseparably associated with one another. Fifty-three per cent of the readers of that newspaper did not lack confidence in South Africa; they expressed the belief that the leadership of South Africa was in the right hands. No wonder that the report received world-wide publicity, and that a newspaper such as the <i>Christian Science Monitor, inter alia,</i> had the following to say in its edition of Friday 16 January 1976&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For an Afrikaner Nationalist politician to receive such a high percentage of approval from people who could be expected to dislike him, the poll is something of a triumph.</block>

<p>It was a triumph for my party, for my colleague here and his assistants; it afforded recognition to the way in which they are performing their tasks. It is a triumph for the policy of the National Party, for what does this newspaper say? Why did these people poll as they did? This newspaper said that they polled as they did because things were going well with them, as they themselves stated. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Looking round, we see Black men driving the most fashionable cars, owing fashionable houses which are furnished with modern bed-room suites, kitchen schemes and hifi&#x2019;s. We have a bank, owned for the benefit of Blacks by Blacks &#x2026;</block>

<p>And so it continues. Not all of them have these things, but do all the Whites? It was only yesterday, the day before yesterday, when there were still many thousands of Whites in South Africa who had nothing. I do not want to say that it is a paradise, but these Black people have in the meantime compared their position with the position of the Black people in other parts of the world and have come to realize what they have in South Africa. In spite <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0193"/>of instigation there is gratitude to be found among these Black people.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When did you last visit Soweto?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member need not ask me now when I last visited Soweto. I want to ask the hon. member when last she read <i>The World.</i> She will find the answer in it. On what do those who are opposed to this, as this newspaper states, base their case? I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Opponents of Mr. Vorster cited pass laws, the influx regulations that control the flow of Africans &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member knows that this is a matter on which we can no longer be reproached if there are complaints about it. Surely the hon. member knows what agreement I reached with the Black leaders in this regard. The ball is no longer in our court. The ball is now in the court of the Black leaders. In this way one can analyse the matter. However, the following was also revealed by the newspaper. Those who were opposed to this said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although his detractors all seem to admire Mr. Vorster&#x2019;s attempts to make friends with other African States, they criticized him because, as one of them said, he is exercising detente outside South Africa whilst leaving his own backyard dirty.</block>

<p>Surely this is not true. [Interjections.] This Government has a proud history of dedication by its officials and the other people dealing with this matter. It has over the years, and it shall persevere in this in future, had a proud history of dedication to those affairs of the Bantu in order to make life better and better for them in South Africa. However, this is not what the hon. member wants; nor is it what the Progressive Party is seeking to achieve when it holds talks with the Bantu. No, what they want&#x2014;the hon. member for Umhlatuzana was quite correct&#x2014;is not improved circumstances, is not a say on their own level and over their own affairs for the Black people, but is surrender to those people of what belongs to the White man. [Interjections.] I am not talking behind the backs of the Black people; I have always spoken openly to them. As I am now talking to you, so I also speak to them. They know they can rely on me to do whatever is necessary and within my power, but they also know&#x2014;in fact, this is what I told them&#x2014;that I am not prepared to surrender the identity of the Whites and what belongs to them in the process.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I say that considering the circumstances, the conditions in which we find ourselves, one must conclude that the relations between White, Coloured, Indian and Black are good. What is more, I make bold to say that the relations between Afrikaans and English-speaking persons have never been better under any party than they are at the moment under this Government. [Interjections.] I think that no one outside this House will deny the truth of this statement. Talk to the man in the street and you will find that, as far as he is concerned, it is in fact so. Compare the grass-root relations between Afrikaner and English-speaker today with those in the days of the United Party: There is no comparison whatsoever, and for very obvious reasons. But I do not want to dwell on that today. We shall have another occasion to debate this and I personally would be very pleased to have an opportunity to debate that in full. If there are hon. members who want to debate it with me, then I say now that I would appreciate an extensive debate on this issue when my Vote comes up for discussion.</p>

<p>Here again it is not necessary for me to blow my own trumpet or that of my party in this regard. Because these are facts, I need only refer hon. members to the poll conducted by <i>The Star</i> and <i>The Argus</i> last year. I do not want to go into details; all hon. members have read the results of that poll. Again I say that one cannot divorce the leader of a party from the party and its principles. In the 1974 election, unlike the 1970 election, this party gained a substantial English-speaking vote. Therefore I say without hesitation that grass-root relations between Afrikaners and English speakers are good. I have dedicated myself to improving them and I and my colleagues will at all times continue to do so. I am not saying for one moment that apart from the substantial English-speaking vote that we got in the 1974 election all English-speakers will vote for us. Naturally not. There will always be those who vote against us. Quite naturally I hope that they will vote for me. I shall certainly do my <span class="col_355-356" refersTo="page_0194"/>level best by word and deed to persuade them to vote for me.</p>

<p>It is for that reason that my party has decided to put up a candidate in an otherwise impossible seat, the seat of Durban North. We will fight that election.</p>

<p>To satisfy the curiosity of my hon. friend on the opposite side, the candidate who will bear the standard of the National Party will be the hon. Senator Denis Worrall. [Interjections.] Let me say that I find him an eminently suitable candidate, a man in whom I have the fullest confidence, and I take this opportunity to recommend him to the constituents of Durban North. As far as I am concerned he has my best wishes &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know that. I have been in politics too long to deny that he will need them. I do not for one moment say that he will win, but I maintain that he will fare better than my hon. friend in Middelburg &#x2026; [Interjections]&#x2026; and what is more certain, he will fare better than my hon. friend did in Bryanston.</p>

<p>To conclude this part of my speech, let me say that no matter what anybody says, the fact remains&#x2014;nobody can dispute it&#x2014;that our people are growing together in this country, and hon. members on the other side know it. Our people are more and more finding a common basis on which to stand, and they will find it; they must find it.</p>

<p>*I come now to the Angolan situation. I have seen fit, in respect of this matter, to get away from the stereotyped amendment which one moves in this regard. Because I am in earnest about this matter, because it is the case for South Africa, I want to say to the hon. members: Let us stop this nonsense of arguing in this House about who trusts whom. Surely we know what the position is. Let us pass a motion which will let South Africa speak and which will speak for South Africa. For that reason I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>&#x201C;(1) this House expresses its grave concern at the Communist aggression committed in Angola by Russia and Cuba with a view to imposing a Marxist state on the unwilling inhabitants by force of arms;</li>

<li>(2) it is obvious to this House that it is a further object of the aggression similarly to subject other territories and states, <i>inter alia</i> South West Africa and South Africa;</li>

<li>(3) this House takes note of the steps already taken to halt the aggression;</li>

<li>(4) this House directs the Government, in view of these objects and threats, to take all reasonable steps to foil this aggression and to safeguard our country as well as the territories and borders for which we are responsible; and</li>

<li>(5) this House in conclusion conveys its sincere thanks and appreciation to the Defence Force and all officers and men for the courageous and heroic manner in which they have acquitted themselves of their task in the operational area and expresses its deep sympathy with those who have lost loved ones in the struggle.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>I do not think there is any member in this House who will not be able to support this amendment. I am giving notice of my amendment in good time so that hon. members may consider it, and cast a considered vote.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the actual Angolan situation itself I believe it is necessary to pause for a moment to consider the total strategy of the communists. There is no doubt at all that the strategy of the communists is world domination, and that this will continue to remain their strategy. They can achieve world domination in three ways. They can achieve it firstly by infiltration and subversion, by propaganda and terrorism. Consequently they give preference to these methods at all times. They also know more about these methods than any person in any Western country can ever know or will ever know, for they excel in the softening up and subversion not only of the country itself but also of the morale and the values in which the free world believes, and in <span class="col_357-358" refersTo="page_0195"/>the exploitation of grievances. History has proved this throughout the world. When it comes to terrorism and murder there is no one who can hold a candle to them. If this does not succeed the second alternative is conventional warfare in all its nakedness and reality. The third alternative is nuclear warfare.</p>

<p>Although they are experts in the first sphere, namely that of infiltration and subversion, I am apprehensive, as far as the second and third alternatives are concerned, when I look around me at the world that the Russians have succeeded with their propaganda in causing the free world to be obsessed with the prospect of a nuclear war while they, on the other hand, are applying themselves to conventional warfare. They are causing the world to be obsessed with nuclear weapons while they know&#x2014;I firmly believe this&#x2014;that the next war will not be a nuclear war, just as the last war was not a poison gas and germ war. The nations recoiled from this, and I think that all the great powers, Russia included, will recoil from a nuclear war. They are causing the world to be obsessed with this, and in the meantime they are preparing themselves thoroughly in the sphere of conventional war. When it comes to warships, tanks and other heavy weapons, they are definitely leaving the West far behind in the race to produce such conventional weapons. In my opinion this is the danger in store for the Western world. It is good for a country to prepare itself for a nuclear war. It is good that the countries which have the means are prepared for it, but if the West should make the mistake of dismantling its conventional war machinery, it would be ploughed under by the communists in the years which lie ahead for us.</p>

<p>As far as South Africa is concerned it is, as a result of its strategic situation and its industrial and mineral potential, a key factor in the conventional war which Russia is planning. Surely it is self-evident that that country which controls South Africa has a powerful advantage over other countries in a conventional war, namely the resources, the sea route and everything that goes with it. If one reflects for a moment and begins to fit the pieces in the puzzle together, it is very clear to one that the communist strategy for South Africa is to cause South Africa to fight simultaneously or as much as possible on three fronts, namely on the Mozambique, Rhodesian and Angolan front. In addition to that they have relied and are still relying on the fourth front, namely the defeatists and the &#x201C;joiners&#x201D; within South Africa itself. One is grateful that, owing to level-headed action, nothing came of the planning on the Mozambique front. I shall return to this matter again when I reply to what hon. members said. The communists expected us to interfere in Mozambique, and they were disappointed when we did not interfere. I am not saying this merely for the sake of talking about this matter, or on the basis of hearsay: I have had personal experience, from talks I held in Africa, that this was indeed what was thought.</p>

<p>Thanks to our African initiative&#x2014;I am still grateful that I said what I did in the Senate on 23 October&#x2014;we were able to prevent an escalation on the Rhodesian front. You can imagine this for yourself. And the people who speak so easily of war&#x2014;just think here of Albert Hertzog and his people &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member for Sea Point spoke&#x2014;not on this issue, but on the Angolan issue&#x2014;I asked myself at times whether it was Colin Marais speaking, or Jaap Eglin. This is just by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if we had been compelled to fight on three fronts you could imagine&#x2014;and this is just what Albert Hertzog would have liked, and what he and his people are now reproaching us for&#x2014;what this would have meant? It would have meant total mobilization; it would have meant the large-scale conversion of factories to the manufacture of armaments; it would have meant a tremendous increase in the defence budget and the disruption and halting of the country&#x2019;s economy.</p>

<p>The Government was mindful of all these things. We did not flee our destiny. I want to state here&#x2014;if people were perhaps to think that we are afraid or that we do not see our way clear to doing so&#x2014;that we shall fight on three fronts if it should become necessary, that we shall have to fight on three fronts if there is no alternative. I believe, moreover, that we shall be able to repulse any such attack, and if it is forced upon us, this is what we shall do. I have confidence in our people; I have confidence in our ability to defend ourselves, and I have confidence in the strength of our economy. It goes without saying that the damage to the economy will be great and that the mortality will similarly be high, but I feel instinctively&#x2014;every time I speak to our people <span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0196"/>about this matter&#x2014;that our people are prepared to defend the soil of South Africa at all costs. For that I am very grateful.</p>

<p>Since I am now going to deal with the Angolan matter I want to tell you in this regard that I have full confidence in my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Defence, and in his handling of this matter. I was with him all the way in this matter. I also have confidence in the leaders of the Defence Force, in the officers and the men of the Permanent Force and the Citizen Force; I have confidence in the young men who are receiving training, and I have confidence in the young people of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am not speaking now as a person who has not yet had any experience of these matters. My own son was 18 years old when he had to patrol the Zambesi border with a machine gun for months on end. I heard very little from him because there was no communication with him. I received no report from him other than his letters. I never made inquiries about him or abused my position in that regard. He had to endure it as all the other men did. I know how this pulls at one&#x2019;s heartstrings. I know what feelings arose in me when he walked in unexpectedly at the door one fine evening. So I know what it means. One is not indifferent to these things, but thank God, our children&#x2014;and I am saying this with all the conviction at my command&#x2014;are tougher than we think, they are more mature than we think, and they are more courageous than we think.</p>

<p>Sir, before I proceed to deal with the Angolan situation itself it is worthwhile asking oneself&#x2014;for we must see it against that background&#x2014;where we now stand with Africa, after everything that has happened. That question was asked repeatedly in this debate, and outside this House as well. In earlier years it was simply the case that Africa, just because it was South Africa, took up a position against, and voted against South Africa without inquiring into and apart from the merits of the question. As far as South Africa was concerned, there was simply no place for it. It was not of Africa; it was an intruder, a colonialist; it was an exploiter that had to be expelled from this part of the world. That situation has changed; that situation has changed noticeably during the past 18 months. We have come a long way in that time; further, in fact, that I ever expected we would have come in such a short time. Naturally one cannot, if one knows what troubled waters have passed under the bridge, expect matters to change overnight. If one knows how people have committed themselves, what standpoints they have adopted and what decisions they have taken, one can understand that matters must proceed slowly. Africa was indeed closed to us. And now? The fact of the matter is that we are paying visits and receiving visitors on a very reasonable scale. In spite of the fact that African states decided at Dar-es-Salaam in April last year that there should be no talks with South Africa and that South Africa should not be received, we are receiving one another and we are exchanging visits with one another on all levels. Our aircraft may land in certain African states, and have in fact done so. Our people may hold meetings in certain African states, and have in fact done so. We have open lines of communication with many African countries. Trade between African states and our country is becoming more and more of a reality. Our technical assistance is being requested and given. We are exchanging missions and representatives on an official and non-official level, admittedly on a non-official level more often than on an official level, but that does not matter. The fact is, Sir, as I have stated on a previous occasion, that the trend of the graph is an upward one. I am aware that there will be hon. members who will laugh cynically at this, who will ridicule this, and who will dismiss it as being of little or no significance. They would be making a mistake if they did so. In particular they would be making a mistake if they dismissed it because they were afraid to give the Government any credit for it. Unfortunately it is true that there are people&#x2014;and some of them are sitting in this House&#x2014;who cannot distinguish between South Africa and the Government, and who think that, if one deals South Africa a blow, one is harming the Government. A demonstration of this was the sardonic smile on the face of the hon. member for Hillbrow, among others, when my hon. colleagues were discussing the economy.</p>

<p>One should be realistic and not consider only the progress which has been made with Africa in the sphere of relations. One should also be level-headed and realistic and consider where Africa differs with us. Africa differs with us on South West Africa. It differs sharply with us, but I can assure hon. members that it differs less sharply with us now than 18 <span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0197"/>months ago. Why does Africa differ with us? It differs with us because it is committed to recognizing Swapo as the only organization which represents South West Africa, and to recognizing Sam Nujoma as the only leader to whom South West Africa can be handed over. This is again becoming evident now, and I want to reaffirm emphatically here today that one cannot draw a distinction between Swapo within and Swapo outside South West Africa. The hon. member for Yeoville made a good and a moderate speech, on which I want to congratulate him, with the exception of what he said about Swapo. I do not think the hon. member knows the circumstances, for then he would not have said what he did. The one faction of Swapo poses as being moderate because it is inside South West Africa. But have you ever heard it once it is outside South West Africa? One cannot draw a distinction, for as an organization Swapo in its entirety was conceived and born in communist sin here in Cape Town in 1957 when it was established by two Whites, Messrs. Simons and Turok.</p>

<p>The one organization is in fact a myth. Zanu and Zapu have never amalgamated. They have merely acquired an umbrella organization. They differed with one another from the first day. There have been rifts within Zapu and Zanu. I want to go further and say that in this connection I cannot care less about what is happening in other countries. I have no reason to believe that Nkomo is a communist. There is nothing in Nkomo&#x2019;s early history which proves that he was a communist. But I am telling you that Sam Nujoma is a communist, and that Swapo was established by White communists in Cape Town in the late &#x2019;fifties under the original name of the Owambo People&#x2019;s Organization. Unfortunately, owing to the U.N. decision, Africa has over the years accepted Swapo and Nujoma. We have argued about this a great deal, and we shall argue about this a great deal more. However, I am not prepared, as far as this matter is concerned, to change my standpoint in any respect. Africa rejects our homeland policy. They see South Africa&#x2014;and they say that they are forced to see it in this way for many understandable reasons&#x2014;as a unitary state, and they desire &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; for Blacks and Whites in the whole of South Africa. They reject the policy of the Progrefs; they do not accept it, unless the policy of that party is a camouflaged policy which will lead to &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. If only they would tell us what their policy is we would be able to pass judgment on it. The fact of the matter is, and hon. members must know this and face up to it, that there are good African states that do not believe that the leaders of the Black people in South Africa are Matanzima, Mangope, Buthelezi, Phatudi and others. They believe that the only two leaders of the Black people in South Africa are Mandela and Sobukwe. One will first have to clear up and argue out the matter with them. Take the present problem I am experiencing with President Tolbert of Liberia. He addressed a request to me to allow Sobukwe to visit him as his guest of honour at his swearing in as President for the next term. I was unable to do so, for Sobukwe is not the leader of the Black people in South Africa.</p>

<p>Let me say at once, since the hon. member has made an interjection, that I know who made the recommendation that Sobukwe should attend. [Interjections.] I was unable to let Sobukwe go, owing to the things he had been guilty of. I need not go into that. It would have been a slap in the fact to the actual, the elected and natural leaders of the Black people in South Africa if I had done so. The strategy was&#x2014;and I am not accusing President Tolbert of this, but the people behind it&#x2014;that I was to have been accused at a later stage of having rejected the Black leaders of South Africa and having elevated Sobukwe to the position of the actual leader of the Black people in South Africa. I am not that stupid. Unfortunately they have committed themselves in respect of Sobukwe, and they have committed themselves in respect of Mandela. One need only read their documents, for unfortunately it is a fact that not only the world at large, but Africa as well is being fed with false propaganda, <span class="col_363-364" refersTo="page_0198"/>which emanates from South Africa. Let me give you an example. I make no apology for quoting you an example, for&#x2014;and I have read widely on this subject&#x2014;I have never seen a more effective exposition of South Africa&#x2019;s position than the one I read in the Natal <i>Daily News</i> of 25 September. This was a report from Ken Owen. He is known to us all. He is not a friend of this Government, and I very often doubt whether he is a friend of South Africa. This is what he wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is the most readily available cause for a liberal American with time on his hands and an unwillingness to examine the conditions of his own society. Powerful vested interests are at work, there are people who have made careers out of fighting apartheid from a distance, there are lawyers living entirely on foundation grants, academics whose reputations absolutely require a bloodbath in South Africa, churchmen who have made a profession of their indignation. To these vested interests, the prospect of a peaceful and evolutionary solution to South African race problems represents a dire threat.</block>

<p>Then he concludes, and this causes misgivings in all of us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then there are elements in South African politics who have long nurtured alliances with overseas liberaly, have fed them information and shaped their opinions. To them any mitigation of foreign hostility represents a victory for the Nationalist Party.</block>

<p>That is what Mr. Ken Owen had to say. If you would just consider the Dar-es-Salaam declaration of last year, you would see that it contained certain specific words. The facts are false. They wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Between 30% and 40% of the African children do not go to school at all. When they do, their education by law has to be carried on through the medium of the tribal language. Even the few Africans who get to universities, are taught at least partly in the tribal language. Both the curriculum and the syllabus have been deliberately designed by the Government to fit the children only for unskilled occupations.</block>

<p>I discuss this matter with leaders in Africa, for we have discussed it on various occasions, and they ask me: &#x201C;But why do your own people say this, that and the other?&#x201D; The hon. the Deputy Minister has dealt with the speech made by the hon. member for Pinelands. They are going to cast his speech in my teeth, because it agrees in certain respects with the Dar-es-Salaam declaration, and it is not true.</p>

<p>This is what they say, while there are 9 062 Black people in South Africa who are at present studying at universities and while, of the 28% of the total Bantu population that is of school-going age, 21% is already attending school. This is an achievement which does not exist in other African countries, an achievement which is unique to Black people in South Africa alone. But we receive no credit for this. All we receive are reproaches of this kind. In respect of all these matters, we find this kind of wild talk, but it is a different matter when one is confronted with the facts. Take the main source of revenue of the Progressive Party, Mr. Harry Oppenheimer. When he is confronted with the facts on Black trade unions, this is what he has to say, according to an edition of <i>Optima</i> published towards the end of 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An important point to be kept in mind is that the Black worker will need the goodwill of the White worker. We must, therefore, in consultation with the established White trade unions, make sure that the organization of the Blacks will not be carried through at the expense of the security or established standards of the Whites.</block>

<p>When we do this, we are condemned and arraigned by the outside world, but when the businessman, Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, is confronted with the reality, he writes as he did in <i>Optima</i> and states his point in this manner.</p>

<p>I come now to the essence of the Angolan matter, and I want to say at once that hon. members will understand that it is an exceptionally delicate matter. Even on this occasion <span class="col_365-366" refersTo="page_0199"/>there are things which I simply dare not say. South Africa&#x2019;s involvement was not an isolated involvement; others were also involved. I am not going to mention their names. It is not for me to do so. Everyone must speak for himself on this matter. I am only prepared to say what I said at Stellenbosch, i.e. that I am prepared to stand up and be counted in regard to this matter. It goes without saying that, on the question of their involvement, those people should come forward themselves.</p>

<p>Let us now approach the matter from a different point of view. Let us ask ourselves what would have happened if South Africa had not become involved. Then, firstly, the MPLA, with Russian and Cuban help, would have taken over the whole of Angola and would have subjugated the entire population. They would have had the harbours of Lobito, Mocamedes and other harbours at their disposal right at the outset. They would have had the Benguela railway line at their disposal. They would have created the impression in the outside world that the people of Angola wanted the MPLA and were well-disposed to the MPLA. Initially the MPLA did not disclose the presence of the Russians and the Cubans. They concealed their presence; they did not mention them, and the Russians and the Cubans did not announce their own presence there either. They tried to create the impression that it was the MPLA that was finding favour with the people of Angola and had the support of all the people in Angola. They did this although they controlled only one-third of the population and less than one-third of the territory. I maintain in all seriousness that South Africa&#x2019;s involvement exposed the Russian-Cuban involvement. Even if South Africa did nothing else, South Africa did do the free world a service in Africa by causing this to emerge very clearly. But what would have happened further? The OAU would have recognized the MPLA unanimously or with few dissenting votes at its conference, and South Africa would have been condemned in one morning at Addis Ababa. This did not happen.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Angola would at that juncture have been used as a base for attacks on South West Africa, but also for a possible attack on Zaire and a possible attack on Zambia. The communists are engaged in underground activities in both countries, and I am not being wise after the event now because President Kaunda declared a state of emergency. I can refer you to statements I made in December, and prior and subsequent to that, in which I warned that this was going to be the case. I saw it coming. And that was precisely what happened, and President Kaunda was compelled to take those steps. But he was not only compelled to take those steps. You have seen how the Soviet threatened him in public and said to him: You must be careful, certain things are going to happen to you&#x2014;so insolent has it become as a result of the lack of action against it from certain quarters. Tanzania, who recognized the MPLA, would have been forced to co-operate with the communists, and the final result would have been a communist belt from the Atlantic Ocean, from Luanda across to Dares-Salaam on the Indian Ocean. With that Africa would have been cut in two. But what is more, if we had not become involved, the defence of South West Africa would have been impeded, if not rendered impossible, by 30 000, 40 000 or more refugees which they would have driven before them into South West Africa. They would, as it were, have driven them in like a battalion of infantry to make it impossible for one to carry out a proper defence. And Swapo would have been among those refugees and among those invading troops. It is a well-known fact, Sir, that the members of Swapo carry three cards in their pockets. They carry an FNLA card in their pockets when it suits them, and they carry a Unita card in their pockets when that suits them, and if it is necessary, and that suits them, they pull out an Ovambo tribal card. One is therefore dealing with three-faced persons. Last year already&#x2014;and I am not saying this in a spirit of reproach; I am saying this simply because I owe it to Parliament&#x2014;I considered it my duty to bring this situation very strongly to the attention of the countries that should have known this, both in Africa and in the free world. I have a clear conscience in this regard, i.e. that we did everything in our power to bring this situation and its consequences to the attention of those who should have known about it. I am not going to bandy names across the floor of this House. Nor am I going to level reproaches. To do so would be of no avail to us at this stage. But I do want this House to know that I went out of my way to settle this matter. In the process I informed the hon. the Leader of the Opposition from time to time of what was happening, and I <span class="col_367-368" refersTo="page_0200"/>gave very serious consideration to informing the leader of the Progressive Party as well.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>A time will come when I shall tell you. To mention only one thing now: The hon. member heard the hon. member for Durban Point. Did the young hon. member at the back hear when they asked him about his standpoint on the Communist Party in South Africa while he was speaking? He did not reply to them. Both of them put the questions to him. He did not reply to them. [Interjections.] My question is why not? And if the hon. member subsequently wants to take this up with me, he is at liberty to do so. I shall gladly have a word with him in this connection. [Interjections.] In addition there is the fact that the communists are straddling the Cape sea route, and it is not only South Africa that says this. Military experts all over the world say it. The Belgian Prime Minister told us only this morning.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, when reproaches are made about Angola, I think it can best be discussed by reference to a leader in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 20 January 1976. In that leader the editor of <i>The Cape Times</i> put four questions to me: (1) Is South Africa fighting in the Angolan civil war?; (2) If so, why have we departed from our policy of non-intervention in the affairs of our neighbours; (3) Why was the public not kept informed, and (4) What is the extent of our present commitment and what will it be in the future? These questions more or less deal with the whole Angolan situation, also the questions that were put to members on this side of the House. When the question is put to me whether South Africa is fighting in the Angolan civil war, I say that South Africa was never a party in this civil war. South Africa did not become involved in Angola because it wanted to take part in the civil war. There must be absolute clarity about that. What is more, it must be at all times understood, because that is the situation, and hon. members know that that is so, that our involvement in Angola was not the cause of Russian and Cuban intervention. Our involvement was the effect of Russian and Cuban intervention. If they did not enter Angola, if they did not take part in this affair, if they did not try to subvert the whole of Angola and to suppress its people, South Africa would never have entered Angola at all. We were not involved in the civil war. We had nothing to do with it whatsoever; it was not our affair. I therefore say that we were not a party to the civil war. My hon. colleague explained that. He went further and said that our objectives were limited and that we achieved our ends. That is so. If hon. members ask me what our objectives were, then I say: Firstly, to chase the MPLA and the Cubans away from the borders for which we were responsible, to chase them away from the dam, because we did not go there in the first instance to occupy the dam. You will remember that my colleague explained that we went there to investigate the situation and were fired upon. That was the first time we ever went into Angola. We went in to chase Cuba and the MPLA away from the dam.</p>

Sir, we chased them away from the borders for which we were responsible. My hon. colleague over here told you about the build-up of arms on the borders of South West Africa and for what purpose. And then, secondly, and I want to be <span class="col_369-370" refersTo="page_0201"/>very candid about this, it is rather difficult, Sir, when you chase a man away to decide when to stop. That, candidly, is a difficulty. Naturally it must be left to the people who are responsible for doing the job to decide how far you are going to chase away the man, knowing that if you chase him away a short distance he may come back. I make no bones about the fact that we chased him a very long way, and I take full responsibility for that. [Interjections.] Secondly, let us look at what happened next. Again I am only talking about my involvement and my Government&#x2019;s involvement, and not about the involvement of other countries of the free world. We became involved to prevent the MPLA and the Cubans from harassing the people in the traditionally Unita and FNLA areas, harassment to such an extent that they had to flee to Owambo and South West Africa in their tens of thousands. I make no apology for having done that either. Thirdly, we became involved in order to bring to the notice of the free world and of Africa the fact that an unwilling people was being driven into the communist fold at the point of a bayonet, or otherwise was being shot to pieces. We did exactly that. Because we did that, there are those who turn round and say, firstly, that we should not have done it. If I understood the hon. member for Yeoville correctly, he is with me on this point, that there are some who do not hold it against us that we did it. There are those, however, who immediately turn round and say: &#x201C;Why did you throw overboard your policy of non-intervention? You acted in a certain way in Mozambique but took an opposite course of action in the case of Angola.&#x201D; However, one cannot equate the two. They are absolutely and totally different. I was accused, first of all by Dr. Albert Hertzog, closely followed by the hon. member for Sea Point, though he managed to beat the hon. member for Sea Point by a short head, or a short beard.</p>

<p>Let us now look at the arguments of hon. members on the other side. This was thrown at my head also by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, and he was applauded by the hon. member for Rondebosch. In fact, they appeared on the same page of <i>The Cape Times</i>&#x2014;Karperde! The hon. member for Rondebosch applauded him for the stand he took, unlike the stand taken by the hon. member for Durban Point and the hon. Leader of the Opposition. He congratulated the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. No wonder! They are birds of a feather. I do not often give advice to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. However, I think it is appropriate that I do give him advice on this occasion. Let me say to him, in the popular turn of phrase: Why do you not take your seat where your mouth is?

<p>Let me first of all deal with the hon. member for Rondebosch. Out of the mouth of the babe we heard the truth. The great cry was that they wanted information and that this &#x201C;cruel&#x201D; Government withheld it from them. What did the hon. member for Rondebosch say after he was informed by my hon. colleague here? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek is nie eintlik vreeslik bekommerd om nog meer inligting oor Angola te h&#x00EA; nie. Ek is tevrede dat daar inligting gegee is dat ons wel betrokke was. Die agb.

<p>*What does he want to do with that? Use it against South Africa? Why does he say that he is not interested in the other things? He only wanted this one piece of information, as it suited his purpose. He only wanted to be able to say: South Africa was involved; the Minister said so himself. Surely that is not something which we previously concealed. I shall come to this again when I deal with the remark made by the hon. member for Sea Point.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said more about this matter outside than he did inside this House, for it is easier to say things outside this House. After all, there is no one who can call you to order.</p>

<block name="quote">Speaking at a public meeting at Middelburg, Transvaal, on Monday night, Mr. Basson said the two main pillars of the country&#x2019;s foreign policy&#x2014;non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries and the undertaking that South West Africa would not be used as a basis for military action across the border&#x2014;had been thrown overboard by South Africa&#x2019;s involvement.</block>

<p>He went, and you went with him! I hope that my genial friend on the other side has thanked the hon. member for Rondebosch appropriately for taking him along.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Bezuidenhout put a question to me in this debate about the difference between the allegation that they wish to liberate South West Africa from Angola, and the statement made by Frelimo against South Africa this week in Louren&#x00E7;o Marques. My reply is that there is a tremendous difference between Mozambique and Angola. Mozambique was handed over to one Government. It made no difference whether or not one like that Government. South Africa&#x2019;s foreign policy is still that if there is a Government which it does not like, it does not make war against it. As long as that Government leaves South Africa in peace, South Africa will leave that Government in peace. Surely we made it very clear that we were not seeking a quarrel with Mozambique, that we were not interested in who comprised that Government, just as long as there was a stable Government and that country was not used as a base for an attack on South Africa.</p>

<p>It does not stop at talk only; after all, I want to explain this now. On the one hand it is a matter of talking, and on the other hand a matter of doing. There was no build-up of an arsenal of weapons on the border between Mozambique and South Africa. What is more&#x2014;the hon. member probably does not know this&#x2014;we fenced off the border between South Africa and Mozambique at a time when one would have expected feelings to be at their highest pitch. I was on that border myself; we were on the one side and Frelimo on the other. We recruited labour among them, and we fenced off that border which we had not been able to fence off in the time of the Portuguese, without there even being an argument about where the border ran.</p>

<p>Surely no attack was planned on South Africa, and if an attack on South Africa is planned and executed, we shall repel it. I told Mozambique this at the time. In the case of Angola forces were built up on our border. After all, there are no Swapo activities in Mozambique. In the case of Angola refuge was granted to members of <span class="col_373-374" refersTo="page_0203"/>Swapo, and those members were allowed to enter South West Africa to commit murder there. What is more, they occupied the dam and fired on our people. We did not intervene; we acted in self-defence, and we shall at all times continue to do so.</p>

<p>But surely that is what I am doing now. I am not talking to you. You must not be so conceited as to think that I am talking only to you; I am talking to hon. members in the House. I come to the hon. member for Sea Point in this connection.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This is what the hon. member said to me (Hansard, 1976, col. 101.)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And in this case all the evidence is that the Government has both wilfully and secretively gone outside of the clear mandate of non-intervention, the clear mandate of non-intervention in the affairs of other countries in the instance of Angola. The Government has repeatedly stated that South Africa&#x2019;s involvement has been limited to the protection of the waterworks at Calueque and of the hydro-electric scheme at Ruacana. In addition it says that it has been protecting the borders for which we have accepted responsibility. This has necessitated the involvement of South African forces in occasional hot pursuit of terrorist groups who have violated or threatened to violate the border. And there has been a general assertion, often used by the hon. the Prime Minister, that our cause is the cause of the free world.</block>

<p>Why did the hon. member lay words in my mouth which I never used? I never spoke about &#x201C;the cause&#x201D;, nor did I say that our cause is the cause of the free world. I used the word &#x201C;involvement&#x201D; and &#x201C;involvement&#x201D; is a totally different word from the word &#x201C;cause&#x201D;. I never disputed or denied that South Africa was involved. It is true that we did not give more information. We did not give more information because the matter was delicate and because we were not alone in our involvement in this. It worried me as it worried everybody else. However, we did not leave it at that; we explained it to the media as best we possibly could. I did so personally. I interviewed how many editors and how many journalists and explained it to them at length and my hon. colleague, the Minister of Defence, went out of his way to explain to all the editors of the newspapers what the circumstances were. It was impossible for us to go beyond the word &#x201C;involvement&#x201D; in this matter because too much was at stake. I accept full responsibility for that. Whilst I am on this point, let me say something in respect of which I am sure all hon. members who take it seriously will agree with me: America lost the war in Vietnam because <i>inter alia</i> the Press was too much involved with that war. [Interjections.] I am glad that I get a &#x201C;hear hear&#x201D; from the other side because that is so. One does not fight a war in order to supply news to newspapers. War is a serious matter. War is a matter of life and death and very often the wrong word at the wrong time in a newspaper can cause the death of people. It can also upset your strategy. It can make all your plans go wrong. It can undermine the morale inside and outside your country. We did not snub the newspapers. Why should we want to snub the newspapers? We want their co-operation and that is why we went out of our way to explain to them.</p>

<p>We did not depart from our policy. I want to repeat that if in the case of Angola there had been one Government to which the Portuguese had handed over, then as far as South Africa was concerned that would have been the end of the matter unless they had attacked us either through South West Africa or otherwise. My time is running out but I may say that there are other arguments which I can use to show that you cannot equate the two.</p>

<p>There was also a third question asked: Why was the public not kept informed? In answer to that I say that the public was informed. There was also the question: What is the extent of our present commitment and what will it be in future? I say that our present commitment is as it always has been, namely the protection of our country and the borders for which we are responsible. In the case of Angola it also refers to the Kunene scheme and whatever goes with it. We are committed and we will at all times defend our legitimate interests and those of the Ovambo people.</p>

<p>For a reason I would not know, the hon. member for Sea Point asked about the article which Mr. Schulzberger wrote. I have not seen that article, but it is perfectly clear what <span class="col_375-376" refersTo="page_0204"/>happened. I more particularly discussed, as far as this question was concerned, the North. The FNLA forces were not far from Luanda at the time and the hon. member has surely read what Holden Roberto said, namely that he was out-gunned by the Russians and the Cubans, that the morale of his people was high and that they were a match for the MPLA soldiers, but that he could not fight the 120 mm rockets barehanded. Of course, I said to Mr. Schulzberger: South Africa does not have that sort of thing; so we cannot give it to them even if we wanted to. It is only the free world that can give it to them. I am sorry that the free world did not do so. I thought that, by saying that, I might have touched a spark somewhere and that these people would at least be given the tools required for the job they had to do.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This had nothing whatsoever to do with our preparedness. It had to do with a situation 1 500 or more miles away from us. It had to do with a place wherein we were not involved at all. I am sorry that I have to say that the free world alone could at that time have cut off the communist and Cuban supplies through Luanda. That was not done and the result was what we have seen it to be.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I have tried to argue and prove that we did not become involved because we wanted to be involved. South Africa has a record in this regard. We do not want to become involved, but we were involved because we had no alternative. I am grateful for the understanding shown by my friends, the hon. member for Durban Point, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and others, in this regard. They themselves said that they did not agree with everything we were doing, but I appreciate the spirit in which they discussed matters with us, even when they reproached us.</p>

<p>I referred at the outset to the communist objectives. Those objectives have always remained the same. We have learned a lesson in Angola, a lesson which we have already learned before, for I am on record as having said a long time ago in this House that, when it comes to the worst, South Africa stands alone. People will have to realize this. I think our people have realized this for a long time, for the instincts of a people whose survival is at stake, are never wrong. That is why our people are moving closer together, and that is why there is the intensification of feeling among our people which one sees in these days, and which we saw more than ever before on the day of humiliation. One observes it in one&#x2019;s correspondence, and one hears it in one&#x2019;s conversation with people. There are difficult days in store for us. It is going to be a difficult year, a year of endless problems. It is a watershed year. But I believe, as I stand here before you, that it is also a year of grace. It is a year of hope and a year of faith, because we have a task which we have to accomplish. Thank God our people are prepared to accomplish that task.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I intend following the fine example set by the hon. the Prime Minister by first discussing economic affairs and race relations before coming back to the important matter of Angola. In this way I want to remind this House of the fact that in one of the legs of my motion I accuse the Government, and consequently express no confidence in it, of not providing adequately, in the gravest circumstances which South Africa must be ready to meet, for the national security of the country in that it has failed to maintain economic growth and to combat inflation in particular, in a manner consistent with increasing defence and other demands on our resources. The hon. the Prime Minister replied to our criticism in this regard by saying that he was satisfied with the answers given by his Ministers, <i>inter alia,</i> that we had done right to devalue, and that he expressed his gratitude to all for the manner in which they had helped to combat inflation. He went on to speak with great confidence of an upward trend in the economy. One has really been waiting for many years for a realistic debate in this House on the financial and economic factors which influence our economy, but that hope is disappointed virtually every year. We do get answers, but these are answers which do not go to the root of the matter. It is clear that the Government is treating symptoms and not the disease itself. We always hear how clever the Government is, and when the Opposition expresses criticism, we are accused of a lack of patriotism, <span class="col_377-378" refersTo="page_0205"/>especially when the country is in danger, as it is at the present time. Fortunately that accusation does not put us off, but unfortunately, it affects both businessmen and the economy. Nobody can tell me that the spirit of enterprise and the initiative of our businessmen are still as enthusiastic today as they were in the years before Government ideology changed virtually every board-room, workshop and factory into a workshop for the removal of red tape before the day&#x2019;s work could be commenced. One asks oneself how much confidence an economy is able to inspire when 60% of the workers in the industry have no statutory training or qualifications. Patriotism is important, and it is important that one should discuss it, but it must be supported by arms and a strong economy.</p>

<p>This year the attack on the Government is based on inflation and devaluation. To my mind the answers we received from the Government were satisfactory on neither the one theme nor the other. Devaluation is but a temporary aid which can hardly cure the basic disease. I know speakers on the Government side quoted cost of living figures and dealt with the position of our current account which should be attributed to devaluation and the campaign against inflation. However, devaluation can only assist in the matter of our exports as long as our domestic price increases are not so substantial that we are no longer able to sell cheaply overseas. Sooner or later domestic price increases must be affected adversely by devaluation which causes imports to be higher than those of last year by 22% on average. As yet the full effect of the devaluation has not worked through to the whole economy. This means that we cannot boast of an inflation rate which dropped to 12% in December. What is also remarkable, is that whereas the costs of imports increased, the volume of imports decreased. If we wish to maintain the value of our imports in 1976 at the same level as that of the previous year, the volume of imports will have to decrease by 30%. In that case competition for the decreased volume will lead to still higher prices.</p>

<p>Since the largest part of our exports consists of capital goods, only one of two things can happen this year: Either we shall have to import, in which case production costs and prices will rise considerably, or we shall have to cut imports drastically, in which case the economy will develop more slowly, and will even deteriorate. Neither of these two possibilities create a favourable picture. The present inflation together with a slow growth rate is fatal to the maintenance of good race relations. Our economic and military efficiency is undermined drastically by both these factors.</p>

<p>Whatever the advantages or disadvantages of devaluation may be, devaluation on its own cannot solve our problems. If there is no change in the volume or in the prices of imports, all prices will be increased by devaluation and our domestic debt will rise considerably. The hon. the Minister of Finance became annoyed when we accused him of spending excessively and that the extravagance of the Government is one of the main causes of inflation. The fact remains that Government expenditures continued to rise over the years, and rose at an impossible rate during the past two or three years. During the financial year 1973-&#x2019;74 consumer expenditure rose by 23%, the year after by 24% and in the financial year 1975-&#x2019;76 by 19%. I quote from the <i>Hill Samuels Quarterly Economic and Market Appraisal</i> (page 4)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government certainly appears to be making an effort to set a good example by reducing its expenditure. This was absolutely essential, as during the first half of 1975 consumption expenditure by general government was 35% higher than during the same period in 1974. This item now amounts to 14,7% of gross domestic product, as compared with 12,6% in 1974.</block>

<p>Now the hon. the Minister relies upon the present campaign against inflation. Does he not realize that temporary success will undoubtedly be followed by the outburst of the pent-up expectations of both businessmen and wage earners in the country? Mr. Speaker, these are short term solutions. In the long run there is only one real solution, and that is increased productivity. This is what I stressed in my introductory speech. Nobody contradicted me and nobody on the Government side declared himself prepared to take the necessary steps to promote increased productivity.</p>

<p>I mentioned four essential steps. Now I am going to add the fifth step, i.e. the amendment of section 3 of the Planning Act. The Government is now using this legislation in <span class="col_379-380" refersTo="page_0206"/>some of our most important industrial areas to limit the number of Bantu labourers to what it was in 1968. Inspectors go around threatening employers with a fine of R10 per Bantu per day in respect of every Bantu labourer by whom the 1968 figure is exceeded. In other words, in practice it amounts to the prohibition of development and growth. In this way they are trying to bring pressure to bear upon industrialists to move out to the border areas, something which will definitely have an inflationary effect on the short term. They are being forced to the homelands, where, according to publications of the Government and of various investment corporations, it is clear that the expenditure regarding these industries rose by an average of 21,5% per year. As against this enormous increase, we nevertheless find that all the homelands put together contributed only 3% of the gross national production in 1975. In other words, this is indicative of an extremely shortsighted approach.</p>

<p>And what is the answer of the Government with regard to the other four steps I asked for? I am just going to repeat them: The abolition of job reservation; the inclusion of non-Whites in the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; in the Industrial Conciliation Act; compulsory education for all races; facilities for professional and technical training modelled on the economic requirements and not on race or colour, and acceptance of the fact that Blacks are permanently resident in White areas.</p>

<p>I cannot deal with all the answers. For that reason I confine myself to the question of job reservation. What is the Government&#x2019;s interpretation? What is its defence? According to what the hon. the Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions said yesterday, it only relates to 2,9% of the manpower. The hon. the Deputy Minister also said, &#x201C;it is being phased out&#x201D;. If this is true, it is not consistent with the policy of the former Minister of Labour. He was the one who said that it would be abolished over his dead body. Could this possibly be the reason why that hon. member was promoted to the Other Place?</p>

<p>Who are the people covered by this 2,9%, in any case? This excludes the mine workers and the Public Service, where a different methods of reservation is applied. For that reason it is, in practice, applicable to a much larger section of our labour force. The problem is that it covers the peak of the labour pyramid. Although it only applies temporarily to a negligible number of workers, it has a limiting effect upon the whole labour structure in South Africa.</p>

<p>There are other ways in which the progress of Blacks is being hampered. There is, for instance, the system in respect of apprentices. Admittedly, it is not prohibited under the Industrial Conciliation Act, but there are other regulations limiting Black apprentices to the homelands, where employment opportunities, of course, do not exist. This undoubtedly has a limiting effect as well and it dampens the enthusiasm of the employer to have his employees trained. He selects a man, trains him, spends money on his training and then finds that job reservation is applied and that he cannot use the man in the job for which he was trained. For this reason this figure of 2,9% means nothing whatsoever. It is in no way an indication of the effects of this measure, and it is no defence either.</p>

<p>After all, South Africa promised the U.N. that it will gradually abolish discrimination, but job reservation is undoubtedly colour discrimination in its most flagrant form. It cannot be justified and harms our name as well as our economy immeasurably. I think it is a foregone conclusion: No man with common sense, no person who is informed, can argue that this Government is taking sufficient steps to maintain the economic growth and to combat inflation in a manner consistent with the increase in defence and other demands made on our resources.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. the Minister of Finance may have pointed to some signs of economic improvement and of Government willingness to discipline itself better in the future. What we cannot forget is that this Government has repeatedly confronted itself with financial crisis after financial crisis in the whole of the last 28 years. Devaluation in any circumstances is only resorted to as a drastic step in the last resort. It has been taken by this Government four times in the last four years, twice in 1975 alone. In our opinion the villains of the piece have been successive Ministers of Finance who have been countenancing excessive expenditure and financing it in an inflationary manner.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the Government&#x2019;s race policy which builds an empire of ideological legislation within the State. Add to that a penchant for State interference in affairs that <span class="col_381-382" refersTo="page_0207"/>should be left to private enterprise and, inevitably, the tail must wag the dog. The Government must take the lion&#x2019;s share of the blame for increasing imports, for competing for labour and material in short supply and, above all, for setting a spendthrift example and setting the mood against personal sacrifice and self-discipline. But I think their greatest sin in the economic field has been in the sphere of labour where not one single member of the Cabinet, and especially the hon. the Minister of Labour, has recognized the urgency of relaxing racial barriers to further productivity. The cost in this respect to the country is incalculable and totally incomprehensible in any country, except one totally blinded by ideological motives. I have no hesitation in saying that in so far as my accusations against the Government&#x2019;s management of the economy and inflation are concerned, my case is proved and proved up to the hilt.</p>

<p>Secondly, I would like to deal with the Government&#x2019;s failure to improve race relations by making more rapid progress towards a system that will unite South Africans of all races in a common loyalty. The hon. the Prime Minister replied to that by saying that basically race relations were good. He spoke about the Coloureds and said that he had approved the dismissal of Mr. Leon. He admitted that meetings followed and that there was, as he said, incitement, and he said that he had his ear to the ground. He also said that he had consulted with them before the dismissal and that his door was open to them. He also said that he would not run away from confrontation and that part of the offer he had made would be implemented and that the other part would not because there had been a failure, as far as he was concerned, in respect of co-operation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister then went on to deal with the Bantu. He told us that the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to the Bantu had been a success. By way of proof he quoted the fact that Chief Mangope, whose territories are not consolidated, had asked for independence. Here was the ultimate proof that the criticism of the Opposition that you could not give independence to an unconsolidated territory or that the Bantu would not take it, was entirely unjustified. Fortuitously Chief Mangope spoke in Cape Town the night before last. In <i>The Argus</i> of 29 January he is reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Chief Mangope said that if the land consolidation question were to be finalized at the present stage, the people of Bophuthatswana would not consider independence.</block>

<block name="quote">One look at the map will suffice to convince any reasonable person that it is plainly incompatible with the emergence of a healthy national self-respect.</block>

<block name="quote">The Chief said the land issue was one of several questions on which the Republican Government still had to prove the sincerity of its policy.</block>

<p>It does not seem that the hon. the Prime Minister has proved anything. In fact, it seems to me that he has proved conclusively that the criticism I have levelled from this side of the House is soundly grounded.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that there has been consensus between the hon. the Prime Minister and Chief Mangope. It seems to me as if there is still complete disagreement.</p>

<p>Having listened to the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon, it is quite clear that South Africa is on the threshold of a war of survival on the African Continent. I think that the Government accepts that under those circumstances, race relations, the development of a common loyalty to South Africa, is one of the most urgent things with which we have to deal, but listening to the Ministers who have spoken in this debate and to the hon. the Prime Minister himself, it seems that what is lacking is that sense of urgency on the Government&#x2019;s side to get on with the job. They make all sorts of promises but there is very little to show. How long ago was it that our ambassador at the United Nations promised the gradual removal of discrimination on the grounds of race alone in South Africa? What has been done since then? It is when one asks questions of that kind, that this Government is unable to meet the charge that unless things change in South Africa there are going to be many people of the non-White races in South Africa who are going to be less afraid of communism than they are of the present deal they are getting in South Africa. That is becoming more and more evident in the studies of people who know about the non-White people.</p>

<p>Let us look at the situation with regard to the Coloureds. The hon. the Minister of Health has made out a case justifying the dismissal of Mr. Leon for failing to carry out his statutory duty. The hon. the Prime Minister says that he approves of that entirely. There may or there may not be a case, but the fact is that as far as the Coloured people are concerned, they feel that the hon. the Minister had no case and that Mr. Leon did the right thing. We have a new hon. Minister who has taken over the portfolio and he has given no indication whatsoever of what his plans are for the Coloureds in future. It looks as though he is merely proceeding with the same sterile ideas which must end in disaster. It seems to me that he is living in a state of euphoria as far as the relations between the Whites and the Coloureds are concerned, which is entirely unjustified by the facts. I should like to put one or two things to him: The moderate Coloured, such as the ex-serviceman, asked that war veterans&#x2019; pensions be placed on a 4:3:2 basis instead of a 4:2:1 basis, in other words, that they should get three-quarters of what the Whites were getting, instead of half. That request has been turned down. How do you think those people feel about it, Sir?</p>

<p>*I think there are many Whites in whom the remarks made by some of the Coloured leaders are causing a feeling of unease and disappointment. No concessions made by the Government are accepted; in fact, they are rejected. They prefer to speak of an alliance with the Blacks and they regard themselves as being the only real opposition in South Africa. Consequently our object must be to neutralize the lack of confidence and the despair in their own future on the part of the Coloured people, and to change these feelings into something which will inspire confidence. They think that the move away from discrimination, as they have experienced it up to now, means nothing to them. The position in which they find themselves is exploited by some of the leaders and their position does not improve. They are seeking nothing else today than full citizenship on an integrated basis, as I have already warned the Government. They are adopting a quite outrageous attitude and the hon. the Minister knows that what I am saying is true. They take no account of the group identities which have become the accepted practice over a period of generations. What has given rise to this situation? I think the question is whether these people should be given a breeding-ground in which even the moderate and realistic Coloured person is driven into the arms of the extremists. The reason is the fact that this Government has never clearly spelt out its policy in regard to the Coloured people.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman says it is nonsense. Allow me to read to him what one of his own Ministers, Dr. Connie Mulder, said a few months or weeks ago. In this statement Dr. Mulder said that the course which the Coloured people were to take had not been decided yet. He spoke of territorial separation and integration, and then he said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another alternative which is also honest and which can be defended on ethical grounds is for the Coloured people to be given full political authority in their present area. These are the courses which are open and concerning which a decision will be taken later.</block>

<p>This was said by Minister Mulder. In other words, the final course to be taken by the Coloured people is not known. This is what the hon. the Minister says. And, Sir, he is a member of the Cabinet. He spoke with the Prime Minister and presumably with the present Minister of Coloured Affairs. He does not know the destination of the Coloured people. The hon. gentleman believes that he can go on telling the people year after year that he has a policy, while he has no policy. Now it seems to me as if the hon. the Minister is hiding behind the Theron Commission. We do not know when the report will be published and what its recommendations will be. We know what became of the Tomlinson report. We awaited that report for years and when it was published, the Government rejected almost all the most important recommendations. What is going to happen to the Theron Commission? It is not up to a commission to take the lead; it is the responsibility of the Government to take the lead concerning this matter.</p>

<p>I listened very carefully and I read the Hansard as well, and I am even more confused than before.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, Sir, we are faced with a new situation in South Africa. The whole scene has changed in the past few months. We are going to have communist States on our northern borders and it is vitally essential for the security of this country that we have plans which will consolidate the whole population. Not only must they be politically, economically and socially in a better position than the inhabitants of the territories to the north, but they must be seen to be in a better position than the inhabitants of those territories. The one thing on which we will have to work is to see that they understand that situation. What have we got so far? We have been told by the Nationalist Party that there are only two roads open as far as colour policy is concerned. The one is the road that leads to apartheid, and the other the road that leads to integration. As far as the Coloureds are concerned, apartheid has manifestly failed. Are they going to lead us in the direction of integration, or are they at last going to accept the fact that there is a third road, namely federalism, in which they can realize the aspirations of the Coloured people?</p>

<p>That is unsaleable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says it is unsaleable. Let me tell him that his apartheid policy is completely unsaleable to the Coloured people. What is more, this does not only apply to the Coloured people; it applies to the Indians as well. It applies to the urban Bantu as well. It is a far more important problem than just the Coloureds. It is probably the problem in South Africa, and in this debate there has been no attempt to deal with it at all. What is needed is a new philosophical framework to cater for the situation as it is at the moment, and it is perfectly clear that this Government is completely incapable of producing it. Sir, in the field of race relations, I feel that I have every justification for my accusations against the Government.</p>

<p>I now come to the position in respect of Angola. May I say here that it seemed to me for a considerable part of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s discourse on this matter that we were talking past each other. It seemed to me that the hon. gentleman had not appreciated the charges that were levelled against him, nor did he make any real attempt to meet them. My charges against him were that he had failed to take the public into his confidence and to motivate it adequately in regard to the Government&#x2019;s <span class="col_387-388" refersTo="page_0210"/>actions and objectives in Angola. I chose my words with care because I believed that the safety of troops and the lack of desire to help those who wanted to damage us were two very big considerations. Even having regard to those issues, I think it is perfectly clear already that a great deal more should have been made available to the public. This week&#x2019;s debate has resulted in the public being very much better informed and motivated than they were when this debate started on Monday. That, to a great extent, proves my case, but I believe the public are not satisfied yet. Until the hon. the Prime Minister spoke today, I believe they felt that our troops had been used as pawns in a game of political and diplomatic power. I think that is the feeling they had. They felt that we had become involved in what you may call a large armed raid, if you like, which could easily have deteriorated into a full-scale war in which Russia herself would have played a part. They have been told that those troops must now be withdrawn and they do not understand why. They do not know what the troops have achieved and where we go from here. I believe the public wants answers to four questions: They want to know why we went in, they want to know what we achieved, they want to know why we withdrew, and they want to know where we go from here. I will not say that there have been no attempts to answer those questions. There have been attempts and I want to examine them. As to the question of why we went in, I conceded in my opening speech that there could be military justification, but I asked for the political justification, in view of the political and diplomatic dangers involved. What have we had so far? The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is mos vanselfsprekend dat as &#x2019;n oorlog &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is, with foreign troops and advisers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; nie &#x2019;n gewone oorlog is nie en so &#x2019;n oorlog &#x2019;n ernstige bedreiging inhou vir daardie betrokke land se buurstate, niemand so &#x2019;n buurstaat kan beskuldig van inmenging of aggressie as hy stappe doen om daardie bedreiging af te weer nie. Ons moet ook nie vergeet nie dat die Russe en Kubane openlik &#x2019;n lank tyd al geweldpleging teen Suid-Afrika voorstaan en dit bepleit.</block>

<p>In other words, what the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs was telling us was in effect that this was a pre-emptive strike. There has been no admission of that even from the hon. the Prime Minister. We have the fact that there was a build-up and that when we visited the works at Ruacana we were fired upon. We took the works and we then found that there was a build-up outside. We then chased people away. That is why we went in. In chasing people away, whom were we chasing? Were we chasing just the MPLA? Were we chasing just Cubans? Whom did we fight? The public of South Africa would like to know why we went in. The hon. the Prime Minister very delicately this afternoon tried to answer the question of what would have happened if we did not go in. Very well, what would have happened if we did not go in? First of all, the hon. gentleman said that we did not go in alone, that others were involved and that they must speak for themselves. In other words, the public is entitled to believe that the hon. the Prime Minister went in with the approval, tacit or overt, of certain other powers.</p>

<p>He says that had we not gone in, the MPLA would have taken over the ports and the railway. Our objective, then, was to prevent their doing that. He says, secondly, we revealed the Russian-Cuban presence. Did we know they were there when we went in, or did we not? He says Angola would have been used as the base for an attack on South West Africa, Za&#x00EF;re and Zambia. Is it not going to be used for that purpose today? The hon. the Prime Minister said the OAU would have recognized the MPLA. Was one of our objectives to stay there until the OAU conference was over? The hon. the Prime Minister says that if we had not gone in, Tanzania would have been forced to go with the communists, and that there would have been a communist belt right across Africa. Is that going to be prevented today? You see, Sir, our problem is that we want to know why we went in. We want to know what we achieved, and we want to know why we came out. Those are the questions people are asking. They want to know where we go from there. We went in obviously with certain <span class="col_389-390" refersTo="page_0211"/>objectives.

<p>Now, Sir, the Minister is introducing an entirely new concept of defending the freedom of the whole of Southern Africa.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and that is how I understood the hon. gentleman. But, you see, Sir, we find ourselves in difficulty in coming exactly to a conclusion. It is important that we reach a conclusion, because unless we know exactly why we went in we will not know whether we achieved our objective. We will not know what was achieved. Now, when we come to what was achieved, if you read through what was said by the two Ministers before the hon. the Prime Minister spoke this afternoon, you find that they both made broad claims that our intervention was politically rewarding and that Africa understands us better. They give little substantial proof and they make no claims of any military advantage. Now, what does the hon. the Prime Minister say? He said our objectives were limited and they were achieved. He said we got involved to prevent the MPLA and the Cubans harassing the inhabitants, to the point of chasing them away and causing them to flee. He said our intention was to bring to the attention of the free world that people were being forced under the communist yoke. Well, how much was achieved? Why did we withdraw? The hon. the Prime Minister said we chased them away and that, having chased them away, we had achieved our objectives and returned back home. Have we chased them away for good or are they coming back again?</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>You see, Sir, neither Minister has attempted to justify the withdrawal, but what is so interesting is that here is an article written by Christopher Manion of Johannesburg for the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on 22 January, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has in fact twice taken the decision to withdraw from the Angolan front, following America&#x2019;s reluctance to make a firm military commitment to counteract Soviet and Cuban aid to the Marxist MPLA movement. Either Pretoria has been repeatedly dissuaded from doing so by Washington and several African States, <span class="col_391-392" refersTo="page_0212"/>which although embarrassed by publicity over South Africa&#x2019;s involvement, are anxious to prevent an MPLA victory &#x2026;</block>

<p>One wonders whether that has something to do with our withdrawal. I think what we have to ask ourselves at this stage is where we go from here. I think we must draw up a balance sheet of the pluses and the minuses and the sort of direction we have to follow hereafter. As far as the pluses are concerned, I think public opinion in South Africa, much of it complacent or unaware of the imminence of potential danger, has been made acutely aware of the unexpected speed and nature of the dangers that can arise. I think, secondly, our military forces, although they have acquitted themselves well, must have learned many valuable lessons in regard to this type of rapid defensive and preventive action on our borders. I think, thirdly, on the plus side, the border remains intact, the works at Ruacana and Calueque are protected and the work by the international consortium is still proceeding. I think, fourthly, that while some tragic loss of life occurred, this has been far lighter than may well have been the case. Hopefully some of the international implications and complications of this type of action are now more clearly understood. Russian strategy in Africa has been more clearly exposed and may be better understood by ourselves and the outside world. The Western world, although it did not come to our aid, has been alerted to further threats and the necessary responses in defence of the sea route and other areas in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Now, what are the minuses? There are minuses. The Government has lost public trust through its failure to take South Africa fully into its confidence.</p>

<p>The Government failed to explain its motives abroad and it conceded a propaganda victory to our opponents overseas. Doubts have been raised in many African States as to the sincerity of South Africa&#x2019;s declared policy of non-intervention.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister is entitled to make that statement, but I can say that in many African States doubts have been raised as to the sincerity of South Africa&#x2019;s declared policy of non-intervention.</p>

<p>Lastly, the hostility of all States in Africa towards South Africa&#x2019;s continued occupation of South West Africa has been sustained and may be increased. So what are the lessons to be learned? I believe that if similar threats should occur in the future, the Government should insure that military information services are adequate to the political task of maintaining public confidence, which it did not do in this case. There must be fuller justification, combined with adequate reassurances as to our limited objectives, and these should be disseminated. We must proceed with far greater speed to find a solution for South West Africa. We have to broaden our system of co-operation in Southern Africa, so that it is understood that we defend ourselves as a region. We must accept the fact that new, heavy burdens may be placed on our economy, and we must ensure that it remains vigorously productive, even at the cost of discarding ideological luxuries. We must make greater speed in the field of race relations so as to build a common loyalty. I believe that our defences have to be in an even greater state of proficiency than at the present time.</p>

<p>If I might sum up, let me say we face a <span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0213"/>future in which threats to our security will be a permanent feature of our existence. The country&#x2019;s greatest task will be the motivation of all people of all races to defend every inch of South Africa as if it were their own. I ask myself if this is the Government to do the job. I believe it is not. The hon. the Prime Minister has sought to introduce an amendment for which he says every South African can vote. However, I have very great doubts as to whether this amendment is in order, because it seems to me that it contradicts my motion in no respect whatever. It does not call for confidence in the Government. The essence of my motion is no confidence in the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on a point of order: I should like you to consider whether this amendment moved by the hon. the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s motion is in order. In terms of the rules of this House, and in terms of the rule of relevancy, there are certain features of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s amendment which are not relevant to the motion of no confidence which has been introduced by the Leader of the Opposition. Secondly, in terms of Speaker&#x2019;s rulings over the years, an amendment may not extend the scope of the original motion. Quite clearly, in a number of respects the amendment moved by the hon. the Prime Minister, in particular the fifth paragraph of his amendment, extends the scope of the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I therefore respectfully submit that both in terms of the rule of relevancy, and in terms of the rule relating to extending the scope by way of an amendment, this amendment is not in order in terms of the rules and procedures of this House.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I may inform this House that the matter raised by the hon. member for Sea Point was brought to my attention this afternoon, and that I have had some opportunity to consider the matter. The matter of Angola was brought before this House in paragraph (a) of the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the form of a censure of the Government for its actions in connection with that matter. Any amendment in which this House wishes to take up any other standpoint on this matter will therefore in my opinion be relevant and admissible.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I must further point out that as stated by Sir Erskine May on page 379 of the 18th edition of his work, <i>Parliamentary Practice,</i> one object of an amendment may be to modify a question in such a way as to increase its acceptability. I consider that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s amendment falls into this category, and accordingly rule the amendment to be in order.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>To this date the Republic has had its share of terrorists and terroristic activities and has stood up against it with determination. Thanks to the unselfish devotion to duty of our troops and members of the S.A. Police on the borders, as well as to the active and moral support from all sectors at home, we have thus far been able to curtail this problem. The conflict raging in Angola has done more than merely to increase the threat. It has introduced a completely new factor by the intervention of foreign powers. Due to the new situation which has arisen virtually overnight, doubt exists whether the Defence Act makes sufficient provision to enable us to deploy our forces to safeguard our interests and to protect our borders under all circumstances. On a basis of voluntary military service outside the borders of the Republic, we have thus far been able to satisfactorily fulfil our commitments. In the event of an escalation requiring more action, however, a number of uncertainties have to be clarified and to this intent the Bill now before the House has been introduced.</p>

<p>Clause 1(a) of the Bill provides for an armed conflict, which no doubt cannot be excluded as a possibility in future, to be identified as a possible and probable threat to the security of the Republic. Should the need arise for such a threat to be prevented or suppressed through our Defence Force, it will be regarded as &#x201C;service in defence of the Republic&#x201D;. The State President decides whether any armed conflict outside the Republic poses a threat to its security.</p>

<p>In clause 1(b) a definite geographic meaning is assigned to the concept &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; as being Africa south of the equator. The concept &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D; is defined in such a manner as to stress its activities rather than its aims. The term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; is rather vague, and it is more appropriate to clearly define its geographic extent. Perhaps &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; would have been a better term to use. If hon. members will refer to clause 6, they will find that this clause amends section 95 of the Act which restricts the territory within which members of the S.A. Defence Force may be employed in time of war on a compulsory basis. Although under the existing provisions this territory already extends outside the borders of the Republic and South West Africa, there is no absolute certainty as to the exact geographic extent. This doubt is removed by the amendment and the geographic boundary wherein members of the S.A. Defence Force may be employed in time of war is fixed as anywhere in Africa, south of the equator. I must point out, however, that the term &#x201C;south of the equator&#x201D; might pose practical problems and create confusion. I readily admit that this could be the case. An alternative to consider would be the deletion of the term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;, but the provision as it reads in the Defence Act at present is rather vague and very difficult to interpret.</p>

<p>In clause 2 the expression &#x201C;prevention or suppression of terrorism&#x201D; which, in terms of the existing section of the Act, forms part of the definition of &#x201C;service in defence of the Republic&#x201D;, is deleted from section 1 of the Act and inserted in section 3(2) as a specific duty to which the S.A. Defence Force or any portion or member thereof, may at all times be employed.</p>

<p><span class="col_399-400" refersTo="page_0216"/>In 1974 the definition of the expression &#x201C;service in defence of the Republic&#x201D; was amended to include also the combating of terrorism within the meaning thereof under the Terrorism Act, 1967. The sole reason for this amendment was to extend the protection of the War Pensions Act given under section 145 to members of the Citizen Force and Commandos also to members of the Permanent Force for disablement suffered during military service in the combating of terrorism. Because of a subsequent amendment to the Government Service Pensions Act, 1965, however, the necessity for this provision has lapsed, whereas terrorism and terroristic activities have escalated and gone beyond the meaning assigned thereto by the Terrorism Act and has become the prime concern of our troops on the border. No court in the Republic has jurisdiction over acts of terrorism committed against the Republic outside its borders. Circumstances may, however, demand action to prevent or suppress such activities.</p>

<p>In clauses 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 the amendment in clause 2 is carried forward to the sections referred to therein as consequential amendments.</p>

<p>I have already dealt with some of the amendments proposed in clause 6. However, clause 6 also extends the meaning of the expression &#x201C;time of war&#x201D; in section 95 of the principal Act to include &#x201C;service for the prevention or the suppression of terrorism&#x201D; as well as &#x201C;service for the prevention or suppression of any armed conflict&#x201D; intended in clause 1(a). This is considered necessary as a formal declaration of war is something of the past. One cannot any longer define war on the one hand and a situation of peace or armed conflict on the other hand.</p>

<p>Clause 8 inserts two new sections, 103<i>ter</i> and 103<i>quat,</i> which are aimed at indemnity against civil or criminal action arising out of acts in connection with the combating of terrorism in any operational area and the compensating of innocent parties for damage suffered in the process. The necessity for these provisions arose out of an incident in the past which caused great uncertainty and anxiety in the minds of our soldiers doing duty on the border. Operational commitments do not allow for soldiers to be withdrawn from their duties to attend judicial inquiries into the deaths through unnatural causes of persons killed in the process of combating terrorism. Neither is it advisable to subject soldiers to the worry of a possible criminal prosecution or civil process for acts done in good faith and in the execution of their duties under order. To this end the proposed section 103<i>ter</i>(2) prohibits the institution or continuation of any civil or criminal proceedings against the State, the State President, the Minister of Defence, a member of the South African Defence Force or any other person in the service of the State by reason of any act advised, commanded, ordered, directed or done by them in good faith for the purposes of or in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in any operational area.</p>

<p>Subsection (3) compels a court of law to accept as conclusive proof of the facts, a certificate signed by the Minister of Defence to the effect that any act specified therein was advised for the purposes of or in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in an operational area.</p>

<p>Proceedings already instituted must be discontinued in terms of subsection (4) upon the direction of the Minister of Justice acting upon the authority of the State President when of the opinion that the proceedings were instituted by reason of an act advised, etc., in good faith for the purposes of or in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in an operational area, and that it is in the national interest for it to be discontinued. The State President bases his opinion on the consideration of a report by the Minister of Defence indicating the circumstances under which the act in question took place, as well as the factors indicating that it was in good faith and for the purposes of combating terrorism in an operation area.</p>

<p>In terms of subsection (6) the court shall upon the same grounds <i>mero motu</i> order proceedings to be discontinued. In all cases the procedures shall lapse and be deemed void. No order shall be made, also as to costs, except for the costs in connection with the question of whether the act was for the purpose of or in connection with the prevention or suppression of terrorism in such an operational area. Both the Minister of Defence and of Justice act by way of certificates, and in terms of subsection (7) the validity of any such certificate is beyond the jurisdiction of any court.</p>

<p>Because, as has already happened, innocent parties can suffer damage in the process of combating terrorism, and because, in terms of <span class="col_401-402" refersTo="page_0217"/>section 103<i>ter</i>, they will have no recourse to courts, the proposed section 103<i>quat</i>(1) allows them to apply to the Minister of Defence for compensation. In terms of subsection 2(a) the Minister, acting in consultation with the Minister of Finance, may grant any application and pay the amount claimed, or a lesser amount. If the application is not granted, or if granted, the amount offered is not accepted, the Minister must in terms of subsection 2(b) refer the application to a compensation board established by him in terms of subsection (3), for consideration thereof and to make recommendations. The constitution of the board, the members to be appointed on the board, their conditions of service, and the powers, duties and functions of the board, are contained in subsections (4) to (6).</p>

<p>In terms of subsection (7) the Minister shall notify a claimant in writing of a recommendation of a compensation board and must give effect thereto.</p>

<p>In terms of subsection (8) compensation is paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Further administrative provisions s well as offences and punishments are provided for in subsections (9) and (10).</p>

<p>In clause 10 of the Bill the benefits of the Moratorium Act, 1963, are extended also to members of the Citizen Force and Commandos rendering continuous service of 19 days&#x2019; duration and which has been extended by the Minister to 12 weeks in terms of section 92<i>ter</i>(2) of the Act. Reasons for this extension have already been communicated to both Houses.</p>

<p>The clauses referred to in clause 11 of the Bill operate with retrospective effect in order to obviate any doubt which may exist in regard to the legality of action taken to date under existing provisions for the purpose of the combating of terrorism or forces threatening those interests for which we are responsible.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. the Minister for his explanation of the various clauses of the Bill. I think that it is obvious that our Defence Act has not kept pace with the changes brought about by the new world situation in which wars are not declared. We have made many amendments over the years&#x2014;amendments which were aimed at building up our forces and applying them mainly under the concept of terrorism or in conventional war. In these ways we face a different type of threat and the escalation from terrorism to large-scale or conventional opposition, can be a sudden and an unexpected one. Equally so, it is essential that any legal doubts which may prevail, must be put beyond doubt so that there can be no confusion in the minds of those who are defending South Africa.</p>

<p>There are three main principles involved in this Bill: the introduction of the concept of &#x201C;armed conflict&#x201D;, the question of territorial restrictions south of the equator, and the legal process and compensation arising from the combating of terrorism in operational areas. I want to say at once that we on this side of the House believe that the time has come to go further than this Bill does. We believe the time has come to remove all territorial restrictions in respect of the service of our defence forces. This section in the Act, section 95, is part of the history of South Africa. Its historic background is one of a union of peoples who had fought each other in war and the seeds of that division had carried forward to two world wars. In our generation we have found our people divided into those who fought and those who did not fight. Some of that bitterness still exists today&#x2014;the volunteers against the neutrals or the volunteers against those who were positively antagonistic by undermining the war effort&#x2014;in other words those who, in the parlance of that war, acted as a fifth column. Let us face it, that whether we like it or not, there are those today who are saying: Let the Nats go and fight their own war, why should we volunteer? One hears it. Herein lies one of the tragedies that has flowed from history.</p>

<p>I believe that today there is a new generation of soldiers facing a common enemy. I can conceive of no other enemy against whom our forces will be used than international communism, and it is common cause amongst, I would say, the overwhelming majority of people in South Africa, that this real threat to South Africa must be fought with all the power at our command. I believe that with that common objective before us we should not divide a new generation of South Africans into those who are prepared to serve and those who are not prepared to serve their country. We do not have a volunteer army today. People are called up in terms of their national service commitments. Everyone is called up for army service. But having trained them as soldiers, do we now say to them: Right, chaps, which of <span class="col_403-404" refersTo="page_0218"/>you are prepared to go and fight for South Africa? If we do that we shall again get them divided on a volunteer basis; those willing to serve and those not willing to serve. And if anybody else&#x2019;s son should volunteer and my son should not, or <i>vice versa</i> &#x2026; In my case I know my serving son would go because he has told me that no matter what I said to him he would volunteer. I blackmailed my father in just the same way nearly 40 years ago. Now why should he go while another lad says: &#x201C;No, I do not want to go; I have a good business&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am studying&#x201D; and consequently he sits at home in a base camp, does his year&#x2019;s service in safety, whilst the boys who volunteer go up to serve South Africa. I believe that they should all face the same responsibilities and the same duties, and that there should be no question of choice when it comes to fighting for South Africa. If you are fighting for South Africa, you cannot say that here is a line to which I will fight. If you are standing on our side of the border and somebody attacks you from the other side, must the commanding officer then go round to everybody and say: &#x2018;&#x2018;Come on, chaps, who is going with me to go and hit them back?&#x201D; Or say we extend it to the equator and you get into a war, as we have done on two occasions&#x2014;where we have fought north of the equator&#x2014;and you get to that line and then you have to go to all your troops and ask them which of them want to go home now. I do not think it is realistic in the circumstances of today, with the speed of travel, with the danger of long-distance missiles and weapons. You cannot today look on a river or a line on a map and say that that is the boundary beyond which you will not move. Therefore we wish to propose to the hon. the Minister that rather than change the definition of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;, we abolish section 95 entirely in so far as any territorial restriction is concerned, or if it is still required for any other reason, which I have not been able to find, we amend it to eliminate the territorial restrictions.</p>

<p>There is a second objection to the method which is being used in this Bill. We create a new task&#x2014;a task which involves armed conflict beyond the borders of South Africa&#x2014;and then we define &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; as the equator. We believe that the enemies of South Africa will make use of this to claim that we have aggressive intentions towards neighbouring states. By passing this amending legislation in this form, we could be placing a propaganda weapon in the hands of our enemies, because then they could say: Look what South Africa is now doing; they are passing an Act entitling them to fight beyond their borders and then they specify that they can go and fight anywhere south of the equator. And to the countries south of the equator they can say: Here is clear planning for future aggression. No other country that I know of in the world limits the operational area of its forces. So, for a second reason, if we eliminate the territorial limitation upon service, we place ourselves on the same footing as any other country, and we remove the possibility of misrepresentation of our objective. We know that South Africa has no territorial aims. We are giving away parts of it, rather than seeking more land. So therefore let us make it clear to everyone that this is not our objective.</p>

<p>Then I turn to the proposal that &#x201C;armed conflict&#x201D;, be part of &#x201C;service in the defence of South Africa,&#x201D; and particularly to clause 6, which deems it to be &#x201C;service in time of war against an enemy&#x201D; for the purposes of section 95. We agree that there is no question about the use of our forces. They must be used wherever it is necessary to use them. But in the spirit of the Act, whenever there is a state of war, there has been&#x2014;and has to be for practical purposes&#x2014;a mobilization of our forces. When mobilization is applied, either full or partial mobilization, there is, in terms of section 91, a requirement that Parliament shall give its approval within 30 days of such mobilization. With recent amendments to the Act now we can now partially mobilize without invoking section 91. In terms of section 92 there may be a call-up for a period of up to six months without invoking section 91. Let me point out that the spirit and intent of section 91 is that parliamentary approval is required&#x2014;and let me emphasize, <i>post facto</i> approval; nobody could possibly suggest that you first have to go to Parliament to get permission, because your army must act and act quickly when there is danger. But having acted to mobilize, you then come to Parliament for approval. We believe that the same safeguard which applies to mobilization should apply in such circumstances. It already partially applies in so far as the Minister must report to Parliament within 14 days in respect of call-up under section 92. The principle is <span class="col_405-406" refersTo="page_0219"/>already there and this should also apply to a state of armed conflict which is deemed to be action against an enemy in time of war in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>As a South African, I cannot visualize Parliament refusing such permission. If the facts are as they would seem to me to be&#x2014;although South Africa does not officially know what they are&#x2014;obviously we should have gone out to meet the enemy on ground of our own choosing. Obviously one does not wait until the enemy hits one. One goes out and hits him where it suits you best. Therefore, if the circumstances are as I think they were, then I think it was right to have acted as we did and acted quickly, and I would be the last to suggest that we should tie the hands of either the State President in declaring war, or the military forces in acting. I do believe, however, that if the Minister had come back to Parliament and told Parliament what the Government had done, he would have had Parliament and with it all the people of South Africa solidly and fully behind the action. Doubts and questioning would have been eliminated, and some of the unfortunate attitudes which have been adopted in some quarters would have been avoided. We are therefore happy to accept the concept of armed conflict but we ask that it be brought within the ambit of the same proviso as applies when mobilization takes place, and that Parliament be informed and given the opportunity to give its approval.</p>

<p>In fact, we go further. One could combine the concept of combating terrorism with armed conflict, because once again, where does one draw the line? If you go out to chase a small group of terrorists and suddenly come upon a large camp of 500 or 600 armed enemies the action changes from one aimed at fighting a handful of terrorist raiders into a full-scale armed conflict. The two are so closely associated that I believe that one could combine them into one definition, which would be clearer and which would then apply all the provisions which this Bill applies, in respect of combating and suppressing terrorism to participation in an armed conflict. This also requires a clearer definition of terrorism. What we are saying in this Bill is, in fact, that terrorism means &#x201C;terroristic&#x201D; activities in the Republic. I cannot find the word &#x201C;terroristic&#x201D; in a dictionary. There is &#x201C;terrorist&#x201D; and there is &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D;. I do not believe &#x201C;terroristic&#x201D; is a word. I do not think that in Afrikaans &#x201C;terroristiese&#x201D; relates to terrorism either. However this may be, as the definition reads it is not a strong or clear definition, and in the Committee Stage we will move a clearer definition, which we believe covers all possibilities and places the definition beyond doubt. Parliament should not pass meaningless definitions which could later lead to dispute and conflict.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 8, the proposed new section 103<i>ter,</i> removing the jurisdiction of the courts in certain circumstances. Some of my learned colleagues will deal with the legal aspects of this. There are only two points of general principle which I shall raise now. The one is that we do not believe it to be correct for the Minister to appoint a compensation board to hear appeals against his own decisions. A compensation board is set up to deal with cases where the decision of the Minister has not been accepted. In passing I think the hon. the Minister is wrong in saying that this applies where the compensation was not acceptable to the applicant. The only two conditions under which the board can be established, are when the Minister has granted an application but no amount is paid or where he has rejected an application. There is no provision&#x2014;and this we shall seek to put right at the Committee Stage&#x2014;for an appeal to the board where the Minister has granted an application but offered a lesser amount not acceptable to the applicant. I think that is clearly the intention, but it is not stated in clause 8(2) of the Bill. The principle proposed is that a person appeals against the Minister&#x2019;s finding and that appeal is heard by a board appointed by the same Minister. We shall move, in the Committee Stage, that the compensation board be appointed by the Minister of Justice and controlled by the Minister of Justice. We recognize the strong arguments for not adopting the normal legal process in an operational area under these circumstances, but we believe that there is a judicial aspect concerned here and that the matter should be dealt with through the Minister of Justice and a proper tribunal appointed to deal with compensation which is not controlled by the Minister of Defence. There are certain other aspects of detail which will be dealt with by other members. These relate to the procedures and the operation of this proposed clause.</p>

<p><span class="col_407-408" refersTo="page_0220"/>I now come to clause 10, that of the moratorium. I welcome this, as I was the first person to raise this matter some time ago. I welcome the fact that the Minister has introduced this and that the section 92 call-up will now be covered. There is a problem here, however, to which I must admit quite frankly I have not found a solution. I believe, however, that we have to look at this. The application of the moratorium, in this regard, specifically excludes rentals or payments on residential flats or homes, by a serviceman if that rental becomes due after he is called up for service. Quite obviously, in times of war or during a 12-month call-up, the person concerned has to make arrangements to give up the flat or home concerned if the rent cannot be paid. When a man is called up for three months however, if he cannot pay his rent at the end of the first month, his wife can be put out on the street. We obviously cannot expect every soldier who cannot pay his rent out of his R3-30 allowance if he is not in an operational area to close down and give up his home because he has been called up for three months. I believe we have got to find some protection for that shorter period, which is excluded under the present moratorium provisions. One cannot expect a landlord to go for months without rent, because he in turn is using that rental to pay off bonds or in many cases to live. Equally, however, one cannot expect a soldier to have to give up his home because he is called up for three months. He cannot put his furniture into storage. He may be able to send his wife and family to relatives, but the physical home is there and he has to pay for it. If he is not in an operational area, on under R100 per month, he cannot possibly clothe and feed his family and pay his rent for three months. As I say, I am baffled. I do not have a positive proposal to make. One cannot expect the landlord to carry the burden, and on the other hand one has to protect these servicemen as well. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether perhaps, later in the session, when we have had an opportunity to look at this more carefully, and perhaps have found some solution, an amendment could not be introduced in the General Laws Amendment Bill at the end of the session. This is a real weakness which has already appeared in two or three cases which have come to my attention. We cannot expect charity to do it and we shall have to find some way of protecting the homes of people called up to fight to defend us.</p>

<p>To sum up: We ask for a new look at the concept of serving South Africa beyond our borders and at the removal of territorial restrictions so that all will serve equally wherever they are required for the safety and the security of South Africa. We suggest that by doing so, we shall prevent putting a weapon in the hands of our enemies, that we shall give a greater meaning to our Defence Act and that those who are called up for service will know that they are there to serve wherever, whenever and however the needs of South Africa require this of them. We visualize some improvements in the definitions and in the combination of combating terrorism and armed conflict and certain amendments, as I have stated, in regard to legal procedures in operational areas in combating communism.</p>

<p>This makes it clear that in principle we support the objective, the principles of this measure. In fact we should like it to go further and we hope that the hon. the Minister will agree to an instruction to the Committee of the whole House which will enable us to amend or to delete section 95 in order that we can introduce a new era into our South African defence concept. We shall support the Second Reading but hope the hon. the Minister will meet us in this regard.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that what we have again had here, as was the case during the No-confidence Debate, was a very responsible approach on the part of the United Party&#x2019;s chief spokesman on defence. I think you will find that we will be able to discuss with each other most of the aspects in regard to which he wants to move amendments and that we shall probably be able to debate some of these aspects at the Committee Stage. I think that his difficulty in regard to the limitations on the service of our troops in so far as they concern the area and the terrain, links up with the problem raised by the hon. the Minister himself. I believe that we shall undoubtedly be able to conduct very fruitful discussions in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point referred to the attitude which could prevail as a result of the standpoint which certain political groups, to be specific the National Party, adopted in the days prior to the Second World War. I do not think that this is relevant at this <span class="col_409-410" refersTo="page_0221"/>stage because the aspect which is now under discussion, the threat, is different. We could just as well advance the counter argument that the war effort and war machinery of the Allied powers during the Second World War strengthened those very forces which now threaten us. We could just as well advance that as an argument. But we shall refrain from doing that. We are not going to trade reproaches, but will let it suffice that we have a common approach, namely the defence of the country, for which we thank the Opposition.</p>

<p>If, then, we have to test the Defence Act against that, we find that that is precisely what it is geared to, not the committing aggression, but the defence of what is ours. The Defence Act was designed, not only to make provision for the defence of the life of Koos van der Merwe and his sheep, but also that of Mr. Harry Oppenheimer and his mines, Barry Clifford&#x2019;s private school and April Mondesi&#x2019;s wives and children. Everyone will enjoy the benefit of this.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>The Defence Act is aimed at protecting State authority, too, against those who seek to undermine it. When, therefore, we consider these aims and find that the Defence Act does not cover them adequately, then we change it because it is necessary that this be done. To go into technical details concerning the Defence Act at this stage, to investigate whether it could perhaps be true that a certain hon. Senator argued about the legal validity of certain action, is something which we reject and condemn. However, I shall come back to this again. I thank the Opposition, therefore, for the standpoint which they have adopted. Our aims are the same and I ask that we start on that note and make it our point of departure.</p>

<p>I agree that a number of principles are involved. I can identify some of these principles by asking a few questions. The first is: For what purposes may our troops be employed, and the second is, in what areas may they be employed. We find that the Defence Act has up to now made provision for the employment of troops to serve in defence of the Republic, to serve in the prevention or suppression of internal disorder and to serve in the preservation of lives or health. However, it has now become necessary&#x2014;in this regard I refer to clause 2&#x2014;to add terrorism as a substantive service. It has become necessary since the old definition of &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D; which appears in the definition under the concept &#x201C;service in defence of the Republic&#x201D; is too local in scope. It is geared to the local situation to too great an extent, to terrorism within the borders of the Republic of South Africa. However, in practice it has been proved that it can operate against us from beyond our borders as well. It has been proved in practice, too, that we must have an elastic concept. We must have a flexible concept since terrorism as such is flexible. Their ingenuity knows no bounds. We know how this is being utilized today by small groups of Palestinian terrorists. The essence of the matter, therefore, is that we want an elastic concept. The Opposition&#x2019;s chief spokesman calls for a new definition of &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D; because, according to him, the definition as it stands is too narrow in scope. However, he will know that it is precisely when one defines a concept and does not leave it to popular usage to determine its content or give it to the courts to interpret, that one comes unstruck. I, too, made a search to see if I could possibly find anywhere in law, definitions of &#x201C;terrorist activities&#x201D; as such. I then found that Cassell&#x2019;s <i>International Law</i> deals specifically with &#x201C;terrorist acts&#x201D; and defines them as &#x201C;typical cases of the violation of the independence of states&#x201D;, in other words what we have in mind now and not the aeroplane which is hijacked by terrorists, but that which must be preserved for us, viz. the integrity and sovereignty of our state. That too can be threatened by terrorist activities. I have quoted a well-known writer on international law. What is more, as far back as 1934 the old League of Nations identified &#x201C;terrorist activities&#x201D; as such as a crime against the authority of the State, and condemned them. This arose out of a certain escapade in Europe in those years. The UNO as we know it today also passed a very strong verdict in 1951 in a certain resolution which was compiled by the International Law Commission and in which the expression &#x201C;terrorist activities&#x201D; is used. I therefore call on the Opposition to leave this expression to the suppleness of our judicature, of interpretation and to the existing meaning which international law has already given &#x201C;terrorist activities&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I began my argument by saying that it has <span class="col_411-412" refersTo="page_0222"/>become necessary for us to make this a substantive service for which our troops can be employed, namely the threat to the authority of the State, from whichever quarter it may come. Our troops can also be employed in time of war in connection with the discharge of the obligations of the Republic&#x2019;s agreements in regard to joint defence&#x2014;that is the definition. However, on the basis of experiences in recent times, the latest developments in Africa, we began to realize that there was a grey area from which the security of the Republic can be threatened, namely conflicts which may arise beyond our borders and which are dangerous to the integrity of the State. It is therefore necessary for us to consider the possibility of a duty on South Africa&#x2019;s part to guarantee stability in such areas for the sake, not only of its own stability, but also for the sake of a wider concept which is developing, namely that the Republic of South Africa as such is involved in Africa in a situation in which collective responsibility against that which threatens Africa as a whole is developing and growing. This argument received its strongest support in the House from none other than the hon. member for Yeoville. On three separate occasions he has advocated a Monroe doctrine. The time has come for us to consider very specifically what this involves and then to say to the hon. member for Yeoville that we see in these ideas of his, true patriotism, true vision, a true sense of responsibility towards South Africa and a moving away from pettiness in certain Opposition circles, to be specific, the Progrefs. This being so, we find it interesting that the hon. member for Yeoville voted against the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s amendment last week. He who advocates this collective responsibility voted against that amendment. I believe that we who have begun to develop respect for the viewpoint of the hon. member for Yeoville are entitled to ask for an explanation from him in this regard. I do not want to call his credibility into question.</p>

<p>Thus far I have indicated for what purposes our troops may be employed, but as yet I have made no reference to the issue of territorial limitations. We shall come to that. This is the matter which was raised by the hon. member for Durban Point with regard to section 95 in regard to which he proposed another definition of South Africa; in fact, he wants to leave out the definition in order to keep it as wide as possible. On a future occasion I shall deal in great detail with this matter, namely with the question of how widely that provision must be read. As I have indicated, the employment of our troops is therefore geared to the new situation as it has developed over the years and is known to us today. We want to ask the hon. member for Durban Point to consider carefully what we have said before we debate this matter among ourselves. I am referring to the elasticity of the provision.</p>

<p>This brings me to the question: What territorial restrictions are there on the employment of our troops? Here section 95 in particular is applicable. Let me add at once that when we refer to the Republic of South Africa in the context of the Defence Act, this also includes South West Africa. There must be no doubt about that. Section 95 provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A member of the South African Defence Force may be required in time of war to perform service against an enemy anywhere in South Africa, whether within or outside the Republic and may with his written consent be required to perform such service outside South Africa.</block>

<p>It is clear that the South African soldier may therefore be employed in an area greater than the Republic, the Republic including&#x2014;I emphasize this again&#x2014;South West Africa. In other words, if we interpret the Act as it reads at present, it is very clear that it is impossible to employ the South African Defence Force only within the borders of the Republic of South Africa, because that would make it ridiculous, it would make it ineffectual, it would make it meaningless and would make South Africa ridiculous in the eyes of the military. If we were to see our responsibility as being limited solely to these borders, the question would arise as to the purpose of the cardinal principle of international law, that if the integrity, the security or the property of one&#x2019;s territory is threatened, one has the right to cross one&#x2019;s borders and punish the offence committed against one. There is, therefore, authority for one to do this in regard to terrorists and in regard to any action against one.</p>

<p><span class="col_413-414" refersTo="page_0223"/>To take this further into the practical sphere, one cannot cause the bullets to stop halfway across the river and say that one may not shoot across the border. We have now also become acquainted with the 122 mm Stalin organ which can be towed 20 km behind a border and can still destroy one totally on the border. Let us go further and see what happens in practice if one sticks to one&#x2019;s borders. If one does this one loses, just as the French lost. They thought that the Maginot Line could not be taken and consequently they stayed there. They did not budge from that line, but the Germans extracted them from it. In other words, ordinary common sense tells one that if one&#x2019;s troops can be employed for the defence of one&#x2019;s borders, it must be possible to employ them beyond the borders. As the hon. member for Durban Point said, one cannot ask a man&#x2019;s permission when one is, so to speak, halfway across the cutline in South West Africa.</p>

<p>I find it very interesting that the Progrefs should now begin to react in this tone because the preamble of the provision in section 95 has a long history. It goes back to the days when Gen. Louis Botha and Gen. Smuts piloted the Defence Act through the House of Assembly for the first time. At the time Gen. Botha spoke in favour of the Bill and said that it would have to be possible to employ the troops beyond the borders of the Union, namely South Africa, because (Hansard, 28 February 1912, col. 751)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Union had for neighbours several of the great powers, and in the case of raids from those territories the army must be able to cross their borders.</block>

<p>So said Gen. Louis Botha.</p>

<p>In fact, when the late Gen. Smuts, as Minister of Defence, piloted this Act through Parliament he used the same argument, but he said that it was necessary because we had Portuguese colonial possessions as neighbours. In other words, as far back as 1912 Gen. Smuts foresaw the possibility that the Portuguese colonies could serve as a springboard for enemies of South Africa. At that time South West Africa was not yet included in the then Union of South Africa. We therefore cannot but acknowledge today the far-sightedness of those two men and agree with them. However, it goes much further than that. When South Africa entered the war in 1939, this Defence Act still applied.</p>

<p>No less a person than Col. Neil Orpen, a self-acknowledged Progressive, came to the fore with two letters in <i>The Cape Times</i>&#x2014;on 7 and 15 January respectively&#x2014;and stated that he wanted nothing to do with that newspaper&#x2019;s negative arguments. In fact, he supports his argument with a letter from a widow, also a Progressive, who states that her son is prepared to fight and to die for South Africa. Col. Orpen then refers us to a very interesting book written by J. S. N. Simpson, entitled <i>South Africa Fights.</i> For the purposes of our debate, it is as well for us to take note of what this author has to say. He states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The far-sighted men who framed that Act, left the terms &#x201C;in any part of South Africa&#x201D; specifically vague. They did not limit the service to the Union alone, thus restricting the operations of the South African forces to action within their own frontiers. The idea was to go and seek your enemy where you find him; strike at him before he reaches your frontiers. As South Africa&#x2019;s visions turned to the north, &#x2026;</block>

<p>And now this is very interesting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_415-416" refersTo="page_0224"/>&#x2026; as it was realized how modern communications had brought her to the doorstep of Kenya and Uganda, those who read the times right became convinced that the law expressly allowed for the calling up of the Union&#x2019;s manhood to defend its distant strategic frontiers.</block>

<p>This is how we, too, interpreted the Defence Act when we became involved in a minor military operation in Angola, and also when we came to Parliament and, through the hon. the Minister of Defence, asked for a clearly circumscribed definition of what exactly the duty of our soldiers was. This is not a new concept, a new idea, which the hon. the Minister of Defence is presenting to the House here. What the hon. Minister is asking us here is to define clearly and precisely something which has been contained in our Defence Act from as far back as 1912, and which was interpreted in exactly the same way as 1939&#x2014;even though I, as a little boy, did not support that war effort; nor was there much point in it. Even though I did not support it then, I say this in respect for the viewpoint arising out of those times, which now comes to the fore.</p>

<p>Furthermore I find it very interesting that the hon. Senator Bamford should have had so much to say in <i>The Cape Times</i> some time ago. The worst thing he said&#x2014;and this is absolutely unforgivable&#x2014;is that he tried to intimate that South African troops were limited solely to action in the Republic of South Africa. He did this as a lawyer and I take it that he did it as a responsible person. To come forward with such an argument in these times really makes one shudder, if one considers the degree of patriotism behind such an approach.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asks why the legislation is retrospective. We have told you that it is to spell this out very clearly and precisely for those who are unable to read and understand, and who are unaware of the history and the traditions of the Defence Force and South Africa&#x2019;s state of mind.</p>

<p>To conclude, I shall come back to other facets of the Bill which were also raised by the hon. member for Durban Point. I want to agree with him at once in regard to one aspect, namely the issue of subsection 2(b) of section 103<i>quat.</i> It is clear from this that if the Minister were in fact to decide to grant compensation, and the aggrieved party was not satisfied with it, then the argument advanced by the hon. member for Durban Point would be valid. The hon. the Minister must please give serious consideration to enabling a person who feels aggrieved about the amount of compensation as such, to have recourse to the compensation board. I do not think we shall argue a great deal about who will appoint the compensation board, whether it be the Minister of Justice or the State President. However, what we must emphasize very strongly is that these measures are peacetime measures, although designed for those specific circumstances in which we want to avoid measures in an emergency situation and in which we specifically want to make it possible for a Defence Force man to carry out orders legally given to him. It will also make it so much easier for him to carry out his task if he knows that he would be protected if he were to have to flatten a farmer&#x2019;s fences or damage the property of a person in the pursuit of terrorists. Consequently, before we discuss this matter, we must bear in mind that we need this precisely because we do not want to implement emergency measures and because we do not want to cause difficulties.</p>

<p>In the last few moments at my disposal, Sir, I want to deal with a pamphlet from an extreme rightist quarter, one is tempted to say, an extremely foolish quarter. This pamphlet gives out that under the Defence Act Parliament should have been convened. The sections quoted deal with mobilization. It is correct that under certain circumstances when mobilization takes place, Parliament has to be convened. The hon. the Minister employs the units of the Defence Force for the defence of the Republic of South Africa under section 92<i>ter,</i> which was specially designed for this purpose. It was the hon. member for Durban Point who proposed in a Select Committee that if we should do this, the Minister should then submit a report to Parliament within 14 days after the start of a session, if Parliament was <span class="col_417-418" refersTo="page_0225"/>not in session at that time. Less than a week ago we received such a report from the Minister. Consequently I am of the opinion that we should censure these people, whoever they may be, who make these blatant misrepresentations and quote sections of no relevance whatever, in the strongest possible terms. If their actions should have the effect of demoralizing our troops, then this would be an act bordering on the worst type of undermining of the State. The question has occurred to me whether suitable provision should not be made in our Defence Act for such action.</p>

<p>I also just want to refer in passing to the Moratorium Act and in this regard put a question to the hon. the Minister. In cases where there are certain sections which do not apply to a specific member of the Defence Force if he should omit to provide certain information, would it not be possible for such a man to be informed of his specific rights under the Moratorium Act, to enable him to provide information timeously where required, for example in implementing the Hire Purchase Act?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bloemfontein West touched on quite a few matters and I cannot react to all of them. It is interesting to note that he attacked my party even before we stated our point of view on this measure. The hon. member also referred to the hon. member for Yeoville, and to the amendment moved by the hon. the Prime Minister. I hope to return to that a little later. He made one point on which I should like to elaborate a little. He said that various principles are at stake in this particular Bill.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The provisions of this Bill affect aspects in our society that touch upon the lives of every South African, irrespective of his race or background. It affects, for example, the nature of military service in defence of the Republic, the combating of terrorism, the compensation for men responsible for military service and their protection when they might be prosecuted in the combating of terrorism. In any society such provisions will enjoy the attention of anybody who is concerned about the safety and security of all the inhabitants in that society. But particularly in South Africa there is an additional sense of urgency because we are a deeply troubled society and because we live in very difficult times. We are beset with problems which under peaceful and normal circumstances would tax the most competent brains of the best people in the world to the utmost. We, however, because of circumstances, have to cope with those problems under abnormal conditions where there is a threat to peace. These abnormal conditions are directly related to our military situation. We have troops on the border of South West Africa and, in fact, in Angola itself. There is a civil war raging in Angola at this very moment, a civil war in which we were partly involved and from which we have withdrawn and, at this particular stage, we are still not quite sure as to the nature of the benefits of having done so.</p>

<p>To complete the picture, we have tense and volatile societies very close to our borders, in Zambia, Zaire, Rhodesia and Mozambique. As a matter of fact, in most of these societies there is a very real possibility of armed conflict taking place. If one looks at all the countries south of the equator&#x2014;and we hope this will not happen&#x2014;one cannot but fear that they, or many of them, are ripe for civil war. We will promote and support any effort at establishing co-operation, peace and stability with and within those societies. That is why, given these circumstances, we have to be very serious when we discuss the provisions of this Bill. We believe that we are deliberating on matters that affect the lives of our young people, not in some future sense, but immediately, particularly if we keep in mind that these young people have to form part of the majority of our Defence Force and that they have to contribute to the defence of the country. It is in terms of these considerations that I would like to consider some of the substantive amendments in this Bill in as responsible and unemotional a manner as possible.</p>

<p>The first aspect concerns the whole issue of compensation in the broad sense. As the hon. the Minister has indicated, primarily clauses 9 and 10 are involved with this. Let me say immediately that we are in full agreement with the principle of such provisions and we support and welcome these amendments. In fact, we believe that we can go even further in this respect and my hon. colleague will no doubt make some mention of this later on. We believe that whenever someone performs military service in any capacity and suffers as <span class="col_419-420" refersTo="page_0226"/>a result of it, he should be adequately compensated and that the people in the country should be willing to contribute to such compensation through the State.</p>

<p>The second aspect I briefly want to talk about is the combating of terrorism. Virtually every clause in this Bill is directly or indirectly related to the problem of combating terrorism. I am not going to dwell on them individually, but I would like to point out some of the highlights. Clause 1(b) changes the meaning of the concept of terrorism by giving it a new definition and, therefore, by implication dropping its old connotation with the Terrorism Act of 1967. Therefore, we have two concepts of terrorism operative in South Africa. One could say that the one has primarily a political content, while the other has a more military content. We welcome this change and the fact that this definition has now been introduced into this Bill, because we think it conforms more to the conventional usage of the word &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D; and that it makes more sense in military spheres to use this conception of terrorism. In any case, given the intended scope of the Bill, it would have made military nonsense to have retained the Terrorism Act sense of the word for military purposes. The main import of clauses 2, 4 and 6 is to make the combating of terrorism an integral part of training in service in the Citizen Force to enable the State President and the Minister to call up the Citizen Force for such purposes whenever and wherever it is necessary, and in addition the territorial restrictions are also changed.</p>

<p>One of the saddest comments in the latter half of this century is that in this period acts of terrorism became a common instrument for applying political, economic and social pressure or for bringing about change. Bombing, hijacking, pillage, rape and murder have become almost daily occurrences or features in the mass communications media of the world. I say it is sad, because wherever it happens one finds a group of people so frustrated and filled with anger and irrationality, that they are prepared to kill indiscriminately members of their own society. By their very acts these people are saying that they have given up all hope for peaceful and orderly change in that society and they are intent on preventing others from bringing about that change as well. Because terrorism inspires terror, fear and resistance, we believe that it has to be opposed in whatever manner possible, and we support the measures envisaged in this Bill. We would, however, be failing in our duty if we did not point out a fact which is very obvious, and that is that although terrorism is a pernicious disease, it is also a symptom indicating that there is something wrong in the body of society. When its symptoms become manifest, therefore, it is important to mobilize the loyalty and commitment of all the people in that society to combat this disease. This is the crystal-clear message that I received&#x2014;and I am grateful to the hon. the Minister of Defence for this opportunity&#x2014;when I became acquainted with the civic action programme of the Defence Force which is going on at this very moment on our borders.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>No, I grant that. I am just saying that this was made crystal clear to me when I became acquainted with the programme. Now we come to the question of the protection and indemnification of members of the Defence Force. Clause 8 is a completely new addition to the Defence Act and is concerned with the indemnification of members of the Defence Force when combating terrorism, and with setting up a compensatory mechanism for the public who may become aggrieved because of such action. The problem that this clause tries to cope with is an old one. During the combating of terrorism mistakes are made and accidents do happen. Sometimes, as was evident in the case of Vietnam, people in the service of the USA deliberately committed criminal acts, very often without the knowledge of their superiors. When something like that happens the question is simply: How can the aggrieved party be compensated and the integrity and honour of the Defence Force be protected at the same time? Let me say immediately, Sir, that our high-ranking commanding officers in the Defence Force are men of superior quality in every respect. I have spoken to them and I believe without qualification that they are jealous of the integrity of the Defence Force, that in combating terrorism they would never wilfully command anybody to commit an act which would not be in conformity with his duty, and also that if under their command mistakes are made they will be quite prepared <span class="col_421-422" refersTo="page_0227"/>not to hide anything and to see that justice is done. In fact, I am sure that they would welcome any procedure whereby indemnification can be effected with honour and compensation meted out with justice. But what kind of provisions are made in clause 8? A politician&#x2014;and I do not say this in any derogatory sense because I am one myself&#x2014;who happens to be the Minister of Defence decides that no criminal or civil action can be brought against any member of the Defence Force when he is combating terrorism. This is provided for in the new section 103<i>ter</i>(2). The Minister simply signs a certificate which is conclusive proof that a member of the Defence Force was busy combating terrorism. That is provided for in section 103<i>ter</i>(3). When this certificate has been signed, and on the basis of it, the Minister of Justice tells the court to stop any proceedings against a member of the Defence Force, and no court has any power to review or to declare void or to question the validity of the certificate signed by the Minister of Defence or the Minister of Justice. The onus is then on the aggrieved party to prove that this certificate was not signed by the Minister. So much for the indemnification of the Defence Force, but what about provisions for the compensation of the aggrieved party in this case? He can apply to the Minister in writing giving a full explanation of his problem and the Minister may after consideration compensate him, but if the Minister does not, the Minister will then appoint a compensation board, the chairman of which will have to be a judge or an ex-judge or a magistrate or an ex-magistrate, with not more than three other members, who may be from the Public Service or may be members of the public. The chairman will decide what procedure will be followed by this board. The verdict of the board depends on a majority decision and in some cases the chairman has the casting vote. The court can call any evidence it wants to and if someone fails or refuses to attend or gives false evidence he is liable on conviction to a fine of R200 or three months&#x2019; imprisonment. But the aggrieved party on the other hand has no legal representation; he has no right to call witnesses for his case and no member of the public may attend the proceedings of the board. In any case, the Minister or the board is under no obligation to give reasons for the decision or the recommendation. Sir, I have stated nothing else but what is stated in the clauses mentioned and I repeat this simple question. Is this the way to indemnify with honour and to compensate with justice? I can understand the necessity for a degree of secrecy in these proceedings and one even appreciates the delicacy of the problem but I fail to understand why the ordinary judicial process has to be ignored completely and why the aggrieved has no right to representation or to call witnesses on his own behalf. Above all, I fail to understand, in this whole procedure and its mechanism, how it can operate and redound to the credit and the honour of our Defence Force. Why? I should like to explain this</p>

<p>Apart from anything else I have said about terrorism it is clear that it is above all a political act and its occurrence and the combating of it are clouded with propaganda of the most distorted kind. Thus if this procedure for compensation and indemnification is used there is the possibility, the clear possibility, that whilst the Press of the world is talking about an incident, giving details about it and making defamatory allegations about the Defence Force, we will be meeting completely behind closed doors&#x2014;in some cases this may be completely necessary&#x2014;and there is no way in which the person who is aggrieved can have any representation in that case. Obviously we are going to be landed with a great deal of hostile propaganda in a case like that. The impeccable record of our Defence Force, to which the Minister of Defence referred when he discussed the Angolan situation in the no-confidence debate, will now become the target of hostile propaganda in the eyes of the world and particularly in Africa. So although we appreciate the problem, we cannot support the measures proposed in this Bill to cope with this problem I have just mentioned.</p>

<p>I come to the last aspect which I should like to mention. This concerns the nature of the defence of the Republic of South Africa. This aspect is covered by clauses 1, 3, 6 and 11. What they say is that any member of the Defence Force can be used for the suppression of armed conflict taking place south of the equator if the State President deems such conflict to be a threat to the security of South Africa, and a member has to do this without volunteering; and when he does this he is deemed to be acting in a state of war. These clauses affect the situation by defending South Africa for the purpose of the Defence Act as <span class="col_423-424" refersTo="page_0228"/>Africa south of the equator, by determining that the suppression of armed conflict mentioned above is part of military service in defence of the Republic, and by specifying more clearly the territorial restrictions that coincide with volunteering. I should briefly like to say a word about each of these.</p>

<p>There is a new definition of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; contained in this Bill. The definition of South Africa in the Defence Act has always been an ambiguous one and it has always led to problems of interpretation. We are aware of that. As far back as 1919 we had the court case, in the Appellate Division, of <i>General Life Insurance Co.</i> v. <i>Moyle,</i> where this ambiguity was fully discussed. This particular case also involved a military incident. In 1914 Moyle, who had made a proposal to insure his life with the defendant company, received from the company a letter stating that he would be insured while taking part in military operations in South Africa. Thereafter a policy was issued to him containing a special condition excluding the risk of military service. In 1916 Moyle died of wounds received while on military service in Africa. A claim was made in terms of his policy, and this was refused because of the peculiar conception of Africa in that case that was conformed to on the part of the company. The case then went to the Appellate Division and the judge said that the conception of South Africa used in 1919 for this particular case was Africa south of the equator. Then the learned judge said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under those circumstances and without any evidence it would, one would think, have been difficult for any court to have arrived at the conclusion that the expression &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; included everything south of the equator; that the mouth of the Congo could be properly described as being in South Africa or Lake Tanganyika properly regarded as a South African lake.</block>

<p>Then he reversed the decision on that ground. We were not as fortunate as that in recent times because when we received telephone calls from parents and from interested persons we could not give a clear judgment in this case simply because of the ambiguity in the Defence Act as to what &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; really means. By implication I think the hon. the Minister conceded that they were fighting outside South Africa&#x2019;s borders, by saying that everyone had volunteered.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>But we were not able to give that kind of clear advice. Sir, quite frankly I prefer the old ambiguity of the present Act to the blinding and almost stupendous clarity that this Bill tries to provide. &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; now means Africa south of the equator. In this region we have a number of beleaguered societies, trouble-ridden societies, and for purposes of the Defence Act, by implication we are actually saying they are part of us. With every fairly intelligent human being, I simply ask: In heaven&#x2019;s name, why? When I look at the Bill I can find primarily in terms of the logic of the amendments, three answers to this question, and I want to look quickly at these answers. The first has to do with the whole question of volunteering for service, and this has always been a hot issue in debates in this Parliament since its inception. In fact, in 1957, when the parent Act was accepted, the then Minister of Defence, under strong attack from the official Opposition because of this principle of voluntarism made the following comment. He tried to retain it in the Act, which he successfully did.</p>

<p>*He said (Hansard, Vol. 93, col. 1282)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hon. members will note in Clause 95 where mention is made of defence services that it is proposed to leave the position unchanged as it has been since 1912, namely that citizens may be required to serve within the Union in defence of the Union and that when operations become necessary outside the borders of the Union volunteers will be called for.</block>

<p>Then he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this connection I propose to advance only one argument &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein West also used this argument&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I think that during the past few years we have all consistently agreed in this House that we have always been able to rely on a <span class="col_425-426" refersTo="page_0229"/>sufficient number of volunteers in wartime. Seeing that in terms of this Act there have been enough volunteers in two wars nobody entertains any doubt that in case of possible Communist aggression against South Africa a sufficient number of volunteers will be found in South Africa in the future to go beyond the borders of the Union.</block>

<p>It is interesting that the official Opposition of that time moved an amendment to that legislation which actually tried to prevent the Second Reading. The reason for this was the question of &#x201C;voluntariness&#x201D;, this question whether or not one may cross the borders.</p>

<p>&#x2020; At that time they were not prepared to pass the Second Reading because of this very principle. The whole question of volunteering is that the Minister of Defence in 1957 did not change the principle of volunteering; in fact the present Minister does not change it either. The present Minister simply changes the borders of South Africa and now says, in theory, that one need only volunteer if one is already halfway across Lake Tanganyika. Up to that point, however, one is simply doing military service. I do not think he has calmed the anxiety in the hearts of thousands of parents when he tells them that their sons need no longer worry about volunteering for service south of the equator. I can understand the problem confronting the hon. the Minister because I know there is a need, in a military sense, to move outside the borders of the Republic. A colleague of mine will make recommendations in this respect to show that we are aware of these problems.</p>

<p>The second answer to why this definition is inadequate is linked to what I regard as the controversial aspect of the Bill, given the times and circumstances in which we find ourselves in South Africa at the moment. I am referring to defining as part of the defence of South Africa any armed conflict outside South Africa which is deemed to be a threat to the security and safety of South Africa. Note &#x201C;outside the Republic&#x201D;. This literally means anywhere in the world. It is important to note this&#x2014;anywhere in the world. By this provision we are enabled to intervene in any society where there is armed conflict which we deem&#x2014;irrespective of what they deem&#x2014;to be against the interests or security of South Africa. This is a situation without precedent in international law. My mind grinds to a halt in trying to think of all the diplomatic ramifications of such a position.</p>

<p>Far more disturbing and serious, however, is the international position of our soldiers. I am now asking the hon. the Minister whether there is any clarity about this. When one of our soldiers is taken prisoner in a situation where he is combating or suppressing an armed conflict outside the borders of the Republic, a conflict which is deemed to be a threat to the security of the Republic, does the Geneva Convention apply? How will he be treated? Would he be treated in the same way as the present soldier of South Africa when he is caught? Who will negotiate on his behalf, and in terms of which convention? How will they apply? I think this is a legitimate question, and I would like some reply from the hon. the Minister in this connection.</p>

<p>Equally serious are the implications of this Bill in the present tense and urgent circumstances of our position in Africa and in the world in general. We cannot afford to allow the enemies of South Africa or countries hostile to South Africa, to have any ammunition like this to use as propaganda against us. This is one of the problems. This particular clause of the Bill can be interpreted, despite our intentions to the contrary, as meaning that South Africa does have aggressive and hostile intentions. All these points I have mentioned are directly related to the substantive merits of the argument itself.</p>

<p>There is a final point which I cannot fail to note. This relates to clause 11. This Bill makes absolutely unique and unprecedented provisions, just as Angola was an absolutely unique and unprecedented event, after colonial withdrawal without a Government to take charge and civil war raging. I suspect that we were involved very deeply in that transitional phase although we as members of the public did not exactly know and in which way. We have tried to elicit, as responsibly as possible, information from this Government and we have only been met by abuse. What they have not been willing to discuss openly in debate, they are partially trying to cover up and justify with this legislation, and we refuse to be party to that. Therefore, because there are contradictory principles&#x2014;there are principles which we support in this Bill and there are principles which are ambiguous and questionable&#x2014;I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_427-428" refersTo="page_0230"/>To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the order for the Second Reading of the Defence Amendment Bill [B. 12&#x2014;&#x2019;76] (Assembly) be discharged and that the subject of the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I do so because we believe that in such a committee we can thoroughly discuss all the aspects of the Bill and come to grips with some of the problems I have mentioned.</p>

<p>I wish now to make a personal statement with reference to what the hon. member for Bloemfontein West has said. I have a stepbrother of whom I am the guardian. I have, in fact, been his guardian for the past two years, until he turned 21 on Christmas Day last year. He is in the armoured division of the Defence Force. I do not know where he has been or what he has done. All I know is that I have received notification to send my letters to Grootfontein. I have a fair idea where he has been and what he has been doing. I have been concerned about him. I am sure he is doing the best he can wherever he is. Both of us share a deep affection for our country. I have never pleaded with the Minister of Defence for any special privileges in this respect. I am not interested in obtaining any special privileges. I have tried, however, through my party to get as much information as possible&#x2014;not only for him and for me, but also for the public&#x2014;on what happened there. We were met by abuse. A Day of Prayer was called for and we supported that. We asked the Prime Minister to make a statement the day Parliament opened believing this to be outside the party political sphere. That was refused. If the Prime Minister, at that stage, had introduced the amendment he introduced on Friday I would obviously have voted for it, but the Prime Minister introduced an amendment based on patriotism and the death of people&#x2014;which involves all of us&#x2014;in the presence of this House during the most vicious no-confidence debate this House has seen for a long time. If I ever plan to put my hand up in the future in support of such a motion, in such circumstances I hope it will shrivel up and dry up in front of me.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the course of my speech I shall deal specifically with the amendment of the previous hon. speaker and say what I think about it. At this stage, however, I first want to say a few words about the Bill itself. It is the position that the Defence Act of 1957 was based on the old South African Defence Act of 1913, and that that Act, when it was still contained in the Statute Book, dealt with specific circumstances of warfare as they were known to the legislature in those days. But times have changed since then. South Africa is no longer a member of the Commonwealth. The Great War of 1914, and the Second World War, brought eras in the history of mankind to a close. Africa shook off the yoke of colonialism, but in doing so she also forfeited the involvement and the attendant protection of the military forces of the colonial powers. Russian imperialism, which has been eminent since the days of Czar Peter and Catherine the Great, but which was restricted mainly to Europe, the Near, Middle and Far East up to and including the Second World War, has now openly manifested itself in Southern Africa as well. The smaller countries of the Western community, and the countries of the pro-Western community, have learned a lesson from Vietnam, i.e. that one may perhaps hope for the support of a major power, but one can no longer rely on it. We can put this in another way as well: South Africa, and other countries of Africa as well, should expect and be prepared to defend themselves with their own resources in the event of a military threat. To think that others will rush in to rescue and assist them, would be fatal.</p>

<p>Times have changed, but the greatest change for South Africa in the era after its withdrawal from the Commonwealth and in the post-colonial era is that it is the only power in Southern Africa today which in any way possesses an appreciable defence force. Compared to the USA, Russia, England, France and Germany we are small, but here in Southern Africa South Africa is a military giant. I am not saying that South Africa is a super power; we know that South Africa is not <span class="col_429-430" refersTo="page_0231"/>a super power, but in its part of the world it will make itself felt and will in fact be able to hold the fort when its borders are threatened and an onslaught is made on its political integrity.</p>

<p>Times have also changed as far as the methods of waging war are concerned, the methods by which aggression is committed, and the methods by which vested power is obtained by specific ideologies and States where it did not previously exist. We in South Africa have experienced the cold war for many years. As people who have experienced the cold war, we also observe how Russian imperialism is moving closer as slowly as a glazier: Today it may not be there yet, but tomorrow it is. We in South Africa have come to know terrorism from the earliest days. We also know that wars are no longer declared today and peace is no longer concluded; they simply occur.</p>

<p>Since the hon. the Prime Minister made his speech before the Senate in October 1974, events in Africa have changed with the speed of lightning&#x2014;I believe to the benefit of South Africa. During the past few months we have seen the UNO refusing to adopt resolution against South Africa unless Russia was simultaneously condemned. Very recently we heard the outcome of the Addis Ababa conference of the OAU, at which South Africa, for the first time in many years, was not condemned. We also heard the statement by the Foreign Minister of the Ivory Coast in which he said that the involvement of South Africa in Angola was not aggression. To my mind this spells out one thing only: Not only are they taking a different view of South Africa, but there are also States in Africa, particularly in Southern Africa, that will at any time turn openly, or in secret if need be, to South Africa for defence aid. In view of the lessons of the past year it is very clear that it may be in South Africa&#x2019;s interest to render such assistance. It will in fact be in the defence of South Africa itself if such assistance is rendered, for anyone with the most elementary knowledge of defence knows that if you are able to choose your own front, you are better off then when your enemy chooses the front.</p>

<p>The Amendment Bill before us brings our Defence Act up to date as far as the exigencies of the moment are concerned. I think that we can analyse those exigencies on the basis of our experiences in Angola. It was probably the general expectation that with the withdrawal of the Portuguese from Angola there would for a time be dissension, unrest and shooting among the factions&#x2014;which were already known at the time&#x2014;before one of them gained the upper hand, as we had come to know the process elsewhere in Africa. However, we did not have such tribal fights, such disputes between factions in Angola. When the Portuguese left the minority group, as far as numbers are concerned, had already been supported for a long time by the Russians and the Cubans as far as the preparation of propaganda, political preparation as well as armaments were concerned, and they were in fact almost ready to take over the country. It is very clear that it was not only after the withdrawal of the Portuguese from Angola that Russia and Cuba began to support the MPLA. If there is one piece of evidence to prove this, it was the arms build-up in Angola which we experienced. According to a report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 27 January this year, which came from the newspaper&#x2019;s own correspondent in Luanda, there were sources of information which alleged that there were 56 T34 tanks in the south of Angola and 50 T34 tanks in the north. There were also &#x201C;independent informed sources&#x201D; which spoke of 250 T34 and even T54 tanks&#x2014;the latter being the newer models&#x2014;in brigade strength 60 miles from Nova Lisboa. We also had the privilege of seeing photographs of the 122 mm rocket launcher, a totally effective weapon, especially when it comes to the demoralization of combatants in Africa in particular. According to informed sources there are 100 of these rocket launchers in Angola. For the rest there were 68 light, amphibious tanks, 166 armoured personnel carriers, 301 anti-aircraft guns mounted on armoured vehicles, and 12 000 light, single-barrelled 122 mm rocket launchers. So one can continue. If one considers these figures, one asks oneself whether this is the quantity of weaponry which Russia and Cuba supply to warring factions, or whether they perhaps had other plans in Southern Africa than merely the installation of the MPLA in Angola. At present the southward offensive of the MPLA is undoubtedly directed at Kunene. In actual fact it is an offensive by the Cubans, supported by the Russians, by East Germans and other communist nations from behind the Iron Curtain. Now the question is: When they reach the <span class="col_431-432" refersTo="page_0232"/>South West African border with those tanks and weaponry which I mentioned, are they going to stop, are they going to fall back and simply withdraw from Angola, or will they proceed to attack South West Africa, Zambia and Zaire and enfold the entire southern portion of the continent of Africa in their communist tentacles? That is what is at issue. Perhaps they will not cross the border immediately at the Kunene, but leave it to an advanced guard of Swapo to begin the assault. But they may begin in Za&#x00EF;re or Zambia. They may also state directly from the banks of the Kunene: &#x201C;We shall proceed to install Swapo as the Government in South West Africa as we tried to install the MPLA in Angola.&#x201D; Would it have been far-sighted of this Government and its army advisers first to have waited for such a moment before beginning to take steps to defend the borders of South West Africa?</p>

<p>This brings me to the hon. member for Rondebosch. I must say that when he began to discuss this Bill it almost sounded to me as though we would see an aboutface by the Progrefs here, and that they would support this Bill. However, I knew that this would not be the case. I merely wondered what they were going to base their opposition on. Now it is becoming very apparent what basis they have chosen. Only those aspects which ostensibly constitute short-term political gain for them, are the aspects which they, according to him, will support. He went further and said that they wished to move that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee because of certain other aspects, aspects which in fact contain the essence and spirit of this entire amendment, viz. the prevention or suppression of any conflict outside the Republic which, in the opinion of the State President, is or may be a threat to the security of the Republic, as well as the question of the definition &#x201C;Africa south of the equator&#x201D;. I think there is another reason for this as well, i.e. to try to camouflage a little the attitude of the Progrefs to the defence of South Africa and South West Africa and to South Africa&#x2019;s involvement and its presence in the operational area. I am referring now to their attitude as reflected last week and the previous week in the hon. member for Rondebosch&#x2019;s interview with <i>The Cape Times</i> and in the statements made by them here in the House of Assembly. However, there is nothing which is going to cause more of a backlash against that party than the very standpoint they adopted last week in this House in respect of South Africa&#x2019;s actions in Angola. Last week, and again today, the hon. member for Rondebosch kept well away from what he had said in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 21 January 1976 after he had apparently leaked the information to them that he and a few other M.P.S had paid a short visit to the operational area.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member must relate his argument to the objects of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>I shall return to it in a moment, Sir. I am simply indicating what their attitude is. It is as a result of the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude in respect of clause 1(a), and the fact that they wish to circumvent the problem of conflict outside South Africa that I am referring to their attitude in this regard.</p>

<p>Before the hon. member left for the operational area, he and his party were already firmlyresolved to adhere to their standpoint that they would see or hear nothing which would cause them to abandon their standpoint that South Africa should withdraw unconditionally from Angola, whatever the position was at Calueque, and whatever the position was in regard to Calais and its fugitives. Now respect of the defence, in respect of our deeds in South Africa. In the speech he has just made he again referred briefly to terrorism being the result of the frustrations of people who can do nothing in a community to bring about the changes which they advocate. This is his attitude in this regard, but he raised the same point last week here in this House when he asked what the politicians were doing to safeguard and change the internal situation in order to win and retain the loyalty of everyone in the country, while the military are prepared to offer their lives. He said they asked us here in South Africa, the politicians and the administrators of the country, what hope there was for the urban Black man, the Coloureds and the Black labourers. According to him this is what the military asked him. I want to put it to him that the questions which he quoted here were all sucked out of his thumb; that it was absolute rubbish that some of the military put such questions to him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<p>You implied it.</p>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>He implied it, because he discussed the matter. Mr. Speaker, they did not ask him those questions there, and I still want him to bring me the person who asked him those questions. He sucked all of these things out of his thumb&#x2014;in fact, he put words in the mouth of the military.</p>

<p>With that I wish to conclude with my argument in respect of the attitude they are manifesting with regard to South Africa&#x2019;s actions in the operational area No. 1.</p>

<p>As far as this Bill is concerned, I want to conclude by saying that the exposition of the hon. the Minister was crystal clear, and that there is no reason whatsoever for it to be referred to a Select Committee. In reality this Bill, in view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves at present, should be promulgated as rapidly as possible. The motion of the hon. member for Rondebosch will result in a delay of weeks, even months, ensuing before this legislation will come into operation. This is in fact what he wants. He does not want this Bill to become law, and to be implemented as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill is crystal clear in respect of the purpose for which the S.A. Defence Force may be employed under certain circumstances, as well as the term for which the Defence Force may be employed. I therefore support this Bill in its entirety.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend speaking at very great length on this Bill today, because I believe that there is a great deal of unanimity in regard to the principles contained in it&#x2014;certainly as far as the official Opposition and the Government are concerned. One notes with regret that the Opposition to the official Opposition cannot yet see the reason for this legislation. The Minister is quite correct when he says that the situation that arose in Angola after the withdrawal of the Portuguese and our limited involvement in the conflict which occurred there, has brought a new dimension to the whole political and military set-up in southern Africa. As a result of this it is absolutely necessary that our attention should be drawn towards our defence legislation as it stands at the present time.</p>

<p>Legislation, in spite of amendments brought in from time to time to improve it, legislation in which we have dealt with conscientious objection and national service, is still bound to <span class="col_435-436" refersTo="page_0234"/>the provisions that pertained in 1918 and in 1945 in regard to the volunteering system. It still contains the limitation of the Republic of South Africa. I speak under correction, Mr. Speaker, but I believe that we are one of the few, if not the only country in the world, with a territorial limitation with regard to service in the Defence Force. We believe that there should be no limitation where the security of the Republic is directly threatened, and therefore I support the suggestions made to the hon. Minister of Defence by the hon. member for Durban Point. That is that we should not, in fact, define the Republic of South Africa, as it is defined in subsection (1)(b), as a specific area limited to southern Africa, which, as has been correctly said, can perhaps be used by enemies of our country. The hon. the Minister of Defence, in his Second Reading speech introducing this Bill, mentioned the amendments to section 95, which are contained in subsection (6) of this Bill. We believe this could be adequately dealt with, merely by removing the word &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;, and inserting &#x201C;wherever the security of the Republic is directly threatened&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The rest of the amendments to that clause, and quite a good deal of what is contained in that clause, could then fall away, because the limitation would then be removed. There would be no specific indication of where service would be necessary and it would obviate all our problems. I believe that this is correct. Looking into the background, however, for reasons why this has arisen, I would like to quote here from the latest <i>United States News Digest,</i> from their information service. What Dr. Kissinger says there is, I believe, very pertinent to what applies to southern Africa and to South Africa today. Dr. Kissinger said at a Press conference on 23 December 1975 in regard to the situation in Angola:</p>

<block name="quote">Now, in Angola we are dealing with three factions, none of them very large, none of them very well organized. Without outside support the war would end on a basis that the Organization of African Unity has proposed&#x2014;through some sort of coalition among the local forces. That is all we want. We have no permanent interest in Angola, and I repeat again we have no objection to the MPLA as long as it is an African organization.</block>

<p>I believe that applies to South Africa as well. Then he goes on and he points out that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the United States, for example, accepted without difficulty a pro-Marxist faction&#x2014;Frelimo&#x2014;that came to power by indigenous means in Mozambique. The issue, he emphasized, was not whether a pro-Soviet Union faction was becoming dominant in Angola, but whether the Soviet Union, backed by a Cuban expeditionary force, could impose on two-thirds of the population of newly independent Angola its own brand of Government.</block>

<p>I believe that that is where our objections arose and that is where it becomes necessary to take away the limitations that presently exist in our Defence Act. It is quite amazing how this goes on. Dr. Kissinger went on to say that this, as far as the United States were concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; was a litmus test for national liberation movements within the framework of the world balance of power and the overall process of d&#x00E9;tente between the Soviet Union and the United States.</block>

<p>I would say that it is a litmus test also for the Republic of South Africa in so far as the balance of power in Africa and in the overall process of d&#x00E9;tente in Southern Africa are concerned. I wish to quote finally from this document&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The massive introduction of Cuban troops and Soviet equipment in Angola, for example, does not meet that test. Such a massive intervention does not merely constitute aid for a beleaguered national liberation movement; it is an attempt to impose a solution upon Africans by non-Africans.</block>

<p>It is therefore our duty in this House to see to it that our Defence Force is prepared and able to move at the shortest possible notice to contend with armed conflict in other territories which may threaten our security. It is for that reason that we support this Bill. The Minister also mentioned in his introductory speech the new concept which has been introduced, viz. that of armed conflict. The Minister said that there were no more formal declarations of war; these were something of the past. This is so; this is the way modern wars are fought. Now <span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0235"/>we have the principle of armed conflict in which our forces can take part without full mobilization of the armed forces. It is only in the event of full mobilization that this Parliament may be summoned in terms of section 91 of the Act. We do not wish that Parliament be summoned willy-nilly, for every little action of hot pursuit, but would like some provision included in the Act requiring that where action in excess of hot pursuit takes place, Parliament be summoned and informed. It is extremely difficult, as a public representative, to give the correct answers to people when armed conflict takes place. Everybody seems to imagine that because you have the letters MP after your name, you are the Prime Minister or the Minister of Defence. That is the reason why we would like to have some provision for cases where we are forced into armed conflict to have Parliament called and not only in cases where full mobilization takes place. The hon. member for Bloemfontein West seemed a little concerned that we wish to define terrorism more clearly. I do not think that he need be concerned. We will propose an amendment in the Committee Stage and we can therefore debate the matter there. I believe that our amendment will be a good one and that he will find it acceptable. The questions of the moratorium and the determination of compensation will be dealt with later in this debate by our more erudite legal and financial representatives.</p>

<p>I want now to come to the hon. member for Rondebosch, and also the hon. Senator who has been writing letters to the Press, the hon. Senator Bamford. It would appear that in spite of the low-key manner in which the hon. member for Rondebosch approached this Bill, his party is opposed to doing away with the volunteer system. Certainly the hon. Senator was opposed, in the letters he wrote, to people under 21 years of age serving outside South Africa without their parents&#x2019; consent. That is exactly the same attitude as that of the HNP. People under 21 years of age may not serve outside South Africa&#x2019;s borders without their parents&#x2019; consent. In this connection they quote section 22(6)(A)(a) and section 44(5)(A)(a) while forgetting the other provisions of those sections and the provisions of section 95, which provides clearly that a member of the Defence Force, without specifying his age, may volunteer. The volunteer system, particularly in the case of our border situation, is a totally impossible thing. You can have an army sitting on the border and being attacked from the other side, and before the generals can counter-attack they would have to run around and get everybody to sign that they are willing to volunteer to go over to the other side. I believe that is an impossible situation to ask anybody to be in. The hon. member for Rondebosch mentioned something which I find difficult to accept. He said that the situation in Angola was unique and unprecedented, but in the very next breath he refused to be a party to this Bill and asked for it to be referred to a Select Committee. He has admitted that the situation was unique and unprecedented. But this situation has certainly not ceased to exist. We are no longer involved in it, because we have withdrawn to our borders but the civil war in Angola still goes on. The Cuban and Russian incursion into Angola still goes on. The threat of those forces to use Angola as a spring-board from which to attack South West Africa and the Republic is still there. Is this not unique and unprecedented and as such does it not need unique and unprecedented legislation to deal with that situation. I believe that in his heart of hearts the hon. member for Yeoville agreed with us, and I shall be interested to hear what that hon. member has to say &#x2026;</p>

<p>This is a Bill which I feel, in broad principle, enjoys the unqualified support of all South Africans and people staying in South West Africa, because we all abhor and will fight terrorism in all its manifest variety and forms. It is my conviction that the approval of this amending Bill will achieve three objects: Firstly, it will indicate the will and the firm and unshakeable determination of our people to counter terrorism; the will to contest any attempt to dictate to our people their political future; the will to contest any attempt to disrupt the peaceful coexistence existing in South Africa and our evolution towards a community of nations based on the model of the free world wherein human dignity will reign supreme.</p>

<p>Secondly, it will indicate to the growing number of our friends in Africa that we of the Republic of South Africa and of South West Africa, we who have toiled with the sun of Africa beating down on our backs as we tilled the land, we who have been nourished by the soil of Africa from infancy and know no other fatherland, that we are against the enslavement of Africa by the new neo-colonialists of Russia and Cuba. Thirdly, it will underline the faith this country has in our Prime Minister and in our Minister of Defence, and it will demonstrate convincingly our agreement with their leadership in the immediate past, specifically as regards the action taken regarding d&#x00E9;tente and Angola.&#x2014;Terrorism cannot be effectively combated unless all positive and possible steps are taken to do so; no half-measures will suffice.</p>

<p>*When we study this legislation, we must bear in mind the fact that we must take effective measures to combat terrorism. In order to do this we must look at the objectives of terrorism and analyse them.</p>

<p>It is clear&#x2014;and this is my submission&#x2014;that terrorism has three facets. In the first place there must be a source from which the violence which is inherent in terrorism can arise. In the second place this violence is directed against a specific victim or group of victims. In the third place this violence is aimed at provoking an emotional reaction from certain persons so that their resistance to the aggressor can be destroyed or at least watered down. Keeping these three aspects in mind, I would like to consider the amending Bill more closely.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is clear that there will be and already is a source of violence beyond our borders. It is a fact that 99% of the population of South Africa are satisfied and do not present themselves as a source of violence. For that reason we must take action against the terrorists, even beyond our borders, if this should be necessary. It must, however, be made clear&#x2014;and it is clear, as the record of this Government clearly shows&#x2014;that this involves no aggression whatsoever. We do not threaten any nations in the way that Zambia and Za&#x00EF;re have already been threatened by other powers. However, I want to say that if a farmer has cattle and his neighbour&#x2019;s cattle are destroyed by a leopard and her cubs, he should look to his own safety.</p>

<p>When we consider the victims of terrorism, we should understand one thing very clearly. That is that the victims of terrorism are not chosen according to race or colour. The whole question has nothing to do with racism; on the contrary, we know that there are Black people who have been made victims of terrorism by other Black people. For this reason we must identify our enemies very carefully. The Marxist ideology will always be forced upon an individual who opposes the ideology, whether he is Black, White, Yellow or Brown.</p>

<p>The third aspect is that an attempt is made to create an emotional condition, terror, on the part of the population, in order to bring about mistrust of the State and of the competency of the State to protect the population properly. <span class="col_441-442" refersTo="page_0237"/>There is another aspect to this. An attempt is made to establish the thought amongst certain people that one should not judge the aggressor harshly, so that one can have it both ways. If the aggressor should win, then one will not have antagonized him too much. There are people in this House who are trying to have it both ways and who were not even prepared to second the suggestion of the hon. the Prime Minister. They are not prepared to express their &#x201C;grave concern at the communist aggression in Angola&#x201D;. Are they taking out insurance in advance so that they will not be sought out by the barrel of a Marxist gun? They are not only not prepared to second the words of the hon. the Prime Minister; on the contrary, they vote against his motion. For instance, they do not agree that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;this House directs the Government, in view of these objects and threats, to take all reasonable steps to foil this aggression and to safeguard our country as well as the territories and borders for which we are responsible."</block>

<p>This Bill deals with precisely this part of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s suggestion. What notice should we take of these people&#x2019;s objections to the Defence Amendment Bill, if that is their attitude? I think that in the interests of South Africa we should ignore them.</p>

<p>Because there must be no hesitation in taking <i>bona fide</i> action in the interests of South Africa, it is necessary that clause 8 of the amending Bill be placed on the Statute Book as soon as possible. Anyone who has any idea of how a soldier operates will have no objections against clause 8. After all, terrorists often move about at night and a bullet may be deflected. It is possible for something of this kind to happen. The official Opposition has seen the matter in the right perspective and they agree with us on this aspect, and therefore I shall not enlarge on this any further.</p>

<p>Another aspect has also been mentioned. Objections are made and it is said that the competency and jurisdiction of the courts are being removed in terms of provisions in clause 8 and that everything is now being placed in the hands of the State President, the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Justice. It is very clear that this side of the House has no lack of confidence in our courts. We have the fullest confidence in our courts of law. However, I want to add immediately that as a legal practitioner I do not have the same confidence in the extremely pink legal advisers who are often to be found in Johannesburg. It amazes one at times to see how these people abuse the process of cross-examination to elicit information which in actual fact is quite irrelevant. They are merely intent on supplying information to our enemies. The rules of cross-examination have not necessarily been made for wartime conditions. The object of the Supreme Court rules is that the hearing should take place in the calm atmosphere of peacetime, and the judge is bound by these rules. This is in fact so and therefore I am perfectly satisfied with this particular clause. Furthermore, although the jurisdiction of the courts will be excluded in certain respects, we do not want anyone to suffer financial losses unnecessarily. Therefore the idea of this compensation court is most important, and it has my support as well. The hon. member for Rondebosch spoke about the compensation board and said that one could not even be represented on it and that one went into it blindly. However, this is not so, for if one looks at subsection 9(b) of the new section 103<i>quat,</i> it is quite clear that no person shall be entitled to attend the proceedings of a compensation board or to appear or be represented before a compensation board, except&#x2014;and the hon. member did not read this part&#x2014;with the leave or at the request of such compensation board, or in compliance with a notice. It is quite clear that during the investigation of this compensation board, certain information may be revealed, which is exactly what we wish to prevent by the issuing of the certificate of the hon. the Minister. The hon. member now wants us to admit through the back door those people whom we stopped at the front door by means of issuing this certificate, so that these &#x201C;pink&#x201D; people may be given an opportunity in the compensation court to ask unnecessary questions in order to elicit information. I want to make it quite clear that I am not at all opposed to cross-examination. I am entirely in favour of people being legally represented, but when I am given a choice, my answer is that the safety of the State is the highest authority. I hope that I am making myself very clear. I see that an hon. member on the other side is writing enthusiastically. He will probably try to create the impression that I am against the courts of South Africa, but this is not so.</p>

<p><span class="col_443-444" refersTo="page_0238"/>This Government, the National Party, does indeed realize that sophisticated weapons are necessary in waging a present-day war, that the training of our men must be intensive, that the morale must be high and that we must strike at the enemy as far and as tactically as possible, but we realize above all that a terrorist attack is the first phase of a process of violence which, via guerilla warfare, will eventually develop into conventional warfare. Therefore the House would be neglecting its duty if it did not immediately attack and destroy, with all the power at our disposal, this corner-stone&#x2014;terrorism&#x2014;which could lead to a conventional attack. A conventional war in the framework of Africa and in the framework of the policy of Russia and Cuba can be avoided, provided that one takes decisive and merciless action, hitting as hard as possible in this stage when it is still only a terrorist attack. There is a small group in this country&#x2014;I exclude hon. members who are sitting here&#x2014;and the name of the Herstigte Nasionale Party has been mentioned, who do not agree with this idea. It is the policy of the Herstigte Nasionale Party to send letters and telegrams to the M.P.S telling them to vote against this Bill, since they believe that we should not intervene in Angola, because they are too afraid. I want to mention that from my constituency, in which there are approximately 15 000 people, I received one letter and one telegram. I want to say that the HNP should look to see whether they are still with the people of South Africa. The HNP has never been with the people of South Africa, but honestly, it must be an indication to them of how the people feel. It is high time that the HNP changed their direction and also became patriotic in this respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is obvious from the tenor of the speeches that have been made in the House this afternoon, that we are all well aware of the seriousness and the urgency of the situation which is besetting South Africa. It is with great confidence that we on this side of the House support this Bill, except that we feel it does not go far enough. This country is wedded to the volunteer syndrome and the boundary syndrome as far as the Defence Act is concerned, and the sooner we break away from that the better. The time has come where we know that the whole of the country is involved in war and therefore we cannot waste our time arguing about this and that and other nice legalities. We on this side of the House are behind the Government in bringing forward this Bill and we are not in favour of a Select Committee whereby it would be further delayed. The men in the Army require it for their own good and for their own protection, just as we in South Africa require it for our protection and to help in keeping South Africa going. Both men and women&#x2014;we must remember that we now have women in the Defence Force&#x2014;could quite easily be called up. After all, nurses and other women&#x2019;s auxiliary forces went up North in the last issue and they did a jolly good job in the front line. It was not as if they were in protected services. We shall have to protect those men and women, our sons and daughters, when they are called up to do their stint of duty. I repeat that I support this Bill. In modern warfare, with modern communications by land, sea and air, no boundaries are known and we cannot bind the South African Government or Defence Force to start calling for volunteers. I have my reservations about the volunteer system, because when we are totally involved in armed <span class="col_445-446" refersTo="page_0239"/>conflict or anything similar to that, we come to the question of manpower control, etc., and then there should be no question of volunteers. Because the moment you call for volunteers, you immediately have to start fiddling about with your manpower control in order to keep a balance of power in order to keep the economy going and at the same time to strengthen the sinews of war. [Interjections.] Sir, I maintain that if a man joins the armed services of South Africa, he must know that he is liable to serve in the interests of South Africa anywhere where there may be a threat to the security of South Africa. After all, we in the Republic of South Africa are not a world power; we are not a super power. It is therefore not likely that we will be involved across the oceans. We are an African power and we are very much concerned with what goes on here in Africa, and therefore we cannot bind ourselves to boundaries.</p>

<p>I support this Bill and in order to save time and to give the Senate a chance to get some work done, I will now sit down.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when discussing this Amendment Bill, especially as far as two aspects are concerned, namely the prevention or suppression of any armed conflict outside the Republic which, in the opinion of the State President, is or may be a threat to the security of the Republic and, secondly, the definition of South Africa as &#x201C;Africa south of the equator&#x201D;, there should be no misunderstanding on what the attitude or actions of South Africa would be if its security were threatened and if this were to necessitate actions even far beyond its frontiers. I say there should be no misunderstanding on this issue, and here I agree with the hon. member for Durban Point, when he said that the employment of South Africa&#x2019;s troops outside this area will only take place against international communism. But now I read in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 29 January that the hon. member for Rondebosch, the chief spokesman of the Progrefs on defence matters&#x2014;I am sorry he is not present at the moment&#x2014;adopts the standpoint that this Amendment Bill will create the impression of aggression among the hostile States of Africa. [Interjections.] The hon. member says this is correct. Let us then make it clear to Africa that we have no aggressive aims with this Bill, and let me also inform the hon. member, even that hon. member who now has such a lot to say over there and apparently does not want a turn to speak, that those Africa States who judge the actions of others by their own, will certainly regard this Bill as an act of aggression; because what is there concerning South Africa that these people do not regard as aggression?</p>

<p>But one should also consider the background and the circumstances which led to this Amendment Bill which is now before this House. I want to allege that there is no circumstance, that there is nothing in the policy of South Africa which is or could be the cause for violent conflict between the various States of Africa. And this brings me back to the hon. member for Rondebosch, who insinuated with his remarks that there should be a specific change in the internal situation, a different attitude between peoples, if we want them to support this Bill. With reference to his remark that this Bill will be regarded as a deed of aggression by hostile States in Africa, I also want to ask him whether he is not interested in what the attitude of the friendly States in Africa is, especially in view of what our hon. Minister of Defence, and even the Prime Minister, also said, i.e. that if any of these friendly and non-communist States in Africa were to be threatened and they were to request assistance from our Government, that assistance will be considered on its merits. This, then, is South Africa&#x2019;s answer as to the reason for this Bill. Our attitude and actions should be assured regarding the threat against us, but our friends should also be assured of what our actions will be if they are threatened.</p>

<p>I say we should also consider the background and the events in Africa which make this Bill essential. I am certain that no threat exists in Africa, other than the communist threat, that could give rise to conflicts between the various States. South Africa is part of Africa. Our domestic policy is not the reason for there having to be confrontation and clashes between the independent States and nations of Africa. Indeed, our policy is in fact the guarantee that various nations can coexist peacefully in Africa. Show me a single <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat</i> or any civil war or a single cold-blooded murder of a national leader in Southern Africa, or in the whole of Africa, that was the result of South Africa&#x2019;s policy of separate development, or that was initiated by South Africa&#x2019;s policy. The hon. the Minister and the hon. the Prime Minister said repeatedly that we have no <span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0240"/>territorial claims in Africa. We are there only to guarantee and safeguard that which is our own. The hon. member for Rondebosch used long words to stress the alleged unnecessariness of this Bill if we would only make certain adjustments in South Africa, but I want to tell him that the Russian interest in and penetration into Africa, is not simply a whim or a phenomenon of the moment. It is, indeed, a carefully planned strategy under a long-term policy the object of which is world domination. The communists realized long ago what the potential is of this mighty continent, with its population of almost 300 million people, as trading, military and ideological partners. The object of Russian intervention in Africa is to extend its sphere of influence here so that it can establish these partnerships, even if it is by the subjugation of various nations. This is, after all, not something which has just started; it started a long time ago, as is proved by the history of the Congo.</p>

<p>When the bloody struggle against the Portuguese was commenced by Frelimo 12 years ago, and at the same time by a number of freedom organizations in Angola, which are today embroiled in a bloody civil war, they were already playing that role. And this communist-inspired struggle in Africa against which our troops will possibly have to take action in the future, increased in magnitude and intensity after the termination of the war in Vietnam as the war material which became a surplus and redundant there found its way to the terrorists in Africa, against whom we shall also have to take action in due course. But over and above this potential of Africa as trading, military and ideological partners, Africa also occupies an extremely important strategic position in respect of air and seaborne traffic, if a number of points in Africa can be successfully controlled, which will result in the face of the whole world being changed dramatically. Let me tell you, Sir, that Russia did not discover this now, suddenly, after the Portuguese had left Angola and Mozambique; they have known this for a long time, and prepared themselves a long time ago for these deeds they are at present occupying themselves with in Africa.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am giving you the background which will in all probability make it essential for us in future to take action beyond our borders, and this is why I am trying to find justification for the definition of the borders within which our troops have to operate. The hon. member for Durban Point adopted a certain standpoint in regard to the definition of &#x201C;Africa south of the equator&#x201D;. I have no quarrel with him about where the border should be within which our soldiers should operate.</p>

<p>This same strategic importance of Africa is consequently the reason for Russia&#x2019;s particular interest, for example, in Somalia. Of greater importance, however, is that it is able to cut off the sea routes and therefore the oil supplies of the entire world from there.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>No, not at all. I am in the process of telling the hon. member that the communists are not interested only in Angola. This is a long-term policy which has been carefully planned and the steps which Russia is taking to reach South Africa have already been planned over a long period. That is why I am also referring, <i>inter alia,</i> to Somalia.</p>

<p>Of even greater importance and strategic value are Mozambique on the Indian Ocean and Angola on the Atlantic Ocean. Over and above the influence which Russia is able to exercise from these two points over the two important oceans of the world, it is also able to cast its shadow from thence over the whole of Southern Africa, especially because South Africa is in this particular position that its stable and economically viable Government forms the basis for the maintenance of the balance of power here at the southernmost point of Africa between the two most important oceans of the world, namely the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. It is Russia&#x2019;s aim that this power base should be destroyed.</p>

<p>Russia&#x2019;s presence in Angola is not the result of our policy of separate development, as the hon. member for Rondebosch wanted to suggest. No, it is Russia&#x2019;s desire for world domination, an ideology which was formulated more than a generation before the term &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; met with a response throughout the world. Russia&#x2019;s and Cuba&#x2019;s presence in Angola has nothing to do with the fact that we are defending our border interests there. No, <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0241"/>this is simply the cloak under which it is trying to justify its military intervention in Africa. The statement which I just made is proved by the fact that the Africa states have now split from top to bottom for the first time in the 12 years of the existence of the OAU, and of bitter fulmination against South Africa. Why did a split occur? It did not occur because of colour or racism, which was usually associated with South Africa. No, they split on communism. The intervention of Russia in Angola is the main reason for the split of the African states. In that a very important fact is revealed for South Africa. Two very distinct, distinguishable blocs have developed in Africa, namely a pro-communist bloc and an anti-communist bloc. This division has already been intensified by the accession to power in Mozambique of the outspoken pro-communist, Samora Machel of Frelimo. This is consequently the reason why the MPLA was recognized as the legal government in Angola by a number of African states and communist countries. It is not a matter of South Africa&#x2019;s involvement as hon. members want to suggest so casually and generally. The slavish obligation to recognize a communist government in Angola existed long before South Africa was mentioned, because the world problem with international communism is that where it has taken root as an ideology, it refuses to let go. Its essence and aspiration is to imperialistic conquest of the whole world, towards the subjugation of the whole world. It is interesting and striking that of all countries, with the exclusion of South Africa, it is China that repeatedly warned against the dangers of Russian imperialism which does not have an eye only on Angola or the Continent of Africa with a view to subjugation, but eye on global conquest.</p>

<p>With this real closeness of the communists to our borders and this real threat, South Africa has no other choice than to live in the present time with its realities and to prepare for the future in a purposeful and meaningful manner.</p>

<p>This Amendment Bill, which is before this House today, is one of the ways in which South Africa is preparing itself purposefully and meaningfully for the future. The fact that we will in all probability have to deal with this communist threat on a larger scale in the future is sufficient reason for me to give my ready support to this Amendment Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. Just be patient, old man, and relax. I just want to get the situation quite clear as far as the Monroe Doctrine is concerned. I have been pleading for a Monroe type doctrine for Africa, not for just a short while, but for many years. The basic concept of it is that the affairs of Africa should be decided by Africans, whether they are White or Black, and that the major powers or super powers be kept out of Africa with their arms so as not to create spheres of influence here. If this had been done in Africa years ago, we would now have had a situation in terms of which the OAU could well have met and said they did not want Cuba and Russia to intervene because this goes contrary to such a doctrine. The Monroe Doctrine does not involve sending armies all over Africa, as the hon. member for Pretoria West seemed to suggest. For his benefit, I want to read to him a short passage to demonstrate what the Monroe Doctrine is. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principles of President Monroe, as the message was referred to in Congress, consist of three openly proclaimed dicta: No further European colonization in the new world &#x2026;</block>

<p>I take it he agrees with that as far as Africa is concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; abstention of the United States from the political affairs of Europe and non-intervention of Europe in the Governments of the American hemisphere.</block>

<p>Those are the three principles which were originally laid down, and the fourth one, <span class="col_451-452" refersTo="page_0242"/>which only came into existence many years later, in 1869, was that the United States opposed the transfer of any existing European colonies from one European sovereign to another. The concept of other powers keeping out of Africa, and leaving the affairs of Africa to Africans, is one which I do not believe anyone in this House disagrees with.</p>

<p>No, I shall deal with you later. I want to come back specifically to some of the provisions of this Bill. The hon. member for Rondebosch has asked that this particular measure go to a Select Committee, and I think one could motivate this case in a number of ways.</p>

<p>I should like to start with the provisions of the Moratorium Act, which it is sought to amend here. I venture to suggest that the hon. the Minister will agree with me&#x2014;the hon. member for Durban Point certainly agrees with me&#x2014;that this particular measure does not go far enough. I could give other examples, over and beyond those given by the hon. member for Durban Point, in relation to this particular matter, for example the issue of forfeiture provisions and their existence and implementation after the moratorium period. There is also the question of the accumulation of debt which, in fact, arises when, after the period of the Act, one has to pay the whole amount. So one could go on and suggest that the Moratorium Act amendments, which are contained here, in fact do not go far enough. Much more is required. In exactly the same way clause 9, which deals with the disablement of soldiers, can be mentioned. I venture to suggest&#x2014;I know that there are ex-service organizations which have the same view&#x2014;that the present provisions in respect of pensions, disablement and many related matters are utterly out of date and need substantial amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>These are all matters which can be introduced into this piece of legislation if you want to because you can in fact broaden it if you do not accept the Second Reading of the Bill and refer it to a Select Committee. In the same way as you can amend the Moratorium Act in the Defence Amendment Bill, so you can deal with all of these matters. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that there are in fact, sitting around here on the benches of this House, members on all sides who have considerable experience of these matters, who know what the problems are and who can make very substantial contributions in a Select Committee to this particular matter. Even on these grounds, which are not grounds which are in dispute, one can make out a very substantial case for a Select Committee.</p>

<p>Let me deal with the indemnity provisions. Again, when debate takes place, there are distortions as to what our attitude is. We in these benches recognize that in certain circumstances it is not in the national interest to have litigation about matters which may affect the national interest. We accept that; we do not dispute that and we do not argue with that principle. We also accept that you must compensate. However, what many of the members sitting in these benches I think are known for is that we do not believe that you must in fact create machinery which is of such a nature that fundamental principles of the rule of law are ignored. Whereas we shall support the hon. the Minister in the principle that there must be machinery, we believe that there must be machinery which in fact gives a man a fair chance to put his case. There cannot be a fair case when a man has no right to lead evidence. There cannot be a fair case when he has no right to have his case argued on his behalf. Under these circumstances there cannot be justice done and this is not what is necessary to safeguard the security of the State. We shall move detailed amendments which will not in fact embarrass the hon. the Minister in so far as national security is concerned but will see to it that in fact justice is done.</p>

<p>Let me put another point to the hon. the Minister. I wonder whether he has considered it. In this particular provision he has sought to take both crime and civil remedy away from the courts. Has he had a look at the provisions of the schedule to the Military Disciplinary Code and the other provisions of the Act in order to see whether crime can then be adequately punished by the military courts? I do not think he has because if one examines it, it is clear that once you take this away from the courts there is not an adequate remedy to take <span class="col_453-454" refersTo="page_0243"/>its place. I believe that the hon. the Minister does not want to have crimes go unpunished, and that the purpose of this legislation is not to have crimes go unpunished, but to protect purely the security of the State and the national interest in circumstances when it may not be in the interest of the State as such that a matter be heard in open court. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that it is fundamental that a subject of the State has a remedy, has the right to be heard, has a right to lead evidence, has a right to cross-examine and has a right to argue his own case. The hon. the Minister has a duty to see that these fundamental rights are observed when he seeks to take matters away from the courts in circumstances such as these.</p>

<p>Let me deal with another matter which I think is perhaps the most important part of this debate. We find in this particular debate again the endeavour to use the tactic of the smear. Make no mistake; it comes from both the left and the right here; it comes from both sides.</p>

<p>If the hon. members want to serve the national interest, then they will have to ask themselves whether in fact these games which are being played here are in the interest of the defence of South Africa. I want to say here and now, so that there is no misunderstanding between us, that I believe that the heads of the army and all our forces are tremendously concerned that there should not be political division in the army because that is not in the interests of South Africa. I do not believe that any terrorist is going to ask whether the bullet that he fires is going to hit a member of the Nationalist Party, a member of the United Party, a member of the PRP or, for that matter, a member of the HNP, the party to which that hon. member almost belonged. When you start sowing this suspicion about loyalty, you must remember that there are the sons of members of the PRP and there are members of the PRP who serve in the army and the other forces. [Interjections.] Those people who talk here and seek to destroy in fact the loyalty that exists &#x2026;</p>

<p>I do not think I want to waste even a moment of time on that gentleman sitting on the back-bench there. What is being done here is the issue I think this House has to consider today.</p>

<p>However, I want to refer to another matter. Is it in the interests of South Africa when doubts are cast on the loyalty of the leader of this party in respect of information? Is that in the interests of South Africa? What do hon. members think people belonging to the PRP are going to think about this when they are participating in the defence of South Africa? [Interjections.] Is this in the interests of South Africa? I want to say that I believe that, whereas the hon. the Minister&#x2014;he can reply to this&#x2014;may differ very substantially from us who sit in these benches, I do not believe that the hon. the Minister of Defence would like to have political issues, which affect his forces, raised in this House. I do not think it is in the interests of South Africa that such sowing of dissension should take place. I believe that that amounts to sabotage of the worst kind.</p>

<p>Let me deal with some other matters specifically concerned with this Bill. As I have indicated, the Bill deals with a number of principles and I should like to come back again to the issue of the defence of South Africa. We in these benches believe the Republic must be defended, that terrorism must be stamped out and also that the people of South Africa must serve to achieve these ends. Let me go further: I believe that not only White citizens must defend South Africa, but that all citizens, irrespective of their colour, should defend South Africa and should have a feeling that they have something to defend in South Africa. In as far as South Africa is to be defended and terrorism is to be stamped out, we accept that there should be conscription. We also accept that in particular circumstances&#x2014;here one has to tread warily because these are international political issues&#x2014;there may have to be hot pursuit. The examples that were given in this regard, viz. that you obviously cannot ask for the consent of the people as you are crossing a river or a border, speak for themselves and do not need to be mentioned again. Therefore, the fact that the concept of hot pursuit is included, is something we obviously accept. However, as I have said, one has to handle this very carefully and very diplomatically; there will not always be hot pursuit because sometimes the interests of South Africa, internationally, may require a political decision rather than a military one. We also accept that there may have to be anticipatory action taken in certain circumstances and that, therefore, the power may have to be given to make this possible. I think one must be in a position to prevent attack. In a war retaliatory action may also be required. One cannot, when under attack, suddenly say: &#x201C;Here is the border; this is where we stop.&#x201D; One accepts that in all such instances and under such circumstances there can be conscription. There already is a definition in the Act which deals with the defence of South Africa and which also deals with a situation which hon. members opposite appear to be overlooking, as there is already provision in the Act for us to come to the assistance of other States with which we have agreements.</p>

<p>So much for the question of where one should be defending South Africa and where one should be conscripted in order to defend South Africa. I think we also have to make it clear that we as a country have no territorial ambitions in Africa. I am speaking of Africa as a whole and not only of Southern Africa in that context. What worries one&#x2014;here, again, one must tread delicately&#x2014;is that one must not create the impression that the Act is being amended in order to enable us to expand. I am satisfied that the hon. the Minister, the Government and the Nationalist Party, have no territorial ambitions but make no mistake, this sort of thing can be exploited by enemies of South Africa and one would not wish to see it being so exploited. What happens when one wants to go on a military expedition elsewhere? Should one then use people who have been conscripted, or should one then use volunteers or the professional army? We in these benches believe that in the case of such ventures, volunteers or the professional army should be used. We do not believe, however, that the Defence Department or the Army should be hamstrung. For that reason I want to indicate to the hon. the Minister that we have also drafted a definition of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;. Perhaps I should read it at this point so that the hon. the Minister can consider it. We would move for the deletion of the words &#x201C;south of the equator&#x201D; in the definition and substitute the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Republic of South Africa and areas adjacent to the borders of the Republic in <span class="col_457-458" refersTo="page_0245"/>which the South African Defence Force may be operating in hot pursuit of armed forces or terrorists who have previously entered the Republic or in which forces who have attacked or which it is reasonably believed intend to attack the Republic are present.</block>

<p>We think that that will cover the situation and will give all the scope that may be required. There are many relevant examples, even after the Second World War. It was volunteers who took part in the Berlin airlift and it was volunteers who went to Korea. We believe&#x2014;I regret to say I cannot agree with the hon. member for Durban Point&#x2014;that there cannot now be conscription to serve anywhere in the world. We believe that, where the defence of South Africa is concerned, you will have no difficulty in uniting your people, but we also believe that, when it comes to going outside South Africa, i.e. beyond the limits I have indicated here as the limits required for the defence of our country, volunteers should be used. This is how we view this matter. We believe that this is practical and realistic. We believe that in these sorts of conditions there will be almost unanimous agreement on this point. I do not think there will be any disagreement on the proposed amendment which I have suggested. Some people, such as the hon. member for Durban Point, may want to go further&#x2014;the hon. the Minister wants to go to the equator&#x2014;but in our view it is reasonable that conscripts are used within these limits and that, beyond the limits, volunteers and professional soldiers should be used.</p>

<p>There is a final matter with which I want to conclude. I think that the fact that the patriotism of people is queried in this House, is a disservice to South Africa and a disservice to the armed forces. I think it can only harm South Africa. I believe that what is required, in this type of debate, is an entirely different spirit. A while ago I was challenged by the hon. member for Rustenburg, who has disappeared since, to express my attitude towards the motion put by the hon. the Prime Minister on Friday. I want to say here and now&#x2014;the hon. member for Rondebosch said the same thing&#x2014;that the hon. the Prime Minister has no quarrel with us on that point. Let me say in what respect we do have a quarrel with him. What worries me and is perhaps the reason why I tore my heart out while I sat in these benches, is that I have to find myself in a situation where I believe in something, but know it to be a game and a trick that is being played in a way to embarrass us. [Interjections.] I make no excuse for the fact that when there is something that I believe to be right, I may feel hurt that I cannot vote for it. The hon. member for Rondebosch has the same view and I think the members sitting in these benches all have that view. If you want to move a motion &#x2026;</p>

That, with respect, is the way in which one can bring about unity in South Africa and have your people united behind you in the defence of South Africa. We find ourselves in the situation that, despite being called people who want to play with communists by an hon. member on that side and despite being tarnished with a red brush by that un &#x2026;&#x2014;I was going to say something unparliamentary&#x2014;by the hon. member for Umhlanga, we have to show that we are prepared to participate in the defence of South Africa and that is not in the interests of the Defence Force or of our people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in this debate, which has probably brought a greater measure of unanimity into this House than other debates we have had, a few astonishing statements were nevertheless made. While we were discussing military matters, I gained the impression that the hon. member for Yeoville was trying very hard to throw up smoke-screens in this House this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="col_459-460" refersTo="page_0246"/>The hon. member for Yeoville agrees with us about the communist threat, and I shall be glad if he will listen now. He agrees with us about the communist threat, but the other day when he had to vote on an amendment to this effect, he, together with his party, voted against it. Now he calls it a political game. I am wondering now whether it was also a political game last year when he left the United Party on a similar motion. Could it have been a game on his part or on the part of the Government?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite clear that the hon. member for Yeoville is throwing up smoke screens this afternoon to hide his own embarrassment and that of his party. He refers to the embarrassment of the Opposition and of the Leader of the Opposition as a result of an amendment moved by the Prime Minister, while it was quite clear to everyone in this House where the embarrassment was when the amendment was put to the vote on Friday. Without any doubt, it was the hon. member for Yeoville in particular who was embarrassed.</p>

<p>He referred to the question of patriotism and spoke about people who impair the loyalty of the Army. At the same time his party and he himself are the only people who differ sharply from the Government and from the rest of this House on the introduction of a very essential Bill such as this one. Now, who is trying to cause division and foment dissension? I should like to know that from him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch said in this House today that terrorism actually represents or show up disease symptoms in a community. I should like to know from the hon. members for Yeoville and Houghton whether they agree with this statement: Do you agree that terrorism represents disease symptoms in a community or in national life? Mr. Speaker, they do not want to answer. I think they probably realize what is coming. I should also like to know whether the disease symptoms are characteristic of the Israeli community, which is also subject to terrorist attacks over an even far longer period than South Africa. I should like to know this from the hon. members for Houghton and Yeoville and from their party.</p>

<speech by="#ungerer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>Smoke screens such as I have seldom seen were thrown up here this afternoon, but some glimmers of truth have shone very strongly through those smoke screens. Therefore, I can understand very well the embarrassment and the concern of the hon. member for Yeoville at what those belonging to his party must think about the questioning of their leader&#x2019;s secrecy. I can understand very well that it means a problem for and an embarrassment to him.</p>

<p>However, I leave the matter at that because I want to go further. We are dealing here with legislation which has most decidedly become very essential under our particular circumstances. The legislation provides our Defence Force with the protection it needs to take action against terrorist activities and internal riots. It is a good thing that this protection is being given to our men, because they will otherwise hesitate to take action when they have to and we know that our enemies will not hesitate to hit back. The legislation also protects the public, and it is a good thing that this is so. Particularly when it comes to the combating of terrorism in any operation area, it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish between terrorists and non-terrorists. For that reason it is a good thing that the legislation also protects the general public. The Bill also provides greater flexibility to the powers of the Minister of Defence than existed before to call up people for military service. This is a good thing, too, because it is a fact that energetic, quick and prepared action, particularly in view of the combating of terrorism, is of the utmost importance. It is essential and it is a good thing that the Minister receives those powers, which enables him to take the most energetic and rapid action and to offer resistance.</p>

<p>Finally, the Bill also extends our operational area in great measure. I want to add immediately that I am sympathetic towards the standpoint adopted by the hon. member for Durban Point. He is of the opinion that the operational area should not be subject to any restrictions whatsoever. In the world in which we are living today and under the particular circumstances in which South Africa finds itself, it has become necessary that there should be no restrictions on the movements or <span class="col_461-462" refersTo="page_0247"/>on the operational area of the South African Defence Force. We have a task to fulfil in Southern Africa, and even in Africa, and for that reason it is a good thing that this Bill has been introduced to enable us to fulfill that task well. With the disappearance of colonial powers from Africa, South Africa has become the natural leader in Africa, particularly in view of its technological&#x2014;scientific superiority or knowledge.</p>

<p>Let us pause for a moment and consider the lessons we can learn from history. In the first place, it is a fact that numbers may sometimes be of a decisive nature, but it is equally true that small nations have made indelible impressions on the world scene in the past. We are one of those small nations. On the other hand, history teaches us that every significant civilization in the past, on every continent, had to be backed, supported and protected by military power. It is also a fact that one can say without fear of contradiction that the Republic of South Africa represents the only significant civilization on the continent of Africa. For that reason we are subject to what I shall call this basic truth, i.e. that any significant civilization on every continent had to be supported and protected by military power in the past.</p>

<p>This Government has appreciated this truth well in time and has, at an increasing rate, always tried to render and maintain South Africa&#x2019;s preparedness as effectively as possible. I think I can say without fear of contradiction that, at the moment, South Africa is as prepared as before never in history in time of peace.</p>

<p>I also want to tell you that it is with pride that we take notice of the fact that the morale of the men of the South African Defence Force is as high as it can possibly be, that our standard of training is the highest in the world, that it compares favourably with that of any country in the free world, and that it even compares favourably with the standard of training of the strongly motivated Israeli defence force, which is generally regarded as the most prepared and best motivated nation in the world today. We have had evidence in this regard from people who became closely acquainted with the activities of our men on the border. I personally have gathered evidence on that score&#x2014;not in the operational area, but in a training area&#x2014;when I visited my former regiment recently and found that these people are motivated in such a way now that, while they were sometimes bored in the past, these men are now doing everything possible to carry out their operations as realistically as possible, and in the finest detail.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the standard of training and the morale of men in any defence force are subject to inter-action. If a person enjoys a high standard of training, it tends to enhance his morale. On the other hand, a person with a high morale is able to achieve a higher standard of training than men who are not motivated. I think it can be accepted without any doubt that the men of the South African Defence Force have already shown their mettle in Angola. Therefore, it is a fact that the hon. the Prime Minister could quite rightly and with acclaim say: &#x201C;Think the Lord, the people of South Africa are prepared to fulfil and are capable of fulfilling their task in Africa.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What is their task in Africa which this Bill in particular enables them to fulfil? Linked up with this thought of being the only significant civilization on the continent of Africa, there is another historic fact we should like to dwell on for a moment, i.e. that the continents of Asia, Europe and America were the bearers of the standard of civilization of the world in different times and under different nationalities. And the day when it is Africa&#x2019;s turn it will automatically be the case that the Republic of South Africa will have to fulfil that task as the only significant civilization on the continent of Africa. I want to say that the day is not far off when this will in fact happen. I also want to say, and I do not say this in an unkindly spirit, that the leading country of the West, America, has failed in the task of leading the West against the surging and evidently unstoppable imperialism of Russian Communism. It is a fact that the free world, i.e. the West and, together with them, America has retreated reluctantly before Russian imperialism over the past decades. The hon. the Prime Minister said quite rightly that we had learned one lesson from Angola&#x2014;that when the worst comes to the worst, we shall stand alone in Africa. I am sympathetic towards the standpoint of the hon. member for Yeoville that Africa should solve its own problems. This is also the standpoint of this side of the House, and it is also the standpoint of Africa as a whole.</p>

<p>After all, we have had evidence that, after the outstanding performance of our men in Angola, Africa has greater respect for South <span class="col_463-464" refersTo="page_0248"/>Africa. Surely, it is also a fact that Africa is already splitting into a non-communist and a communist bloc as has been pointed out by the hon. member for Parys with great dignity some time ago. It is a fact that we find ourselves on the eve of an era in which South Africa will probably have to assume the leadership of the non-communist bloc in Africa to keep communist imperialism, particularly Russian imperialism, out of Africa. It may be our responsibility to help Africa to escape from the strangle-hold Russia is trying to apply to it. For that reason we need this Bill and everything it implies to enable us to fulfil this task. I should like to support this Bill with acclaim.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the hon. member for Sasolburg will excuse me if I do not follow him directly as he has dealt more with the broad assessment of our country&#x2019;s responsibilities in Africa than with the Bill that is before the House. Before I attend to the Bill as such I have a few questions which I would like to direct towards the hon. member for Yeoville. I think he said in his speech that the Prime Minister played a game at the end of the No-confidence Debate this year and that he played the same game at the end of the No-confidence Debate last year. If that is so, I would like to ask him why he fell for this game last year.</p>

<p>That is no answer to my question. I think the answer is quite clear that the hon. member did fall for the game last year. There is a second question I want to put to the hon. member.

<p>The answer is clear. The hon. member has no answer as to why his party did not call for a division if he wanted to prove that. I will tell him why his party did not call for a division. It is because there was division amongst themselves. They dared not call for a division. The final question I want to put to the hon. member for Yeoville is this: His leader raised a point of order against the Prime Minister that the amendment was irrelevant to the no-confidence motion moved by my leader. If his party considered that the amendment of the Prime Minister was irrelevant, why then did they not vote for it?</p>

<p>I can tell you that the reason why they did not vote for it was that some would have voted for it and some would not have voted for it. [Interjections.] To get down to the Bill itself, there are certain aspects of the Bill which are a cause of concern to us. Basically we have three objections. Firstly, we object to the drawing of a line regarding service and the definition of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; itself. Secondly, we have certain objections in regard to the indemnity and the compensation board clauses. Thirdly, we have certain objections to service being considered as being in order to prevent armed conflict outside the Republic. I want to elaborate on some of these objections which have been mentioned in passing by the hon. member for Durban Point. First of all, I would like to deal with the indemnity clause. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions in regard to this particular clause. The purpose of these questions is to clarify the particular points before we go into Committee. In subsection (2) of the proposed new section 103<i>ter</i> the words &#x201C;or done in good faith&#x201D; are used in the English text. To me these words are disjunctive in relation to the words which precede them, namely the words &#x201C;advised, commanded, ordered, directed&#x201D;. If that is so, the English text will read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(2) &#x2026; any &#x2026; person in the service of the State by reason of any act&#x2026; done in good faith by the State President&#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, the whole question of being advised, commanded, ordered or directed is taken out of the context of the subsection itself. If one looks at the Afrikaans text, it seems as if it does not indicate the same thing. I believe that there is a mistake and it is very <span class="col_465-466" refersTo="page_0249"/>important that we should know whether there is a mistake or not. If the words &#x201C;any act done in good faith&#x201D; are taken in isolation, it would mean that it would cover a far broader field than using it conjunctively with the words &#x201C;advised, commanded, ordered, directed&#x201D;. I believe that before we go into the Committee Stage and before we vote on the Second Reading of the Bill, we should know from the hon. the Minister whether that is his intention or whether there is a mistake in the English text. We believe that even if there is a mistake and a test has to be carried out as to whether an act was done in good faith&#x2014;these words will still remain there&#x2014;then in terms of subsection (5) of the proposed new section 103<i>ter</i>, the test has to be applied by the State President We believe that this is wrong.</p>

<p>Are you referring to subsection (2)?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to subsection (2) of section 103<i>ter</i> which is added by clause 8 of the Bill.</p>

<p>I shall now deal with the basic test to find out whether an act was done in good faith or not. In terms of subsection (5)&#x2014;the hon. the Minister will follow me if he looks at subsection (5)&#x2014;this test is to be carried out by the State President. We believe that this is wrong because, in view of the arbitrary nature of a test of good faith, the presence or absence of good faith should be considered by some person who is schooled in the impartiality of the law. The people of South Africa should see that the impartiality of the law is in fact being applied in this test. We would suggest that such a person could be an attorney-general, for instance, as he has by the nature of his office, training and background, an eminent suitability to bring about a just finding as to a test of whether an act was done in good faith. We believe that the proposed sections 103<i>ter</i> and <i>103qual</i> contain drastic provisions. I would refer the House to subsection (7)(a) of section <i>103ter</i> which provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No court shall have power to review, set aside or declare to be void or otherwise question the validity of any certificate &#x2026;</block>

<p>This in itself is an immensely drastic provision. It is the substitution of a <i>quasi</i>-judicial procedure for the normal legal process for obtaining retribution for loss. This in fact applies a form of total moratorium for service personnel with regard to normally accepted contraventions of our civil and criminal law. We accept, however, that there is a need for such a form of legislation under the present circumstances prevailing in the South African situation. An eminent South African jurist as long ago as 1915 said the following with regard to martial law&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is an inherent right in every state as in every individual to use all means at its disposal to defend itself when its existence is at stake. When the force upon which the courts depend and upon which the Constitution is based is itself challenged, under such circumstances the State may be compelled by necessity to disregard for a time the ordinary safeguards of liberty in defence of liberty itself, and to substitute for the careful and deliberate procedure of the law, a machinery more drastic and speedy in order to cope with an urgent danger.</block>

<p>I believe that under our present circumstances in South Africa it is not possible to apply martial law but that this type of operation that we are now discussing today is in fact on very similar bases. This Bill is not temporary like martial law. This Bill is going to be incorporated into our Defence Act and will remain as a permanency. Therefore, we must examine the principles extremely carefully. We must call for the greatest measure of objectivity as possible, and for all reasonable precautions to be taken to see that the objects of the Bill are examined during its operation and that it follows as nearly as possible a court process basis. In this regard I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister a question. Is there any similar provision anywhere which applies to service in the prevention or suppression of internal disorder? I believe that these provisions of section 103<i>ter</i> and <i>quat</i> only apply in respect of the suppression of terrorism. But there does not seem to be any provision anywhere which applies in respect of the prevention or suppression of internal disorder. If this is not so and if there are no other provisions applying for that form of service in the defence of the Republic, could the hon. the Minister please explain to this House why.</p>

<p>With regard to the Compensation Board we agree broadly with the institution of such a <span class="col_467-468" refersTo="page_0250"/>board. We are unable to accept, however, that the Minister of Defence sets up this board. We suggest that the hon. the Minister of Justice should do this, not because we have much confidence in him or that we believe he is better than the hon. the Minister of Defence. We also have little confidence in the latter Minister and I shall tell him why this is so. This is because he admitted in his Second Reading speech here this afternoon that he himself has little faith in the change in the Bill which draws a hypothetical line along the equator. How can we have faith in a Defence Minister who comes forward with a Bill and then says he has got little faith in it?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>To get back to my point, let me say we believe that the Minister of Justice is the best man for this particular function of appointing a board. After all, the board is a <i>quasi</i>-judicial board and his function is in a judicial field and we believe that he is more qualified to put together a board than the hon. the Minister of Defence.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we also do not like the procedures laid down in terms of subsection 5 of the new section 103<i>quat.</i> We believe that there should be continuity. The wording of the Bill indicates that there will from time to time be different boards appointed. On each occasion the chairman of that particular board is entitled in terms of subsection 5 of 1<i>03quat</i> to define what form of procedures he is going to operate under. We believe that this is wrong, that there should be some form of certainty in the minds of the people as to what procedures are going to be followed and that there should be some form of continuity between each board as it is composed so that they know that they will have certain rules and procedures which they will have to follow. We would suggest, that the hon. the Minister of Justice should by regulation set up a standard form of regulations so that the compensation boards could follow those regulations. There are also precedence for compensation boards with regard to similar types of regulations. As the hon. member of Durban Point has mentioned, we cannot accept subsection 9(b). This subsection is totally unacceptable to us. I think the hon. the Minister will know why I think that he actually knows that it is unacceptable to us. We do not believe it is right that a claimant&#x2014;not a member of the force, but a claimant&#x2014;cannot attend a court hearing as of right. It is wrong that he should not be allowed to make verbal representations and to question witnesses or to have legal representation there. As I have said previously, these are drastic measures and we should try to follow normal legal procedures as far as possible. I do not believe that if our suggestion is carried into operation, it will detrimentally affect the Defence Force. The claimant by the nature of things in terms of this proposed Compensation Board will usually be a member of the public and not a member of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words about the drawing of a line, the line of the equator suggested in clause 1 of the Bill. No line can be drawn. I agree that as the Act stands at present it is impossible legally to define South Africa as used in terms of section 95 of the Act. Section 95 of the Act <i>inter alia</i> reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A member of the South African Defence Force may be required in time of war to perform service against an enemy anywhere in South Africa, whether within or outside the Republic&#x2026;</block>

<p>Obviously we have a void here. The words &#x201C;South Africa,&#x201D; if not defined in the Act, has really no true meaning. Section 95 deals with the territorial restrictions on the employment of defence forces in times of war. The principle of territorial restriction is vital for a discussion as to the identification of what in fact is South Africa. Either we leave the Act as it stands at present or we try and draw lines, or we delete section 95 altogether. If we leave the Act as it stands now it becomes completely meaningless. South Africa is not defined. If we try and draw lines we are in a hopeless situation. Does the hon. the Minister know where the equator goes? It runs right through the centre of Za&#x00EF;re. I wonder if anybody knows exactly where the equator is.</p>

<p>Yes, it goes through the bar of the White Rhino Hotel. I do not know whether it is on the far side of the counter or this side of it. We are always going to have problems with the drawing of lines. If we were to knock out section 95 of the Act, and have no provision in the Act at all for territorial restrictions, our Defence Forces will be subject to service anywhere in defence of the country in which they live and to which they owe their loyalty. I cannot conceive, in this day and age, of any defence force, in this rapidly constricting world of ours, which would hamstring its operations in such an anachronistic manner as we do in this country. I put it to members of this House that if they were military commanders, with the intent of utilizing their forces to the maximum of their ability, would they like to have placed on them a restriction like this, i.e. that at any time they would not know how many forces they would have at their disposal?</p>

<p>I believe that this is a terrible situation. The only answer lies in removing this historical albatross from around our necks. We should remedy the situation now and not wait for another day before doing so.</p>

<p>The proposal of the extension of the definition of &#x201C;service in defence of the Republic for the prevention or suppression of armed conflict outside the Republic&#x201D; is also an extremely drastic and far-reaching measure. The use of our forces, in such a form of operation, can obviously be done without the necessity for a general mobilization. It is only in terms of a general mobilization that Parliament can be called together in order to discuss the action taken by the Government of the day. We will agree with this measure if it is passed, but only on condition that it must also be subject to the same principles of a general mobilization, in other words that the Parliament of South Africa should be informed and should be afforded the opportunity of discussing the decision of the Government to take steps in terms of this new definition of service in the defence of our country. We would like to know from the hon. the Minister what his views are on the question of convening Parliament if, particularly, we have no territorial restrictions on the use of our forces, as we have suggested, and we accept that the extended definition of service in the defence of the Republic be added to the Act.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. GREEFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the speech by the hon. member for East London City, who has just resumed his seat, was aimed more at putting certain questions to the hon. the Minister. I am therefore not going to react at length to what he said. However, as far as the defining of frontiers is concerned, where we are dealing with the definition of South Africa, I tend to agree with the hon. member for Durban Point and the hon. member for East London City. My personal opinion is that it would be better for us rather to begin omitting mention of the borders when issues such as the one we are dealing with at present, are at stake.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the world has become very small in this century of speed we are living in. It is clear that we no longer fight wars on horseback and that cannons are no longer drawn by horses. That is why it is essential that we take this fully into account when we are dealing with the defence of our country and that we should not decide to limit ourselves to a defined area, namely South Africa. However, I know that this aspect will be dealt with in the next stage of the Bill.</p>

<p>The stability and the peace and quiet in this country which have been brought about by legislation introduced by the National Party over the past 26 years has almost caused us to forget&#x2014;I say this with all respect&#x2014;to look at certain Acts and to adapt them to today&#x2019;s circumstances. Owing to circumstances which have virtually been forced on us, viz. the events around us and to the north of our borders, we have suddenly woken up and decided that certain aspects of our Defence Act will have to be considered anew and that they will have to be thoroughly investigated.</p>

<p>It is in this context that I want to support this amendment Bill before the House today in all respects. This Bill is aimed at streamlining our Defence Act, adapting it to altered circumstances and adapting it to demands made on us under the present circumstances. The Bill is therefore aimed at establishing an outstanding and sound Defence Act for South Africa. It is our duty to attend at once to issues which may crop up from time to time and to state this clearly and unambiguously in an Act. This has been done in this Bill at present before the House.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to a few of the clauses in this Act, more specifically to what the hon. member for Yeoville had to say about certain <span class="col_471-472" refersTo="page_0252"/>aspects. I note that the hon. member is not in the House at the moment. Last week, during the discussions in the House, the hon. member came forward cooing like a dove and said that he realized that he needed the might and power of a hawk. However, when the real demand was made on him to consider how patriotic that speech of his was, the mountain once again merely brought forth a mouse and nothing more, and what is more, it was a dead mouse.</p>

<p>It is pointless to rise today and refer to a game which is supposedly being played by our hon. Prime Minister. In my opinion our hon. Prime Minister regards this matter as too serious and too urgent to make a game out of it. It will be remembered that he referred to the speech by the hon. member for Yeoville. This shows us that he was of the opinion that the speech was made in all sincerity and that he would have expected the hon. member for Yeoville to show his true colours clearly when this matter was voted on, but the hon. member did not do so. This is no game which is being played. The hon. member mentioned that the Bill&#x2014;and he said that the hon. the Minister would not realize this&#x2014;did away with civil and criminal proceedings. This is by no means the case. If we look at subsection (2) of the envisaged subsection 103<i>ter</i> which is being inserted in the Act by clause 8 of the Bill, it is very clear that this procedure is only suspended civilly and criminally when it is quite clear that a person has been &#x201C;advised, commanded, ordered or directed &#x2026; by the State President, the Minister, or a member of the South African Defence Force&#x201D; to do what they had to do in a specific case. This has nothing to do with criminal offences which such a soldier or any person might commit beyond the scope of his orders. As far as this is concerned, the hon. member for Yeoville is quite wrong when he maintains that the hon. the Minister is suspending purely civil and criminal proceedings by means of this legislation. This does not apply to people who commit an ordinary criminal offence, but only to persons who act within the scope of the orders they receive as part of the act of war which they have to carry out.</p>

<p>There is another aspect, too, which I should like to touch on, and this concerns what the hon. member for Rondebosch maintained. He states that if we change the definition of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; then this in itself will indicate that South Africa has aggressive tendencies and it will undoubtedly make the other states of Africa hostile towards South Africa. In the debate last week we heard what this matter, in the final analysis, was about. The way in which war is waged has changed to such an extent that we cannot limit ourselves to fighting merely within our borders. The sophisticated arms of today which are capable of striking with absolute effectiveness at a distance of 20, 30 and 40 kilometres, have resulted in our being unable to limit ourselves to our borders. If we have an enemy closing round us, then it is essential for us to attack that enemy and for us to drive him a very long way in order to render him absolutely ineffective. That is why the hon. member for Rondebosch is wrong when he states that those countries will think that South Africa has aggressive tendencies. After all, we have often heard from our hon. Prime Minister and other members that the policy of our country is not a policy of territorial expansion. Our policy is purely one of defence, but present circumstances demand that we go further and not merely come to a halt once we have driven the enemy over the border.</p>

<p>I want to refer to what the hon. member for Rondebosch and the hon. member for Yeoville had to say about compensation. The hon. member for Yeoville came along with his old story and the story we have often had from them, viz. the maintenance of the so-called rule of law. However, we are dealing with legislation today which concerns the waging of war and the defence of our country, of that which is ours, the maintenance of what we have acquired and its preservation. At such a time one cannot concern oneself with petty matters such as actions for compensation. When we are dealing with these things then we are dealing with matters of major importance and we must get our priorities straight and shift the other points into the background, because the main thing is to see to the defence of our country and the preservation of what is ours. I feel that it is essential for us to put a stop immediately to that litigation and not to concern ourselves further with it. Our soldiers, every one of them, will have to do their duty and some of them will be expected to be at the front instead of fighting actions in courts of law.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to mention clause 10 which concerns the amendments to and adjustment <span class="col_473-474" refersTo="page_0253"/>of the Moratorium Act. It is heartening to see that we are now eventually reaching the stage at which we are applying that Act to all the persons who are serving, irrespective of the way in which they are serving, as the hon. member for Durban Point, too, rightly mentioned today. I fully associate myself with the manner of implementation as it is now contained in the Act. I am very pleased about the attitude which our official Opposition has adopted towards this matter and that they are not opposing this Bill. In any event, certain amendments are in store which will be raised in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I trust that the hon. member for Aliwal will forgive me if I do not follow him on the points he has raised. However, I will deal with some of them in the course of the remarks I intend making this afternoon. First of all, I want to make one matter quite clear. The attitude which has been adopted and the amendment which has been suggested in regard to territorial limitation by the hon. member for Durban Point is consistent with the attitude adopted by this side of the House in the 1957 debate on the Defence Act. I want to remind the House, if I may, that the amendment which was moved by the then member for Simonstown, the late Mr. Lewis Gay, during the Second Reading of the Defence Bill&#x2014;I quote from Hansard, 18 February 1957. col. 1288&#x2014;said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This House, with the object of ensuring that the Defence Bill shall create legislative and administrative machinery to enable the establishment and maintenance of a South African Defence Force under modern conditions of nuclear warfare should be capable of affording maximum possible security to South Africa, declines to pass the second reading of the Bill unless and until the Government <i>inter alia</i> gives an assurance that provision will be made for (a) any member serving in any branch of the South African Defence Force to be required in time of war to perform service anywhere either within or beyond the borders of the Union.</block>

<p>In (b) he dealt with the second leg of the amendment, namely that the commandos should have the same type of training as the Citizen Force. This has been implemented. The third leg of the amendment was the establishment of a council of defence. In dealing with the amendment, Mr. Gay said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The territorial limitation, we feel, is directly against the best interests of Union defence; it is impracticable to build up a defence force and, when it is put to the test, when it is wanted to be used suddenly, to find that a number of men in key positions, both highly-trained officers and men, can simply say: &#x2018;No, we are not prepared to go further than the Union borders&#x2019;. Your whole organization will be upset and you would have to sit down and train others or wait until you can get the men to sign on the dotted line. It is a fantastic position.</block>

<p>That is the attitude which this side of the House adopted. The then Minister of Defence, Mr. Erasmus, came with the interesting argument&#x2014;which is the same one which the hon. member for Rondebosch offered this afternoon&#x2014;that there would be enough volunteers to fight communism and there would be no need to conscript the army. It is quite interesting if one looks at the persons who supported the amendment which was moved by Mr. Lewis Gay. One finds interesting and leading Progressives such as Dr. De Beer, the late Mr. Harry Lawrence, Mr. Hamilton Russell, Dr. Steytler, Mr. Williams and none other than Mr. Harry Oppenheimer himself supporting that attitude in 1957. It seems that it is not unreasonable to expect that one should have from the Progressive benches the support of this suggestion, so that we in this House could be unanimous in regard to the use of the Defence Force in future.</p>

<p>I believe it is wrong to persist with the volunteer system. I say this because I believe that in South Africa&#x2014;South Africa is part of Africa, as we now recognize ourselves to be&#x2014;that where it is necessary for our defence forces to be involved, then everybody must be involved without giving a choice to those who want to sit behind and leave others to do the work. I say this because one has to raise the question of conscientious objectors. I think that in the law of this country we have made adequate provision for the genuine conscientious objector. They are accommodated before the stage of mobilization or active military operation. I can see no reason why there <span class="col_475-476" refersTo="page_0254"/>should not be a commitment of all members of the Defence Force in time of a threat to our security. I look back over the years since the last world war and one has a feeling of regret that the South Africanism which is built up in armed combat&#x2014;there is, in fact, a South Africanism that is built up and I am sure it is being built up by those who are now in operation&#x2014;becomes dissipated after the war, because of the recrimination and bitterness which developed between those who volunteered and those who did not. It was bitter immediately after the war, and hon. members of this House and you, Mr. Speaker, will be aware that right up to now, 30 years after the war, there are still occasions when, in this House, there are signs of those recriminations in respect of those who volunteered and those who did not volunteer in the last war. By eliminating this question of volunteering, as far as the future is concerned, we can at least save the present generation of South Africans who are serving in our Defence Force&#x2014;and this also applies to future generations&#x2014;from the disruptiveness of these recriminations amongst those members of the Defence Force who volunteer and those who do not.</p>

<p>One also has to realize that there are actually three legs to the definition of &#x201C;service&#x201D; in the terms of this Bill. The first one relates to service in time of war, the second is the fulfilment of treaty obligations which might exist between the Republic and other countries. It seems to me unthinkable that, in applying the Monroe Doctrine to Southern Africa, and entering into treaties of mutual aid in times of foreign aggression, we would then still have to go to our forces and ask them to volunteer to fulfil a treaty obligation that has been entered into by this country with another country in Southern Africa. I believe the time will come&#x2014;and it must come very shortly, with more understanding growing in Southern Africa or Capricorn Africa, as my hon. leader refers to it&#x2014;when there will be treaties of mutual assistance between the countries of Africa in the event of aggression from outside Africa. One remembers that there was a similar provision in the Monroe Doctrine relating to America and South America. If there was an attack on any part of South America, or any attempt at colonization, the United States would regard this as an act of aggression in which they would become involved. This is very similar to what has happened in Angola; it is very similar to what has happened to us in Africa, i.e. being involved in and concerned about an attempt by the imperialism of the communists&#x2014;if I may use that phrase&#x2014;to bring influence to bear on self-determination in Africa.</p>

<p>I am afraid I cannot go along with the hon. member for Yeoville in his suggested definition of &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D;. It is quite clear that if we try to formulate any definition, it becomes a cumbersome and limiting factor in so far as the effectiveness of our Defence Force is concerned. Surely the whole attitude of our country has been made clear over and over again. We are concerned only when our security is threatened. That is all we want a Defence Force for. It is a Defence Force, and we will use that Defence Force when the peace and security of this country is threatened. That being so, we do not want to say we are going here, there or anywhere else. The test of the use of the Defence Force depends on the situation that has arisen and not on the territorial limitat on imposed as far as the Defence Force is concerned. I regret that the hon. member for Yeoville does not see his way clear to accept this principle of conscription in our army, i.e. the obligation on members to serve in the Defence Force, no matter where it is, in cases where our security is threatened. I hope it is an attitude that will change and that we will be able to go further with this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch said that this Bill gives ammunition to our enemies and that it is hostile and aggressive in its terms. I agree to the extent that a definition of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; as being south of the equator may well provoke, or give opportunities for, criticism of the Republic&#x2019;s intentions. However, surely the answer to our enemies is simply that we in this House can, in dealing with this Bill, present a resolute and united attitude towards the defence of South Africa when and where our security is threatened. Whenever and wherever our security is threatened, we will all stand together in the defence of this country. I think that is the attitude to accept.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we adjourned last evening, I had made four points. The first was the desire of this side of the House to eliminate territorial restriction on the use of the members of the S.A. Defence Force. Secondly, I had made the point that the attitude we were adopting in this debate was consistent with the attitude that was adopted by this side of the House in 1957 when an amendment of that nature was moved by this side in a debate similar to this. I had said, thirdly, that we on this side of the House looked forward to a commitment so far as South Africa was concerned, a possible commitment for the maintenance of the integrity of the States of Southern Africa by way of mutual non-aggression and defence pacts between these States. The fourth point I had raised was that the emphasis now, as far as our Defence Force was concerned, was on the willingness of all our people to defend the country when the security or the integrity of our State was in peril.</p>

<p>What always arises when one deals with legislation dealing with military activity, is the question of compensation for injuries or damage sustained by individuals. Therefore we welcome the inclusion of provision in clause 8 of this Bill for the payment of compensation to those who are in effect non-combatants&#x2014;in other words, those who suffer injuries as a result of action taken by our forces in combating terrorism or, alternatively, those who suffer damage to property by reason of such proceedings. One can well understand that there will be situations where properties might well be damaged and where premises occupied by terrorists must be destroyed in order to destroy the terrorists, and that compensation should be paid to the persons concerned. I would like to say to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development that the question of compensation is equally important to the persons for whom he is responsible, i.e. those Bantu people who might become involved in so far as terrorist activities are concerned. There is always anxiety in the minds of people as to what is to be their position if they suffer loss, injury or damage as a result of action, of participating in the defence of their country. I have welcomed the fact that in this Bill provision has been made for the security of non-combatants and for compensation for those who might suffer as a result of activities in connection with the curtailment and control of terrorism. I hope that during the session we shall have the opportunity of discussing further the question of pensions generally for war disabilities and disablement apart from the aspect which is touched upon in this Bill. I am sure that this opportunity will be given to us.</p>

<p>In passing I want to say that there is great concern amongst the public&#x2014;it has become apparent in the Press recently&#x2014;about the need to care for persons who are involved in military operations. There are a number of funds being run and administered by various bodies to deal with the needs of servicemen. I hope that the hon. the Minister, when dealing with this question of compensation on this basis, will have an opportunity to look at the position with regard to the provision of funds to deal with those hardships which are suffered by members of the Defence Force and their families, hardships which are not directly attributable to their participation in war, in conflict. There are many problems of this nature that arise and which can only be dealt with outside the framework of pension and similar legislation. I believe that when we talk about the defence of this country and about the need for every South African to be prepared to represent his country, the hon. the Minister should give consideration to what our Defence Force terms the development of &#x201C;weerbaarheid&#x201D; <span class="col_479-480" refersTo="page_0256"/>in our defence forces, a determination to defend, and to see that it is created also in other sections of our community and not only in those who are committed to compulsory national service.</p>

<p>I want to mention to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and he will forgive me for mentioning a personal matter at the moment&#x2014;the members of the Cape Corps who have served South Africa in the past and who are willing to serve South Africa again. I want to mention particularly the instance of one member of the Cape Corps who served as a stretcher-bearer with me in my company during the last war. He was one of three Cape Corps men who was awarded military medals for bravery in action in Italy. He lost his sight as the result of his function, as a stretcher-bearer, of rescuing wounded White people. He lost his sight as a result of machine-gun fire. If one thinks of that man and what has happened to him, the reward which he has received during the last 30 years, then one can only say: Thank God that there is an organization such as St. Dunstan&#x2019;s that was able to look after him. I believe that one has to look at this seriously, when one is discussing the duty to serve South Africa, as to what is the attitude of these people and whether we as a Parliament are accepting our responsibility to respond to the attitudes which they adopt. I want to read to the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs&#x2014;I see he is not here at the moment&#x2014;from an address at the recent congress of the S.A. Coloured Ex-Servicemen&#x2019;s Legion at which both he and I were present. I want to read some of the words which were spoken by the president of that organization. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mnr. die Minister en vriende, die nuwe jaar l&#x00EA; voor met al sy onbekendheid. Dit wil asof oorlogswolke weer vir ons saampak, hierdie keer baie na aan ons, en indien dit gebeur, waar staan ons? My antwoord stel ek baie duidelik: Ons staan nog altyd waar ons voorheen gestaan het, in diens van Suid-Afrika.</block>

<p>Sir, that was the attitude of our Coloured people, and I believe it throws a tremendous responsibility on to us when dealing with legislation of this nature.</p>

<p>That brings me to the final point, the point raised by the hon. member for Durban Point, i.e. the need to reconsider the provisions of section 91(2) of the Defence Act in regard to Parliament being convened within 30 days of moblization, as it is now, and to extend that where we are involved in activities which are now to be brought within the definition of &#x201C;service&#x201D; and involve activities which are outside the borders of our country. Sir, I believe that by calling Parliament together in those circumstances, not when we are dealing with terrorism but when we are dealing with armed conflict outside the borders of the Republic, it provides an opportunity to motivate the whole nation behind the armed forces involved. I believe that is important and I hope that the hon. the Minister will give serious consideration to accepting the suggestions which have been made by the hon. member for Durban Point. Sir, motivation of the general public means the mobilization of the support of the general public for those committed to armed conflict and ensures confidence, and I believe that confidence will promote greater efficiency in so far as our defence forces are concerned. For those reasons I hope to learn, from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply, to what extent he is prepared to go along with the suggestions which have been made by this side of the House and which we will be able to discuss in more detail in the Committee Stage.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Green Point, in the course of his speech, referred to the willingness of our Brown people to defend our country, South Africa. We know this is the attitude of those people. One often hears a discordant note and it is hon. members of this House who often pay attention to those discordant notes. But we have the confidence in our Coloured people that they, just like all of us, will give everything to this country. Then the hon. member for Green Point also stressed the willingness of all our people to defend their country. Sir, this is very important, because the Bill before the House deals with the safeguarding of the State. It is the good right of the electorate outside to expect things from their Government. One can draw up a very long list of these things and right at the top of that list will appear the security of the State. If we draw a line through this, very little will remain, because the security of the State is the basis of all the facets of our life. For that reason it is so essential that we in South Africa should place a very high premium on the <span class="col_481-482" refersTo="page_0257"/>security of the State. Sir, within the scope of a few days, we have had two opportunities in this House to show that we are <i>ad idem</i> in this House as far as these matters are concerned. Last week we were able to give such a display, except for a few hon. members, this little team of eleven who are sitting on my right. In cricket terms one could say that this team performed very poorly. If I may take it further using cricket terms, I can say that there was one of the hon. members who played a reasonably good innings, but when he had to round it off, he did not have the courage to do so. I am referring to the hon. member for Yeoville. [Interjections.] Now we have another opportunity in dealing with this Bill, to show that we in this House are unanimous when it comes to the protection of our State, and again we have this little team of eleven who appeared on the scene yesterday and again tried to circumvent this Bill on technical grounds. Sir, South Africa&#x2019;s security is being threatened and I believe this party on my right read and interpreted the wicket quite incorrectly. It was revealed quite clearly during the no-confidence debate, that these people have no idea of what these matters are about. The amendment of the Prime Minister which we accepted here last week confirms that we should be unanimous as far as the security of our State is concerned, because in that amendment we stated that the aim of the aggression against the Republic of South Africa is, <i>inter alia,</i> to subjugate South West Africa and South Africa. After all, this is the aim of the enemies of the Republic of South Africa, namely to subjugate us, to subjugate us to a Marxist state, and we know what this means for us, and what this entails for us. Now we have this legislation before us to rectify and improve certain things in our defence legislation in order to combat this aggression. Sir, it has been said clearly that South Africa does not want to attack and does not want to take other people&#x2019;s territory, but we cannot sit back and allow South Africa to be thrown to the wolves either. It is essential that South Africa should hit back where the necessity to do so arises. Now it is imperative that reference to armed conflict, armed conflict outside the Republic of South Africa as well, will be made in this legislation. But now the hon. member for Rondebosch says he does not like that wording. He wants that wording deleted and he simply wants reference to be made to terrorism. He does not want these people who commit aggression to be pursued, or, if we were to become involved in armed conflict, that South Africa would act and defend itself. But the hon. member for Yeoville admits this, because when he furnishes his definition he refers to areas along the borders of the Republic. At least, he looks a little further than the hon. member for Rondebosch. He appreciates that one should pursue these people. But now he does not go very far either, because how does one determine that area outside one&#x2019;s borders? For that reason I think one can agree with the hon. member for Durban Point when he wants that definition amended to read &#x201C;anywhere&#x201D;. But this shows us that the hon. member for Durban Point is in earnest about his country, that he is in earnest about this Republic of South Africa, and that, where aggression is committed against our country, we should hit out and defend ourselves.</p>

<p>When coming back to clause 11, which states that this Act should be made of retrospective effect, the Progressive Reform Party also wants to create the idea that we come to this House to ask for condonation as if irregularities had taken place. Sir, I want to tell you that when that party speaks in this spirit, it is in fact an insult to our Defence Force, because we are dealing with changed circumstances which should be duly taken into consideration. Under these circumstances which have arisen and in which South Africa is involved, I believe South Africa acted correctly, that its Defence Force acted correctly and that this is actually an opportunity for us to pay homage to our Defence Force for the heroic deeds which were performed there and to pay homage to young men who were prepared to take up arms for their country. For that reason it is the task of all of us to safeguard our country. It is the primary task of this House, because we are not dealing here with a distant war. It is our own borders that we have to defend, our own territory, and it is our own people&#x2014;Black, Brown and White&#x2014;who are involved in this. Therefore, it is a matter which affects everyone of us. For that reason I want to say in conclusion that it is regretted that this House cannot be unanimous on the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down said that <span class="col_483-484" refersTo="page_0258"/>members on these benches had initiated the concept that the Government had been acting outside the law in respect of its adventure in Angola. Let me say immediately that the debate last week has aroused certain suspicions that this may well be so, but as far as this House is concerned, it was the hon. the Minister of Defence who introduced this thought into the debate by saying that there were certain amendments that were required in order to obviate any doubt about the legality of the Government&#x2019;s actions. I shall refer to this again in the course of my remarks.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I am now speaking about this debate in this House, and referring to the hon. member for Oudtshoorn. The debate has shown that there are a number of areas of broad agreement in relation to defence and to the aspects of the Bill before us. At this stage I want to come back to two points in respect of which we in these benches find ourselves at odds with other hon. members in this House. One is the question of the volunteer principle, the principle which has been expanded, at the suggestion of hon. members on my right, to exclude any territorial reference and therefore to make volunteering no longer an aspect of South African servicemen serving in a time of war beyond the borders of the country. This is a matter which deserves serious consideration, because clearly there can be arguments on both sides in this connection. We in these benches have not heard arguments which persuade us that the volunteer principle should be abandoned. We think that the arguments in favour of it, with adjustments or amendments to take the territorial concept into account, are necessary, but we would advise against abandoning the volunteer principle, a principle which has been a very important traditional part of defence in South Africa over the years, indeed for generations. We agree with the amendment which has been suggested by the hon. member for Yeoville. He has indicated that when it comes to South Africa, and when it comes to the combating of terrorism within South Africa and the immediately adjoining operational areas, which we see as an integral part of service within South Africa, there is no dispute between ourselves and other members in this House. We advise that this House should not lightly discard the volunteer principle for military service in wars in foreign countries. We should not lightly discard a principle that applied in the old Republics prior to this day and applies in South Africa. Firstly, the argument which has been advanced by some hon. members is that volunteering is necessarily a divisive factor.</p>

<p>I do not want to argue that there will never be problems created in certain sets of circumstances. However, people who do volunteer and those who do not volunteer, merely reflect the divisions within the community. If one looks at the last war, in 1939, one finds that the fact that certain people did volunteer and others did not, did not cause differences, it was merely a reflection of differences that existed within the society. Had one said that people were unpatriotic and that they had to go up North, one would have created a far greater division within the society. Volunteering reflects the division, but conscription can, in certain circumstances, accentuate the divisions. We have referred on numerous occasions to the lessons of Vietnam. Without going into the rights and wrongs of the Vietnam saga, there is no doubt that the concept of conscription in relation to Vietnam was a vital factor in dividing the American people at a time when the president, at least, believed they should be united on a national issue. Therefore, although I do not argue that volunteering has no problems, I believe that compulsory conscription, without taking the mood of the people as a whole into account, can be more divisive. I think this House should take note of this. Secondly, I wish to put forward a view that, in the main, a volunteer army is better than a conscript army, whether it is a volunteer army of the permanent force or whether it is a volunteer army of commandos or citizen forces. They have a better morale, greater motivation and a greater sense of commitment. I do not think we should lightly destroy that because this has played a very important part. I know, as other hon. members on this side of the House will know, that when we, 30 or 40 years younger than we are today, went up north and to Italy as volunteers, we felt more motivated and felt a greater sense of pride than those other armies that were there merely because they had been conscripted. I do not think we must underestimate the spirit that <span class="col_485-486" refersTo="page_0259"/>goes with a voluntary commitment to do something for one&#x2019;s country.</p>

<p>Apart from this, I believe that the volunteer system imposes certain restraints on the Government. The Government can take the vital step of taking us into a war without recalling Parliament until after the act has been done. It is therefore important that if there are no restrictions by Parliament, there should at least be other factors operating within the society which will not discourage the Government from going lightly into a foreign military adventure. If the Government knows that it has to motivate the people, if it knows that the Army depends not on instruction of the law, but on the motivation of the people, I believe the Government will take this into account in deciding the extent to which they should or should not become involved in foreign escapades. Also, the Government would not enter into a state of war unless it knew that it could take the people with it on a voluntary basis. I do not think we want a situation where this Government, by executive action, takes us into a war, so that thereafter everyone is committed. Surely we want this Government to take into account that the maximum effort on the part of South Africa involves the Government telling the people the whole story, involves the Government in motivating them. However, if the Government is in a position to enter a war or to enter into military operations without telling the people, knowing that it has a conscript army which it could bring in, I believe that a very necessary restraint has been taken away from the Government. It has been said that we are all united. Yes, we are all united in general terms. We all believe in the defence of South Africa. However, let us remember that governments have been known to make mistakes. I think the hon. the Minister has the view that in a previous stage of South Africa&#x2019;s history a Government of South Africa made a mistake and took us into war. Governments do make mistakes. Governments do become involved in wars which they should not become involved in. I think they are much more likely to embark on foreign military adventures if they have a conscript army which they can throw in, rather than having to motivate people and take them along on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>I believe that these are important factors. I am not denying some of the factors that have been raised in support of abandoning this principle. However, I believe it would be wrong of this House lightly to discard this. I believe it would certainly be wrong to discard this principle before referring this Bill to a Select Committee. I believe that this whole matter should be referred to a Select Committee before the Government commits itself to abandoning this important principle.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I put a question to the hon. member?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, later on. What is even more important is that there is a change in the definition of the defence of South Africa contemplated in this Bill. This definition, which deals with armed conflict in other countries, widens tremendously the scope given to the Government to embark on military intervention in foreign countries. Because this House is being asked to widen the scope of military involvement in other countries, there is an added reason why the volunteer system should not be abandoned. Finally, I think that this must be seen against the background of Africa. We are talking about Africa. We are talking about 4 million Whites on a Black continent. I think we should take into account the racial composition of our own country. We have heard that everyone should defend South Africa, and not only that, but everyone should be conscripted to defend South Africa. Are we in a position to apply that to everybody? Are we in a position to apply this conscription rule to the Coloureds, the Blacks and the Indians of South Africa? We must not come with sweeping generalities. We must realize that there is a potential danger for us in Africa and there is a divisive factor within South Africa if our Government starts sending armies consisting of White conscripts into Africa at a stage where it is not able to integrate the Black people into the total defence of South Africa. I do not think we must underestimate the impact of sending White conscripts into Africa when we have not yet reached the stage of being prepared to give the same opportunity to Black people to defend South Africa. For these reasons this House should not lightly abandon the principle of voluntarism as far as the defence of South Africa beyond its borders is concerned.</p>

<p>There is another clause to which we have an objection in principle. I refer to the clause which seeks to amend section 1 (1)(c) of the <span class="col_487-488" refersTo="page_0260"/>principal Act. The provisions of this clause seek to introduce a new element in the definition of the &#x201C;defence of South Africa&#x201D;. It is the one dealing with the prevention or suppression of any armed conflict outside the Republic. We in these benches, as has been indicated by my hon. colleagues from Yeoville and Rondebosch, have very severe misgivings about this clause, about its scope, about its possible application by this Government, especially in the light of recent events, and about the consequences. I do not believe that this clause can be seen except in the context of the Angolan adventure. Indeed, the hon. the Minister indicated this. The retrospective clauses take us back to a date prior to our involvement in Angola and, in fact, the hon. the Minister even referred to obviating any doubts about the legality of our action. So this clause in particular has to be seen against the background of the Angolan adventure and the explanations, partial though they have been, by the Government of what is happening today. Let us look at this clause for a moment. Whether you like it or not, whether you support or reject it, it does impinge on our traditional non-intervention policy. It does take you outside of our traditional non-intervention policy into a new unknown. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with it in due course. This is an important step in dismantling our non-intervention policy. It authorizes the Government to become involved militarily in the affairs of another country and it then sets certain conditions or limitations. However, let us look at what it does authorize. First of all this involvement goes beyond normal treaty obligations. So, in respect of all we have heard about &#x201C;of course we have to fulfil our treaty obligations&#x201D; I say, &#x201C;yes, in any case under the Defence Act you have to fulfil your treaty obligations&#x201D;. Secondly, this goes beyond a state of war. In other words, it does not mean that you can intervene if there is a state of war, you could always have done that. It goes beyond even an anticipated state of war because the Act defines &#x201C;a time of war&#x201D; as a time when there is an actual state of war or when a state of war may be anticipated by the State President. In other words, it says that even if you anticipated a state of war, you could have done that. So this clause goes beyond treaty obligations, it goes beyond an actual state of war, it goes beyond a potential state of war and it goes even further than pre-emptive strikes, because in terms of the present Act you could deal with it under the definition of a time of war. It goes beyond the combating of terrorism because the provisions of the Act permit you to act against terrorists. It therefore goes beyond all these things. It gives authority to the Government to intervene militarily in a foreign country on very, very broad grounds. I want to look for a moment at those grounds. If one looks at it in its narrowest context, one finds that it relates to the suppression of any armed conflict which in the opinion of the State President is a threat to the security. In other words, the very narrowest context of this clause means that you can suppress armed conflict if there is no doubt at all that it is a threat to the country. However, that is not where it ends; it goes far, far beyond that. It says that you can prevent any armed conflict which may be a threat. Can you imagine this, Sir? You have the authority to prevent something which has not taken place or which you do not know is going to take place and which may be a threat, not &#x201C;is&#x201D; a threat, not &#x201C;armed conflict which exists&#x201D;. Therefore, not only must you be correct in your judgment that there is going to be an armed conflict although it has not taken place, but you must also be correct in your judgment that it may be a threat; not that it is a threat. We believe that that is far too wide. This opens the door to military intervention. It opens the door to the kind of adventures which can take place if the Government feels that it wants to intervene in the affairs of another country. This will enable it to become involved, not in a civil war, but in a potential civil war in other countries. It will enable it to become involved, let us say, in suppressing a revolt against a military dictator in another country. It will enable it to become involved in stopping an uprising against corruption in a certain country. These are the kind of things which could well happen in Africa and all of these things would fall within the ambit of the authority which the Government is seeking under this Bill. Not only can this be implemented with the consent of the Government concerned, but it in fact can be implemented in defiance of the Government concerned because the factor of <span class="col_489-490" refersTo="page_0261"/>whether the Government concerned is in favour or not of this intervention is irrelevant in terms of this clause. It would mean that South Africa would have to make an accurate assessment that there is a potential conflict and that that potential conflict may be a threat to the security of South Africa. I believe that South Africa could only do that if there were vast numbers of Bureau for State Security people around Africa making their own appraisal of the situation, because surely we would not make this assessment on hearsay evidence given to use by one or other party. I have the fear that in order to make this work, we are going to have some kind of CIA operation around Africa gleaning the information to feed into the machine in order to see that this decision can be properly made in terms of the Act. I believe that in this clause as it reads at the moment, the Government is asking Parliament for a licence to intervene militarily in foreign countries. I do not believe, however, that this licence is going to be recognized by the international community. Indeed, I am sure that it is going to be repudiated, that it is going to be rejected not only by individual states, but by the wider international community.</p>

<p>As I think we all agree, this Bill has to be seen against the background of our recent involvement in Angola. Clause 11 makes provision for certain of the provisions to be retrospective to 9 August, which is prior to our involvement at the dam and the hydro-electric scheme site. The hon. the Minister of Defence, I think, will agree that he did say that the reason for this clause was to obviate any doubt about the legality of the Government&#x2019;s action. Well, if you want to obviate doubt, then doubt must exist, because if doubt does not exist, why do you need to obviate it? Here the hon. the Minister himself says that he is coming to us four or five months after 9 August because perhaps there is some doubt about the legality of our actions and they want to obviate that. It would appear that not only did the Government not tell the people what it was doing, and not only did it act secretively, but on the statement of the hon. the Minister himself there is doubt as to the legality of the Government&#x2019;s actions in this connection. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;I hope he will give us the reply during his response to this debate&#x2014;what section of the Defence Act the Government invoked when it embarked upon a military operation which had as its consequence that South African soldiers were captured many hundreds of kilometres beyond the South African borders and in Angola. The hon. the Minister should tell us what section of the Defence Act he invoked, because on all the evidence before us and on the statement by the hon. the Minister that there is doubt as to the legality of our actions, we can find no section which could reasonably have been invoked. Clearly the whole story, the whole truth, has not yet been revealed. All the evidence is before us. As the hon. member for Rondebosch said in the course of his speech, part of this Bill is an attempt to cover up a situation that has not yet been revealed to the public.</p>

<p>I must refer, however, to events which, over the past weekend, were reflected in the weekend Press. Statements, coming from a most authoritative individual, have been made and I believe that those statements should not be left unchallenged by the Government. I am referring to the statements that were reported to have been made by the American Secretary of State, Mr. Henry Kissinger, before a Senate sub-committee in America. This is important because, if these statements are allowed to stand as they are, they call into question the credibility of the statements which the hon. the Prime Minister made in this House. I believe it is in the interests of South Africa that the hon. the Minister must refute these allegations to the extent that they are in conflict with what the hon. the Prime Minister has told this House. I do not believe these statements can be allowed to stand. I do not believe it is proper that statements coming from an authoritative source such as this can be left to stand in conflict with what has been said in this House. I believe the credibility of the Government is at stake and that the Government should remedy the situation. In essence, the hon. the Prime Minister said three times the other day that it was quite clear that we were not involved in a civil war. I have the quotation here. It was crisply and clearly stated. We have to accept that on face value. I want to add that Mr. Kissinger has not been an enemy of South Africa in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to the extent that this Bill makes provision for South African involvement in a foreign country in terms of a new definition, this being made retrospective to 8 August, I would submit that, while not traversing the whole of the subject, within the context of our involvement in Angola and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that this Bill is partly there to remove any doubts as to the legality of our involvement there, I could develop my argument. However, I accept your ruling that, clearly, it should not go beyond that. I do think that for this reason the nature of our involvement must be made clear. On the one hand Mr. Kissinger said we went there because we were invited, but on the other hand, the hon. the Prime Minister said we were not involved. I think the hon. the Minister of Defence must answer this allegation crisply because it concerns the nature of our involvement. I do not believe that this particular aspect should be left unanswered. People in South Africa are faced with conflicting statements, one made by the hon. the Prime Minister and another by the American Secretary of State.</p>

<p>We believe that this Bill, which extends the scope of the Act, is an attempt at a partial cover-up of a whole series of errors of judgment made by the Government in respect of its involvement in Angola. It is for this reason that we cannot accept the clause on the basis of the explanations that have at this stage been given by the Government. Certain other consequences would follow, should we accept this clause. First of all, I have no doubt whatsoever that the acceptance of this clause will cause a significant number of African States to say that South Africa is becoming a militaristic power. As I have said on previous occasions, the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s impeccable attitude towards Mozambique and his withdrawal of South African Police from Rhodesia in my opinion did much to allay that fear, but nevertheless that attitude and that fear still exists. I need only point to <i>the Daily News</i> of Gaberones of a few days ago. I was in Gaberones, where I had certain discussions, and I put it to the newspaper at the time that South Africa&#x2019;s presence in Angola was primarily due to its assessment that Russia was endeavouring to exploit the situation in Angola to her advantage. This was my assessment of the situation. Botswana is not at loggerheads with South Africa. It is not a country that is hostile towards us. In a way it is very much an extension of us in southern Africa. Nevertheless, Mr. Archie Mogwe, Botswana&#x2019;s Minister of External Affairs, said&#x2014;and I quote from the newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as Botswana sees South Africa&#x2019;s presence in Angola, it can only be motivated by a desire to extend their influence beyond the borders in an effort to frustrate liberation in southern Africa.</block>

<p>I do not agree with that and I have made it clear that I do not agree with it. However, if a man like Mr. Archie Mogwe can make that kind of statement and believe it, can you imagine what the rest of Africa, which is more remote from us, is saying at this stage?</p>

<p>Secondly, I think there is another consequence of this clause of the Bill. Although this may be seen as a means of giving some umbrella military protection to weaker states near us, I believe it could well be counterproductive. I think that the effect of this Bill and of this clause in particular could cause countries bordering on South Africa to seek military alliance with other countries. It could well happen that, seeing the growth of South Africa&#x2019;s militarism, as they would see it, these countries would look for some counterbalance and consequently would seek military alliances with countries outside of our orbit of influence. Finally, let us make no mistake about it, we are approaching a very exciting and traumatic experience in South Africa, viz. the independence of the Transkei. I think that this kind of clause is going to cast more doubt on the real meaning of independence of countries such as the Transkei.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>It is all very well for hon. members to say that, but they must go and talk to African leaders. I think we should do everything in our power to allay the fear, mistrust and suspicion that exist as far as South Africa&#x2019;s military operations are concerned.</p>

<p>There are a number of aspects of this Bill with which we agree. I refer, for instance, to the combating of terrorism, the principle of <span class="col_493-494" refersTo="page_0263"/>compensation, the extension of the provisions of the Moratorium Act and the concept of defensive alliances and mutual defence treaties with other countries in Africa. However, we cannot give a mandate to the Government which in our opinion, in view of the experiences of the last three months, amounts to a blank cheque being given to the Government for their involvement in the affairs of another country. There is another area of agreement: I believe that, no matter how much we might argue about the mandate imposed by the political Government in South Africa, all of us want to keep the Defence Force, <i>per se,</i> out of party politics. I think this has been the mood and I believe it is also the spirit of this debate. One of the encouraging features of the S.A. Defence Force today is the absence of party political influence within the Defence Force. I believe that all of us in this House are pleased that this is so. In the circumstances, we believe the hon. the Prime Minister was wrong the other day. I want to say that I was disappointed in him for the way in which he explained the fact that he had not given to me, as the leader of one of the parliamentary parties, any information relating to South Africa&#x2019;s involvement in Angola. As far as the personal innuendo is concerned, I dismiss it with the contempt it deserves; it is irrelevant. What is much more important, is that the hon. the Prime Minister must realize there are times when one has to be a statesman and not a party politician. At a time of national crisis I believe the hon. the Prime Minister should not try to play party politics and give a slap in the face to the hundreds of thousands of people who do support us in these benches. [Interjections.] The hon. the Prime Minister should not try to cause artificial divisions in South Africa when such divisions do not exist. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. SNYMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is striking that the only discordant notes which we have heard during this debate, have in fact come from the hon. member for Sea Point and those of kindred spirit. The hon. member for Sea Point is very worried that voluntary service in the South African Defence Force will disappear completely, but it seems to me that the only people who are not prepared to defend the country on a voluntary basis, are those people on that side of the House. The hon. member says that we must become motivated and stand together in defending our country&#x2019;s borders, but I want to tell him once again that it seems to me that the only people who are not motivated in this respect are, once again, his party and those of kindred spirit. He is very worried about the so-called intervention which is now being allowed with tacit permission in terms of clause 1(c) of this amending Bill. But I want to tell him and his party that the amendments which are being effected by this Bill, will no more be used to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries in any respect than the Angolan situation was an interference by South Africa in the domestic affairs of a neighbouring State. It is no wonder that the hon. the Prime Minister also acted on the premise that furnishing information to that side of the House would not be to act in a responsible manner.</p>

<p>It is with much gratitude that, during this debate on the amendment of the Defence Bill of 1957, we have otherwise been able to experience such a high spirit of unanimity as has been the case&#x2014;a spirit which has resulted from the previous week&#x2019;s no-confidence debate. This reflects without a doubt the spirit of patriotism, a spirit of fidelity and loyalty of the citizens of the Republic of South Africa, especially in these days when our existence is once again being threatened by international communism, which incessantly seeks our downfall in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Defence said on one occasion that peace is an unnatural state for man, and that peace does not preserve itself. If we want to keep our country, our air-space and our waters intact, we cannot relax our vigilance. In this spirit of vigilance we vote for the amendments contained in this Bill. We vote for this Bill in order to cope with the changed circumstances, the changed methods of warfare, the changed methods of undermining law and order and the reprehensible murder attacks of treacherous terrorism, which are often initiated far beyond the borders of our country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch&#x2019;s fear that the world will accuse South Africa of aggression and of territorial expansion if South Africa extends its strategic operational area to exceed the boundaries of the Republic itself, is entirely unfounded. The hon. the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated that it would have been foolish of South Africa not to have beaten off the attack of the Cubans and of the <span class="col_495-496" refersTo="page_0264"/>MPLA from Angola. I quote his own words: &#x201C;That which we have done, we will do repeatedly.&#x201D; Here we have the assurance that, if a similar situation should again arise on the borders of South Africa, this procedure would be repeated. Even after this onslaught had been warded off no fewer than 22 African States refused point blank to condemn South Africa&#x2019;s participation there, and that after South Africa had already been engaged in military activities in Angola to protect the borders for which we had accepted responsibility. Why should we therefore not streamline our defence legislation and adjust it so that effective and quick action could be taken should it be necessary? It is apparently only the Progressive Reformist Party and the Herstigte Nasionale Party who have objections against and are suspicious of this amendment. Indeed, they are two strange bed-mates. Yesterday, the hon. member for Green Point and today the hon. member for Sea Point, referred to the great deal of mutual dissent and discord which prevailed during the Second World War between volunteers and non-volunteers or opponents of the war effort at that time, a quarrel which, as he puts it, has been rearing its head in this House for the past 30 years and longer. I do not want to raise those arguments again in this debate. This has probably been done many times in this House, even before I came here. I just want to underline the fact that the circumstances of that time are vastly different from today&#x2019;s. It is not necessary for me to enlarge upon this any further, except to point out one aspect. In those days there was no question of an undivided loyalty to one flag and one fatherland, as is the case today thanks to the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister and his predecessors. This country has probably never been so consolidated, so unanimous and so united behind a Prime Minister as it is today. One cannot help recalling the words of the late Dr. Verwoerd, who held out the prospect that once South Africa became a republic, a united nation would develop in this country. It now appears as if that ideal of Dr. Verwoerd is now being realized. Therefore the whole question of voluntary or non-voluntary service in the South African Defence Force should never again be an issue in the history of South Africa. While the South African Defence Force is committed to voluntary service to a large extent and while, especially our commandos consist of a large percentage of volunteers, it is wonderful to see how able-bodied men from all walks of life join the ranks with enthusiasm to fulfil their basic duty as citizens and to equip themselves for this purpose. Therefore, it is right that in clause 8 of this amendment Bill the necessary additions to the principal Act should be effected so that protection can be afforded through this Act for compensation and even civil claims which may arise as a result of the combating of terrorism. This amendment, as well as the amendment to the Moratorium Act of 1963, should further stimulate the morale of these people and encourage them to equip themselves to the best of their ability for the difficult task which lies ahead of them and especially for the increasingly difficult task which will lie ahead of them in the future. These voluntary members of the commandos, who are prepared, sometimes with great personal inconvenience and sacrifices, and even financial sacrifices, to give their unselfish service to their country, deserve in every respect the advantages which the amending Bill entails for them. There are young men, and not only young men, but even middle-aged men, who never had the privilege of receiving their basic training under the old ballot system. They feel this deficiency in their civilian set-up and are eager to undergo this training. With their infectious enthusiasm they contribute a great deal towards making our nation&#x2014;a nation which is prepared, with a trowel in one hand and a gun in the other&#x2014;unceasingly to develop our bastion here in the south.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Defence on this amending Bill which he will successfully pilot through this House. It can only lead to great advantage for this country and its citizens.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietersburg said certain things in respect of this legislation with which I agree. But I do not agree with some of his political remarks. I am going to leave the hon. member at that, however, because I want to come back to certain aspects of the speech of the hon. member for Sea Point.</p>

<p>As regards one principle with which the hon. member dealt, viz. that Parliament should be summoned to meet, I want to tell him that if he had listened carefully to the speech of the <span class="col_497-498" refersTo="page_0265"/>hon. member for Durban Point, he would have heard that we are in fact going to move such an amendment. Surely it is true that a Government can also commit an error of judgment and that Parliament should therefore be involved in something of this kind. As regards the point raised by the hon. member with reference to a voluntary army, I want to say that I, too, thought many years ago that this was a wonderful idea. However, we are living in changed circumstances and conditions, and I think if he were to go into all the merits of the case, he would realize that it would be in the interest of both White and Black in the country if we were to renounce this idea.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think the hon. member is in grave difficulties as far as the principle of non-intervention is concerned. In the light of clause 1(c) he is accusing the Government of abandoning its policy of non-intervention. Right behind him he, of course, has the hon. member for Yeoville, and yesterday he repeated his appeal for the acceptance of a Monroe Doctrine for Africa. In his speech he said that this did not involve sending armies all over Africa. However, he continued to quote the traditional Monroe Doctrine sections upon that. I would like to say that, where he said that there should be no further colonization in the new world, there should be added to it that any attempt to reconquer the South American Republics by any power would be considered &#x201C;a manifestation of unfriendly disposition towards the United States&#x201D;. This, of course, is the type of thing that leads to intervention. If those are his feelings, we are, I think, entitled to know why in fact he is not supporting this Bill, or, in opposing it, is not relating it to his fundamental belief that there should be a Monroe Doctrine applicable in Africa. If a person publicly advocates this, he has two options: You can either reject or accept it. Whatever you do must, however, be proved from your central point of view. I could have understood it if he said that he could not support it because it did not go far enough and that we needed a much more severe provision. On the other hand he could have said that he was prepared to support the Bill because it was moving in the right direction. Once one accepts such a doctrine the whole argument of intervention in the affairs of other countries falls by the way</p>

<p>In accepting such a doctrine one must also accept the responsibilities that go with it. The responsibility lies in upholding the doctrine, and the doctrine can only be upheld if one has the means to do it. One of the important means of doing it is a Defence Bill containing some of the principles set out here. However, such a Bill will have to go much further than this one because in this one, clause 1(c) is centred around the security of South Africa only. South Africa is not, in terms of this Bill, intended to be an international watch-dog or a Police power for Africa. In assuming this role America found that she had to go outside her borders for military, political and economic reasons. At one stage, in her desire to keep European powers out, she was even forced to accept the role of debt collector for European nations. I am now specifically referring to the San Domingo incidents. I want to quote from the <i>History of American Foreign Relations</i> by L. M. Sears the following paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In an important sense they became the vassals of the United States, an enlargement of imperialism, embarrassing to friendly understanding with other Latin powers. On the other hand, to leave Europeans to do their own collecting is to involve the Monroe Doctrine in constant jeopardy, while to deny them this and yet refuse to do it for them, is to antagonize the world.</block>

<p>I can quote other aspects, like the case of the Panama Canal, of which the construction was delayed. Then, when it was ultimately constructed, it was preceded by a revolution and Panama was ceded from Columbia. But once it was built, the Panama Canal came under American control. Yes, she paid some $10 million for it. She paid another million annually to Panama. My point is that historically one can hardly blame some of those countries which were affected in that sphere where it was practised for regarding the American economic penetration under this cloak of the Monroe Doctrine with suspicion, distrust and even an insidious form of empire-building. This brings me to the point I want to make, i.e. to warn this hon. House against the practice to just willy-nilly accept certain political terms, perhaps because they sound nice, without first &#x2026;</p>

<from><span class="col_499-500" refersTo="page_0266"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, like Mesopotamia, my friend here says &#x2026; without first carefully considering its historical connotation and its political implications internally for the country itself, internationally in the sphere where it is to be applied and internationally outside the sphere of influence of the doctrine. Therefore, it is worthwhile to look at this because, after all, this doctrine was a doctrine applicable and devised by America some 150 years ago. One cannot simply look and declare oneself an adherent of such a doctrine in the hope that the whole world will only remember the good that flowed from it. Remember, what was regarded as good for the citizens of the United States of America was regarded as evil for other countries within that sphere of influence.</p>

<p>Let us be frank. If one happens to look at the map of America, and be a United States citizen, one may say: &#x201C;What a great idea. When it started, we were only 22 states; when it finished we had some 50 states.&#x201D; If in fact you happen to live on the other side, south of the Rio Grande in Mexico, you may also love the Gringos&#x2014;as they would call them&#x2014;because they happened to help you during the time of Maximilian and Napoleon III. But if Mexicans look just to the north of them and see the wonderful cattle country and the oil-wells of Texas and think that it once belonged to Mexico, it having been lost to America 23 years after the Monroe Doctrine; if they should look up to California and realize that they lost that too, then they have reason to hate America. Two years after they discovered gold in California, Mexico lost it in a war against America. Perhaps it was the gold, or perhaps it was the 8 000 unmarried girls who left Australia for new pastures on the other side of the Pacific after the gold rush in Australia had been completed&#x2014;I do not know.</p>

<p>My hon. leader has spoken before and has also advocated greater co-operation on several occasions, and not co-operation in vague terms like this, but the need for specific, firm agreements, definitely military and otherwise, with countries on the continent of Africa within the Capricorn area. But to advocate a Monroe Doctrine in its original form is an invitation to continuous commitment across the border. Sir, historically America was very lucky that she did not get involved in many wars in pursuance of the Monroe Doctrine, that it was not necessary for her to be involved in more wars, wars which would have had nothing to do with her security. But in this Bill we are speaking specifically about the security of our own State. In the beginning stages the British Navy really provided the necessary protection for the upholding of the Monroe Doctrine. It is noteworthy to read what William Spence Robertson had to say about it in the centennial address on the Monroe Doctrine in 1923. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If enunciation of the doctrine took courage on our part, it inspired but little fear in Europe. The real bulwark for the South Americans then and until long afterwards was the British Navy. For Britain did not favour European encroachment which would parcel put the economic empire which she had taken over from the nerveless hands of Spain.</block>

<p>Then, in latter years, we also find that outside factors assisted America and prevented them from what would have become necessary, viz. sending armies all over America. I may just mention the incident of the Venezuela border dispute of 1896 where there would have been a war. Luckily there was a Jameson raid here and Britain pulled back. The same happened with Napoleon III and Mexico where luckily there was a civil war and it was not necessary.</p>

<p>I want to make it quite clear that just as little as I am prepared to use this House to advocate a blank cheque for South Africa in international involvement, as I would have done if I had to get up to support the views of the hon. member for Yeoville, just as little am I prepared&#x2014;and this I direct to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;to have the position under clause (1)(c) unless it is amended in the Committee Stage, and I hope therefore that he will give serious consideration to the suggestions put forward by the hon. member for Durban Point.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I think I should convey my sincere thanks to most hon. members for the sense of responsibility they displayed during the discussion of this Bill. In past years, particularly since I have been the Minister concerned, I have always found a sense of responsibility in such measure very gratifying, and I thank the official Opposition in particular for our having been able to reach this understanding in respect of defence. This came from both sides, and I think it was <span class="col_501-502" refersTo="page_0267"/>greatly to the benefit of our Defence Force and of our attempt to elevate our Defence Force above party disputes. Therefore, I think we can all state with pride that the S.A. Defence Force is today giving us reason to be proud of it. Therefore I also think, in the second place, that the morale of the S.A. Defence Force is exceptionally high, because they have the feeling that when matters concerning them are debated in Parliament it is done in a responsible manner and in such a manner that they are not prejudiced by it. Of course this does not mean to say that there were no differences of opinion from time to time, but I think the general premise was that we should protect the S.A. Defence Force and that we should make it feel that Parliament stands united behind it. That is also why we made use of Select Committees in the past. When we were dealing with difficult Bills, I gave prior notice that after the principle had been accepted, we would take the basis of that principle to a Select Committee to try to iron out the particulars in detail among ourselves. But the question I ask myself is why the hon. members of the Progressive Party want a Select Committee. As I see it they want a Select Committee because they differ with us on fundamental issues, and also because there appear to be fundamental differences within their own ranks as well. I say this is a pity. I find it regrettable that although we have for so many years now been able to adopt a unified standpoint on the Defence Force, although we differed with one another on lesser details&#x2014;which is most certainly the right of every hon. member in this House&#x2014;the Progressive Party has, since its establishment, wanted to introduce a new element of strife within South Africa&#x2019;s Defence Force. I can find no other explanation for their behaviour. I do not want to refer back to the old debates. However, the hon. member for Sea Point raised this matter, and I am in fact replying to it. He refused to vote in favour of this House expressing its concern at the Russian-Cuban presence in Angola, and he refused to agree that this could possibly bring about aggression against South West Africa. [Interjections.] He refused to vote in favour of this House and the Government taking steps to prevent this. He refused to vote in favour, in view of those threats, of all reasonable steps being taken to fail that aggression, and what is more, Sir, he refused to vote in favour of this House conveying its appreciation to the South African soldiers. [Interjections.] He is now saying that it was a trick of the Prime Minister. Sir, this is an even more serious matter. In other words, when this House is asked to express its confidence in this manner, then it is a game. When does the Progressive Party wish to express its confidence then?</p>

<p>But surely it was that hon. member who involved Angola in his actions against the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister told him what we were doing. But let us go a little further. The hon. member has a way of making statements very readily. He said that I was inserting provisions in this Bill because I myself doubted whether I had acted within the law in respect of Angola. Where does the hon. member get that from? I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The clauses referred to in clause 11 of the Bill operate with retrospective effect in order to obviate any doubt which may exist on the legality of actions taken to date.</block>

<p>It is not that I had any doubts on this score, for, when I discussed the Angolan issue in this House, I said that I had received legal opinion which substantiated my actions. I said that I had obtained legal advice. But other people in the country, including the hon. member, had doubts, and therefore we were rectifying the matter so that even doubters such as he could see the light in the future. [Interjections.] The hon. member is asking me to make a statement on what Dr. Kissinger is alleged to have said. Was the hon. member not present here when the Prime Minister spoke, when the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke, and when I said that we have not gone into Angola in a self-righteous manner? Was he not listening? Was he not listening when we said that for diplomatic and other reasons we were not able to spell everything out then?

<p>When Dr. Kissinger sneezes, you believe him, but when the Prime Minister speaks, then it is a trick.

If what they are preaching should succeed in South Africa, it would be of no avail having a Defence Force. A Defence Force would no longer be necessary, for then South Africa would be committed to surrender.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to volunteers. Who is abolishing the right to use volunteers? Where does the hon. member read that? It is not stated in the motion of the hon. member for Durban Point, nor is it stated in the Bill. In spite of what is stated in the Act, Volunteers were used in 1939. This was Government policy at the time. What is now being inserted in the Act, is that the Government, in time of war, should have the right to use every able-bodied citizen to perform certain tasks.</p>

<p>The hon. member must take her medicine this afternoon. The hon. member for Rondebosch said that he was very impressed by the programme of civil action in the north of South West Africa. It impressed him immensely. However, Owambo and Kavango are not the only two places where civil action is taking place. After all, civil action is taking place in the Republic of South Africa as well. It is happening every day. The additional civil action which is taking place there, is taking place precisely because those people do not yet have the means to introduce the civil action of a well-ordered State. Does he not understand this? In other words, the peace task which we are undertaking there is in fact to enable those people to reach a level where they can look after themselves. But surely civil action is taking place in the Republic as well. It is taking place on a very large scale, by way of all the services we are rendering or the upliftment work, or the educational work, and all the services which are being placed at the disposal of the population of South Africa by this House and other boards.</p>

<p>I now want to put this question to the hon. member: What forces constitute a threat to this civil action, and that civil action with which the hon. member was so impressed? At the moment these are the forces which are being unleased in Angola under Russian-Cuban guidance for it is they who, with their military force, wish to undo what is being done by means of civil action to the benefit of other people. Can the hon. member deny that? And how are they doing this? They are doing this by means of terrorism and terroristic activities, and also by causing an armed conflict when terrorism is combated. Does the hon. member not understand this? Surely it must be clear to him for did he not go there as the leader of &#x00E1; group! That civil action, and the civil action in all spheres in the Republic of South Africa, is being threatened today from one quarter only. The threat comes from those forces that wish to overthrow orderly government, and that force is terrorism. If terrorism cannot succeed, the element of intervention comes into play to <span class="col_505-506" refersTo="page_0269"/>intensify and escalate that terrorism by means of armed conflict.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am talking now, The Bill deals primarily with four matters which are aimed at improving the defence of the Republic of South Africa, for what we are dealing with is the defence of the Republic of South Africa. For this purpose South West Africa is included in the defence of the Republic of South Africa, as the legislation states. Our entire defence is based, not on aggression but on defence. It is stated in the Defence Act that the Republic of South Africa may in times of war and against terrorism be defended anywhere in South Africa. That is the first problem we have to contend with. This is not a problem which arose yesterday, it is a problem which has been present since 1912. For other reasons it was then perhaps less of a problem and more of a solution. In 1912 there were other wounds in South Africa that first had to heal. I think the leaders of the time, in their wisdom, inserted these words because they had to unite a people, a people which had then just emerged from a war with one another. Surely we cannot deny our history. The fact of the matter is that wounds had been inflicted and that there was mutual suspicion and mistrust. Those leaders tried, to the best of their ability, to bring the people together to defend the new Union of South Africa in such a way that wounds would not be re-opened. They did not always succeed in doing so. However, to define South Africa as a geographic concept produced problems at the time and is still producing problems today. If the designation were to be removed, section 95 would have to be amended accordingly. This is clear to me. Therefore one either inserts a better definition of South Africa or Southern Africa there, and one spells it out clearly in the light of new circumstances, or it has to disappear. It is one of two choices. In my introductory speech I said that even a definition of what comprises South Africa can produce problems for one. I readily concede that.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, something else has happened. Hon. members quoted what took place in 1957 when a motion was introduced in this House on the part of the Opposition in favour of which members who were then sensible, but who are today Progressives, voted. I hope they are more sensible than those who are here, and that that is why they are not here. They are now using other people to do the work for them here. I said that something else happened, and I am referring to the introduction of compulsory national service. This created a completely different picture in South Africa. It did not exist in 1939, nor in 1957. Compulsory national service has only been, introduced during the past few years, as a result of a joint investigation which took place, and not as a result of a motion of mine as Minister, for when I became Minister, the process was already in progress. Therefore I do not want to take credit for it, for it was the product of a joint investigation by Defence Force, leaders and members of the public, prominent people from our communities. That investigation was carried out on the instructions of the then State President. It was then requested that Parliament give attention to whether the time had not arrived for the introduction of compulsory military service as a principle in the Defence Act, hut always still &#x201C;in defence of the Republic of South Africa&#x2019;&#x2019;. This confronted us with a new situation, the results of which we as Parliament have perhaps not dealt with sufficiently, for under the system of compulsory national service there is a force-in-being at the disposal of the Minister of Defence. It is stated thus in the Act. The Minister of Defence may employ that force-in-being, which was established under compulsory military service, anywhere in defence of the Republic of South Africa. This is the legal opinion I obtained, and I think that this legal opinion is correct. This new situation then arose, and I personally, and those who have to advise me, are experiencing difficulty in reaching clarity on what is meant by this vague concept of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>According to the motion of the Progressive Party some people think that &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; means nothing more than simply a meandering corridor all around the borders of the former protectorates. They and Dr. Hertzog now agree on this point, they are kindred spirits. However, I do not think that this was what was understood under &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; in the <span class="col_507-508" refersTo="page_0270"/>Defence Act, for the military view of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; is that there is a military theatre in which South Africa&#x2019;s interests lie, and that this is far wider than our mere borders. The military view is most certainly that it extends at least as far as the equator, and that it extends further seawards than merely along our coastline. There must also be seaward defence of South Africa; its security must also be ensured at sea. This makes the problem of giving a definition of &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; even greater. We must not concentrate solely on defence by the army. In any balanced actions in defence of South Africa the army will to a large extent be dependent on air and naval support, as was also the case recently. I want to point out that South Africa did not recently take action by means of the army only; it also took action by means of the air force and the navy, which played a part in support of the army. Consequently I reconsidered the position, and I am quite prepared to have the motion of the hon. member for Durban Point placed on the Order Paper as an instruction. [Interjections.] I have already discussed this with the law advisers, and in consultation with them a motion in this regard is being prepared. They will also discuss it with the hon. member. Notice of the motion will be given tomorrow so that we will be able to give an additional instruction to the Committee of the Whole House. I admit candidly that this is completely in the spirit in which there has always been consultation on the Defence Act, and I am therefore not ashamed to accept a motion of the hon. member for Durban Point. In any case he has always negotiated with me in the right spirit on matters affecting the Defence Force. I appreciate this on his part, and he knows that I do so. However, this does not detract from the fact that from time to time we oppose one another very strenuously on other matters. But surely we are adults in this House, and not so childish that we wish to turn everything into a party-political game, as the group of hon. members sitting over there wish to do.</p>

<p>However, there is another point I want to make. It is of course possible for agreements between South Africa and neighbouring countries to arise, for example non-aggression treaties, or agreements in terms of which they will jointly oppose the communist danger in Southern Africa, for there are States that are better disposed towards these matters than the Progressive Party. In such a case the agreement will be submitted to Parliament. I cannot imagine our concluding a defence agreement with another country without submitting the essential principles of it to Parliament. After all, this is most certainly the practice, but what is more, it is also sound common sense. It is not stated thus anywhere in the Defence Act, but it shall be done. Out of such agreements a situation of armed conflict may arise, in which South Africa will have certain obligations, which could possibly result from attacks made on the various States. It could then be in South Africa&#x2019;s interests to help ensure that the lawful governments of those countries are protected. Of course armed conflict could also arise in that terrorism has to be combated, as we recently experienced. In the first place South Africa considered itself primarily involved in the combating of terrorism and terroristic activities. But the next thing South Africa knew was it was confronted with an armed conflict beyond its border as a result of the intervention of forces that had effected an arms build-up on our borders, of forces which constituted a threat to those interests for which South Africa was responsible. I say in all honesty to my friends opposite that however much I want to help them it is not even possible to ask for parliamentary authorization at such a time.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am prepared to report properly on such a matter at the next ensuing session of Parliament. If matters were to develop into a state of war, the Defence Act provides that the State President may then declare a state of war, and he then has to summon Parliament within 30 days, not for the purposes of review, but to discuss it. My standpoint is that occasions may arise when <span class="col_509-510" refersTo="page_0271"/>we shall have to act, and that it would not be in the interests of the country to summon Parliament at that stage since the crisis situation could by so doing be made far worse than it might in fact be. The Government gave attention to all these matters. Let me say&#x2014;I do not think I am divulging a secret when I say this&#x2014;that the Government recently gave attention to all these matters, but if we had, at a given moment, come to this Parliament and requested the powers which we required at that stage to go further, we would have wanted to commit larger forces, and we would not have ended where we did in fact end. The Government did not want to summon Parliament because it did not want to go further than its limited objective. I have already spelled this out very clearly here.</p>

<p>There is a third matter to which I want to refer. Suppression and prevention of terrorism or terroristic activities, for the purposes of employment in terms of section 95, are deemed to be service against an enemy in time of war. I want to emphasize this. The proposed new section 103 <i>ter</i> and 103 <i>quat,</i> contained in clause 8, offers indemnity in connection with the combating of terrorism and terroristic activities. Why is this the case? This only applies to the indemnity of a member of the S.A. Defence Force against proceedings, as it is stated in the proposed section 103<i>ter</i> (2), by reason of any act &#x201C;advised, commanded, ordered, directed or done&#x2019;&#x2019;, in the service of the State in any operational area. Therefore this would also apply in the suppression of any internal disorder if the Defence Force is called in. However, this only applies when he acted in good faith, according to instructions, in the performance of his operational duties. Let me put it in another way: If a soldier in one military area who is not under orders were to go out and attack, assault, injure or kill a private individual, he will not receive indemnity under this section, for he has then committed a crime. In time of war a court martial will deal with him. However, if he hurts someone in good faith in the performance of his duties imposed on him by a higher authority, we do not want that soldier to be dragged before a court while he was merely carrying out the commands and instructions of a higher authority. That is all that is at issue.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Is it the Afrikaans text which is applicable? In the Afrikaans text it is clear that he may only act in good faith and that he may be indemnified when he is under orders. It is not as clear from the English version.</p>

<p>This morning I asked the law advisers to tell me whether they thought there was a difference. They assured me that there is no difference between the Afrikaans and English texts. However, these are matters we could look at again in the Committee Stage. I am not a lawyer. I did study law for a while at university, and I learned one thing from that experience, namely that lawyers and economists are dangerous people. This is at the same time my reply to the hon. member for East London City. My information, therefore, is that there is no difference between the two versions as they are stated in the English and Afrikaans texts. I have read them, and personally I find no difference between the two either.</p>

<p>There is a fourth matter to which I want to refer, namely the amendment in respect of the Moratorium Act. This amendment is the furthest we are able to go in this connection.</p>

<p>These are the four most important matters we are dealing with. Why, then, all the fuss on the part of the Progressive Party? By now they have placed us in the category of world powers which are waging campaigns of conquest, apparently under the leadership of General Eglin and General Slabbert!</p>

<p>This is not such an easy matter. We have already discussed it with organized commerce, specifically with bodies such as the Handelsinstitut, the Chamber of Commerce, if I am not mistaken, and other major organizations as well. We came up against very great problems. I do not think that a Select Committee, or even this House, can solve those problems. After all, the lessor also has rights. He has to pay interest on capital, and in many cases he is probably also a person who is affected by this legislation. That is why I believe that a solution to this problem should rather be sought outside Parliament, for example, by holding discussions with building societies, and that it should not be solved by means of legislation. We have already made great progress with employers, after holding discussions with them on the payment of their employees. Let me give you an example. Out of a total of 5 000 persons who were called up to serve in the Citizen Force, there were only, according to a survey which was made, 103 persons who were not being paid in full by their employers. This was as a result of the efforts which the Defence Force and I personally made to persuade employers to pay their employees properly. I think that we should try to solve this problem in that way&#x2014;I am not saying that we shall succeed&#x2014;rather than to introduce legislation. In any case I do not know what to do about this problem, nor do I think that we shall find a solution to it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point also objected to the concept of &#x201C;terroristic activities&#x201D;. He said there was no such thing. Well, I have learned one thing, and that is that in these times in which we are living there is no such thing as something which one has to describe as non-existent. As long as we are dealing with the clever plans from Moscow we will encounter all kinds of things of this nature. I see in <i>Webster&#x2019;s Third New International Dictionary,</i> page 2361, that &#x201C;terroristic&#x201D; is given as &#x201C;the adjective pertaining to terrorism&#x201D;. I think that that is a good source to quote. Consequently it seems to me that we are right. The difficulty is that as soon as one formulates terrorism too much for our purposes one may run the risk of paralysing oneself, for it manifests itself in various ways.</p>

<p>Let me furnish an example of what I mean. At a certain place a terrorist attack occurred, and murder was committed. Subsequently a state of confusion developed among a part of the population there. Precisely as a result of our military actions there, one of our soldiers requires protection today in terms of these provisions. What happened? Patrols were sent out. Insurgents had painted slogans on the road and when the patrols were not there they had victimized the local population and demonstrated by means of the slogans what would happen to them. They dream up new methods of blackmailing the population every day. In carrying out their task one patrol apprehended certain people. They were warned to remain where they were, but they fled. In the precipitate flight, which occurred at night, shots were fired and one of their number was wounded. Surely we have to afford that soldier protection. After all, he did not deliberately shoot an innocent person. He was protecting innocent people. That is what we are trying to do here. I am mentioning this to indicate to the hon. member how one is constantly dealing with new methods of terroristic activities.</p>

<p>The hon. members said that they did not like my appointing the Compensation Board. Yet they allow me to appoint the Board of Review. They also allow me to appoint the Staff Board. I may appoint the leaders of the Defence Force, but I may not appoint the Compensation Board. It seems so illogical to me. The hon. member for East London City said he does not trust me; that is why he does not want this. He wants this Board to be appointed by someone else. He caused the hon. member for Durban Point to find himself in a difficult spot. The hon. member should not discuss matters before he has consulted the hon. member for Durban Point, who will be able to furnish him with very sound advice and who will also advise him not to make such unnecessary statements here. I want to tell that hon. member now that I do not intend accepting that amendment, and that I have no intention either of avoiding my obligations, for this side of the House trusts me.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is not necessary for such an hon. member, who has not been long in Parliament, to display his ignorance here. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the hon. member introduced that note here, for we were arguing with one another on an entirely different basis. However, I want to dispose of this matter with the greatest possible dispatch. When I need the advice of a judge and I call him in for that purpose, it does not mean to say that it is an inferior judge because I am asking him. In exactly the same way a judge is not inferior because he is appointed by the Minister of Justice to the Supreme Court or to the Appeal Court, and is subsequently even asked to express an opinion on Government matters. That is a nonsensical argument.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Albany. He asked about &#x201C;action in excess of hot pursuit&#x201D;. This could of course happen. Something like this could result from an engagement with terrorists. As I have said, there is no time for Parliament to be summoned, and it is impossible for us to undertake to summon Parliament shortly afterwards, for conflicts of that kind may arise several times in a space of a month or two. Should we then summon Parliament for every conflict? I think we should leave this matter in the hands of any reasonable Government. If a Government knows that its country is so divided on an issue that it first has to come to Parliament to settle it, it shall do so. This has happened in the past. However, if the Government knows that it has the support of the bulk of its population, of the electorate, in respect of the safeguarding of its borders, it would be a weak Government that does not take action.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville referred to war pensions and &#x201C;disablement&#x201D;. This falls under other legislation&#x2014;not under this legislation. It is the domain of another department. I do not administer pensions. I shall help the hon. member to obtain the greatest possible benefits for soldiers, but this is not relevant here.</p>

<p>There are other bodies which collect funds. The hon. member for Green Point referred to assistance outside the sphere of legislation. That is correct. There are certain bodies that are collecting funds today. There is a registered welfare organization, the Southern Cross Fund, and I hope that everyone in the country will support that organization. It is a bilingual organization. It is an organization that is trying to serve the entire population. That fund is being utilized in many cases to alleviate problems. Then there are the services of the S.A. Legion, which always receives favourable support from me. Furthermore, there is the Governor-General &#x2019; s Fund, to which one could also perhaps look for possible assistance.</p>

<p>Then the question of &#x201C;professional armies and volunteers&#x201D; was raised. But surely South Africa cannot maintain a permanent force on a large scale. South Africa is a country which, like Switzerland, Sweden, Israel and to a large extent France, which is a bigger country than ours, makes use of compulsory military service to augment its Permanent Force. Although South Africa should have a larger Permanent Force&#x2014;and I am in favour of this&#x2014;it will not be able to escape the obligations it will have to impose on national servicemen and on its Citizen Force and Commandos. Therefore the hon. member for Yeoville was really not making any contribution by advocating this.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell the hon. member for Sea Point that the right to make use of volunteers is in no way being abolished by this proposed legislation. It is a question of Government policy, and if a Government wishes to go and fight with volunteers only, it is still at liberty to say that it only wants volunteers. Where in the Bill is it stated that this is not allowed? When did the hon. member for Durban Point imply anything of the kind? He merely asked that when we take action against terrorism we should call up everyone who should be called up in terms of the Act to deal with terrorism and an armed conflict which constitutes a threat to the security of our country. If one is called up, everyone should be called up. However, I can imagine, if we wish to take action as we did at the time of the Korean War, when we only needed a handful of people, that we will in fact call for volunteers. We did not call up the whole of South Africa to go and fight in Korea. This is the reason for the existence of the element of voluntariness in the legislation. It is not being prevented. But when South Africa is threatened, when the security of the Republic is at stake, for example in the case of war, terrorism or terroristic action against the interests of South Africa, or in the case of an armed conflict which, in the opinion of the State President, may be a threat to the security of the country, it is deemed to be the duty of everyone to protect the security of <span class="col_515-516" refersTo="page_0274"/>South Africa. Whether or not the hon. member likes the Government of the day does not matter. It is the duty of everyone to do so, just as it would have been the duty of everyone in 1939 if there had been an attack on the borders of the country. I am readily prepared to admit that it would be a poor South African who, if his country&#x2019;s borders were threatened, refused to take up arms to defend it.</p>

<p>The official Opposition and the Government will simply have to continue to take the steps necessary to make the soldiers feel that Parliament is behind them.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The proposed Bill creates a statutory offence if and when a person purports to act as a representative of the State, Armaments Board and/or Armscor and who while posing as such a representative inquires about the availability of armaments and/or negotiates the possible procurement of armaments.</p>

<p>Certain sections have been provided to ease or facilitate the application of the proposed Bill, with special reference to difficulties and/or problems which are expected to arise with respect to the jurisdiction of the courts and the acceptability of witnesses.</p>

<p>Let us first of all deal with circumstances that give rise to the necessity for legislation of this nature. In the time we are living in, so-called &#x201C;gun-running&#x201D; offers excessive profits for the &#x201C;runner&#x201D; or agent. This results in persons representing themselves both within the Republic and in foreign countries as accredited agents of the Republic, the Armaments Board and/or Armscor. In this guise, they make inquiries about the availability of armaments, enter into negotiations for the supply thereof and endeavour to establish agency agreements with foreign suppliers. This conduct could and in practice does create embarrassment, hampers official procurement, causes prices to be increased unnecessarily and often results in serious security risks. To cope with this problem, it is proposed that such misrepresentation be prohibited and that the necessary penalties be imposed for offences.</p>

<p>It is my intention to deal only with the cardinal points covered in the Bill. The contents of clause 2 of the Bill comprise</p>

<p>Those actions that constitute an offence;</p>

<p>Those persons who may be guilty of an offence;</p>

<p>The punishment applicable.</p>

<p><span class="col_517-518" refersTo="page_0275"/>The offence of false representation as accredited agent <i>ipso facto</i> entails the acquisition of weapons, information about weapons, the manufacturing rights as regards weapons by way of licences, patents, or other such means. It is not only the acquisition of such information, but also making inquiries about such information which constitutes such an offence. The prohibition of such conduct applies not only to the Republic, but also to other countries where, in many instances, such conduct may occur.</p>

<p>The sentence applicable is a maximum fine of R5 000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years or both the fine and the imprisonment. The penalty proposed bears relationship to the attractiveness of the weapons trade and the negative repercussions which irresponsible actions impose on our national security and can be regarded as a sufficient deterrent.</p>

<p>Clause 3 read in conjunction with clause 4 makes it possible to prosecute in the Republic of South Africa, as the offence is deemed to have been committed at the place where the accused happens to be in the Republic of South Africa. These provisions are necessary as the offences may, as mentioned previously, be committed outside the jurisdiction of the courts of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 5 of the Bill. As will often happen, a witness may not be available or may not be prepared to give evidence before a court in the Republic of South Africa, as he may reside abroad or because of the adverse publicity involved and/or because the negotiations he participated in are prohibited by law or regulation in his own country. To provide the court with sufficient evidence in a prosecution, it is proposed that provision be made for admission as evidence in a trial, the evidence given under oath of a witness taken down in writing&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) in the presence of the accused;</li>

<li>(b) by an officer having functions and responsibilities corresponding to functions and responsibilities in the Republic of South Africa, either of a judge or a magistrate or of a consular officer,</li>

</ol>

<p>and which statement shall be authenticated in the prescribed manner. This clause merely facilitates the proof of offences committed outside the Republic of South Africa without derogating from the high standards of justice maintained by the courts of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>To conclude, it should be pointed out that the provisions of clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill are in principle identical to sections 3, 4 and 7 of the Civil Aviation Offences Act, No. 10 of 1972, as amended, and that the only new provision is that contained in clause 2 of the Bill which creates the offence.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support the Second Reading of this Bill. However, we have one objection. It is not really an objection, but a suggestion for the improvement of procedure in regard to the procurement of evidence from abroad as provided in clause 5 of the Bill. Like the hon. the Minister of Defence, I am not a lawyer, but even to me as a layman the procedure envisaged looks clumsy. The accused can only be arrested in the Republic of South Africa; we cannot arrest him abroad. The person must therefore be arrested here and subsequently he will have to be taken overseas to be present for the purposes of obtaining a statement. Subsequently he has to be brought back for a hearing.</p>

<p>My learned friend, the hon. member for Green Point, will propose the establishment of a proven and recognized legal procedure in regard to the procurement of overseas evidence, a procedure which we believe will represent a great improvement. However, this is a matter which I am merely mentioning now and which I shall deal with further at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>We shall never eliminate entirely the evil of the gun runner&#x2014;that is impossible. They are like vultures. Wherever there is something to scavenge they will be there. Consequently we shall have to attempt to deal with them by any means possible and that is the aim of this Bill.</p>

<p>The unauthorized middleman who steps in not only poses a danger to the country, but also pushes up the price of the armaments we buy. This prejudices the interests of South Africa. It is a very easy way to make a quick profit without risk. However, such an offender will now have to run the risk of falling foul of this Act.</p>

<p>We must admit that we are exceptionally vulnerable as far as the procurement of armaments is concerned. With a few exceptions, <span class="col_519-520" refersTo="page_0276"/>we cannot trade or compete on the free market. Secrecy is necessary, therefore, and the more secrecy there is, the more opportunities are there for the person who wants to abuse them illegally and in conflict with the interests of South Africa. Part of the normal check which would otherwise be carried out by Parliament is now withdrawn from Parliament because the necessary secrecy means that we cannot discuss prices and sources in Parliament. A heavy responsibility rests on the hon. the Minister and on the Armaments Board.</p>

<p>For interest&#x2019;s sake and in passing I just want to mention that the Bill calls to mind a purchase which another South African government department effected through a certain middleman. I refer of course to the Cuban Viscounts which we bought. Today we are getting our hardware from Cuba via another middleman. I must admit that I prefer the middleman we are using today to the one we used then to purchase Cuban Viscounts. The price we are paying now is perhaps a little lower and there is much glory for the middleman who is at present placing some of that hardware in our hands.</p>

<p>One day it will be possible for an interesting history to be written. However, we hope that the time will soon come when the restrictions on our markets for arms will be lifted and when we will again be able to trade on the free market. In the meantime a Bill such as this one is necessary and we on this side of the House support it, because we must have arms. We must obtain arms, since our men need them in order to defend our country. We shall vote for the Second Reading and the hon. member for Green Point will deal with the amendment to which I referred.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member for Durban Point displayed very sound judgment, something which we also perceived in his support of the Defence Amendment Bill. The hon. member quite rightly said that the vultures abroad who seek carrion to peddle cannot be kept in check by means of this legislation. However, it is important for one to make an effort to check their activities and clip their wings a little.</p>

<p>&#x2020; The procurement of modern armaments is a very onerous task. Parliament, therefore, found it necessary to create machinery to assist the Department of Defence and the hon. the Minister in this difficult task. I am referring to the Armaments Board, as well as to the Armaments Development and Production Corporation.</p>

<p>This Bill has to do with the procurement of armaments in its widest concept. Because of its sensitive nature it is a very difficult and delicate task to negotiate the procurement of armaments. Because of South Africa&#x2019;s past and present position, great care should be exercised even by authorized people with knowledge and years of experience in the handling of such matters, let alone by people with no knowledge or experience in this field at all. These people may very well jeopardize a specific procurement by their actions. They may even jeopardize the security of the State directly or indirectly. The latter arguments and the existence of the two armament organizations are the basis of the principles which are to be considered in this Bill.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, in order to understand fully certain principles in this Bill, we must begin by understanding that very unnatural and heavy restrictions have been imposed on the acquisition of armaments under present circumstances as a result of the interference of UNO in transactions of this nature. Secondly: Owing to the age of technological armaments which we are living in, this is extremely difficult and at the moment the Department of Defence must gear itself to specialized tasks and provide the services required for a better understanding of these specialized tasks, and perhaps we can take a brief introductory look at the responsibility of the S.A. Defence Force in this regard. Taking into account the Republic&#x2019;s appreciation of its threats, it is the task of the S.A. Defence Force to draw up and define the operational need for the necessary armaments for the combating of this threat and in addition, to plan the tactical deployment thereof. Supplementary to this, we could say that the armaments organizations have to build up a certain knowledge in their own ranks by means of which they can make these armaments available. Looking at these tasks of the armaments organizations, we can say that it is their task <i>inter alia</i> to build up knowledge of armaments available throughout the world. It is their task, too, to identify and establish sources and channels from which and through which armaments can be made available to us, <span class="col_521-522" refersTo="page_0277"/>to become acquainted with the operational possibilities and possibilities of application of armaments and to be possessed of sufficient knowledge of armaments to be in a position to determine whether armaments purchased will meet the operational requirements of the S.A. Defence Force. They must be acquainted, too, with the manufacturing potential of the industries. We can purchase these armaments, we can have the best and the finest armaments in the world, and this will mean nothing if we are unable to maintain them. One could continue in this way to refer to research programmes, modernization programmes and the levels of skill necessary to effect the modernization of armaments in order to combat new threats. I could continue in this vein, but what I have just mentioned illustrates to a sufficient degree the principle contained in this legislation, viz. that the armaments organizations, in their own ranks, and in co-operation with the Defence Force, have the knowledge and the ability necessary to deal most effectively with the aspect of acquisition. What is most important is that they have the knowledge and that they will need no outsiders to assist them, people without experience or any knowledge who go trudging around abroad making enquiries or purchasing armaments. We note that there are three types of person usually involved in gunrunning abroad. The first kind is the person who has the interests of the Republic and the interests of our Defence Force at heart and who becomes involved in such transactions and matters merely by chance and in good faith. The second type is the person who intentionally goes abroad, has the interests of the Republic of South Africa at heart in good faith, but who tries to make as much money as possible as quickly as possible out of these transactions. The third type is the most dangerous, viz. the kind of person who wants to make sure whatever the circumstances that he is able to obtain armaments for the Government illegally without being concerned as to whether he may be jeopardizing existing relationships, existing contracts and existing agreements, or that he may be compromising the relationships we have built up so far with friendly peoples in view of the present attitude of the UNO in regard to armaments transactions. This legislation is aimed at restricting the activities of these people. There are two kinds of activities these people undertake. The first thing these ferrets do is to go abroad, as I have just mentioned, to attempt to procure armaments or to make inquiries about them. The second kind of ferret goes abroad intentionally in order to try to gain agencies and then bring these to the Republic and by so doing enrich himself. In supporting this legislation, one is inclined to ask oneself whether clause 2 of this Bill goes far enough. Clause 2 of the Bill as it reads at present only concerns those persons who purport to represent the state in South Africa or elsewhere and effect transactions or make inquiries in regard to armaments. The second type of person is one who purports to want to enter into agency agreements on behalf of the State, Board or Corporation. These matters have already been discussed with the hon. the Minister and with the legal advisers, and with the permission of the hon. the Minister we shall quite probably move in the Committee Stage that the agency gunrunners, too, be restricted.</p>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have no quarrel with the principle of this Bill, which, as is clearly stated in the preamble, is to prohibit an unauthorized person from purporting to represent the State in matters relating to arms transactions. I think that we are all at one that carpet-bagging in arms is a practice which, while making enormous profits for individuals and individual groups, does no good for the countries which these people purport to represent. The problem that I have in relation to this Bill flows from the remarks made by the hon. Minister in his opening speech, where he said that the purpose of the Bill was to deal with the offence of false representation as an accredited agent. Using the word &#x201C;false&#x201D; in his opening speech and using the word &#x201C;unauthorized&#x201D; in the preamble to the Bill, the Minister fails to give an absolutely clear meaning to it in the Bill.</p>

<p>The words used in clause 2 refer to &#x201C;any person who, in the Republic or elsewhere, purports&#x201D; to do a particular act. My difficulty is that someone may purport to do something and at the same time in fact be doing something. Purporting is not necessarily pretending. The <i>Shorter Oxford Dictionary&#x2019;s</i> definition of the word &#x201C;purport&#x201D; is &#x201C;to have as its purport&#x201D;, &#x201C;to convey to the mind&#x201D;, &#x201C;to mean&#x201D;, &#x201C;to imply&#x201D;, &#x201C;to profess or claim by its tenor&#x201D;. In Webster&#x2019;s <i>Third International Dictionary</i> the word &#x201C;purport&#x201D; is defined as &#x201C;to convey&#x201D;, &#x201C;to imply or profess outwardly <span class="col_523-524" refersTo="page_0278"/>as meaning&#x201D;, &#x201C;intention of true character&#x201D;. What I am intending to say is that to use the word &#x201C;purport&#x201D; in the Bill is not to give effect to the meaning, completely and clearly, of a false representation or, as is stated in the title, an unauthorized representation. In the Afrikaans section it is of course much better, because the word &#x201C;voorgee&#x201D; is used, and in the <i>Verklarende Afrikaanse Woordeboek</i> by Kritzinger and Pienaar, the word &#x201C;voorgee&#x201D; means &#x201C;om te beweer&#x201D;, which is to allege, or &#x201C;voorwend&#x201D;, which is to pretend, to feign or to simulate, or &#x201C;om die skyn te gee&#x201D;, which is to give the impression. Therefore, whereas we support the principle of the Bill, we are not certain that the exact meaning as interpreted in the speech of the hon. the Minister and in the title of the Bill is in fact contained in that clause. I would ask the Minister perhaps in the Committee Stage to give a thought to clarifying that, and I will certainly move an amendment to that effect.</p>

<p>The second point was passingly dealt with by the hon. member for Durban Point, and relates to the clause which provides for the taking of evidence in writing of witnesses who are not able to appear in a court case relating to a matter of this nature in South Africa. Whereas it is quite clear that there is a need for this sort of provision, the difficulty, as I see it, is that there is no method outlined in this Bill of cross-examination or of putting questions to a person who would give evidence in this way. We feel that a far better way of dealing with the taking of evidence from people who are overseas and who cannot be brought here would be to incorporate the necessary provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1955, the Criminal Code, relating to taking evidence on commissions, and in particular relating to interrogatories. For instance, section 236 of the Criminal Code, relating to interrogatories, says that any party to any criminal proceedings in which a commission is issued may transmit any interrogatory in writing which the court directing the commission may think relevant to the issue, and the magistrate or other person to whom the commission is directed shall examine the witness upon such interrogatory.</p>

<p>Now, the situation is that when a statement in terms of this Bill is brought into South Africa and used in a court, it is quite correct that the accused person through his counsel could query that document and could deal with it in argument in one form or another and could even lead evidence relating to such a document. The written word cannot, however, be cross-examined and the nuances of evidence given by means of a statement of this sort cannot be dealt with. I feel that the position is fully covered by section 236 of the Criminal Code, which authorizes the court to allow questions to be put in writing to such a person so that such replies can then also be taken into account. So while supporting the principle of the Bill, there are these two matters which I think are relevant, and we will be moving the necessary amendments in the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#vlok">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, pointed out to us that the Progressive Reform Party supports the principle of this Bill, and one is very grateful for that. It is very good to notice this positive action from those quarters. [Interjection.] Yes, as the hon. member here says, it is probably after the hiding which they received. The hon. member for Sandton mentioned that they foresee problems with the word &#x201C;purport&#x201D; in the English text and also with the submission of evidence. I think we will be able to thrash out this matter in the Committee Stage quite easily. We are also very grateful for the attitude adopted by the official Opposition as put forward by the hon. member for Durban Point. This is responsible action on the part of the Opposition, and one can appreciate it.</p>

<p>Sir, seeing that we all agree now, I just want to point out briefly in what respect the actions of these so-called arms pedlars endanger the safety of South Africa. We notice that clause 2 of the Bill determines, <i>inter alia,</i> that a person who purports, without having the power to do so, to make inquiries about armaments or acquire information in regard thereto on behalf of the State or the Armaments Corporation, is guilty of an offence. It is essential that it must be so, because under present world conditions where the underhand buying and selling of weapons have become commonplace and where weapons or information is often acquired in a devious manner, it is obvious that conduct of this nature, these unauthorized actions, may seriously involve not only the name of South Africa, but also the security of the Republic. If people can purport freely without being authorized to do so, that they are negotiating on behalf of South Africa, the <span class="col_525-526" refersTo="page_0279"/>dangers attached to it are obvious; because when it comes to the conclusion of these so-called agreements and South Africa would quite rightly refuse to honour them our credibility would become involved and afterwards we could very easily find that, in future, an important door which should have been open to us in obtaining the necessary armaments, is closed with the real supplier. Only one loyalty counts with these unscrupulous weapon pedlars and so-called agents, and that is loyalty towards themselves. All they want to do, is to see how much money they can make out of these transactions and they will not hesitate hawking around everywhere, with the information they gathered in this manner, supposedly on behalf of South Africa, and taking advantage of it. It is obvious that this will deter prospective, sensitive suppliers from making contact with South Africa, and this may have very serious repercussions for South Africa&#x2019;s security in obtaining essential armaments. Therefore it is essential that everyone who wants to obtain armaments, and so on, on behalf of South Africa or the Armaments Board, must be able to prove that he is a properly authorized person. He must be able to identify himself. People with whom we negotiate in this way, must and will very quickly realize and know that every Tom, Dick and Harry cannot obtain armaments, and so on, on behalf of South Africa.</p>

<p>But clause 2 contains a further provision, namely that someone who purports to make enquiries on behalf of the State or the Armaments Corporation about the availability, and so on, of armaments, is also guilty of an offence, and it is good and right that this must be so, because this person who makes enquiries and noses around under the pretence that he is acting on behalf of South Africa, is prejudicing South Africa&#x2019;s security in a serious way. It is reasonably easy for the cunning operator who sails under false colours, to determine what the requirements of the Defence Force in certain respects are, by putting questions here and there. You would all agree, Sir, that this could be extremely dangerous for the Republic. Therefore it is high time that these people who are only bent on filling their own pockets, should be dealt with firmly. <i>Bona fide</i> and sincere agents and suppliers and sellers of armaments have nothing to fear from this Bill or from South Africa. We will still be able to obtain and purchase through these people certain armaments, which we might need from time to time. However, we can definitely do without the unscrupulous and dangerous arms pedlars.</p>

<p>I just want to make one final remark about a further provision of the Act. This offence could also be committed outside the Republic, and therefore clause 3 of the proposed Bill is, to my mind, quite justified. From the nature of the case a great many of the offences will be committed overseas, because that is where these arms pedlars operate. However, if we could get hold of such a person here, when he returns to this country to sell his wares to us, and we could punish him for any damages he caused us over there, I am sure he will think twice before doing this kind of thing again and then come back to us quite presumptuously. Therefore I think it is right that his actions, which take place overseas, should also be made an offence in this of this Act. It is so&#x2014;and one has to admit this&#x2014;that these measures may deter certain arms dealers, whom we could possibly have used, but the real, honest, <i>bona fide</i> supplier of arms or trader will still make contact with us and we shall still be able to obtain the necessary arms from him. I therefore want to support very strongly this Bill with all its provisions.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I obviously have nothing to disagree with the hon. member for Verwoerdburg about. I want to restrict myself entirely to some comments in regard to clause 5 of this Bill. As I see the position, the statement which is referred to in clause 5 might be the most important piece of evidence in a prosecution that arises from the circumstances covered by this Bill. I am referring to the statement made by a person outside the Republic whose presence cannot be procured within the Republic. One knows that a court of law, in dealing with written statements, assesses the value of that evidence by the extent to which it has been tested and by the extent to which the credibility of the witness has been tested. The hon. member for Sandton mentioned certain procedures under the Criminal Procedure Act. I believe that those can be applied, and there is consequently no need to include those sections, i.e. sections 235 to 238 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The court, in any case, can appoint a commission, or send interrogatories to a commissioner overseas. That applies, and it is consequently <span class="col_527-528" refersTo="page_0280"/>unnecessary to put this into the Act. The law of criminal procedure applies. However, it is difficult to visualize the circumstances in which a statement of this sort could be obtained. First of all, the accused person must be present, and we must remember that he will be in a foreign country. He cannot be taken under arrest from South Africa and detained under arrest by South African Police in that foreign country. There must be some peculiar circumstances to bring about the fact that he is present when the statement is made in front of a person who is authorized to record that statement. In order that that statement can be strenghtened, I believe the right should be given to the person charged to put questions to the deponent, i.e. the maker of the statement, and to have those questions and the answers recorded. Then, when that statement comes before a court in the Republic, and is presented as evidence, the accused will not be in a position to say that the statement is false, unless he had had the authority or opportunity to ask questions and did so. In terms of my suggestion, when he comes to court he will have had an opportunity to put questions, and to have those questions and answers recorded. I believe that would strengthen the hands of the court. I think hon. members of this House will agree with me that it would also strengthen the value of that statement if the accused had had the opportunity to put questions to the deponent at the time the statement was made, and it is not simply a statement handed in without there having been any opportunity of it being tested by the accused. I shall move, therefore, in the Committee Stage that authority should be given to the person who is to be charged in the Republic, and who is present when the statement is made, to put questions and have the questions and answers recorded by the official who is taking down the statement overseas. That is additional to the rights of the court in South Africa, when the matter comes up for trial, to apply sections 235 to 238 of the Criminal Procedure Act to issue a commission or interrogatories. That is the amendment I propose to suggest to the hon. the Minister. I know that he and my colleague, the hon. member for Durban Point, profess that they are not lawyers, so I thought I should mention the matter now in some detail in the Second Reading so that the legal advisers of the hon. the Minister can consider the suggestion I have made before it comes up in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. members for their support. It seems to me as if even the Progref Party had a change of heart. At least they want to help now to bring some order into the procurement of weapons. This is a first step. However, I think it is merely as a result of the behaviour of the hon. member for Sandton. He has a fine constituency; all I do not know is how he got there. All I can say, is that even with this measure, it will to my mind still be difficult to contain this evil. It is an attempt to contain it. With this I do not want to imply that one must throw up one&#x2019;s arms in despair and say that one can do nothing. However, we, as a Parliament, should at least help the Armaments Board to combat this evil as far as is possible.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Although this Bill is somewhat related to the coming independence of the Transkei, the provisions of this Bill may also apply to a homeland which is not becoming independent.</p>

<p>Since this Bill does not make direct provision for independence, I would like to remind hon. members that I have explained before that special legislation will be required for this. I may add that there is still a great deal to be done in this regard, and that I cannot yet set a possible date for this.</p>

<p>Although this Bill is not complicated in itself, I shall now briefly explain the contents clause by clause. Firstly, I shall deal with <span class="col_529-530" refersTo="page_0281"/>clauses 1 to 3 and 7 together. Hon. members will recall that the first composition of the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei consisted of 64 traditional members (chiefs) and 45 elected members, i.e. a ratio of 58%:42%. During 1967, and in terms of section 1 of Act 101 of 1967, the composition was amended as far as the ratio between paramount chiefs and chiefs was concerned, but the Legislative Assembly still consisted of 64 traditional members and 45 elected members. During 1971 the composition of the Legislative Assembly was once again amended by section 8 of Act 31 of 1971, by the creation of one additional &#x201C;chief&#x2019;s constituency&#x201D;, so that the assembly then consisted of 65 chiefs and 45 elected members. All this naturally took place at the request of the Transkei Legislative Assembly and Government.</p>

<p>During the previous Parliamentary session the composition was further amended to provide for the representation of the districts of Glen Grey and Herschel which were to be incorporated with the Transkei, and the number of traditional members and elected members was then increased for this purpose.</p>

<p>Since the first composition of the Transkei Legislative Assembly, the composition has therefore been amended three times and the numerical ratio between traditional members and elected members has changed from the original 64 chiefs as against 45 elected members to the present not more than 69 chiefs and 50 elected members.</p>

<p>The reasons for these changes varied from the creation of an additional paramount chieftainship, as was the case in the first assembly, and a corresponding decrease in the number of ordinary chiefs, to the granting of representation as a result of the incorporation of the additional territory to which I have just referred.</p>

<p>On the recommendation of the Recess Committee of the Legislative Assembly, the Transkei Government has now requested that the composition of the Transkei Legislative Assembly be further amended. While the body presently consists of the present five paramount chiefs, a number of chiefs&#x2014;not exceeding 69&#x2014;as well as 50 elected members, it is now being proposed that it will consist of five paramount chiefs, 70 chiefs and 75 elected members. This will therefore result in a composition ratio of 75 chiefs and paramount chiefs&#x2014;the &#x201C;traditional members&#x201D;&#x2014;on the one hand, and 75 elected members on the other hand. There will therefore be representation on a basis of 50% as against 50%, which should be compared with the previous basis of 58% traditional members as against 42% elected members.</p>

<p>The reason for the present request for the amendment of the composition is however quite different, because the purpose of the amendment is now to obtain equality of numbers between the traditional members and the elected members in the Legislative Assembly. This occurrence is naturally a historic one for the Transkei in that the preponderance of traditional authority in the Legislative Assembly will now disappear and that the traditional members and the elected members will be of equal number.</p>

<p>Hon. members are probably aware of the fact&#x2014;they will surely be able to recall this&#x2014;that this tendency has already manifested itself in Owambo, where the elected members actually have a numerical preponderance over the traditional members, with 42 elected members as against 35 traditional members. Previously the opposite applied.</p>

<p>In the Nyanda region one additional &#x201C;chief&#x2019;s constituency&#x201D;, if I may call it that, was created so that the district of Port St. Johns would also be represented by a chief in the Legislative Assembly.</p>

<p>Since the Transkei has been given districts instead of regions as electoral divisions, more chieftainships have been established in the district of Lusikisiki, and at the request of the paramount chief a redivision of &#x201C;chiefs constituencies&#x201D; has been made among the districts.</p>

<p>As far as clauses 4 and 6 are concerned, I must point out that it is essential to arrange various matters through agreement between the Government of the Republic and the Government of the Transkei, and also to grant the Transkei authority over civil aviation so that a start can now be made with the provision of airport facilities for the area by the Transkei Government. The objective of the amendments are therefore to place the two matters above within the legislative and executive authority of the Transkei.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with a consequential matter. At present the Controller and Auditor-General is responsible for the granting of credits to be issued from the Revenue Fund of the Homeland Governments, but as a result of the <span class="col_531-532" refersTo="page_0282"/>approval of the new Exchequer and Audit Act, 1975&#x2014;except in the case of the Transkei&#x2014;this will no longer be the case with effect from 1 April 1976. For the sake of uniformity it is therefore necessary that section 56 of the Transkei Constitution Act, 1963, which among other things provides that a warrant for the issue of money out of the Revenue Fund should be countersigned by the Controller and Auditor-General, should be appropriately amended.</p>

<p>Clause 8 contains the short title and arranges for the date of the coming into operation to be determined by proclamation.</p>

<p>This is briefly the entire matter, and I hope the Bill will be supported by members on all sides of this House.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has given us a clear and concise outline of what is embodied in this measure. As he has said, the principal part of the Bill deals with a change in the proportion of representation in the Transkei Assembly of those who are there as a result of holding a traditional office and those who are elected by the Transkei electorate. There are historical reasons for having both these elements represented. It is arguable as to whether they are better represented in a single chamber or in separate chambers. Nevertheless, we are faced with the situation where they are present in a single chamber and even if this change, which now brings the two elements into numerical parity with each other did not emanate from the Assembly itself, I think it is something we would accept. It is a change which seems to us to be desirable. This is the gravamen of clause 1, and clauses 2 and 3 are really consequential upon the change which is made in clause 1.</p>

<p>A second part of clause 1 deals with the redistribution of chieftainships in certain areas of Pondoland, and Port St. Johns in particular. This, apparently, is at the request of the paramount chief and other authorities in East Pondoland, and it accordingly has our support.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has indicated, clause 4 and 6 deal with the question of enabling the Government of the Transkei, prior to independence, to enter into treaties with the Government of the Republic. Because of the evolution of events, this is something which one can understand, and one can foresee the type of situation in which the two Governments would require the power to enter into treaties with each other. One normally enters into treaties with a body that is independent of oneself, but circumstances could arise, and no doubt will, which will require an agreement to come into existence prior to independence. It is rather like entering into an agreement with a company about to be formed, to put it in terms of the commercial life of this country.</p>

<p>Clause 4 also deals with the empowering of the Government of the Transkei to deal with civil aviation, something which is acceptable to us. Finally, there is the clause that is consequent upon changes in the Exchequer and Audit Act, which provides that it is no longer necessary for the Controller and Auditor-General to exercise his authority in respect of the treasury and the activities of the Minister of Finance of the Transkei. That being so, the measure will have our support at the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my appreciation to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana for the good sense which the official Opposition is beginning to display in respect of the homelands and their development.</p>

<p>This Bill encompasses two very important matters. The one is that the number of elected representatives is now being brought on a par with the number of traditional representatives. When looking at this one can see that it shows a tendency towards democracy. In the time in which we are living, this says a great deal, especially when one looks at what is happening in the rest of Africa. One sees that in the large majority of African states democracy is completely thrown overboard. Here in the Transkei we have the situation that, what the recess committee of the Legislative Assembly is requesting is, according to our norms, a much more democratic system. This means that the Government of the Transkei is not afraid of going to its voters and that conditions have been created in the Transkei and circumstances prevail which make it possible and easy for a Government to go to its voters without being afraid of their judgment. In my opinion this is one of the many very important pieces of evidence we have today of the successful development of our policy of separate development with regard to the homelands.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this Bill authorizes the Legislative <span class="col_533-534" refersTo="page_0283"/>Assembly to conclude agreements with the Government of the Republic. This too is indicative of the development which is taking place there and the success which is being achieved through the policy of separate development there.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would have liked to agree with the hon. member for Lydenburg that this Bill is evidence that the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development is succeeding. As proof of this, he brought forward the fact that the Government is now prepared to allow a more fully elective system for the Transkei Legislative Assembly. If that test were to be carried through, parity would not be the answer, because in that case all the members of the Transkeian Assembly would be elected and not just half the members, as will be the case when this Bill is passed. I agree with the hon. the Minister that, in reaching parity, at least some advance has been made. As he told us, we have had three successive measures, each of which has increased the number of elected members <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> the number of traditional chiefs in the Assembly. Now we have reached the stage that there will be 75 traditional chiefs and 75 elected members&#x2014;parity. At least that is something, and we approve of it. It is at least a step in the direction of a democratic system. However, hon. members on that side of the House must not bluff themselves that this means that the policy of separate development has therefore succeeded. I would say that, before that claim could be made, one would, firstly, need to have a fully elected Transkeian Assembly and, what is even more important, one would need economic viability in that area, a situation where the Transkei did not have to import what amounts to almost 90% of its foodstuffs, for instance. One would also need a situation where the Transkei could provide more than 16 000 jobs in the ten years that the Xhosa Development Corporation has been in operation. Consequently, I am not impressed with this as an argument that points to the success of the policy of separate development. We in these benches are supporting this Bill for one reason only, and that is that it is an advance in the right direction, certainly as far as the composition of the Transkeian Assembly is concerned. We do not have any objection either to the change that is being introduced to remove the exclusive clause, in terms of which the Transkeian Assembly could not make treaties with other countries. Now that Assembly is at least able to make treaties and have discussions with the Government of the Republic of South Africa, a procedure that is clearly necessary in view of the nature of the discussions that are taking place at the present time between the Republican Government and the Transkeian Assembly. For those reasons we are not opposing this Bill.</p>

<p>I hope very much that the hon. the Minister will bear in mind that there are many objections to the course of events presently taking place, such as the fact that the negotiations are being proceeded with without a proper referendum having been held by the people of the Transkei and the fact that objections such as those voiced by the new Leader of the Opposition in the Transkei, have been brushed aside by Chief Minister Matanzima. The most important fact of all, as far as we are concerned, is that the negotiations are taking place and the elections will take place with proclamation No. 400 still in force in the Transkei. Therefore, to claim that the Transkei has a democratic organization under the present circumstances is, I feel, somewhat euphoric, especially in view of the fact that, as I have said, only parity will have been reached. However, because it is an advancement and because, as I say, it is obviously necessary that the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei be enabled to take part in discussions with the Republic on the question of the independence that is forthcoming, we in these benches will not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Let me first of all reply briefly to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. As regards a referendum in the Transkei, the last point she mentioned, I want to say that it is the intention, or so I was informed, of the Transkeian Government to hold a general election based on the draft constitution of the Transkei for their republic.

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of parity in respect of the membership of the Transkeian Assembly. That is another question which the Transkei itself has to resolve.</p>

<p>It is a matter for the Transkei; it is their choice. If they would like to change the composition, the percentage relationship between the two, it is a matter for them to decide on. We are not going to influence them in that direction.</p>

<p>As for the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, I am very glad also for the support he gave us in this respect. It is not so much of a surprise because we have had support from him and his party already in the past and I therefore want to thank them and the House for the manner in which this Bill has been dealt with.

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Before I proceed to deal with the legislation, I should just like to tell the hon. House that worry about the introduction of this first Bill of mine has quite exhausted me.</p>

<p>An explanatory memorandum on the Bill has already been tabled, and I hope it has been of use to hon. members; further to that I shall now deal with the Bill briefly.</p>

<p>Clauses 1 and 2: In the process of the revision of pre-Union legislation by the South African Law Commission, my department was requested by the said commission to indicate whether it was possible to repeal Act 19 of 1891 of Natal. As hon. members know, Bantu law in Natal was codified and proclaimed as the Natal Code of Bantu Law in the schedule to Act 19 of 1891 of Natal. In order to assist the South African Law Commission in its task, the said Act is now being repealed, but because the schedule to the Act, as replaced by Proclamation R. 195 of 1967, is still in regular use, it must be retained, and consequently the necessary provisions are being embodied in the Bantu Administration Act, 1927.</p>

<p>Clauses 3, 20 and 28: Since section 17 of the Interpretation Act, 1957, was amended in 1973, it is no longer necessary to table proclamations and Government notices containing rules and regulations, and only a list of such publications containing rules and regulations are tabled in Parliament. The legal provisions to which these clauses refer, however, provide that the instrument itself&#x2014;for example, a proclamation&#x2014;must be tabled, and if it contains rules or regulations, it must also be listed in terms of section 17 of the Interpretation Act, 1957. In order to eliminate this duplication and confusion, the Acts <span class="col_537-538" refersTo="page_0285"/>concerned are now being amended to create uniformity in the whole matter, in terms of the provisions of the Interpretation Act, 1957.</p>

<p>Clause 4: Owing to a lack of money and time, it will not be possible in the case of the Transkei, and perhaps in the case of other areas as well at a later stage, to buy and transfer all the land intended for a particular homeland before independence is granted. The amendment is intended to make it possible in such a case to purchase and transfer the balance of the land after a homeland has become independent.</p>

<p>Clause 5: In terms of section 9<i>bis</i> (2) of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, the provisions of the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1956 (Act 23 of 1956) referring to surcharges are applicable <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to the South African Bantu Trust Fund. However, the said provisions in section <i>9bis</i> (2) are repealed by the new Exchequer and Audit Act, 1975. In terms of the new section, therefore, provision is made once again for surcharges in respect of the South African Bantu Trust Fund.</p>

<p>Clause 6: Land which was held by the Trust and which was alienated or transferred to the government of a self-governing area is still considered by law as being part of the &#x201C;quota&#x201D;. When the Transkei becomes independent shortly, the &#x201C;quota land&#x201D; will come into the possession of an independent state and the amendments are intended to make it clear that &#x201C;quota land&#x201D; which is so held by an independent state&#x2014;a former self-governing area&#x2014;is still considered to be part of the &#x201C;quota&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Certain lands in homelands which used to be part of the &#x201C;quota&#x201D; have been transferred from the possession of the Trust, a Bantu or other party, to owners such as a development or an investment corporation, as a result of which change in ownership it is no longer deemed to be part of the &#x201C;quota&#x201D;. In terms of the amendment it will in fact be considered part of the &#x201C;quota&#x201D; under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Clauses 7 and 8: In order to lighten the burden of the State President, and also to promote efficiency by shortening communication lines, the power to make regulations is transferred from the State President to the Minister.</p>

<p>Clause 9: The definition of &#x201C;general dealer&#x201D; is being extended to include certain larger employers of Bantu as well, so that such employers will also be able to obtain authorization to sell Bantu beer in terms of the provisions of section 5(iA).</p>

<p>Clause 10: In order to improve refreshment facilities for Bantu persons, provision is being made in this clause for Bantu beer to be provided along with meals in Bantu eating-houses.</p>

<p>Clause 11: The definition of &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; is being extended to enable the Minister to delegate certain functions to officials of his department in the interests of efficiency.</p>

<p>Clauses 12 and 13: In order for the Investment Corporation, development corporations and corporations to be better equipped for their task, they have to be empowered to lend and to borrow money and to promote the negotiation of loans by the said bodies. It is also deemed necessary to authorize the State to guarantee such loans.</p>

<p>Clauses 14 and 15: The purpose of the amendment is to make it possible for the Investment Corporation, in addition to the Trust, also to hold shares in a development corporation or a corporation. Only consequential amendments are made to clause 15.</p>

<p>Clauses 16 and 25: In terms of existing legislation, the proclamation establishing a legislative council or assembly can only be amended, subsequent to the constitution of such council or assembly, after the council or assembly concerned has been consulted on the amendment. Such amendments are mostly made at the request of the authority concerned and the purpose of the amendment is to eliminate further formal consultations in such cases.</p>

<p>Clause 17: In terms of section 5A(f) of the Development of Self-government for Native Nations in South West Africa, 1968, &#x201C;national roads&#x201D; is a matter which is excluded from the authority of homeland governments. In South West African legislation&#x2014;I am referring to <span class="col_539-540" refersTo="page_0286"/>Ordinance 17 of 1972&#x2014;the term &#x201C;proclaimed roads&#x201D; is used and the term &#x201C;national roads&#x201D; is unknown there. The amendment corrects the terminology.</p>

<p>Clause 21: (a) According to White Paper NN&#x2014;&#x2019;68, the South West African Administration would continue to handle the main lines of communication in Bantu areas. The existing position is now being made clear in the Act as well. (b) and (c): The legislative power of legislative councils in South West Africa is being extended by transferring motor carrier transportation with effect from a date to be determined by the Minister.</p>

<p>Clauses 18, 19, 26 and 27: In terms of the laws concerned, legislative councils or assemblies have obtained executive powers over matters which fall within their legislative authority and which immediately prior to the date on which a legislative council or assembly had been established for the area, had been vested in an authority in the Republic, and such powers were obtained with effect from the date on which such legislative council or assembly was established. In addition, further matters were transferred to the authority of the said councils or assemblies from time to time after the said date. According to legal opinion, the executive authority in respect of matters transferred after the said date did not pass to the homeland bodies. The effect of this amendment is that the executive authority in respect of all matters within the legislative authority of a council or assembly will also be vested in the functionaries of the homeland concerned.</p>

<p>Clause 22: It has happened that functions of a local authority (such as the management of a Bantu township) have been taken over by homeland administrations, and in the process officials who enjoy pension benefits have been taken over. Several mission hospitals with their staff have also been taken over in this way. However, the definition of &#x201C;municipal pension fund&#x201D; is so limited that it does not include all pension funds and schemes which are involved, and for this reason it is being extended in order to include all funds and schemes concerned.</p>

<p>Clause 23: (a) In terms of existing legal provisions, the previous pensionable service which a member has accumulated with a &#x201C;municipal pension fund&#x201D; is considered to be pensionable service in the event of a take-over. Some mission hospitals have made representations to the effect that the pensionable service of their members should not automatically be considered pensionable for the fund of the Bantu authority on take-over, but that the official should have a choice in the matter. These representations are now being complied with. The rules of all the pension funds concerned do not make provision for the payment of transfer values if some of their members join another pension fund, and provision is now being made for determining such transfer value. (b) Because deficits may arise in a fund when members are taken over, arrangements are being made for such deficits to be defrayed from revenue. If there should be a surplus from the amount paid over in respect of a member from his previous fund, the surplus accrues to the member himself. In order to cover cases which have already occurred, the provisions of sections 22 and 23 are given retrospective effect from 1 April 1975.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Clause 24: The implementation of the consolidation plans which was approved by Parliament will result in the inclusion of more land into the areas of legislative assemblies. It is therefore necessary that certain terms and designations be properly interpreted.</p>

<p>Clauses 29 and 30; (a) In terms of existing legislation the Minister shall, in respect of each magisterial district or part of a magisterial district in the board&#x2019;s administration area, appoint in such area one or more members, who are members of a body contemplated in section 11(1)(e), to the Bantu Affairs Administration Board. Hon. members are aware that several magisterial districts are situated in the administration area of each Bantu Affairs Administration Board. The above-mentioned requirement results in the appointment of a large number of members out of bodies contemplated in section 11(1)(e). To counteract the clumsiness and high cost brought on by such a large membership, it is intended to do away with the compulsory appointment of a member per magisterial district. (b) In terms of section 4(2)(e) a member of a Bantu Affairs Administration Board who is a member of a body contemplated in section 11(1)(e), loses <span class="col_541-542" refersTo="page_0287"/>his membership of such Board on losing the qualifications required for his appointment. By this amendment it is arranged that a member of a Board will not lose his membership of such Board during his term of office merely by his losing membership of a body contemplated in section 11(1)(e).</p>

<p>Clause 31: This clause contains the short title of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Bill has been adequately explained and that it will find general support in the House.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasant task to congratulate the new Deputy Minister on the speech he made now that he has introduced a Bill in this House for the first time in his capacity as Deputy Minister. I hope he will enjoy his new office and that there will be sound co-operation between him and the thousands of Black people whose affairs he has to deal with.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, one got to know the hon. the Deputy Minister during the time that he was chairman of the Bantu Affairs Commission. We know him as one who approaches his task with calm and thoroughness and I feel sure that it is those qualities that will take him far in the office which he now adorns.</p>

<p>Coming to the Second Reading of the Bill, may I say that whilst there are some clauses which we shall oppose and which we wish to debate at greater length during the Committee Stage, the Bill as a whole will have our support at the Second Reading. I think the House will agree that this is to a large extent a Committee Stage Bill, being an amending Bill on a whole series of measures. The Minister has given a full explanation of this measure. The early clauses of the Bill, as he has indicated, were introduced as a result of recommendations by the South African Law Commission to bring old provincial or colonial legislation up to date but which retains the essential part of that legislation, which is the Natal Native Code, the Natal code of Bantu law. There are other clauses, namely 3, 20 and 28, which as it were, hang together and where the amendments removed an apparent conflict in some of the existing legislation as to whether a list of proclamations and Government notices only or whether the notices themselves should be tabled. In some cases duplication in the tabling of measures of that nature will be eliminated. Then there are those clauses which deal with quota land to be purchased in respect of those homelands which may become independent before the quota purchases are fulfilled. Provision is being made to rectify that situation. I believe that it will be generally agreed that that land should be purchased even although those areas may have become separated from the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As I am being reminded, she is being carried away by the propaganda of her own party. The other clauses which follow chronologically in the Bill, provide for changes in the Exchequer and Audit Act of 1975, and are to a large extent consequential. There are then, as always&#x2014;we seem to have one every year&#x2014;amendments in the legislation in regard to Bantu beer. The definition of &#x201C;employer&#x201D; is changed to enable an employer of more than 25 persons over the age of 18 to sell Bantu beer. There is a reason for that which one can understand and accept. There is provision for Bantu beer to be sold in Bantu eating houses whilst persons are having meals. That is also something which can be accepted. There is also provision for the guarantee by the Government of loans in respect of the various Bantu investment corporations. This may require further discussion. I think at some stage&#x2014;I do not know quite what the appropriate stage will be&#x2014;there ought to be a great deal more discussion and information given in respect of the activities of these institutions.</p>

<p>Then there are clauses which refer to the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards where there is a conflict in points of view. There is <span class="col_543-544" refersTo="page_0288"/>the desire to make some of the boards smaller so as to make them more efficient and less expensive to operate, which is an understandable and acceptable point of view. There is at the same time the machinery which is being used to achieve that end, and that is to reduce the number of persons the Minister is required to appoint, representative of the various magisterial districts, which under the existing legislation are chosen from a list drawn up by the municipalities concerned. That is in a sense an adverse aspect of this measure, because of the importance of municipalities and the part that they play in relation to Bantu affairs and the urban Bantu in particular. One would regret it if there were to be a substantial reduction in the representation on the Bantu Boards from that quarter. This, too, is probably something which we shall want to discuss in greater detail in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Then there are the various sets of clauses&#x2014;and there are numbers of them&#x2014;which deal with delegated legislation, either empowering the Minister to appoint officials to act in his name or bringing about a change where, instead of the State President deciding certain things, the Minister is to decide certain things. This of course, as you know, Sir, means that instead of it being a Cabinet decision and responsibility, it is a ministerial decision and responsibility. There again, particularly in those clauses relating to the Bantu (Urban Areas) Act and the Bantu Labour Act, it may be that we will have something further to say in the Committee Stage because where you have a principal Act of that kind, having very wide import indeed, affecting large numbers of persons in their activities, there are cases where we feel that it is better that the responsibility be a Cabinet responsibility; in other words that the State President takes the decision rather than the hon. the Minister himself. I think that that covers the piece of legislation before us generally, but as I say it is in its nature essentially a Committee Stage discussion, and it remains merely for me to say that this measure will not be opposed by us at the Second Reading.</p>
