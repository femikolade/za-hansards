<heading>FEDERAL SYSTEM AND PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION IN SOUTH AFRICA</heading>

<summary>(Motion)</summary>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House calls upon the Government to recommend to the State President to appoint a commission of inquiry in order to investigate and report upon the desirability of introducing a federal system of government for the Republic of South Africa and upon the desirability of introducing an electoral system of which proportional representation is an integral part.</block>

<p>The tragedy of Whites in Africa as a whole is that they seek to make changes only when it may be too late. The purpose of this motion today and the appeal I should like to make in connection with it is that White South Africa should act before it is too late, secondly that we should make changes while we are strong and able to control the time-table, and thirdly, that we should make changes while we can show that we are doing so because we believe it to be morally right to make these changes and not because of fear. The issue that we have to face is that irrespective of economic or social changes, we must accept that Black, Coloured and Indian people of South Africa will continue to demand political change and will, with increasing pressure, require political rights. White South Africa must accept the reality that unless it comes to an acceptable accommodation with Black South Africa, the pressure will go on and the pace will accelerate. We must also accept that the time for gestures and hollow promises is over and that imposed, unacceptable so-called solutions cannot bring lasting peace to our country. The reality of the need for political rights is accepted by all the political parties, except the HNP. What, however, is not accepted by all the <span class="col_2105-2106" refersTo="page_1069"/>parties is the need to establish the nature of such rights by consensus at least with a majority of the Black people, and, secondly, that there cannot be hidden White veto rights which make a fraud of constitutional proposals.</p>

<p>In addition to the acceptance of the need for political rights it is also accepted by all the political parties, with the one exception, that there has to be a change in the constitutional structure of South Africa. The Nationalist Party has the Bantustan concept, the United Party has the communal or race council, the Democrats have the idea of bringing Coloureds and Indians into the White stream and we in our party, the PRP, have a redrawing of boundaries in mind for the creation of new States or provinces based upon community of interests and in fact this includes ethnic considerations.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have not changed my mind. [Interjections.] It may be that some of the developments have taken place in a right-wing direction as far as my old colleagues are concerned, while some of the developments as far as we are concerned have been more realistic.</p>

<p>What is the difference between yourself and the official Opposition?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The basic difference is that I believe that the majority of the people sitting in the benches to my right want to maintain a White Parliament which exercises a veto right over the federal assembly they want to create. I have never believed in that and I have made that very clear.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Not even when you were in that party?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Not even when I was there, and I have said that publicly. This should therefore not come as a surprise to the Prime Minister, unless he has never taken notice of what I have said, which is another matter.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Were you the only one who believed that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no, there are still many there who do believe it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Name them, Harry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not need to name them; they can stand up and speak for themselves. What I think is significant is that all the political parties believe that there should be some association with the constitutional entities that they want to create. The hon. the Prime Minister has himself spoken of what he calls &#x201C; &#x2019;n magsblok&#x201D;, a power block. His predecessor in office spoke of a commonwealth that he wanted to create. It is quite clear that some form of association between the entities that are to be created is in the mind of the Government. As far as the United Party is concerned there is also to be an association and that is to be a federal concept, the race federation to which they refer. As far as the Democrats are concerned, they refer to a confederation, a term which certain Nationalists also refer to. As far as we in the PRP are concerned, we refer to a federation. None of these terms used by the political parties necessarily have the actual meaning which international constitutional law concepts attach to them. Each political party has its own refinement of the meaning which it has attached to the particular terms that are used.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at the Black political situation. Here we have those who would like to substitute Black power for White power in a unitary system. Then we have those who believe in the separate development of the hon. the Prime Minister. Finally we have many who believe that some form of federation is desirable for South Africa. I believe that it should be said immediately that at least some of the Black leaders who participate in the system of separate development have made it very clear that they do so only because they want to get away from under the umbrella of separate development and apartheid. They find this the only way to remove themselves from that apartheid umbrella. They have said so, and it is no use the hon. gentleman shaking his head. [Interjections.] Even the Chief Minister of the very first of the new emergent States, Chief Minister Matanzima, as recently as 20 December 1975 has gone on record as <span class="col_2107-2108" refersTo="page_1070"/>saying that the future political development in South Africa might include a federation in which, as he has said, Black and White would be equal partners. He too is talking of a federation as a possibility. Let me list others. Black leaders like Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, Dr. Phatudi, Prof. Hudson Ntsanwisi and other leaders of the Coloured and Indian communities are all on record as being supporters of the concept of federation. In these circumstances it is not unfair to conclude that a very substantial section of the White, Black, Indian and Coloured communities of South Africa want a form of federation. Let me go further. I believe almost all of them want their constituent elements to have some form of association between the elements that will continue to exist in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Being a realist, one accepts the fact that we are in opposition, and that in White politics only the Government makes the decisions. We can only seek to influence and we can only seek to present alternatives to be available should Government policies fail. My premise, on the submission that I make here today, is that even under a Nationalist Government some form of federal solution is in fact inevitable. Whatever the spokesmen may say today to the contrary, my appeal to them is to accept this as a reality, that there will inevitably be a federal solution in South Africa, and to plan accordingly. Many Nationalists have touched on the subject. I have referred to what the hon. the Prime Minister calls &#x201C;&#x2019;n magsblok&#x201D;. However, the one thing the hon. the Prime Minister has never done to this day is to tell us what he actually means by that, what it will embrace, what kind of constitutional structure he considers that &#x201C;magsblok&#x201D; should be. It is interesting to note that the hon. the Prime Minister has never &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have told you time and again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has given no details, not one single detail. He has told us nothing.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>And what is the &#x201C;working closely together&#x201D;? Is it to be a firm constitutional situation? What will be involved in it? [Interjections.] There has been no definition given of it, and the hon. the Prime Minister is excellent at asking other people for details.</p>

<p>You have the LBS agreement at the moment.</p>

<p>If that is all that you have in mind, it is not a &#x201C;magsblok&#x201D;. This is not a power block. There is no power block which exists at the present moment in the LBS situation. With great respect, the hon. the Prime Minister knows that. That is not a power block situation. It merely happens to be an agreement which relates to certain economic, and monetary matters, and that is all.</p>

<p>But it is not a power block. The hon. the Prime Minister knows that it is not a power block. The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s predecessor spoke in the same way about a &#x201C;commonwealth&#x201D;. Does the hon. the Prime Minister believe in a commonwealth?</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s predecessor dealt with it. His predecessor said it was part of policy. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to try to analyse the situation. Let me just read to you a passage. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Toe hy die tuislandbeleid aanvanklik aanvaar het, het hy vir homself wonderlike visioene gesien van &#x2019;n lewenspeil gelyk aan di&#x00E9; van die Blanke, van &#x2019;n eie Johannesburg, werkgeleenthede en dies meer. Die werklikheid het &#x2019;n stroewe antwoord gebring. Teen die huidige koers van sake, <span class="col_2109-2110" refersTo="page_1071"/>voorsien hy onafhanklike, maar bitter arm en onder-ontwikkelde tuislande, en hy soek nou na &#x2019;n nuwe antwoord wat ook sy economies welsyn sal verseker, en hom &#x2019;n deel sal gee in die Blankerykdomme van Suid-Afrika. Dit is &#x2019;n verwikkeling wat die Nasionale Party en die Regering nie kan ignoreer nie.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to talk about the breakthrough that has to be made in respect of the development of the homelands. That is the first point, and the second point is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ten tweede, maar ewe belangrik, moet die Nasionale Party ook nou duidelike leiding bring oor die toekoms van SuidAfrika na die staatkundige onafhanklikheid van die tuislande. Hy moet sy eie grondslag van interafhanklikheid in meer uitgewerkte besonderhede uitspel.</block>

<p>But you must blame your own newspapers if those newspapers do not understand you.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>But you are responsible for this newspaper.</p>

<p>&#x2020;But you see, Sir, it is not only newspapers who deal with this. There are professors too, and we can list them. There is Prof. Sampie Terreblanche.</p>

<p>*Do you have anything against him? He too deals with the matter and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dat Suid-Afrika se politieke struktuur mettertyd sal evolueer tot &#x2019;n federasie of &#x2019;n konfederasie, sal niemand seker betwyfel nie, s&#x00EA; prof. Sample Terreblanche, hoogleraar in die economie aan die Universities van Stellenbosch.</block>

<p>No one would doubt this, of course, except the Prime Minister. There is Prof. Ben Vosloo, also from Stellenbosch, who says that he mentioned the possibility of a confederation as an ultimate result of separate development in the youth magazine of the Nationalist Party of the Cape Province as far as back as September 1972.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>But that is a confederation. A confederation is quite different from a federation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that. The only difference between a federation and a confederation is that if there is a confederation one can leave it. That is the only difference, is it not? I can quote other people on the same point, and I can quote other newspapers, Nationalist Party newspapers, which may not deal with federation, but which definitely do deal with confederation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Would you not rather tell us what your federation looks like?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but then you must have a little patience. You must have patience to wait for these people for a few days. Now have patience with me as well.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think if we look at the situation the possibility of a federal situation developing in South Africa, both in the relationship of what will eventually remain of the Republic of South Africa and the emergent independent homelands, and inside South Africa itself, is something which needs to be looked at carefully. Sir, I want to sketch here a scenario for a constitutional development under the Nationalist Party, on the assumption that there would be no change by election and making three other assumptions which I hope will be a reality; firstly, that South Africa is able to resist external pressure; secondly, that the South African economy is strong enough in order to enable the separate development policy to be carried out from an economic point of view and, thirdly, that changes internally will not come about by violent means. These are the three assumptions I must <span class="col_2111-2112" refersTo="page_1072"/>make and obviously I want those three assumptions to become a reality. But then we must look at a South Africa which looks something like this. Firstly, some of the Bantustans will by then have become independent. Secondly, some of them will refuse to become independent for some or other reason.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>How do you know?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Thirdly, some of them may be unable to become independent for economic and for other reasons; and, fourthly, there may be some homelands which might seek to join with other neighbouring States, such as for example Qua-Qua which might join with Lesotho and Bophuthatswana might join with Botswana and the Swazi homeland might join with Swaziland. And then we might also have the situation that Black independent homelands might themselves join with other homelands or might federate with them, as for example the Transkei and the Ciskei. But as the result of all this, you will still have in South Africa Black people in the remainder of South Africa, who in some cases will be citizens of their independent homelands and in other cases will not be citizens of the homelands but will be what I think Prof. Rhoodie has called the &#x201C;denationalized&#x201D; Black people in the remainder of South Africa. And, Sir, you will also then have homelands which form part of South Africa, and on top of that you will have the Coloured people and you will have the Indian people and you will have continued pressure and demands for political rights. The choices which are open to a Nationalist Government in those circumstances are threefold. Firstly, they can say that they will give no rights but continue to dominate and as a result be faced with increasing pressure. The second choice is that they can admit them into the constitutional and political structure with equal rights and the third a federal solution for the remainder of South Africa. It seems to me that whatever the hon. the Prime Minister may say today, in years to come the Nationalist Party will accept that solution.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Which federal solution?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>A federal solution. I am using the word &#x201C;federal&#x201D;. I am not contending that it can only be a solution as we have evolved it&#x2014;in no way. I am talking about federalism in the broad sense and I, Sir, am not so arrogant as to believe that only the ideas that come from these benches might be the eventual ideas for South Africa. But I believe in a federal solution &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>What are the ideas of the people on those benches? I am not trying to be facetious now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>If you see this debate out, Sir, you will hear what the ideas of these benches are. Make no mistake about that. I want to go further, if the hon. the Prime Minister will permit me to deal with his policies for a moment. In these circumstances, even looking at the Coloured and the Indian peoples, whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, even his own Cabinet council idea is the germ of the federal principle, and he knows it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Not at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>He knows it, and that is the only way in which it can develop. If he does not allow it to develop that way, he can never allow the Coloured people in South Africa to share in its sovereignty, because that is the only way he can do it. The Coloured people of South Africa, the same as all the other people, will not accept a situation where they have no say in regard to the sovereignty of the State. With respect, Sir, he knows it and he knows that this is how eventually it will have to develop. I believe that the scenario that eventually will be there under Nationalist Party rule will be a form of federation inside what will be the Republic and an association with the adjacent independent homelands. Whether initially it is a commonwealth, a &#x201C;magsblok&#x201D; or a confederation, the obvious thing is a form of association of that nature. While this is not our idea of the constitutional future of South Africa, if the Nationalist Party accepted the consequences of these policies in terms of what I have said and combined it with a real removal of discrimination and the creation of opportunity one could approach the policies of the Nationalist Party with a far greater degree of hope than one can do at the present moment. I believe therefore that the need is for the Nationalist Party, for the fulfilment of its own ideas, to look at <span class="col_2113-2114" refersTo="page_1073"/>federation as a possible solution for South Africa.</p>

<p>May I now turn to the next aspect, and that is whether a federation can work and whether or not there are alternatives. As I have indicated here, in a unitary system with a franchise system under which the winner takes all, there can be only domination and a minority, or a majority for that matter, which is deprived of political power, can only hope for safeguards in terms of a constitution which ensures that its civil rights are respected.</p>

<p>Let me go to the second alternative, which is partition. I believe that is impractical as the policy of Bantustans will in fact still leave, as I have indicated, the majority of Blacks in the rest of the Republic and also offers no solution for the Coloureds and the Indians. The only other answer then, I believe, is federalism. Federalism is a constitutional structure in which the power to make laws and to exercise administrative functions are divided between a central Government structure and the authorities or units comprising that federation. There is territorial self-government, to the extent which is practical and desired, and central authority, to the extent that it is necessary and agreed to by the individual States. This is a system of government which, in the words of Dicey, is a system &#x201C;where union is desired but not unity&#x201D;, and where geographic, historical, cultural and ethnic or other reasons cause a desire for maximum self rule, while other considerations such as economics, defence, etc., may make an association with others either desirable or necessary. There have been many federations in the world, and I concede immediately that there have been some that have not succeeded. Except for partition, however, there is no real alternative to a polyethnic situation if domination by a majority is rejected as unacceptable. South Africa is always held up as being unique, particularly in regard to its racial composition. Although it is perhaps unique in many ways, other countries and other communities, both in past eras and in the present, have in fact had divisions based on race, nationality or religion, which have created dangerous diversity of interest. However, of all the countries that live in peace, and which have been referred to before, perhaps Switzerland is the best example of a federation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>It is the best example in the world, except of course for the hon. member for Pretoria Central, because three-quarters of its population is, in fact, German, and many of its cantons are biethnic and at least one of them is triethnic. This is perhaps an example of peace and co-operation we could well emulate. From this certain premises emerge, and I should like to list some of them.</p>

<p>Firstly I believe that federation in the true sense can only function if democracy is practised, and this makes constitutional safeguards for groups and individuals essential. Hence a separation and balance of power between executive, legislature and judiciary is necessary. Secondly, if issues exist which cut across ethnic loyalties, particularly if the groups are biethnic or polyethnic, this is a stabilizing factor. In other words, if there are political philosophies which are common, irrespective of the ethnic considerations or if there are religious or other factors, this assists in making the system word. Thirdly, decision-making need not be on a winner-take-all basis, being achieved by consensus or amicable agreement. The concept that everything has to be done by a majority vote is something that we have inherited from the Westminster system. I think we have to look at what is called the &#x201C;Konkordanz demokrazie&#x201D;. This shows that one can come to an agreement and rule much more easily by consensus in many cases, in a polyethnic situation, than one could if one had to rely on a majority vote. Interestingly enough, this is what the hon. the Prime Minister also has in mind with his Cabinet council idea. In these terms one does not always have to base decisions on the fact that one section has more votes than another. One can, in fact, make the majority of the decisions in relation to the running of a country by consensus.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You can only do it in a system where no vote is ever taken.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>No.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the Cabinet principle.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is the Cabinet system that one does not necessarily take a vote. However, one can apply that same <span class="col_2115-2116" refersTo="page_1074"/>system even in a situation where one will have to vote.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But the moment one takes a vote it violates the concept.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it violates the concept. I have no quarrel with that.</p>

<p>The fourth point I want to make is that federation, like any other form of government, should not be imposed upon people. It should be negotiated and implemented by consent. The fifth point is that no government structure can succeed if the changes to the economic and social structure which bring about a just society are not dealt with at the same time. Bearing in mind these and other premises, we evolved our own federal policy. We accepted that for a federation to succeed the individual states need to have a proper geographic content. That is why our federation is based on geographic content. Governments rule territory in which there are people. It is not practical to have different governments ruling people living in the same territorial entity. A race federation is a federation in the air, and is not practical. It needs geographic content.</p>

<p>However, we do not ignore the need to take into account community of interest and the desire of people to maintain their identity. This is why we believe that at present the provincial boundaries are academic and that the boundaries of States need to be drawn afresh, taking into account these interests and desires. We also bear in mind the fact that Whites cannot impose constitutions, and so realize the need to negotiate at a national convention at which we would present our plans as a basis for discussion. The basic essential of any federation policy is a willingness to share on the part of those who at present exercise political power. A refusal to share until it is too late may result in there being nothing for us to share at all.</p>

<p>In the few minutes available to me I wish to turn to the other matter, and that this is the question of the voting system in this country, again a legacy from the Westminster system. In a constituency system the winner takes all, and a simple majority decides who governs on an exclusive basis. The plural system is not the only voting system in use in democratic systems, and it has major disadvantages. A candidate can win and a Government can be in power without majority electoral support. On major issues minorities have no say in determining their own destiny. We sit here as the minority and have no say in determining our own destiny because decisions are made on the other side of the House. Minorities, unless geographically concentrated, are generally underrepresented. There are other systems that can be used. One of these involves a preferential vote, either in the form of an alternative vote system as in Australia, or in terms of a second ballot as in France. In this the voter has a chance of expressing a second choice if no candidate has an overall majority. We have evolved a system which is again similar to that in many of the EEC countries. In this system the voter has two votes, one on a constituency basis and one on a list. That system is one which does allow democracy to be practised in a much more reasonable manner. We have inherited these things from Westminster. These are historical aspects that bind us. In the complex situation ahead of us I believe that a Government would be failing in its duty if it did not at least investigate the alternative aspects which should be investigated. We cannot be hide-bound in our thinking because of historical patterns. We would be failing in our duty to the future if we were to be so hidebound. For those reasons I believe that both federation and the voting system in South Africa need to be examined, irrespective of what the views of the particular parties may be. I say this because federation is as inevitable in South Africa as history itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville really gave very few details of the federal system. He spoke about a federal system, &#x201C;a community of interests&#x201D;, &#x2018;&#x2018;taking ethnic aspects into consideration&#x201D;, but he said extremely little in connection with <span class="col_2117-2118" refersTo="page_1075"/>the real content of the system. I can only express the hope that the other members of the Progressive Party will say more about it. I should like to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House endorses the present system of government and electoral system for the Republic of South Africa&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The really essential aspect of the matter now being debated, is the seat of political power, i.e. who controls political power over whom? This is the essential question. The intention with the idea of a federal system is actually to make it acceptable by roundabout means and pretence, in the sense that if we are prepared to share power, we shall still retain a certain power over our own future. However, it is nothing but pretence to think that political federation is a solution to the problems in the Southern African situation.</p>

<p>Before elaborating on federation as such, I should like to talk about the idea expressed by the mover of this motion at the end of his motion, and that is proportional representation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Under the present system we are elected by the voters of a constituency not necessarily on the basis of our party affiliation. Nowhere on the ballot paper is there an indication that I, for instance, am a candidate of the National Party. Similarly, the hon. member for Yeoville was not elected as member of the United Party by the voters. They voted for a Mr. H. Schwarz. Otherwise there would have been no morality whatsoever in his crossing the floor after he was elected. When he was elected he was the chairman of the United Party in the Transvaal, and after he had crossed the floor he became national chairman of the PRP. There would not have been any moral right for him to do that. Therefore, basically we are elected as representatives of voters in a constituency. There is no solution in saying that we must have proportional representation on a constituency basis. The proposed system of voting on a list basis contains an inherent weakness. There is such a system in force in Germany and various other countries in Europe and we know that the system of proportional representation brings with it an inherent instability in the political system. This is so because we find that the minority party, the party with the smallest support in Germany, has the actual seat of power. It wields the balance of power and because it wields the balance of power, it wields the real power. The party which wields the real power as a result of the proportional representation system in Germany received only 5,5% of the total votes cast.</p>

<p>If they had proportional representation on a party system and on a list system in Great Britain at present, the balance of power and the real power would have been wielded by the Liberal Party. However, as there is a constituency basis, the Liberal Party, even though it commands something like 15% of the total votes, has less than 15 seats in a house of more than 600 members. The constituency basis is the guarantee that voters&#x2019; interests shall be represented in a proper localized way, Proportional representation is certainly no guarantee of the real representation of voters&#x2019; interests.</p>

<p>*If the issue is the real exercise of power, there is no solution in a federal system. The only system offering a real solution, is the system which is maintained in South Africa and in terms of which provision is made for all peoples to have power over their own future and destiny. I do not want to suggest that there will never be closer co-operation among the peoples of South Africa at a political level. However, before any negotiations whatsoever can take place with regard to closer liaison in connection with the exercise of political power, there is one absolute prerequisite, and that is that those who negotiate, do so as international political equals. Thirty years ago there was a bloody war in Europe and bitter enmity between Germany on the one hand, <span class="col_2119-2120" refersTo="page_1076"/>and France, Holland and the other countries on the other hand. Subsequent to that, they formed an economic unit, the European Economic Community, and at the moment there is an endeavour in Europe to develop in the direction of a political system in which the various countries will move closer together. However, negotiations can be conducted fruitfully only if there is political equality among the participating negotiators. Here in South Africa it is an absolute prerequisite that no one negotiates, will participate in the negotiations in a status of dependence. We dare not negotiate as the hon. member who introduced the motion and the United Party expect us to do, viz. on the basis that we as Whites are expected only to give without our retaining the right to entrench and to safeguard our own political future. What is absolutely essential in my opinion, is the policy of separate development, the policy that the various homelands are able to gain absolute independence and sovereignty, that there will be the closest co-operation at economic level, that there will be political liaison through negotiation, but that each Government will have the right to decide according to its own interests, of its own free will and on its own initiative, to what extent they are prepared to accept such negotiations and the agreements resulting from such negotiations. If this takes place at a stage of dependence, no real value can be attached to it.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that there obviously should be closer economic and political co-operation in Southern Africa in the future. There should be co-operation on aspects of mutual interest. In any system concerned with majorities and minorities&#x2014;whether in a federal system, or in any other system&#x2014;there is danger if the real power is seated in a system of government in which representation is given to fundamental minorities and fundamental majorities. We have seen this in other countries in Africa as well as in countries such as Cyprus and Ireland. Where minorities and majorities are concerned, one cannot tie them to a single power structure on a permanent basis. This can only be done after each group has sovereignty over the determination of its own future and if every group decides in absolute sovereignty and of its own free will to what extent negotiations and agreements will take place. That is why we are of the opinion that a federal system, however loose, is not the solution. The solution is to be found in negotiation among sovereign independent nations, as this is taking place in Europe at the moment.</p>

<p>In South Africa the present system has been tested in 15 elections since 1910 and there is no necessity to abandon it. We accept that changes have taken place in human relations, but wherever there is a common power structure, it has led to confrontation and tension. There is no solution in a common power structure. There must obviously be liaison. We as Whites in South Africa who are a numerical minority are, in fact, Africans and as such have a permanent right here in Africa. To share political power with numerical majorities or with other population groups, will not be a solution. I do not intend exercising authority over the political future of the Zulu, the Tswana or the Sotho, but at the same time I am also not prepared to share political authority, real political power, so that the Zulu will have authority over my political future, or that the Cubans, the Russians, the Americans or the British will have authority over my political future. We as White Africans have the right to have political authority over our future in our hands, and then to co-operate voluntarily with the other peoples with whom our destiny is closely bound up, on a basis of understanding and consensus, but not in a system which makes this obligatory for all the participating parties. There must be a free choice of participation or rejection. Therefore, we find a federal system as well as a system of proportional representation completely unacceptable, because they simply bring about a weakening of governmental systems, while the system of majority representation on a constituency basis, a system as we have had it throughout the years, has been tested and has proved itself to be a system which lends itself to stability and security for all&#x2014;White as well as non-White.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that one has to listen to a fellow South African who has totally abandoned any hope of coexistence on a close basis between the different colours and races in South Africa. He says that what we have had since 1910 is good enough, we do not have to change anything. He closes his mind to and blindly disregards three-quarters of a century of change, development and growth. He closes his mind to the Coloured people of South <span class="col_2121-2122" refersTo="page_1077"/>Africa, to the Indian people of South Africa and to the Black urban people of South Africa. He sees the happy continuation into tomorrow of a system designed to give representation to one section of the people, a system which in 65 years has proved itself unable to keep up with the modern needs of this country.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have the motion of the hon. member for Yeoville. We have waited since 1974, when for the first time the Progressives were represented here as a party, and not by an independent, to have a debate on their policy. One really thought that today the time for that had come. There was a proposer who believed in straight talk&#x2014;no double talk, but talk straight from the shoulder, laid on the line. However, what did we find? The nearest they got to talking about their policy was to say that they would draw up new boundaries for the provinces of South Africa. Where are those boundaries? The hon. member based his total concept on new boundaries, but that party has not produced the boundaries and, when one asks them for the boundaries, they say: &#x201C;Oh, we shall consult about that when we get into power and then we shall draw them up.&#x201D; In other words, they have a policy without a foundation.</p>

<p>What about the cloak of double talk which is involved in this? They base their complete philosophy on new boundaries in an attempt to give the public the idea that they will be able to carve some White States out of it where the Whites will not be dominated.</p>

<p>Of course it is. Why else would they talk of redesigning the boundaries? When, in fact, they know that of every magisterial district in South Africa, there is not one where the Whites are in the majority? There may be one exception. Consequently, throughout South Africa there will be a Black majority, but in order to hide that from the people, they do not talk about their franchise policy or draw their lines on the map, but simply talk in vague generalities and platitudes. I say that this is worse than double talk. It is an attempt to bluff the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke of the homeland leaders wanting a federation. Of course, he sat in on summit conferences which the United Party had with homeland leaders. He sat there as a member of the United Party when we discussed federation and they agreed that federation was the direction in which they saw South Africa developing.</p>

<p>He sat there when we discussed the United Party&#x2019;s concept of federation. We have listened to the hon. member for Yeoville for half an hour and the nearest he got to discussing his party&#x2019;s policy was to say that they had a two-vote system. What he did not tell us was that the two-vote system means that half the members of Parliament will be elected by those who are barely literate, who are barely able to write their names and addresses and who have, in short, a minimal education&#x2014;which means Black majority rule. The other 50% of the members will be elected by those who have passed a compulsory standard of education. This, again, means universal franchise. Therefore, there will be Black majority rule. The hon. member has told us nothing of this.</p>

<p>Yes, they have an additional problem. They appointed a commission under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Rondebosch and then the hon. member for Yeoville joined them.

<p>Let us get to the nub of the issue that is before us in the form of this motion. Both the Government and the Progressive Reform Party, or the Reformist Party, which has put this idea forward, are wedded to European concepts of government. The Nationalist Party, strangely enough, is wedded to the Westminster principle, the Westminster concept of government.</p>

<p>The Progressive Party, equally is wedded to European concepts. Every example the hon. member for Yeoville gave was from countries in Europe. He kept on coming back to Europe: Their two-vote system, the Swiss system, and so on. The Nationalist Party: Westminster; decolonization; the breaking up, fragmentation, partition or balkanization; the policy of fear and despair, e.g. &#x201C;you cannot live together, therefore have partitions.&#x201D; The Progs: &#x201C;You are all same, follow the European pattern.&#x201D; We have tried to bring an entirely new concept into constitutional thinking: an African concept, based on the lessons of Africa and designed for the circumstances of Africa&#x2014;in other words, a federation of communities. To set out our objectives I want to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;which will ensure:</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) peaceful co-existence of all our population groups in a common loyalty and responsibility towards South Africa;</li>

<li>(d) effective participation by all communities in decision-making in matters of common interest; and</li>

<li>(e) freedom from domination of any community by any other community.&#x201D;.</li>

<p>The essence of it is in the one fundamental difference in thinking between the geographic concept, the European concept, and our idea of an African concept of a federation of communities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Now, is that an &#x201C;African concept&#x201D;?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The essence of Africa is that one has separate communities, separate identities, not only of race&#x2014;ethnic and tribal&#x2014;but also, within those identities, a rural identity. One can have a Zulu with rural interests and a Zulu with urban interests, each forming a community. We accept the reality of different communities. The Progressive Party wants one mixed-up conglomeration, but we accept the reality of different communities. We base our political thinking, our concept of federation, on the right of communities to maintain their identities, the right of communities to retain their cultural and ethnic identities, as well as the right to run their own affairs to the maximum extent possible, the affairs covering that specific community as a community. We do not stand for domination by a majority, but for a community governing its own affairs.</p>

<p>The crux comes when one seeks the way of linking such communities together in a common patriotism and common responsibility within a common State. This is where the difference comes in. This is where the Government turns to partition and the Progressive Party turns to majority rule. We believe in a sharing of power. A sharing of power means that every community must have a share. Under majority rule there is no sharing of power, because all the power goes to the majority whilst the minorities have no share in it. This is what the Progs stand for; majority rule. We stand for a sharing or power. That sharing of power is based upon the devolution of power to each community and to legislative assemblies running the things concerning the communities, and it is based upon transferring power to a new body, a federal assembly, in which each community will be represented. The difference is that both the Nationalist Party and the Progressive Party visualize an instant solution: Once you partition, it is final and absolute, and once you have majority rule, once you have voted once, it is final and absolute. Ours is an evolutionary transfer of authority, using the existing machinery of the sovereign State, using this Parliament as the transferer of power, the setter-up of a federal assembly and the regulator of pace. In this way one has ordered change to a federation, and not instant change to chaos or frustration and confrontation.</p>

<p>This is the basis of the difference. This is the basis our policy envisages, namely an evolutionary sharing of power through a mechanism in which all will have a share and in which the domination of one community <span class="col_2125-2126" refersTo="page_1079"/>over another will be eliminated. All one does with the geographic federation we have heard about today is that one multiplies the dilemma of South Africa in macrocosm into each of the microcosms. The problem of South Africa as a whole, i.e. Black majority in numbers, is simply multiplied by the number of States which one has. In every State there will be a Black or non-White majority of one kind or another. Thereby one multiplies South Africa&#x2019;s major problem into 10 or 11 smaller problems of exactly the same nature, and you solve nothing.</p>

<p>The only solution will be when one comes to the concept of communities working together as communities. The end of the road remains in the hands of the responsible people who set up the machinery of federation.</p>

<p>No, I have no time. My time has almost expired.

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the policy of the United Party as set out by the hon. member for Durban Point is so good and constitutes the answer to South Africa&#x2019;s problems, why have the Coloureds, Indians and Blacks almost unanimously, and practically all the Whites in South Africa, summarily rejected this policy. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that this sort of debate should take place in an exclusively White political forum in which only the representatives of the Whites are debating the destiny of a multi-racial country and the rights and opportunities of a multi-racial society. It is unfortunate that only the White representatives of only the Whites should be trying to evolve a blueprint for South Africa when, in fact, we should be drawing up a constitutional brief for the delegates of White South Africa to go to an imminent multi-racial national convention to draft a new constitution for our country.</p>

<p>I want to base my contribution on two assumptions. The first is that, we accept the stark reality of our situation. I find the words of Dr. Andr&#x00E9; du Toit very interesting. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is a fundamentally unjust society. We have institutionalized and legalized discriminatory and exploitative practices. The present coercive order of our racial oligarchy can only be maintained through increasingly authoritarian measures at the risk of polarized conflict.</block>

<p>The second assumption I would like to make is that we are prepared to bring about far-reaching changes in South Africa in order to effect rapid and radical change towards a new South Africa free of discrimination, in which socio-economic opportunities and basic human rights are the inalienable property of all South Africans. Those are the two assumptions I should like to make. If all three parties in the House are prepared to accept these requirements, then I should like to make a few appeals. The first is to the Government. I want to ask the Government: Please do not summarily reject, as the hon. member over there did, federalism as a possible mechanism to solve South Africa&#x2019;s complex problems. I say this particularly because the so-called White South Africa that will remain after all the homelands have received independence, will still have a majority of Blacks. In this regard Professor Rhoodie said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ekself is baie meer bekommerd oor die verhoudinge tussen die Wittes en die oorblywende nie-Wittes as oor ons verhoudinge met die Swart volke wat onafhanklike nasieskap en &#x2019;n eie vaderland mag verkry.</block>

<p><span class="col_2127-2128" refersTo="page_1080"/>*Prof. Rhoodie also said that there were approximately 4&#x00BD; million permanent Blacks, &#x201C;not temporary labourers with a consuming yearning for their homelands&#x201D;, in so-called White South Africa at the moment. He said that we should add to that number approximately 2 million Coloureds and &#x00BE; million Asians, and that that totals 7&#x00BD; million non-Whites. &#x201C;In other words, the Republic of South Africa will still have a plural national society, even if all the homelands were to become independent and were to be consolidated to the maximum.&#x201D; Prof. Rhoodie also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Watter lewensvatbare beleid vir die sosio-politieke akkommodasie van hierdie permanente segmente van die SuidAfrikaanse bevolking kan hier ontwikkel wat nie oorwegend op federalisme geskoei is nie?</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek glo dat federalism in die praktyk deur die Nasionale Party geakkommodeer kan word as &#x2019;n logiese ontplooiing van sy beleid, om &#x2019;n respectable politieke idioom van ons tyd te gebruik. Ons mag skepties staan, teenoor die VP en die Progrefs se vorme van federalisme, maar die feit bly dat elk ten opsig van die RSA se permanente nasionale bevolking met &#x2019;n bod gekom het, &#x2019;n bod wat die Nasionale Party met &#x2019;n teenbod sal moet kan neutraliseer, maar dan met iets duideliker uitgespel en meer realities en lewensvatbaar as vae begrippe, soos &#x201C;inspraak&#x201D; en &#x201C;buurskap&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I think this professor has a realistic point of view. I think the Nationalist Party should heed the representations of this person to the Government of South Africa, i.e. in the first place, to come forward with an answer to the policies which we on this side of the House expound and, in the second place, not to reject federalism summarily and out of hand.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is true that at the summit conference of all homeland leaders which was held towards the end of 1973, they accepted that federalism would be the basis of the future constitutional position of South Africa. At the Buluga conference, which was held in November 1973, for the first time representatives of the vast majority of South Africa&#x2019;s population&#x2014;Blacks, Coloureds and Indians&#x2014;got together with the representatives of a section of Whites and agreed on the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Against the background of the realities of South Africa, a federal form of government, embodying autonomous States free of racial exclusiveness &#x2026;</block>

<p>And now members of the United Party should listen to what the representatives of the majority of South Africa&#x2019;s population decided there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a federal form of government, embodying autonomous States free of racial exclusiveness &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, not your sort of policy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is most likely to create the right conditions for peace in our country.</block>

<p>Recently, at the Jan Smuts conference where, once again the leaders of the Black, Coloured and Indian people met with our party, they endorsed and emphasized this concept in the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We accept that in one united South Africa territory and not race must form the basis of government, which should not be racially exclusive.</block>

<p>A clearer more concise and more devastating rejection of the United Party&#x2019;s policy, would be hard to find. I think it is important that they bear this in mind.</p>

<p>My second appeal is therefore directed at the protagonists of a race federation. I think the United Party should re-examine and reconsider their policy in respect of &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want the United Party to reconsider and re-examine their policy in the light of these realities. First of all, the Black, Coloured, Indian and White people of South Africa are obviously not prepared to accept their policy. Is there any constitutional lawyer or political scientist of note in South Africa or abroad who has suggested that the United Party&#x2019;s policy in any way offers South Africa a solution?</p>

<p>A reality which makes this policy impracticable, is the fact that it is based exclusively on race. It proposes a three-tier constitutional structure based exclusively on race, on the compartmentalizing &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member in front of me. It requires that at the base of this system, which the United Party proposes, White, Black, Coloured and Indian must vote separately on separate voters&#x2019; rolls. To bring that about, one has to perpetuate racial separation and classification. The hon. member for Carletonville will agree with me that if the Nationalist Government had not separated the races in South Africa by way of the Group Areas Act, the United Party&#x2019;s first act in terms of their policy would have been the introduction of a measure to separate the races, because it would be impossible to start carrying out their policy unless the races are residentially separate. [Interjections.] On this base, in a multi-racial society where people work next to one another in a multi-racial integrated economy, the United Party proposes in a single geographic area the creation of different uni-racial legislative assemblies to exercise authority over that area. A more effective means of perpetuating race prejudice, race discrimination, friction and conflict, could not be designed. Quite clearly, no system designed along these lines, can in any way lead to the lessening of racial tensions. [Interjections.] The United Party, instead of solving the position of race conflict, has designed a new arena for intensified, exacerbated race conflict. I believe that the United Party&#x2019;s policy where single racial units elect single uni-racial legislative assemblies which send uni-racial delegations to the federal assembly, will inevitably result in the purest form of race domination. I again want to refer to the hon. member for Carletonville. He said that the United Party&#x2019;s policy was more dangerous than that of the Progressive Reform Party. The position is that since the United Party has a policy where Whites vote for Whites and Blacks vote for Blacks, i.e. uni-racial electorates elect uni-racial legislative assemblies which send uni-racial delegations to the federal assembly, one will find a situation where the delegation of any one race is accountable electorally only to its own race and has communication with its own race only. Whatever race has a majority in the federal assembly, will in fact constitute the uni-racial Government of the day and will in this way constitute the purest form of race domination that any constitutional system could devise.</p>

<p>I have no time to answer that hon. member&#x2019;s questions. I have only two or three minutes left. To me, a very interesting thinker in the United Party&#x2019;s ranks is the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I would like to quote what he said in <i>The Star</i> in November last year. He spoke of &#x201C;multinational federations&#x201D;. He uses the word &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D;, not &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D;. That makes a very big difference. Has the United Party now changed from &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; to &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D;. The hon. member who has just spoken, spoke of &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; and then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout speaks of a &#x201C;division&#x201D; of power.</p>

<p>The United Party&#x2019;s policy is, however, a sharing of power and the hon. member for Durban Point used those words. The interesting concept of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that he believes in a division of power, is of course in line with the policy of the Nationalist Government. I am not criticizing him because I think his ideas are light years ahead of the ideas of his party. I think that he should enumerate and clarify his idea for our benefit and for the purpose of debate. He speaks about &#x201C;national White&#x201D; and &#x201C;national Black&#x201D; Parliaments. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, once again very interestingly, believes that the White Parliament should continue, but the United Party after tremendous confusion, believes that the White Parliament should disappear. That is important. The United Party believes in legislative assemblies for the other race groups. But the hon. member for Bezuidenhout speaks about &#x201C;Black national Parliaments&#x201D; and &#x201C;White national Parliaments&#x201D;. I think this is very important and very interesting. The hon. member for Bezuidehout obviously believes that the federation should be based on territory and not on dispersed races as the hon. member for Durban Point suggests. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has advanced interesting ideas and thinking in respect of the constitutional future of this country. His ideas are diametrically opposed to those of the United Party and in some respects constitute a total rejection of those ideas, but I think it is incumbent on him to clarify and to articulate his ideas, because it will be a valuable contribution to the overall constitutional debate and that is the appeal I would like to make to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very clear to me that the Progressive Party has no serious intention whatsoever of discussing this deadly serious subject. They sought a political platform from which to pick a quarrel with the people next to them. Why do they involve the Government in a debate like this if they want to quarrel with the United Party? Let us look at the motion. Quite clearly, it stands on two legs. The one concerns the amendment of the constitution, which they request, and the other concerns the amendment of the voting system; in other words, it interferes with our franchise. I should have been pleased if by this time we could have known exactly what the Progressive Party wanted with regard to the second leg, because they have not told us.</p>

<p>No, I do not want to read your books now; I have it here too. What we should have liked was a debate across the floor of this House on that subject. You cannot have a federation without first changing the franchise in such a way that the electoral system allows you to have a House here which will eventually give you the federation. The hon. member says nothing about that; but I want to remind hon. members that last year the hon. member for Yeoville, who raised the matter here, said certain things in the House. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa offered me a home when I was a child and had no home. South Africa has been more than good to me.</block>

<p>Then he spoke about the Prime Minister&#x2019;s d&#x00E9;tente effort, and addressed the following words to the United Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Perhaps the Prime Minister does not want our assistance, but the least we can do is not to stand in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s way.</block>

<p>I now want to ask the hon. member why he came and stood in the hon. Prime Minister&#x2019;s way this morning with a motion of this nature, because it is nothing but petty politics, as he called it in that speech of his. The hon. member holds an important record in this House. The hon. member has succeeded in shaking one party to its foundations within a short time. He established a second party, but <span class="col_2133-2134" refersTo="page_1083"/>then he discovered that that party was a child born out of wedlock because no one wanted to stand in as its father. He then got himself a step-parent and he forced that step-parent to change its name. We cannot leave a motion concerning such serious matters as the franchise and constitutional amendments in the hands of a man who acts so recklessly with regard to political parties, nor can we leave it in the hands of his party.</p>

<p>Let us examine our history. I shall begin a long way back. Do you know that there was a war in this country about franchise and that England forced our republics into a war about the so-called franchise? Do you know that the franchise was such an important matter that certain things were entrenched in the constitution of 1910? After all, you know the history of the Coloureds, the heart-sore and the misery and the hard words spoken in this House about the Coloureds. I now ask him in what way it helped the Coloureds when for all those years he was accorded so-called recognition in that he was given the franchise until 1968. It did not help him in the least, and as a result, when in subsequent years we were faced with the problem of setting them on a new course, those members continued to stand in our way. Let us look at the Bantu. What did those thinkers, those philosophers, give the Bantu? Virtually nothing until 1936. Then something did in fact happen. However, this was not granted without hard words either, and how acrimonious were the debates in the &#x2018;fifties when we wanted to set the Bantu on their own course? Did the P.R.P., in their recent interviews with Matanzima and Buthelezi and others, tell them what they really had in mind for them? Are they still prepared to tell the Xhosas that they should not accept independence in October 1976, and the Tswanas they should not accept independence next year? Is the hon. member prepared to tell them that they should rather come and share in this sharing of power, or sharing of votes? Is he prepared to do it in that way?</p>

<p>No, you could have spoken about the franchise just now and you did not. You intentionally said nothing about it because you did not want to discuss it. I am coming to that now. Do you know that since 1948 the National Party has done various things, and that the most important support it has received has come from eight elections? Eight elections have told the National Party to continue with separate development, and when we allow the emphasis to fall on development, then those philosophers want to emphasize separation. It is true that separation forms part of the process which arises from this, but our point of departure has been development. That they did not want to accept. Possibly the referendum was the very best answer we had, because in the referendum every man had his own vote. We do not vote in constituencies or candidates. Every one could vote and surely the people knew then that the Republic that would come would be established on the basis of separate development. Surely the public knew that, because we did not tell them anything different. The people in that party told them something different. Even at that stage they asked for a federation and the voters did not accept it. [Interjections.] Be quiet now and I shall tell you what you offered the people. Do you know, Sir, what the philosophy of those people is? The best enunciation by far came from Prof. Hancock who wanted to write a biography of Gen. Smuts and became engaged in conversation with certain people. He said that it had struck him that Gen. Smuts had never really taken race relations in South Africa very seriously. At that point a certain Amery, a good friend of Gen. Smuts, who was in the audience, rose to say that that was true. He had confronted him with the same statement and Gen. Smuts had answered&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why waste time searching for a solution to a problem when there is no solution?</block>

<p>A <i>laissez-faire</i> policy; that is what we inherited in 1948, and that was the political fraud on which political parties operated in the past. When that party came into being, the issue was specifically that of the franchise, or have they forgotten that? They all left here in haste to go to a congress in East London and they were all going to plead there for 20 Bantu representatives in this House, but their leader stated that only eight would be allowed. They then split on the land issue. Surely it is true that they themselves split on the franchise issue. Do you know what was the main cause of the downfall of the UP in 1948? Do you know what was the most important nail in their <span class="col_2135-2136" refersTo="page_1084"/>coffin? It was the Indian franchise. The Whites said: &#x201C;No.&#x201D; Now you will perhaps ask me whether the non-Whites were consulted in the process. However we are dealing with the Whites here, but we are honest towards the non-Whites. However, what do those people do with their qualified franchise about which they are silent here. The hon. member for Rondebosch is the chairman of their commission which is to propagate the new idea. He is conspicuous by his absence. At the moment he is not even in the House.</p>

<p>When, in 1964, Dr. Steytler was asked what the qualified franchise aimed at and whether it could eventually result in total Black domination he said that if the non-Whites were to obtain a majority in the Progressive Party, the non-Whites would be able to amend the constitution in order to replace the qualified franchise with a system of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. Listen to what the founder of that party has to say about the path on which he placed those people. When that day comes, he says, he no longer wants to be a member of the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Good gracious! They place the people on a path, they admit that things are moving in a certain direction, but as soon as they achieved their aim, they run away. What we have here, therefore, is an escapist policy.</p>

<p>I do not know why the hon. member keeps interrupting. I cannot hear him while I am talking. Mr. Speaker, the major problem is in respect of the hon. member&#x2019;s leader. In 1960 the hon. member&#x2019;s leader said here in a debate that in any multiracial country like South Africa, there is &#x201C;group loyalty&#x201D;, &#x201C;group feeling&#x201D; and &#x201C;group prejudices&#x201D;, and that the Progressive <span class="col_2137-2138" refersTo="page_1085"/>Party believed that everything possible should be done to reduce that &#x201C;group loyalty&#x201D;, &#x201C;group feeling&#x201D; and &#x201C;group prejudice&#x201D;. Later in the same debate he said that he believed that separate voters&#x2019; rolls would inevitably give rise to a strengthening and accentuation of &#x201C;group loyalty&#x201D;, &#x201C;group suspicion&#x201D; and &#x201C;group activity&#x201D;. He went on to say that because they believed they had to try to combine the populations of South Africa into one social political union, they therefore also believed that representation on a common voters&#x2019; roll would be an improvement. They say this against the background of a negation of identity. The hon. member said this. He did not use the word &#x201C;identity&#x201D; but he will have to explain to us what &#x201C;groups&#x201D; mean. He did not refer here to groups as Nationalists and United Party supporters, but to groups in the sense of colour groups. That is very clear. Now he states that this is the aim of his policy. He must not read to me from that blue book now; I am now quoting from Hansard what he said. If his policy has changed once again, the hon. member for Rondebosch must rise and tell us about the other policy. He states that the PRP will strive to destroy the things which we interpret as identity. Now he also believes in separate states and things of that kind, but your policy contains the principle that the Progressive Party will strive to destroy those things which strengthen identity.</p>

<p>Every time the National Party talks about identity here, then that party becomes terribly obstreperous.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude because my time has expired. I should still just like to say this to the Progressive Party. Whereas history has showed us very clearly over the past 28 years that to the extent that the Whites have been consulted, they do not want this thing, and whereas we are taking part in a debate here today as Whites, why do you stand in the way of our Prime Minister and why do you say things here which must create a different image in the eyes of Africa to that which the Prime Minister sees in the policy of the National Party?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not agree on all points with the hon. member for Westdene, but I do want to associate myself with his remark that we expected to be able to conduct a debate on a high level about the merits of alternative political systems in South Africa and that all we have had thus far from the hon. members for Yeoville and Bryanston has been a petty party political attack on the United Party.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the basic problem and want to say at once that I do of course fully endorse the amendment moved by my colleague, the hon. member for Durban Point. It is very clear that the present political set-up in South Africa, based as it is on the Westminster pattern, does not have the necessary adaptability to accommodate fully the challenges of the times we are living in. What those challenges consist of, is that irrespective of what may occur in the homelands, we shall somehow have to find a political form in which the Coloureds, the Asiatics and those Bantu who are permanently resident outside the homelands can be taken up into our political set-up. This is the challenge we are faced with. Surely, Sir, it is clear that in terms of the sovereign legislative authority, in terms of the exercise of the executive authority and everything that goes with it, such as the determining of policy, our present political set-up is based on this Parliament, and that those population groups are not represented in this Parliament. We should be making no mistake if we were to describe this system as one of White domination of the political scene, with the exclusion of any participation by the non-Whites and other groups to which I have referred. Just as I reject this system because I believe that it does not have the potential to bring about peace and reconciliation in South Africa, I also reject the PRP proposals, because in my honest opinion, what they amount to is simply replacement of White domination by Black domination. The one is just as unacceptable to me as the other. If I had the time, I should have liked to go into this in more detail. Our present system based on the Westminster pattern is not amenable to development of that kind because it is based on the concept of majority rule, as is that of the PRP. According to this pattern, the party which is fortunate enough to win the majority of seats in an election has the sole right to form the Government. It also prescribes the legislative process, and the executive authority is in <span class="col_2139-2140" refersTo="page_1086"/>its hands. It determines domestic and foreign policy and appoints the judges to our bench. Those are the implications of majority rule in our system. In other words, the winner takes all. It is as simple as that.</p>

I shall come back to that later. On the basis of the principle in the Westminster pattern that the winner takes all, the system is not capable of meeting our needs. In a reasonably homogeneous community this does not matter. Where the values are by and large the same&#x2014;there can be party political differences as in America and the United Kingdom&#x2014;it does not matter there if one party is the winner and takes all. However, where there is a heterogeneous society &#x2026; I am very sorry, the hon. member for Carletonville realizes that I do not have much time.</p>

<p>Where there is a heterogeneous community, where there is a possibility of conflicting values, expectations and demands, then it is an entirely different matter. When this is the case, we cannot maintain a system in which one group takes everything there is to be taken in the government of a country. Consequently, in the light of the heterogeneous nature of our society, the Westminster pattern cannot be applied here. This pattern, within the unitary context in which we find ourselves today, was accepted in 1908-&#x2019;09, in spite of the fact that even at that stage there were people who advocated a federal set-up for South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes. It was accepted at a time when the world was entirely different to what it is today. No one who took part in that National Convention of 1908-&#x2019;09 could have foreseen how the world would change in the subsequent 60 to 70 years. At that stage the interests of the non-White and his possible participation in a political structure were not considered at all because it was unnecessary to do so. The whole relationship between White authority and the political rights of non-Whites was simply not considered for the purpose of a political system in those days.</p>

<p>It is quite simple. That was definitely the case. We still fail to recognize that our society is a plural society; and that plurality will have to be reflected at every level of government, in our Parliament, in our executive authority and on every other possible level. If that plurality is not so reflected, we shall continue to live in an air-tight world bearing no relation to reality.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the only alternative is a federal policy. Merely tinkering with the existing set-up, tinkering with the idea of establishing a joint Cabinet council, for example, or tinkering with the question whether we should have an executive system as we knew it in the Free State, or like America&#x2019;s, where the State President or the Prime Minister will have executive authority&#x2014;the latter in a different sense to that of today&#x2014;will definitely not do. What we do need is a total rethink of the basis of our political structure. If we can do nothing to our system, and continue to maintain a system which denies the other groups effective participation in our government, our legislation and our executive authority, then we cannot hope for peace and co-operation in this country. We accept that for a country like South West, some form of federal government is the only possibility. Sometimes I get the impression&#x2014;particularly, too, with regard to what the hon. member for Klip River said this morning&#x2014;that our colleagues on the other side of the House see this Parliament as an exclusive mouthpiece of the White population, as a body representing the will of the White people. I have no objection to that. But then this Parliament must concern itself with matters which only affect the specific interests of the Whites. It is then the duty of this Parliament to establish a body in which the other population groups will be duly represented. However, I want to leave it at that, <span class="col_2141-2142" refersTo="page_1087"/>because in the very short time I still have at my disposal I want to confine myself to the PRP policy.</p>

<p>We have asked the P.R.P. on a number of occasions to provide a precise explanation of their constitutional policy, which was over-hastily accepted at the shotgun marriage which occurred in Johannesburg. They were asked to indicate clearly the implications of that policy. On various occasions we have spelt out our interpretation of those implications, but our interpretation has never been refuted and at the moment we are still waiting for a thorough elucidation of that policy and its implications. I had expected that we would be given those details this morning. I want to refer to a few examples. The hon. member for Yeoville referred to the &#x201C;redrawing of boundaries&#x201D;. Let us hear, then, where those boundaries are.</p>

<p>My question is not an academic one, because the size of the federal House of Assembly will be determined by the number of states according to their constitutional proposals. It will also determine the size of the federal Senate. It will also determine how the members of the federal House of Assembly and the federal Senate will be elected. Furthermore, it will determine the composition of each of the federal states&#x2019; legislative assemblies. As long as we are not clear on that score, we must stick to what is very clear, viz. that there will probably be a majority of non-Whites in the legislative assembly of each state within the federation. On the basis of the information at our disposal at this stage, it is very clear that in the Federal House of Assembly the Whites as a single group will be the biggest group whereas the non-Whites in this Federal House of Assembly will together probably form the majority. Nor is there any doubt that according to their proposals, the non-Whites will be in the majority in a federal Senate. That is a logical interpretation and if I had more time at my disposal, I should have liked to say why I come to these conclusions on the basis of their proposals. Unfortunately time does not permit.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is obvious that the P.R.P. proposals were ill-conceived and are totally incapable of providing adequate answers to the admittedly difficult problem of reconciling the often conflicting political hopes and expectations of the various groups in our population structure. In certain respects those proposals even aggravate the political conflicts and must, to my mind, lead to even greater polarization between the various population groups. Their proposals refuse to recognize and protect these groups and their identity. Their proposals do not sufficiently protect the interests of minority groups. Their proposals replace White domination with Black domination and they do not provide for the adequate representation of all our groups in all levels of government, because they also believe in the majority concept where the winner takes all. In this respect their proposals fail to reflect the plurality of our society. Their so-called safeguards are in the main worthless and valueless. The distinction drawn between the methods employed to determine the number of members&#x2014;i.e. the size of the federal House of Assembly and the federal Senate&#x2014;and the method of electing those members is confusing and hardly likely to inspire confidence. Their fundamental acceptance of the principle of majority rule and the Westminster type of constitutional government simply transposes all the problems existing in our present unitary setup to the proposed federation and particularly in so far as the state legislatures are concerned. I am sorry that I do not have time to deal adequately and fully with all the <span class="col_2143-2144" refersTo="page_1088"/>proposals of the P.R.P. in this connection, but I want to say that I am convinced they do not have the answer to the very, very difficult problem in South Africa of finding political accommodation for all the various groups.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we have to work out a constitutional framework for South Africa, we must first consider the people for whom we have to work out that constitutional framework. When one looks at the population of South Africa, a few things strike one immediately. In the first place, the people living in South Africa do not only belong to different races, but differ from each other in other ways as well. We have the White South Africans, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Black people of South Africa. It is of essential, and, in my opinion, of decisive importance that when we look at the Black people of South Africa, we must know, realize, and accept that the Black people are not merely Black people, but consist of groups of people belonging to different nations. We have Zulus, Sothos, Xhosas and so on. These people differ from each other in regard to language, culture, traditions, and history, and even their heroes are not the same. When we seek to solve the constitutional problems of South Africa, we must accept that we must do so against this background. We in South Africa have a population which is comprised of poor people and rich people, of educated people and uneducated people. We have a 100% heterogeneous community in South Africa.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Yeoville discusses a federation for South Africa and states that Switzerland is a good example, I reject that out of hand. When he refers us to the USA as a good example, we reject that entirely, because whereas it is true that the federation they have there is successful, it is there to meet the needs of the population, which is to a large extent a homogeneous one. He cannot transplant a solution for a homogeneous community onto a heterogeneous community and think that he has thereby solved the problems of South Africa. While I am dealing with the hon. member for Yeoville, I want to point out that when he refers to Bantustans, I know that he does so with the aim of being insulting, not only towards the Government&#x2019;s policy, but also towards the Black people of South Africa, who seek their own development within the framework of that policy. [Interjections.] On behalf of the Black people, I want to reject the insult to the Black people implied in the hon. member&#x2019;s words as being despicable, as it indeed is.</p>

<p>The central problem of politics in South Africa, and everywhere else in the world, is that it concerns power. The power struggle is the central problem and the central situation as regards the politics of South Africa, as is the case in politics anywhere. The name of the game is power. When we do not bear that in mind, then we negate the most important element, in my humble opinion, of the possibility of a successful solution to the problems of South Africa. Now it is true that in the light of the above we must also bear in mind that as the social level, the economic level and the level of education of the Black people of South Africa rise&#x2014;they have risen under this Government&#x2014;these people become more aware of their own identity in the first place, and the need for political power that goes with it.</p>

<p>It is most important that a process is under way in South Africa in which the Black peoples of South Africa are becoming aware of their own identity&#x2014;not <i>qua</i> Black person, but <i>qua</i> member of a specific people. This is a world phenomenon. Throughout the world people are becoming more aware of their specific identity.</p>

<p>We in South Africa must adopt a policy the logical consequences of which do not frighten us. This Government is working day and night to bring to fruition the logical consequences of its policy. We are not afraid of telling the world what the logical consequence of our policy is; it is that the Black people of South Africa will become independent, that every Black state will become fully independent. That is the logical consequence of our policy. But the hon. members on that side of the House do not have the courage to rise and tell the people of South Africa: &#x201C;The logical consequence of my policy is this, and that is what I am working towards.&#x201D; If the logical consequence of your policy is the sharing of power, then the logical result of the implementation <span class="col_2145-2146" refersTo="page_1089"/>thereof is that the majority of the people must rule.</p>

<p>All this leads to a specific dilemma, a dilemma which, as can clearly be seen, is taking shape in Rhodesia. It is the dilemma that if people want to act in a morally correct way they must be prepared and able to accept the logical consequences of their policy.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s policy is based on two premises. The first premise is that everyone in South Africa is fully entitled to his own self-determination, and the second is that the various justified aspirations for power of all the people must be reconciled with each other in a way which will not give rise to conflict and bloodshed. This reconciliation of power for which we must fight, can be effected in one of two ways. The first is that we should have a sharing of power, and the second is that we should have a division of powers. That is the real constitutional problem of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a very wide gap between the Opposition and ourselves, but there is no real difference in principle between the two opposition parties present in the House. Both want to share power. The dogfight we have seen here today only concerned the details of that principle. It did not concern the principle of the sharing of power itself, but the detail involved. The details of the policy were discussed. We on this side of the House say that there is an unbridgeable gap between the Government and that side of the House with regard to this vital matter. That is why we say that we can never find each other in regard to this matter. However, the Progressive Party and the United Party, on the other hand, can find each other in this regard, because they are both in favour of the same thing. In the final analysis the saying&#x2014;&#x201C;the proof of the pudding is in the eating&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2014;is true. If we want to know what is going to work with regard to the reconciliation of aspirations for power, we must consider what works in Africa. Does the United Party&#x2019;s and the Progressive Party&#x2019;s policy of the sharing of power work in Africa, or does the Government&#x2019;s policy of the separation of powers work? I want to point to a number of examples to show that separation of powers works in Africa and that sharing of powers, as is proposed by the Opposition parties, does not work in Africa at all, and is doomed to utter failure.</p>

<p>Business suspended at 12h45 and resumed at 14h15.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before business was suspended I was saying that when we consider a constitutional system for a country, the question must be asked: Is it going to work or is it not going to work? My standpoint is that the plan of members on the other side of the House, the federation plan, whether it is of the United Party&#x2019;s or the Progressive Reform Party&#x2019;s, is not going to work. The most conclusive evidence I have for this, is the fact that in Africa the federation system does not work at all. I want to mention to you a few examples of failures of federation in Africa. Until 1972 the Cameroons was a federation. It is no longer one today. In 1962 there were efforts to convert Zaire, the then Congo-Kinshasa, into a federation, but that failed. Then, too, there were the French colonies in French West Africa, which were in the form of a federation&#x2014;that failed. There were also the three British colonies of Central Africa. They formed a federation and this, too failed. Then there was the federation of the French Sudan, now Mali and Senegal, the so-called Mali federation. This federation, too, went the way of all flesh. Then we had the efforts to combine Senegal and Gambia into a federation in 1962. This, too, failed. We had the well-known federation of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. This failed in 1963. Then, too, we had the federation of Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia. What happened here? We need no longer guess; it failed.</p>

<p>Today we have only three federations in Africa. Firstly, there is the federation of Tanzania, and there democracy has been abolished. Secondly, there is the federation in Nigeria. There democracy has been abolished and a military government is in power. Thirdly, we have the federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, established in 1952. What is happening there today? The Eritreans have to shed blood in order to acquire their freedom under this federation. I want to predict that if <span class="col_2147-2148" refersTo="page_1090"/>we in South Africa wanted a federation with the Black people, then the day would come when those same Black people would fight to free themselves from that federation, because even if there were no Whites in South Africa, I still say that the Black people of South Africa would never be able to establish a successful federation; it would be doomed to failure because Africa does not endure federations. In Angola we have a situation of conflict. Why do we have this conflict, Sir? Basically, the fundamental reason for that conflict lies in the dispute in international law between the people of Angola, something which we cannot get around.</p>

<p>Then, too, we had the efforts by Cecil John Rhodes and Lord Malvern to establish an imperial federation from Cape Town to Kenya. This, too, failed. When we look at the principles of the policy of the opposition parties, viz. the sharing of power, then we know that if we were to apply that abomination of a federation to Africa, we would be heading for misery, conflict, decay and bloodshed. The path to success for South Africa and for Africa lies in recognizing the diversity of peoples in Africa and South Africa. It lies in recognizing the right of self-determination of each nation, and it also consists of taking the practical steps necessary to give expression in practice to the desire of every person to be his own mater.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down gave us a list of African states which had a federal system and which according to him ended in failure. He should remember that there are another 47 African states and that most of them are unitary states. The hon. member will say, of course, that they too have failed. They are practically all military dictatorships or have experienced <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tats.</i> Why does the hon. member not quote these unitary states as well? Why only the states with a federal system? The hon. member arrived at the crux of the matter just before we suspended business for lunch. He said that the crucial question concerned power. I think he is right. He interpreted the matter correctly when he said this. He then continued by saying that the choice lies between separation of power on the one hand and sharing of power on the other hand. However, in that respect the hon. member is hopelessly wrong. He is wrong because in reality, in spite of pious words, power is already being shared between White and Black in South Africa. This is so. We should not see power only in terms of the ballot box or franchise. Of course this is an important aspect of power. However, it is not power; there are other factors as well which contribute to the total political power of individuals or groups within the society, such as numbers, sophistication, leadership, perspicacity, level of education, level of development, economic power&#x2014;all these factors are power factors. We must take them all into consideration if we wish to draw up a future constitutional policy for South Africa. Franchise is important, and it is especially important as a means through which power can be exercised in a peaceful and orderly fashion. But to compare power with franchise is to close one&#x2019;s eyes to the real situation. During the past years, especially during the past 20 years, there has been a large-scale shift of power to which the hon. member referred. There has been a shift of power in South Africa, a shift of the exclusive power which the White man originally had to more and more power, intrinsic power, to the Black people.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, there has been a change of power. There has been a shift of power from White exclusiveness to the Black people, and I believe that we have to acknowledge this. When the hon. member speaks of &#x201C;skeiding&#x201D;, then I say that &#x201C;skeiding&#x201D;, if it is going to be anything, has got to be a radical structural &#x201C;skeiding&#x201D;&#x2014;not only little pieces of land, but &#x201C;skeiding&#x201D; of resources, &#x201C;skeiding&#x201D; of potential. There must be a complete division, because there is no point in having a small territorial division of land and believing that this is a real division of power. You have to eliminate the sources of conflict where there is potential conflict between power structures, and you will only do that by a much more radical separation than the hon. members opposite suggest.</p>

<p>It is a pity that the Government speakers have so far rejected out of hand the concept of federalism. I think that it is a pity, because they say that they reject it because it implies sharing of power. I say that when the hon. the Prime Minister sits on a Cabinet council with Coloured people, he is sharing power with those Coloured people. What else is he doing? <span class="col_2149-2150" refersTo="page_1091"/>That is a means of sharing power. It is a means, I believe, of in due course accommodating States outside South Africa which come within the total power structure of southern Africa. It is one area, it is one solution to the political problems of South. Africa in regard to which you can get significant support from Black South Africans. However, I think that it is unwise of the Government to abandon federation because they do not like the word. One of these days they might well have to return to federation as a lifeline for themselves and for this country. As far as the hon. members on my right are concerned it is a pity that they have turned this debate into a party-political slanging match. [Interjections.]</p>

The hon. member suggests that we have not presented our policy, but he knows full well that he and I debated this in half-hour speeches during the Part Appropriation debate last year, and subsequently. He is fully aware of that. We have spelled it out in detail and we will be spelling it out again as time becomes available.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>The essence of the attack of the hon. members on my right deals with the issue of a Black majority. I believe that we should get rid of this because this is an argument which should not exist between people on this side of the House, whether they are in the UP or the PRP. If we are going to get rid of race discrimination within a single political entity in South Africa, then there are consequences which the hon. member for Durban Point cannot run away from. One of the two elements of the United Party&#x2019;s constitutional policy is a federal assembly, which will have all the powers which it cannot entrust to ethnic councils. That federal assembly will be just as much Black-dominated as any other assembly created by any other party, if the United Party is going to get rid of race discrimination. [Interjections.] The general secretary of the party, Senator Horak, has said this. Why do the hon. members say he is talking nonsense? I do not think they need to be ashamed of it, but there is a distinct difference between our policy for our national assembly and theirs, and the difference is this: We will extend the franchise to people on the basis of merit and of educational attainment. [Interjections.] If you get rid of discrimination, then the time will come when there will be more Black voters in South Africa than White voters; nobody is arguing about that, but in terms of their policy there will be Black voters who will elect Black candidates to look after Black interests. There will be a polarization, and there is no prospect in terms of their policy of getting a meeting of interests between Blacks and Whites in South Africa. That is the specific difference.</p>

<p>Secondly, to eliminate this argument once and for all, there is the question of what powers can be handed over to the ethnic councils, because this is their so-called safety device. I want to say&#x2014;and I will deal with it again and again in the course of debates&#x2014;that when one takes the speeches of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, the hon. member for Hillbrow and the hon. member for Eden-vale, in terms of those speeches which they are making time and time again, there is virtually nothing which you can hand over to an ethnic council. The hon. member for Hillbrow says that we must get rid of all statutory social colour bars. Once you have done that, there is no aspect of social life which you can hand over to a separate racial council in South Africa. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has said that you do not lose your identity in an open society. He said that the Greeks do not lose it, the Portuguese do not lose it, the English do not lose it, and the Afrikaner does not lose it. In other words, they do not need separate racial councils to protect their identity. The hon. member for Edenvale has attacked separate hospitals, separate educational institutions, separate universities, separate trade unions&#x2014;you name it, he has attacked it, because he says it is discrimination. If in fact those hon. members are going to get rid of discrimination on the terms in which they are speaking of it today, then there is precious little which you can hand over to an ethnic council on a formal constitutional basis.</p>

<p>I believe we must stop playing these little games with one another and come back to the fundamentals which confront us all in South <span class="col_2151-2152" refersTo="page_1092"/>Africa, and that is not whether there is going to be a separation of power or not, but how in fact we can devise a means of sharing the power which already exists in South Africa. I believe that we must take note of the growing importance of the Black and Brown South Africans in this country, and if we are going to get rid of discrimination, we must follow it to its logical conclusion. It is no use saying that we are going to get rid of discrimination in everything other than the political field. The hon. members opposite have issued a statement together with the Black leaders, in which they said: &#x201C;We reject discrimination in any shape or form. &#x201D; I accept that that is their view, but then that must be followed through to its logical conclusion. We are prepared to follow it through and we believe that in due course inexorably these gentlemen will have to follow us.</p>

<p>If we are committed to getting rid of racial discrimination, I believe that we have to face up to the fact of multi-racialism&#x2014;and I use this word advisedly. We do not want a pale neutral grey South African population. We find that South Africa is exciting and interesting, not merely because there are different ethnic groups or different colours. There are different languages and different religions. There are different cultural norms and different economic classes. We believe that the people who belong to those various categories should have the protection of the law on their side and that they should not be forced into a homogeneous neutral grey South African society.</p>

<p>We have to realize too that no solution for the future constitutional development of South Africa is going to last and is going to be worth while unless it is fashioned by Black and White people together. We cannot have a solution imposed by a White Parliament on Black people, or by a Black Parliament on White people. It has to be a solution which is worked out together and agreed to by the representatives of the Black and the White and the Brown people. We believe that there should be a getting together, as was attempted in Rhodesia, and as there is now in South West Africa, an attempt of the leaders of the various communities to get together and to fashion a political future for South Africa. When we present our federal proposals, they must be seen in the light that these are the proposals which we believe should be presented to a national convention of the people of South Africa to get the broadest national assent for them.</p>

<p>The federal system of government is the system most likely to achieve an equitable sharing of political power without discrimination against individuals or against groups in South Africa.</p>

<p>We do not believe that federation in itself is a magic talisman, but at least this will create the conditions, the constitutional order, in which it will be possible both to extend power with safety and to share power with safety for all the people of South Africa. A federation, if it is to mean anything, involves sovereign entities, each having a defined degree of power and being sovereign in their field of power. If a body is going to be sovereign in its field of power, then it must have a territorial basis. You cannot have a State-within-a-State situation. You cannot say that the Coloured Parliament can be sovereign if it does not have a formal territory over which it can exercise its sovereignty. We believe that it is essential in South Africa that we should redelimit the existing provinces and the existing homelands, taking into account community of interests, interests which may be ethnic, linguistic, agricultural or economic. But taking all the factors of community of interest into account, we believe that new self-governing provinces should be fashioned in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I have a problem, as I have only five minutes left, but I will do so later on, by all means. We do not believe that any of these States will be racially exclusive. They will include all the people who happen to be living in the State. This offers an opportunity for people of different races to develop a common interest because of local interests and regional interests rather than interests of only national concern. We accept the concept of self-governing States dealing with matters of <span class="col_2153-2154" refersTo="page_1093"/>local concern, but it is essential for matters of national concern that there should be a national Parliament. We accept the concept of a national Parliament to deal with matters of national concern. We also believe in a bicameral Parliament which consists of a Lower House and a Senate. I do not know whether hon. members on my right do. The Lower House should be the House which represents the people, and the Senate should in the main be the House which represents the various self-governing States which form that federation. That is the basic division between these two authorities.</p>

<p>When it comes to the franchise, we believe that this should be extended progressively to all the peoples of this country. We have no reservations about that. It has to be extended progressively to all the peoples of South Africa. As people grow in residual political power, they must get the means of expressing that political power. It is important from our point of view to have a regulator, because we do not believe that one can move from a point of exclusive White political control to a situation of shared political power without a transition. Therefore we say that there has to be a transition mechanism, and we make no apologies for this. We believe that the best way of achieving it&#x2014;and there may be other ways which we would be prepared to consider&#x2014;is to see that on the one hand the franchise is made as broad as possible to include as many people as possible, and at the same time that those people who have reached a certain level of sophistication within what is a complicated modern society are those ones who should have the dominant say during the transition period. So we say that all people who have basic literacy can enjoy the franchise for one-half of the seats. Those people who have basic literacy would include people with B.A. degrees as well as people with Std. VIII. We believe the other half of the seats should be voted for by those people who have reached the level of free compulsory education provided by the State. We believe that as long as there is an onus on the State to provide free compulsory education to everybody in South Africa, it is reasonable to say that that should be the level that one sets for participation in both votes for the House of Assembly.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is our policy. [Interjections.] We believe that at this stage the aim should be free compulsory education for everybody up to the level of Std. VIII. This is what the State will provide, and this is what the test should be. We also say, and I shall come back to this, that everybody with basic literacy will at least have a vote for the proportional representation roll which forms 50% of the seats.</p>

<p>There is one other point that I want to mention. Hon. members want to know where the protection is. I think that to protect minorities by entrenching racial divisions in South Africa, is going to be disastrous for the White minority in South Africa. I believe that those protections will be achieved through a Bill of Rights, plus a fragmentation of power, plus an independent judiciary, plus the means of preventing domination by not being able to alter the constitution except with the approval of 75% of both Houses of Parliament. These things collectively, we believe, provide the constitutional safeguards. However, the ultimate safeguard does not lie either in their constitutional policy or in ours. The ultimate safeguard lies in trying to find a society in which Black and White are emotionally prepared to try to come to a political reconciliation. This is what, I believe, is the ultimate. What we have suggested is an aid, a means, which indicates an acceptance of the concept of the plurality of the South African society. What is far more important than the plurality of the South African society, is that we are one South Africa. It is within that context of one South Africa that we shall have to find a common political solution.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by raising a matter which&#x2014;and I say this with all respect&#x2014;is beyond your control. It is a matter over which you do not have control. I should like to know from the hon. members of the Progressive Party why they move a motion in this House. I should think they would move a motion in this House because they expect the Government to reply to it. Surely this is why they move a motion; to encourage discussion among members and to get answers to their questions to the Government. However, the hon. Whip of the Progressive Party could not arrange his time in such a way that the Government representative could have more than 10 minutes to reply to the debate. Only 10 minutes are left &#x2026;</p>

<p>I say quite honestly that I do not even feel like replying to the debate. Why should I? If the hon. members do not even have the decency to grant the Government side sufficient time to be able to reply to the debate, why should we reply to it?</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party tried to compress into a period of 20 minutes a policy speech which he would not be able to complete in two hours. What is the sense of that? He is the leader of the party and the motion which he laid before this House deals with a federal system of government and also with a proportional electoral system. This is what it is concerned with. It is not concerned with all the aspects of a policy which he tried to force down all our throats at 100 miles an hour. He rushed through his speech so rapidly that that one almost got the impression that he wanted to deal with about 20 different aspects.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this arrangement of the hon. the Whip of the Progressive Party today is only an example of the way time will be dealt with by this side of the House in future. I can assure you now that the very next time I have the opportunity, I shall rise early during the time allowed for the motion and I shall make excessive use of their time for the purposes of my reply. I am convinced that this was not what the hon. member for Yeoville wanted. The hon. member for Yeoville wanted a debate here today. He wanted us to debate with each other. I spend hours trying to give them a proper answer, but they grant me only 10 minutes to reply. I am not prepared to answer a question if they do not have the decency to leave me sufficient time for it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban Point proposed an amendment to the motion which is before the House. I should like to begin by saying that that amendment is not accepted by this side of the House. I shall come to the reasons for this. For the same reasons we also reject the motion moved by the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville asks: &#x201C;That this House calls upon the Government to recommend to the State President to appoint a commission of inquiry in order to investigate and report upon the desirability of introducing a federal system of government for the Republic of South Africa and upon the desirability of introducing an electoral system of which proportional representation is an integral part.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is not necessary for the hon. House to recommend this to the State President, because a commission cannot determine policy.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. Whip of the Progressive Party would just keep his mouth shut, I would perhaps be able to talk to the hon. member for Yeoville. A commission cannot determine policy. A country&#x2019;s policy is determined by the electorate itself. Over the past 27 years, in seven or eight different elections, the White electorate in South Africa has rejected all forms of federalism as presented by the two parties on the other side. I want to qualify this statement by immediately saying to the hon. leader of the Progressive Party that this side of the House does not reject the concept of &#x2018;&#x2018;federation&#x2019;&#x2019; or &#x201C;federalism&#x201D; as such. This has never been done. It has never been done by the hon. the Prime Minister. Nor has it ever been done by a speaker on this side of the House. The concept as such has never been rejected. What this debate is concerned with is the nature of the federations and federal concepts which are at issue today. This is what it is concerned with, and this is what we are debating today. If they had granted me sufficient time, I would have tried to elucidate this question. However, I am not going to do this, because there are a few other points I wish to discuss.</p>

<p>Why do the voters reject these forms of federalism? They simply do this because they are not prepared to play a subordinate part as a minority group, as part of a pluralistic community, in their own country. The second reason is that every nation should retain political power over itself. The voters also reject this because they stand for the preservation of the identity of the individual and of the group or nation to which he belongs. These things are rejected by the majority. The <span class="col_2157-2158" refersTo="page_1095"/>majority of the White voters stand for the policy of the Nationalist Party which recognizes the right to sovereignty. In the case of the Black man a federal form of government would destroy this ultimate aim.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this side of the House rejects the motion because proportional franchise created chaos in some countries, and in any case cannot succeed in South Africa with its particular pluralistic or geographical set-up. This is our most important reason for rejecting the motion. A further reason why the motion is rejected, is that the federation advocated by the United Party could lead to nothing but a Black majority government. The Progressive Party accepts a Black majority government as their premise. I know there are hon. members of the United Party who do not agree with this. The hon. member for Von Brandis stated this very clearly in a long article in <i>The Star</i> of 25 August 1972. In that article the hon. member for Von Brandis said how the federation plan would work. Each of the four provinces and/or other groups would have three representatives, forming a total of 45. Three representatives from each province gives one 12; one representation for the Indians gives one three; two Coloured representations give one six, and eight Bantu representations give one 24. Therefore there is a sum total of 45 representatives who are nominated for the federal Parliament. Then 120 seats remain, and the hon. member for Von Brandis expects that in the first election which would take place, the Whites would gain at least 80% of the seats. However, he says that, taking into consideration the policy of the United Party, the federal Parliament would be constituted as follows: Whites, 108, Bantu, 38; Coloureds, 12 and Indians, 7. So there is a total of 165 members. In other words, the non-White bloc consists of 57 people and should the Whites be represented in that Parliament on the same basis as in this Parliament, they would be divided more or less as follows, and we must accept that the United Party would then be ruling; the United Party, 60, the National Party, 37 and the Progressive Reform Party, 11, a total of 108. If one were now to add the non-White bloc of 57 to the 11 of the Progressive Party, then we would start with a majority of 68, and where would they fit in other than with the Black people and with the Coloured people? Under the United Party&#x2019;s federal government, therefore, one would have a Black majority government from the outset. This is under their own policy&#x2014;these are not our calculations; these are their own calculations.</p>

<p>Now the hon. Senator J. L. Horak, the general secretary of the United Party, says with reference to this federal government, concerning the powers which are transferred from the White Parliament to the federal parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That power will continue to be transferred to the federal assembly from the White Parliament until Parliament will disappear.</block>

<p>Now the hon. member for Durban Point says today&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The end of the road remains in the hands of the people who set up the machinery.</block>

<p>I ask you, Sir! One starts with a Black majority from the outset. How can one keep the machinery in the hands of the Whites? Sir, this is why these forms of federalism are rejected, because the way things are on the United Party side, this is nothing other than gradual suicide&#x2014;not even sudden suicide, but gradual suicide. Now one can well understand why Mr. Mike Mitchell one day exclaimed here in frustration: &#x201C;It is what it is!&#x201D;</p>

<p>The policy of the Progressive Reform Party is also rejected, because they advocate proportional representation where franchise will be granted to all citizens who, firstly, possess basic literacy and, secondly, have reached the required level of education or have at any stage been registered as voters for Parliament. The principle of Black majority is accepted by them. The hon. member for Sea Point also said today that this should be accepted as such. Now, one cannot help pitying their own people. I read a letter in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 15 December last year, written by a certain Mr. Roger Hulley. He took very strong exception to the allegation of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that the Progressive Party&#x2019;s policy would lead to a Black majority Government&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Secondly, our policy is not Black majority rule, as Mr. Basson tries to suggest. We are bitterly opposed to both Black racialism and White racialism. The only kind of rule for us is multi-racial rule based on individual merit &#x2026; If this scheme sounds like <span class="col_2159-2160" refersTo="page_1096"/>advocating Black majority rule, then words mean nothing.</block>

<p>These are the poor people&#x2019;s own voters. Today has been the second time during the past two weeks that the hon. member for Bryanston has referred with great enthusiasm to his real leader who has not yet come over with him, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He said we should take note of what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, because he is such a progressive thinker, in the academic sense of the word, that we should take note of his thoughts. He then requested the hon. member to elaborate on his thoughts which he expresses from time to time. Sir, he need not elaborate on them. The hon. member can simply read <i>New Nation</i> of 17 November 1971. There all the ideas of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout are spelt out. He can read this. I have it here if he wants it. What this amounts to is that in many respects the view held by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout on this matter is very close to that of the National Party. As an ultimate result he wants a confederation of states in Southern Africa. Basically this is what it amounts to. But he is caught up in the ultimate result of a federation of groups in Southern Africa, and on the other hand the territorial federation, which I think he himself does not know what it is. This is why voters ask questions, and this is why they reject certain policies.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I would just like to put a few questions to the Progressive Party, questions to which they could perhaps reply in the Appropriation debate which lies ahead. These are: Firstly, what is their concept of the various states which their federal body would consist of? Secondly, when would a person qualify for permanent residence? Thirdly, what do they mean by basic literacy? Fourthly, what do they mean by required level of education or, as they further say, people who have at any stage been registered as voters for this Parliament? Does this include all previous Black and Coloured Voters? The hon. members unfortunately do not know, and I am sorry I do not have the time to tell them why they do not know. I could have quoted to them from their own letter, but I would rather use this in a later debate.</p>

<p>I would like to conclude&#x2014;I see my time has expired&#x2014;by reading to you what the hon. the Prime Minister said. The hon. the Prime Minister expressed this view on 4 February 1974, and I think it is a very good answer to some of the arguments which were raised today by members on the other side. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to make very serious appeal to South Africa and its people now to reject once and for all this idea of a political federation as the most pernicious idea there could be for South Africa. If one toys with the idea of a political federation in South Africa, one must bear one&#x2019;s history in mind. There have been many great moments in our political history, but I think that if a person were to ask you today to mention to him the three great moments in the political history of South Africa, the first would be the standpoint adopted by General Hertzog of &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;; the second great moment would be the standpoint of Dr. Malan and the National Party that there should be republican independence in South Africa; and the third is the standpoint of the National Party that independent Black States should be established. There should be no doubt for South Africa and its people&#x2014;no matter to what extent the hon. members frighten people&#x2014;that this is and remains the policy of South Africa; it is the only valid policy which there is for South Africa to build on.</block>

<p>I think this is stated very clearly.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would just like to leave a thought with hon. members. The future will demand new thought in South Africa&#x2014;of course. The National Party has never said that the concepts it has created will not be developed by it. When the various homelands have received independence, there will be situations which will have to be reviewed. But we cannot look at a system of proportional representation when we see the problems it has caused throughout the world. Think of the problems this has caused in countries in Europe through the establishment of small parties and weak coalition governments! Countries like Italy, which has had 58 governments over a period of a few years. At one stage the Netherlands had 28 different parties or groups represented in their parliament. Why is this so? Proportional representation simply does not succeed where the population is not homogeneous. Therefore we must look for something else. Had the <span class="col_2161-2162" refersTo="page_1097"/>opportunity been there, I would have been able to supply the answers today, but now I must conclude in general terms. One must look for something different, because proportional representation cannot succeed in a population situation such as the one we have in South Africa. What the hon. member for Pretoria Central said was true.</p>

<p>I would like to express my sincere thanks to hon. members, especially on our side of the House, for the contributions which they made to the debate. As the hon. member for Pretoria Central said, there is hardly a country&#x2014;in fact, there is no country&#x2014;in Africa where the system which propagated by the other side has worked. The countries where it does work are some countries in Western Europe, and these are exceptions, while in the countries where it is a failure, it is an absolutely chaotic failure.</p>

<p>For that reason we on this side of the House say that the federal concepts advocated by you on the other side cannot succeed. The electorate rejects them, and would reject them again. For that reason we do not even want to discuss it any further. Hon. members will have to suggest something different if they want to have a discussion with us. We have made our policy and our standpoint clear. The proportional form of electoral system which you advocate has been proved throughout the world to be a failure in a population situation such as the one in South Africa. For that reason I am not prepared to accept either the motion of the hon. member or the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Point.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its approval of the generally high level of economic development that has been brought about for the homelands through the actions of various corporations and in particular the recent steps to establish its own specific national corporation for each homeland with a view to ensuring further sustained economic growth.</block>

<p>The policy of ethnic development in South Africa has already reached an advanced stage, its course having been so securely mapped out by this Government that there is no turning back. This policy is aimed at developing an ethnic pattern in South Africa in accordance with which each nation may aspire without hindrance to its own self-realization. Although the struggle for freedom of the Black man in certain parts of Africa has gone hand in hand with violence and confrontation, we find the direct opposite in the Republic, viz. a sincere desire on the part of the Government to take positive steps to emancipate the Black man and to assist him in acquiring his own sovereign independence. The coming independence of the Transkei and the envisaged independence of Bophuthatswana, seen in conjunction with the stirrings in many of the other homelands, have caused the opponents of this policy, primarily the integrationists on that side&#x2014;or should I rather say &#x201C;racists&#x201D;, for those people cannot get away from the concept of &#x201C;race&#x201D;; they still do not understand the concept of &#x201C;nation&#x201D;, perhaps because some of them do not really belong to a nation&#x2014;to realize that they are losing the struggle in respect of the political development of the ethnic policy of the Government. The political development is taking place on an ethnic basis, and not on a racial basis. It is the policy of the National Party to create a situation in South Africa with which and through which it also gives and establishes what it claims as its God-given and inalienable birthright to the other peoples of South Africa as well.</p>

<p>Because the opponents of ethnic freedom realize that they have lost the argument on the political aspects, they are trying to fall back onto a secondary argument. They are arguing that the homelands are not economically viable and do not afford their people the possibility of a livelihood. They are also arguing that the Government is not doing enough in this regard. The argument is being advanced that total economic independence is in fact a prerequisite for political sovereignty. This standpoint is not true&#x2014;it is invalid because the entire tendency in the world today is towards increasing economic interdependence. I cannot illustrate this better than by quoting the example of the economic interdependence <span class="col_2163-2164" refersTo="page_1098"/>of Lesotho, Swaziland. Botswana and the Republic of South Africa. For the purpose of the argument I could include Mozambique as well. I do not want to elaborate on this argument, because I do not think there could be a better example to prove that economic independence is not a prerequisite for political independence than that of the BLS countries, together with Mozambique. In any case, where does one find a country today which is able to isolate itself to such an extent from the rest of the world that it is able to say that economically its sovereign independence is so complete that it does not need anything from anybody, and that it does not need to buy from anyone or does not need anyone to buy from it. In reality we are moving ever farther in the direction of greater economic interdependence, and the EEC is an example of this. We have to accept that the key to future relations between South Africa and the homelands in South Africa, as well as the other countries of Southern Africa, is greater economic co-operation and interdependence on the basis of an equal status for each to the mutual benefit of each State. This amounts to an economic power bloc of states in Southern Africa based on equality and on respect for one another&#x2019;s political sovereignty and integrity.</p>

<p>It is true that the development of the homelands into economically viable units is a very important aspect. In this regard the development corporations have played a very important role. In the first place, I want to say something about the origin of the idea of a development corporation dealing with the Black people. What gave rise to the establishment of development corporations was a recommendation of the Tomlinson Commission. The commission recommended that a development body, over and above the S.A. Bantu Trust, be established to participate, and frequently take the initiative, in the establishment of industrial undertakings, and to promote the development of Black enterprise and economy. There was legislation establishing the Bantu Investment Corporation. This was followed by legislation establishing the Xhosa Development Corporation. With the passing of the Promotion of the Economic Development of Bantu Homelands Act, Act 46 of 1968, authorization was granted for the establishment of further corporations, and the Bantu Mining Corporation was also established. In this way we had primarily these three corporations, the BMC, XDC and BIC, which dealt with economic development in the homelands.</p>

<p>I should like to sum up the activities and the aims of the BIC and the XDC as follows &#x2026; [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, empty vessels make the most noise. Would he please keep quiet, for he is making a lot of noise. I want to summarize these as follows: The provision, in the first place, of capital and means, technical and other assistance, the provision of expert and specialized advice and information as well as guidance to the entrepreneurs; and, in the second place, the encouragement, expansion and establishment of industrial, financial and other undertakings in the homelands, and the encouragement of thrift among Black people; the planning and the promotion of capital formation; the promotion of self-reliance in economic spheres; and the take-over of existing business enterprises, industries, partnerships or companies in the Black areas.</p>

<p>As far as the BMC is concerned, we may summarize its functions into two points: Firstly, the location, development and exploitation of economically utilizable mineral resources, where possible in co-operation with Black entrepreneurs; and secondly, the motivation of White bodies, which have the necessary funds and technical skills at their disposal, to participate actively, subject to specific conditions, in the location and development of mining and mining activities within the homelands.</p>

<p>If we consider the economic growth as well as the development which has taken place in the homelands, then I am of the opinion that the three development corporations, particularly the former two, have made a significant contribution during the past 15 years. Over the last five years in particular the corporations have made an exceptional contribution to the growth in the homelands as a result of the programmes launched by the corporations. If we consider the gross domestic product of the homelands in the Republic we shall see that the GDP of the homelands increased phenomenally from R138,5 million in the period 1960-&#x2019;61 to R307 million in 1970-&#x2019;71, and subsequently to R509 million in 1973-&#x2019;74. Expressed as a percentage it means that the average annual growth rate of the GDP of the homelands increased from 4% in the decade of the fifties to 6,3% in the decade of the &#x2019;sixties. Between 1969-&#x2019;70 and 1973-&#x2019;74 the growth <span class="col_2165-2166" refersTo="page_1099"/>increased tremendously from 6,3% to 16,3% in terms of the GDP. What is important is that the growth rates I have mentioned, excluding the growth rate of the &#x2019;fifties, are considerably higher than the average growth rate of the economy in South Africa as a whole. This indicates the excellent results obtained with the development programmes of the corporations and other bodies in the homelands. The fact of the matter is that the growth rate within the homelands is greater than the growth rate of the economy as a whole. This is a very important and cardinal point and was brought out, <i>inter alia,</i> by the untiring actions of the development corporations. This was a fine achievement on the part of the development corporations. In this connection I want to mention other Government bodies as well, but these do not have a bearing on my motion. If we consider further signs of growth, we see that considerable growth has taken place in respect of the added value of the secondary sectors in the homelands. Growth in the added value of secondary sectors in an economy indicates that there has been economic industrial development and activity in that the input which was made is on a higher level as a result of industrial actions. In the Transkei this added value in the secondary sectors increased from R3,6 million to R8,6 million over the period 1969-&#x2019;78 to 1973-&#x2019;74&#x2014;an increase of 138%. The increase in added value in KwaZulu was 130,8%. The increase in added value in Bophuthatswana was from R1,9 million to R9,0 million. In other words, there was a growth in the added value of approximately 373%. This is growth. Quantitatively it is not considerable, but the fact of the matter is that percentage-wise, tremendous growth is taking place in the homelands. This growth is being generated, <i>inter alia</i>, through the actions of the various corporations.</p>

<p>The hon. member must not be unmannerly now simply because I did not want to allow him to ask a question. He should remember his manners. Over the same period, i.e. the 1969-&#x2019;70 to 1973-&#x2019;74 period, we also see that there was considerable growth in the tertiary sector of the homelands economies. If we exclude the Government sector, we see that the growth in the added value in the tertiary sector in the homelands increased from R60,4 million to R93,7 million. In other words, this was a growth of 55%. This is, in my honest opinion, an excellent achievement. This growth in the gross domestic product of the homelands made a very significant contribution to causing the gross national income per capita of the homeland inhabitants to rise. In general the gross national income per capita is an internationally acceptable norm for measuring prosperity. What is important, however, is what happened with this per capita income in terms of the gross national income. This rose between 1960-&#x2019;61 and 1973-&#x2019;74 from R57 per capita to R175 per capita.</p>

<p>That hon. member cannot even do simple arithmetic. This is a figure which one may truly compare with those in other states elsewhere in Africa and feel satisfied with, although it is not the final target.</p>

<p>Consequently we can say that the general level of prosperity of the homeland inhabitants already compares favourably with those of other Black peoples in Africa. For the sake of interest, I just want to furnish the corresponding per capita income figures for all Black people in South Africa itself. The corresponding figure in 1960-&#x2019;61 was R75, as against the R57 in the homelands. This rose to R144 per capita in terms of the gross national income. In 1973-&#x2019;74 it already stood at R201 per capita, which is a very favourable figure by African standards. We can argue at length about this income which is generated in the homelands by commuters, migratory workers, etc., but I shall leave it at that for the moment.</p>

<p>As far as the achievements of the corporations&#x2019; programmes are concerned, the fundamental premise of these programmes is in the first place to employment opportunities to the people within the homelands; in the second <span class="col_2167-2168" refersTo="page_1100"/>place, to create an income in the homelands for the homeland inhabitants; and in the third place, to involve as many entrepreneurs as possible in these development processes, and then to try to identify them. After they have been identified as entrepreneurs one is able to assist them with other resources, which the corporations have at their disposal, to generate growth themselves in their own homelands. In other words, the actions of these corporations are not acts of economic imperialism, but an attempt to help those people to help themselves. This is the essence of the actions of the development corporations. I repeat: It is not an act of economic imperialism, but an attempt to help people to help themselves in the interests of the whole of South Africa. We do not want part of the prosperity of those people. We want to afford them a prosperity of their own&#x2014;that is our object.</p>

<p>I just want to refer in outline to certain other aspects, which other hon. members on my side of the House will elaborate on further. One of these is the mining enterprises by the corporations in the homelands. One is grateful to be able to say that certain of our homelands already have a considerable known mineral potential which is in fact economically exploitable.</p>

<p>Everyone knows what an important part mining has played in the development of South Africa as a whole, and therefore it is obvious that mining ought to be accorded a high priority in the development of the homelands. It is a fact that the rock formations of the Bushveld igneous complex occur particularly in Bophuthatswana and Lebowa. This is the most important parent rock of minerals in South Africa and contains, <i>inter alia</i>, deposits of tin, platinum, chrome, vanadium-bearing iron ore, and magnesite. In Bophuthatswana platinum is at present the most important mineral. In Lebowa it is chrome. To indicate the potential, it is significant to note that the Lebowa homeland has virtually 50% of the known chrome reserves in the world. KwaZulu&#x2019;s potential lies in the exploitation of its coal deposits. There are numerous other known minerals, and the Bantu Mining Corporation will proceed with this development.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental aspects of development is agriculture. In respect of agriculture the BIC and the XDC are playing a very important role. They have established agricultural divisions. Since 1973 they have been actively engaged in agricultural activities. I want to single out only one aspect in regard to agriculture, and that is that the agricultural potential of the homelands in general is considerable. We usually regard a rainfall of 500 mm per annum to be the dividing line between successful and unsuccessful dry land crop production. It is interesting to see that 76% of the surface area of the homelands has a rainfall of 500 mm per annum and more, in comparison with only 35% in the Republic. The homelands therefore have a very great agricultural potential. Other hon. members will further indicate what is being done in respect of agriculture. I just want to point out that agricultural development, which has been tackled in an enthusiastic manner since 1973 by the BIC and XDC in the Republic as well as in South West Africa, is one of the most obvious priorities today, for with an additional capital investment of between R1 000 and R2 000 an employment opportunity for one person is created in the agricultural sector in the homelands. However, if one wishes to create an employment opportunity for one person in industry, the costs amount to between R5 000 and R8 000 per employee. I therefore wish to present agriculture as an example of one of the easier and cheaper methods of creating additional employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Industry is a very important aspect of the development of the homelands. One of the cornerstones of the economic development and upliftment of the inhabitants of the homelands is in fact the establishment of industries. Industries employ large numbers of people, and afford an opportunity for the acquisition of a good income and advanced skills, which are absolutely indispensable to the socioeconomic growth of our homelands. At present there are various growth-points under the control of the various corporations, for example Babelegi, Isitebe, Letaba, Seshego, Butterworth, Lebowakomo, among others. Another sphere into which the corporations venture, is that they concern themselves with the establishment of industries on an agency basis in the homelands. The practical implementation of this agency system since 1970 may be ascribed to a realization that the manufacturing industry must to an increasing extent provide the motive force for the general economic development of South Africa, and that the better utilization of the Black labour <span class="col_2169-2170" refersTo="page_1101"/>force&#x2014;which all those hon. members advocate&#x2014;forms the basis of such motive force. The establishment of industries therefore has to form an integral part of any homeland development process. In conjunction with this it was also realized that the Black peoples did not have the technical knowledge and managerial skills to activate the industrial development of their homelands themselves, and that the establishment of White industries, under certain conditions, would be an ideal seedbed for developing these attributes in the Black people. The establishment of industries in the homelands could contribute a great deal to encouraging the Black people to live and work in their own homelands and to prevent further influxes to the growth centres in White areas. Owing to its location near the Pretoria/Witwatersrand/Vereeniging complex, the establishment of industries in Bophuthatswana is already a great success, while KwaZulu has a great potential, since this homeland lies in the heart of the future industrial developments of South Africa. The other homelands are situated at some remove from the existing markets of South Africa, but in spite of that the achievements of the corporations have already indicated clearly that the potential of industrialization in these homelands as well should not be underestimated, and that it may under certain circumstances be successfully developed. In the homelands 11 556 employment opportunities have been created by agency enterprises, in enterprises which were, up to March 1974, established with the support of the BIC and the XDC. A total of 11 194, or 97%, of these employment opportunities have been filled by Black workers. During March 1975 the number of Black workers already amounted to an estimated 14 593. In September this figure was already 16 000. The capital formation for the establishment of industries in terms of the agency system already amounted to R58 million in March 1974. Of this amount private entrepreneurs had contributed approximately 50%&#x2014;which indicates that the private undertakings, the private industrialist, is prepared to participate in this development on an agency basis. The bulk of these funds found their way to Bophuthatswana and the Transkei. It is estimated that the amounts which will have been spent by the BIC by 31 March 1976 already total R42,5 million, and that spent by the industrialists, R53 million. At present 175 agency enterprises have already been established, or are in the process of being established, while a further 31 are expected to be established shortly. This indicates that there is tremendous interest in the establishment of industries on this basis.</p>

<p>Besides the establishment of industries on an agency basis, the corporations in question have already established many industries in the homelands out of their own funds. On 31 March 1975 there were approximately 3 723 Blacks working in industries established by the BIC and the XDC, in comparison with 2 411 a year earlier. Therefore there has been considerable growth. In the short period the agency system has been in operation, attempts have been made to identify the Black entrepreneur, with considerable success. As I have already indicated, the Black entrepreneur may obtain all the assistance he requires from these corporations. In the short period the agency system has been in operation the achievements of the BIC and the XDC have already indicated that the establishment of industries in the homelands still constitutes a great potential for the future, particularly in view of the marked increase in the buying power of the Black people, the labour resources of the homelands and the possibilities presented by the processing of primary products.</p>

<p>Other hon. members on this side will elaborate on aspects such as commerce and services, transportation and housing&#x2014;and will indicate what the various corporations have already achieved in this regard. Money is needed to launch comprehensive programmes such as these, and consequently the sources of funds of the corporations had to be expanded to a considerable extent. The issued share capital of the three corporations jointly rose from R21 million in 1969 to R221 379 million on 31 December 1975. This indicates that the Government is prepared to invest money in the development of industry in the homelands.</p>

<p>In conclusion there is one other thing I want to mention. The annual expenditure by the corporations increased from R21,9 million in 1973-&#x2019;74 to R109 million in 1975-&#x2019;76, i.e. an increase of 498,6% over three years. Time does not allow me to discuss the national corporations. Hon. members on my side will elaborate further on that aspect.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great interest to the hon. gentleman <span class="col_2171-2172" refersTo="page_1102"/>who has proposed this motion. He introduced his remarks with a reference to the principle of the policy of separate development. He referred to this as &#x201C;Volkerevryheid&#x201D;, and said that it meant giving to the other peoples of South Africa everything that we have ourselves. I do not propose to dwell on that point at any length. It surprises me, however, that in the year 1976 anybody can still present the policy of separate development in that form. One only has to ask two questions. Firstly: Have we a policy in terms of which other races or peoples have what we have now? Clearly, the answer is &#x201C;no&#x201D;. If one puts it in terms of prospects and one asks what the prospects are that the other &#x201C;Volke&#x201D; or peoples of South Africa will achieve what we have achieved, the answer, clearly, is &#x201C;never&#x201D;. One has only to think of the Coloured and Indian people to realize that that is the answer. I am surprised that the hon. member introduced his motion on that note.</p>

<p>The motion has two parts to it. The first is that we should express our approval of &#x201C;the generally high level of economic development&#x201D; of the homelands. I wonder which of the homelands the hon. gentleman has visited.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that has been brought about for the homelands through the actions of various corporations &#x2026;</block>

<p>The homeland I shall deal with in this regard is KwaZulu, which is the homeland of the largest population group of the Black People. The <i>de jure</i> population of KwaZulu is approximately four million. There is no economic development there that one can boast of at all, nor is the economic development to any large extent produced by the corporations. That is not to say that the corporations have done nothing. I do not propose to advance that sort of case at all. However, the economic development of KwaZulu which, I repeat, of the homelands houses the largest population of the Black peoples, has barely got off the ground, in the first instance, and, as I shall show as I go along, the contribution made by the corporations is minimal.</p>

<p>The whole business started with the report of the Tomlinson Commission. I have here only the summary of that report, but if one looks at Chapter 36, &#x201C;Possible industrial areas&#x201D;, of that summary, one will see that there are three main channels of development postulated in the Tomlinson Commission report. The first is development through Bantu entrepreneurs, the second through the proposed development corporation and the third through European entrepreneurs. The second of those channels, i.e. through the proposed development corporation, is in two parts&#x2014;I quote (summary, paragraph 21, page 142)&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Where the Development Corporation provides Bantu entrepreneurs with help and guidance; and</li>

<li>(b) Where the Development Corporation itself acts as entrepreneur.</li>

</ol>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Channels (i) and (ii) &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the Bantu entrepreneurs and the Corporation themselves&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; must be given preference in every instance and must be utilized to the greatest possible extent. The commission feels, however, that in this way alone the desired tempo of development will probably not be attained. To achieve this end, the third channel will have to be used.</block>

<p>That is to say, private White capital and initiative will have to be used. That was the recommendation of the Tomlinson Commission. I cannot remember how long ago that was, other than that it was in the &#x2019;fifties.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>My friend says &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;. He was obviously never here at the time of the late Dr. Verwoerd. At that time we sat here day after day listening to the most lengthy and involved speeches by the late Dr. Verwoerd in which he spoke of the wickedness of European colonialism if that third option were allowed. He told us&#x2014;I never understood him and I do not believe that anybody else did&#x2014;that the money would somehow percolate through to these areas through the primary, secondary and tertiary employment of Black people in the White areas and so forth. That is one of the reasons why we have this abysmally low level of development.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, what are these corporations? One of the main objects of it all is to develop an economy in the Black areas which is not an &#x201C;aanhangsel&#x201D; of the White areas. Again, what are these corporations? One has only to look at the board of directors and the executive staff of such corporations&#x2014;this information appears in all the corporations&#x2019; reports that we have&#x2014;one has only to look at the place where these corporations carry on their business and where their registered offices are, to see what their nature is. What are they then? They are large State corporations&#x2014;that is to say, they embody a sort of socialism; that is my first objection&#x2014;entirely directed by White people from the White sector to inject development into these Bantu areas.</p>

<p>What is the impact these corporations have had? The impact is that, in the first instance, they have provided some growth points but, by and large, all they have done, with one exception with which I shall deal in a moment, is to provide added avenues of employment for Bantu wage-earners in the Bantu areas. That in itself is worthwhile.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>However, that does not achieve the economic growth which we would like to see take place in the Bantu areas. If the economic growth is to be worthwhile and lasting and if it is to develop those areas, it has to take the form of the development of capital in the hands of Black entrepreneurs. Without that, it is merely a form of colonialism, albeit a very benign form. It is not a form that is to be decried as being wrong, but it is not developing the basic capital growth in the hands of Black people which, I believe, is what we would all like to see. These corporations establish some industries, they buy out and run some industries and they lend money to Black businessmen, largely in the field of retail and wholesale firms. The first two of these activities do not engender capital wealth in the hands of the Black entrepreneur. As I have said, they provide employment, but they do not engender capital and wealth in that sense. They engender and create wealth for the State because they are State corporations. In so far as the agency system is concerned, they engender wealth for the shareholders who are Whites from the White sector of South Africa or from overseas, the shareholders who put those businesses in operation.</p>

<p>Let us look at Isitebi which the hon. gentleman mentioned. I have in front of me Benbo&#x2019;s <i>Economic Review</i> in respect of KwaZulu. This is a report put out by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s commission. In the whole of KwaZulu&#x2014;I have the map in front of me&#x2014;there is one growth point. In a State with a <i>de jure</i> population of four million, there is one growth point.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member want everything in one go?</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That one growth point is Isitebi. Quite a lot of us have been there. What is Isitebi? At this point in time it is a small area of, I suppose, about 10 or 20 acres with streets and 16 factories, according to the report. They are small factories. There is no habitation, Black or White, within sight of these factories. There is no place there for the Whites to live. There is no local village or town in which they can live. The village of Mandini is a privately-owned industrial estate which houses the employees of the local paper mill. The Whites live at Eshowe or at Empangeni or in the resorts to the north of Durban. The Whites do not live at Isitebi. The Black people do not live there either. They live <span class="col_2175-2176" refersTo="page_1104"/>at the village of Sondumbili, some miles away, which was built to feed the paper mill at Mandini. So here one has in the middle of the veld and adjacent to a railway line a block of factories. Admittedly, it provides employment for quite a number&#x2014;just under 1 000 Black people, men and women. According to Benbo 1 000 people are in employment there and that in a state with a population of four million. Is this really something that we can stand up and crow about? We have here one growth point providing 1 000 jobs with no habitation anywhere near it for a population of four million.</p>

<p>There are other enterprises established in KwaZulu under the auspices of the corporations. There is a factory here and there but I do not believe that there is any development at the level that we can stand up and crow about. As I have tried to indicate, real wealth is only created by allowing for the creation of capital in the hands of individuals. I believe that the first thing that goes towards that goal, namely capital in the hands of individuals, and the ability of those individuals to save or to re-invest, has been the very basis of the economic growth of the West and of South Africa. We have got to create that situation in the homelands for the Black people. That means two things. They must be able to run their own businesses, which they are able to do at the present time, and they must be able to take a shareholding in companies. I read with regret in the reports of the corporations that the intention is, when these companies are on their feet, to hand over the control to the tribal authorities, either the territorial authorities or the regional authorities. That is again merely transferring a socialistic State-owned company in White hands to a socialistic State-owned company in Black hands. That also does not create capital in the hands of the individual. I believe that we have got to go for that shareholding to be passed from the corporation into the hands of Black shareholders, because that is a way of building up capital. The other thing is to start with a process of allowing Black people in the homelands privately to own land in freehold. I am the first to accept that with the tribal structure as I know it and many others know it, you will have great difficulty in converting in the existing tribal areas, the concept of tribally-owned land into the freehold concept, which is the basis of our economy. In all the areas which are being bought up now&#x2014;the White areas&#x2014;White farms are being bought up on a large scale and they are not traditionally tribal areas. Why in heaven&#x2019;s name do we not begin there to bring into being the concept of freehold ownership of land? It will do two things. It will provide the Black man with a hedge against inflation, which at the moment he has not got and, secondly, it will allow him to build up capital. What is the use of allowing a business-man to build up a big business and to build up cash assets if he cannot invest it in real property? Basically that is what every businessman does when he has got a bit of money in the bank. He buys a bit of land, either for residential purposes or for further investment. I believe that until we are prepared to do that in respect of the Black man, the economy of the Black areas will never get off the ground.</p>

<p>There is the question of engendering in the Black man a sense of business enterprise. I am worried that whilst there is a great deal of assistance by the corporations to Black businessmen to take over Black businesses&#x2014;that is being rushed ahead&#x2014;the engendering in him of an ability to continue to run that business profitably has fallen behind. Time and time again one sees flourishing trading stores, which one has known over the years in White ownership, taken over by a corporation; a Black owner is put in and the place collapses. The building literally is falling down before your eyes. The business that is being run in the building is a fraction of what it was before. I can give other examples.</p>

<p>I recently toured through the Transkei, in January last. At one of the towns there are two garages. One called in to fill up with petrol and to check one&#x2019;s tyres, as one normally does when one is travelling. At neither garage&#x2014;both had been taken over by individual entrepreneurs&#x2014;was there a workshop; it had closed up. At neither garage could you get any attention other than petrol. You could not even get air for your tyres. There was only one thing being done at those garages and that was for somebody to switch on the petrol pump and put the petrol into your tank. Those pumps are not even owned by the entrepreneur concerned; they are owned by the petrol company and are kept going by the petrol company. What use is it if in a large area which these small towns in the Transkei serve, the local garage cannot repair any vehicle, cannot even give you air for the tyres of your vehicle? <span class="col_2177-2178" refersTo="page_1105"/>Surely this is something to which attention should be given. This permeates through all the activities of the businesses which have been taken over under the auspices of these corporations and put out.</p>

<p>There are other matters which I should like to mention. I have here the 15th annual report of the Bantu Investment Corporation. I have already dealt with this question of it being preferable to transfer the shares to Black individuals rather than to governmental authorities when the corporations phase themselves out. It is not only in the field of businesses that one feels that there is a lack of the creation by the corporations of the right incentive in the Black businessmen whom they wish to take over these businesses.</p>

<p>Have you got some practical suggestions?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the rate of transfer must be slowed down until the corporations have got time to train adequately the people who are going to take over. This cannot be done overnight. I was going to go over to the agricultural sector, which would interest the hon. gentleman. In the report of the BIC it is stated that the Tugela Estates, the Ferry Estates, and other have been taken over. These are irrigation estates. Some of us here have been to the Tugela Estates. My friend, the hon. member for Mooi River, knows it and I have also been there. If ever there was a flourishing irrigation enterprise that when taken over by the BIC completely collapsed, this is it. Now they are trying to build it up again. However, the point that I was making was the lack of incentive engendered in the people concerned. What do they say? I quote from this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Services such ploughing and the provision of fertilizer and seed have been offered to the Zulu plot-holders in the Tugela valley, but relatively few have made use of this service.</block>

<p>People who are rural-orientated, as the hon. gentleman and I am know that this is so. Surely it is no use taking these areas out of profitable production until, you have adequately trained and built up an incentive in the people who are going to take it over? One sees this happening over and over again, if one goes through these reports and one travels around the countryside as some of us do. I think that the sugar industry can be commended in this respect. The sugar industry, a private enterprise body, has already established one, and are to establish two, training centres to teach the Black farmer how profitably to plant and grow cane. I am told that the initial one which has recently been inaugurated in the Indwe area has been a success. Although it was opened recently, it has been going for some time. Some success is being achieved there. I believe that far more emphasis should be put on training the small Black man, and when I say the small Black man I mean the entrepreneur. Whether he is a farmer, whether he has got a retail store, whether he is a cobbler, whether he is a boilermaker, whether he is a welder, there should be far more emphasis on training the man at that level where he can learn and do something constructive and build up his own wealth. Far more emphasis ought to be put at that level than has been done up to the present time. Up to the present time the emphasis has been on large, prestige concerns&#x2014;tea estates, phormium tenax and things of that kind. It means simply taking over Trust land, putting it under a White-owned, White-operated and White-administered company and farming it on the initiative and under the management of White men. The profits go back to the Bantu Trust. That has its place, but I do not believe that the emphasis should be there.</p>

<p>There is a great deal more that one could say, but unfortunately my time is limited. As a matter of fact, it has already run out. I should therefore only like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House urges the Government to hasten the economic development of the homelands by encouraging individual business enterprise and the better training of Bantu as tradesmen and entrepreneurs, and to use the Development Corporations to achieve these ends&#x201D;.</block>

The hon. member has now made it rather difficult for us because he spoke about the general economic growth in the homelands and especially referred to KwaZulu. If I confine myself to the motion, the hon. member will understand this.</p>

<p>The hon. member tried to slate corporations as being socialistic institutions. He said that capital cannot reach Black entrepreneurs because it is kept by the corporations. In recent times many important announcements have been made with respect to corporations. The hon. member himself however, said that he still objects at this stage to shares passing from the corporation to the Bantu, because these people have not yet been sufficiently trained. We have a standpoint and a system according to which we deal with these matters. We have the Bantu Investment Corporation, and it is not necessary for me to go into its history, we have the Xhosa Development Corporation, and the Bantu Mining Corporation, three development corporations which functioned on a coordinating level in the past. It was as a result of the fact that these three co-ordinating corporations succeeded in establishing certain projects within the Bantu homelands and in the process involved the Bantu in those projects and trained them, that we have now reached the stage where we can establish ethnic corporations.</p>

<p>In other words, we have the Bantu Investment Corporation and the other Corporations which, as the hon. member correctly said, mainly have Whites as directors. But under the guidance of those Whites, the so-called executives, which is necessary to accomplish all business, are trained. We can therefore proceed to the following step, and that is to establish the ethnic corporations, by which the Bantu will obtain a direct say, although the undertakings will not, as the hon. member now accused us, be handed over to these people. In these ethnic corporations half the directors will be Black and half White, as has already been indicated when the hon. the Deputy Minister introduced his Bantu legislation here, which deals with the powers of these corporations. It was indicated that we already have the situation where the authorities of the relevant Bantu homelands can submit their recommendations to the Minister to appoint certain directors in the ethnic corporations. The Minister then appoints people from that panel and also appoints the chairman of the corporation. Today we already have the situation where four fledged corporations have been established, namely the Bophuthatswana National Development Corporation, the Venda Development Corporation, the Qua Qua Development Corporation and the Shangaan/Tsonga Development Corporation, and it is hoped that the Transkei and the Ciskei will also receive their corporations on 1 April. True to the point of departure of this side of the House and the considerations for establishing corporations like the Bantu Investment Corporation and the Xhosa Development Corporation in the first place, certain powers are now being transferred from the Bantu Investment Corporation and from the Xhosa Development Corporation to these ethnic corporations. This is precisely in accordance with the National Party&#x2019;s standpoint of how a Bantu people in South Africa should be led within its homelands not only to political independence, but also to economic independence. We will now have the situation where the Bantu Investment Corporation and the Xhosa Development Corporation will transfer the following powers to these ethnic corporations: the financing of Black businessmen, the erection of business premises, the takeover of business undertakings <span class="col_2181-2182" refersTo="page_1107"/>belonging to the two corporations at present, the establishment of business undertakings on a three-fold basis and the financing of Black farmers and agricultural corporations. These will be the functions taken over by the ethnic corporations.</p>

<p>Certain functions are still being reserved for the Bantu Investment Corporation and for the Xhosa Development Corporation, to administer until the time is ripe for transfering these functions to the ethnic corporations or to an independent homeland government. These functions are: transportation, the establishment of industries according to the agency system, and major agricultural projects undertaken by the corporations. We therefore have here a very positive development of the whole system, and I am sorry that the hon, member sees these corporations as a socialist system. In South Africa our White farmers especially value the co-operative principle very highly and I have never in my life seen the co-operative principle described as a socialist principle anywhere. Anyone who sees a socialist tendency in the co-operative principle, have no idea of what co-operatives are. We now want to establish the same advantages for the Bantu in South Africa, as we did for the Whites under the co-operative principle.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana made things difficult for us but I rather want to confine myself to the motion. Gratitude is expressed in this motion for what the corporations have done. In associating myself with what the hon. member for Lydenburg said, I would just like to dwell for a moment on the agricultural projects undertaken by these corporations, and I particularly want to ask why the corporations specifically undertook those projects in agriculture.</p>

<p>For the record, we must confirm that 76% of the Bantu homeland areas have a rainfall of more than 508 mm annually, in other words, more than 20 inches of rain annually. The homelands command more than 20% of South Africa&#x2019;s agricultural potential and more than 20% of the total arable surface area of South Africa. In the homelands we also find 32% of the total cattle population, 9% of the total sheep population and 48% of the total goat population. More than 80% of the homeland populations are employed in agricultural industry in the homelands.</p>

<p>In spite of the addition of land to the homelands, it so happens that there has been no worthwhile increase in agricultural production in the homelands. There was, indeed, a period, especially during the sixties and the early &#x2019;seventies, when agricultural production in the homelands showed a downward trend. This was the result of extreme erosion in the homelands, a condition which meant that withdrawals and a redevelopment of agricultural land had to be undertaken. It is also a fact that the Bantu homelands were unable to provide in their own food requirements at that time. This was why it was necessary for the co-operative societies to intervene and establish certain agricultural projects in the homelands not only to increase production in the homelands, but also to provide Black homeland farmers with an incentive to move away from a mere subsistence economy towards a profit making economy. The Bantu Development Corporation and the Xhosa Development Corporation therefore played an important part in development within the homelands.</p>

<p>If we consider the various homeland areas, we see that Lebowa has the largest single citrus project in the world. This is an undertaking of the Bantu Investment Corporation at Zebediela. This is the largest citrus undertaking in the world. Let us not try and steal a political march on each other about this situation. It is a large project, the largest citrus project in the world and it is established in a Bantu homeland. In Lebowa we also have the Steelpoort River Development Project, an undertaking on Bantu Trust land, promoted by the Bantu Investment Corporation. Today there are already 200 ha under irrigation and a further 300 ha will be added for the cultivation of various cash crops. In Lebowa we also have the Blouberg Farms&#x2014;also an undertaking on Bantu Trust land and under the control of the Bantu Investment Corporation.</p>

<p>In Gazankulu we have the Nabeni scheme, where 160 ha are being cultivated at present. This scheme is going to be extended by a further 500 ha. An undertaking in the silk industry has also been started on the farm Belasting. Young mulberry trees were imported from France and attempts are being made to establish the trees on that farm. It is expected that there will eventually be 100 000 mulberry trees on the farm. If the proposed silk industry is carried through, it will in time be a valuable undertaking for that homeland.</p>

<p>I do not make the mistake made by the hon. speaker who preceded me, namely to speak <span class="col_2183-2184" refersTo="page_1108"/>only about the general economic development. We rather speak about the specific projects of the corporations.</p>

<p>In KwaZulu, land near Mahlabatini has been provided by the Buthelezi tribal authority for the establishment of a large tea project. People from Duma Estates are investigating the possibility of the establishment of a tea project there, on 600 ha of irrigation land. Sisal is also cultivated by an agent, to whom 600 ha have been made available for this purpose. Furthermore there is the Tugela Estates at Tugela Ferry, where mainly cotton, vegetables, wheat, sorghum, oil seeds and chilis are cultivated. There are also five sugar farms in the Eshowe district, and the South African Sugar Association lends further aid and guidance to prospective sugar farmers in the nearby trust area.</p>

<p>There is also large scale agricultural development in process in the Qua Qua area. Dairy farming has already been established in the Witzieshoek area, a district in which excellent rabbit farming has been established. In the long run the rabbit farming is aimed at providing individual rabbit farmers with breeding material. It is expected that undertakings for processing rabbit skins will soon be operating in this area on a large scale.</p>

<p>Now I would like to deal with my people, those of Bophuthatswana. When we speak of Bophuthatswana, it is certainly not inappropriate to mention that a flourishing fishing industry has been established there. There is a breeding centre at the Klippoort Dam, where 26 dams have already been completed. These dams provide a production of more than 300 tons of fresh water fish annually. I refer also to the irrigation project at Taung, which is also an undertaking of the Bantu Investment Corporation. Over 200 ha of land are irrigated there and a variety of wheat is produced. There is a fresh milk farm at Elandsfontein, and fodder kraals, also at Taung, where a cattle-fattening scheme is in operation. This is also an undertaking of the Bantu Investment Corporation. There are also two meat marketing schemes under the auspices of the Bantu Investment Corporation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I could continue in this way and mention what the position is in Kavango, in Owambo and in the Eastern Caprivi. By the end of March this year, the Bantu Investment Corporation will probably have spent an amount of R7 million, R6,5 million of which will have been spent in the Republic and R500 000 in South West Africa. This corporation will have a share in 22 different projects in South Africa, and four in South West Africa&#x2014;altogether 26 projects.</p>

<p>The Xhosa Development Corporation, on the other hand, is doing just as much in the Transkei and the Ciskei in the field of agriculture. My time has nearly expired, but I would like to furnish a few figures in order to give an indication of what is being done by this corporation. The Xhosa Development Corporation has expanded its activities considerably. While an amount of R426 000 was spent by the Xhosa Development Corporation in the Transkei and the Ciskei during the financial year 1973-&#x2019;74, an amount of R2,34 million was spent during the financial year 1974-&#x2019;75.</p>

<p>It is expected that this corporation will spend R4,79 million in the Transkei and the Ciskei in the current financial year. These are important injections on the part of this development corporation within the homelands. And now we should bear in mind that these corporations are also training Black farmers in agriculture so that these people will eventually be able to take over these ethnic corporations completely, so that these will be in the hands of Black people. Sir, this is orderly economic development. This is responsible economic development, where one develops the White know-how together with the potential of the Black man. This is an example to many other people who would like to invest in the Bantu peoples in South Africa and in Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was interesting listening to the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke, but one thing I could not quite understand was that after the hon. member for Umhlatuzana had proved beyond any doubt that there was not a generally high level of economic development in the homelands, he told us that this was in fact not part of the motion. If you look at the motion, it says &#x201C;that this House expresses its approval of the generally high level of economic development that has been brought about for the homelands through the actions of various corporations&#x2019;&#x2019;. Well, we do not accept that there is a generally high level of economic development.</p>

<p>As far as the speech of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana is concerned, I must say that I agree with all the things he said, especially in <span class="col_2185-2186" refersTo="page_1109"/>relation to the encouragement of socialism as a result of the way the economic development is being handled, and therefore this side of the House will have no problem at all in supporting his amendment. Listening to the hon. member for Lydenburg introducing his motion, I found it so unrealistic that I could not help thinking of a story which was told to me the other day. Two housewives were having tea, and the one said: &#x201C;Is it not terrible about this business in Angola? I believe the Cubans are coming down south at such a rate that they will be here by Christmas.&#x201D; And the other one said: &#x201C;Oh, I do not think that is such a bad idea, because I believe the Cubans make very good servants.&#x201D; This shows a complete inability to assess the situation in Angola, and similarly the motion we have in front of us today shows, on the part of the mover of the motion, a complete inability to understand how serious the lack of economic development in the homelands is. Mr. Speaker, I brought all these books here and when I came in hon. members remarked on it, but I brought them because I knew I would probably have to use them in order to check up on some of the statistics that were given to us by hon. members on the other side of the House. Some of the statistics that were given by the hon. member for Lydenburg were so far out that I hope other hon. members who spoke in this debate will say where they come from. He talked about the gross domestic product of the residents in the homelands having risen to R175 per capita, but in answer to a question asked in this House this year the figure was given as R66 per capita. Now we must accept that there is a great difference between R175 and R66. I think his figure of R175 probably represents the national income including such money as is earned outside the homeland.</p>

<p>But let us look at this figure that we have of R66 per capita. This is the gross domestic product per capita in the homelands. It is quite interesting to see the break-down. In the Ciskei it is R68, in the Transkei R70, in KwaZulu R50, in Bophuthatswana R118, in Lebowa R51, in Venda R39, in Gazakulu R48, in Swazi R39 and in Qua-Qua R55. This figure of R66 is the average, and is about one tenth of the gross domestic product per capita for the Republic, including the homelands, and it is about one half of the gross domestic product of the whole of Africa if you exclude the Republic. So if one assumes now that the African continent is the most economically depressed continent in the world, and that the homelands are clearly the most economically depressed areas of Africa, it seems to me absolute nonsense to bring into this House a motion which calls for approval of the &#x201C;generally high level of economic development&#x201D; that has been brought about in the homelands.</p>

<speech by="#enthoven">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member again says he does not believe that the motion talks about the generally high level of economic development. I want to ask him whether he accepts that there is not a generally high level of economic development in the homelands. [Interjections.] When we consider what we mean by a high level of economic development, we have to compare it with what we are trying to do. As the hon. member for Lydenburg quite rightly said, the economic objectives of the Government for the homelands are dictated to a great extent by political considerations. The Government have decided in their wisdom that what must happen in South Africa is that the resources of South Africa must be divided. In this division they have decided that the Black people of South Africa may have 13% of the land and 3% of the gross domestic product and that the non-Black people will have the balance. [Interjections.] These are the facts, Sir.</p>

<p>The other factor which has to be considered here is that it is the intention of the Government to stem the tide of migration from the homelands into the so-called White areas. This means that there is another objective, an economic objective, which the Government has and that is to create sufficient job opportunities in the homelands in order for this to happen. The Government have been speaking a lot recently about separate development and about the importance of the homelands not being economic so much as political. This I think has come about because they realize that there is absolutely no possibility at all of job creations in the homelands coming anywhere near to what is required. Let us make a very conservative estimate of what would be a low objective in comparison with the Government&#x2019;s aims to make its policy a success. For <span class="col_2187-2188" refersTo="page_1110"/>the homelands to cater for their own populations, for their natural increase and for at least half the natural increase of the Black people living outside the homelands, at least 65 000 jobs per annum would have to be produced between the years 1970 and 1980 in the homelands and the border areas. If one looks at the results which have been achieved by the corporations and all the other people who have been helping in this connection, one can see that in relation to what is needed, these are minimal. Figures have been given to us about the number of job opportunities that have been created. I think they were given to us by the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke and the hon. member for Lydenburg, and they do not come anywhere near this. In fact, of the 650 000 new jobs which we have to create in this decade in the Bantu areas, we will be lucky if we have achieved much over 10%. Somebody who did a bit of working out to find out what this meant for the remainder of this decade, or for the next decade if we are to catch up, worked out that over 50% of all the new industrial development which will take place in South Africa over the next ten years will have to take place either in the homelands or in the border areas if the Government is to get anywhere near reaching this particular objective.</p>

<p>The next point that has to be considered is whether in fact the homelands have the potential to create there job opportunities. If one looks at the Tomlinson Report, and if one looks at all the work that was done after that, it is quite clear that the potential is just not there. With all the best will in the world neither the corporations nor anybody else can therefore do anything about it, because there is just not the potential to create this kind of activity.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>We are, therefore, dealing with a situation in the homelands where all they can do on an agricultural basis, that is if all the prerequisites of the Tomlinson Report are met, is to provide for 300 000 families making a living from agriculture.</p>

<p>The other areas where one could have major employment are industry and mining. In mining there has been a certain amount of success. It has all been done by private enterprise, and as far as the present situation is concerned, about 44 000 jobs in mining have been created in the homelands. In industry one has an absolutely hopeless task, and that is the only other area where one can really have major employment. The background against which industry has to compete in the homelands is such that it is very difficult indeed.</p>

<p>The situation, therefore, is that the homelands have to meet certain targets set down by the Government in order to satisfy the government&#x2019;s political requirements. There are also factors involved which make it absolutely impossible for the homelands to ever meet those economic levels. Where does one go from here? With all the best will in the world, as I said previously, there is nothing the corporations can do if they do not have the ability to do it and if it is impossible to do it. In my opinion there is only one thing the Government can do. First of all, they must reassess what constitutes the homelands.</p>

<p>I accept that point, but that is not the point I am trying to make. The point I am trying to make is a very simple one, and that is that it is Government policy to stop the migration of Black people into the Republic. That is Government policy. In order <span class="col_2189-2190" refersTo="page_1111"/>to achieve the objective involved in that policy they have to create job opportunities in the homelands and in the border areas, otherwise the people will starve. As there is not sufficient potential in the homelands in order to provide the job opportunities, something has to be done, otherwise one will get migration and one will get the situation which the Government tells us is undesirable. We do not accept that it is politically undesirable, but the Government tells us it is politically undesirable.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>There is only one way out if the Government is very serious about its policy of separate development. They will have to give far more resources and land to the homelands. This is the first thing they have to do. The second thing they have to do, is redefine their objectives. There is just no possibility at all of any practical boundary, which may in the future constitute enlarged new homelands, producing jobs for all the people who live in that area and for all their natural increase as well as for the natural increase from the White areas.</p>

<p>If the Government were prepared to accept a far lesser objective, for example an objective of being able to provide for 70% of the people living in the homelands and for 70% of the natural increase, and if they were to redefine the areas of the homelands to include growth points and mineral deposits, ports and other such areas&#x2014;what obviously comes to mind is Richards Bay&#x2014;then they would at least have an objective which they could try to achieve with some chance of success. The fact that it would bring other political problems as far as the rest of South Africa is concerned in areas outside the homelands, goes without saying. However, they sit with those problems at the present moment at any rate.</p>

<p>Where you have a situation where the vast majority of the Black proletariat in South Africa have to live and be domiciled in a country where they cannot obtain any of the rights to capital in that country and where the opportunities that exist in their own homelands are so minimal that there is no incentive to them to go back there and try to be entrepreneurs, then one is building up a situation which is heading straight to the form of socialism which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana was talking about, because the people who perhaps live in an area where a certain amount of entrepreneurship can be encouraged, are not allowed to become entrepreneurs, or, if they are entitled to become entrepreneurs, they are only allowed it to a very limited extent. Yet, if they acquire a few skills and go back into the homelands, there is just not the potential there for them to become entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>If one takes the kind of life that is lived at the moment in the homelands, the whole environmental climate in which they live, one realizes that it is just not the sort of environment of which entrepreneurship is part and parcel. Entrepreneurship is a kind of acquired skill, one could say. If the Government really wants to encourage entrepreneurship in the homelands and eventually have Black entrepreneurs who are capable of playing major roles in the building up of the economy of the various homelands, one of the things that has to happen is that they will have to allow Black entrepreneurs to operate in the Republic itself. An hon. member, I think the hon. member for Lydenburg, said that all countries in the world are interdependent, and I agree with him. We have a situation here in South Africa where South Africans can invest in Bophuthatswana, Lebowa, KwaZulu and anywhere else they want to. Entrepreneurs are allowed to do that. They are allowed to invest in these countries, and they do invest there. However, the Black people of these countries, and of the other homelands, are not allowed to invest in the Republic. To me this seems to be a very one-sided kind of deal. Unless something is done about it, we are going to find that the building up of a class of Black entrepreneurs in South Africa is going to be very difficult indeed.</p>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Randburg made basically the same mistake as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, viz. he referred in general to the economic development in the homelands, whereas for us this motion concerns the economic stimulus which emanates from the corporations in the homelands. This is what it deads with. It is pointless for the hon. member to refer here to a &#x201C;lack of economic development&#x201D;, because we are not debating the question whether the economic development <span class="col_2191-2192" refersTo="page_1112"/>which exists and is taking place in the homelands is sufficient. Obviously it is not sufficient. Can anyone say today that South Africa itself has developed sufficiently in the economical sphere? Can anyone say this of a country like the USA? No, obviously not. The point at issue here is the economic development of the homelands by means of cooperative enterprises. The hon. member comes along again with the old story that we are supposedly dividing up the resources of South Africa, that we are taking a certain percentage of the land for ourselves and giving a certain percentage to the homelands, etc. That does not make sense here. The hon. member says: &#x201C;If one looks at the results of the corporations, they have achieved very little indeed.&#x201D; This is basically the mistake which hon. members on the other side of the House are making. They are saying: &#x201C;Look, here you established a growth point. There are only 1 000 plots. You have only created employment opportunities for so many people. This is only a drop in the ocean. &#x2019;&#x2019; They continue in this vein, enumerating minor things. I want to tell hon. members that basically, what is involved here is the creation of economic growth points by means of these corporations in various areas and doing things the cumulative effect of which creates an infrastructure which can make the homelands economically viable. This is what is involved. Hon. members should see this matter as a whole. After all one should first crawl before one can walk. Apparently these hon. members expect that before one can speak of homelands, and before one can say one is dealing with areas to which one wishes to grant independence, they should already be able to run and they may not crawl or walk first. It is not that simple. Lastly, the hon. member advances the old argument that the homelands have no potential in any case. I want to say to the hon. member, with all respect towards him, that he does not know what he is talking about. I do not want to deal with those aspects, but will leave it to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development. I just want to say to the hon. member that when he speaks of potential he need only consider the Transkei, which has one-fifth of the Republic&#x2019;s water resources at its disposal and has the agricultural potential to feed 15 million people. The hon. member cannot deny this because it is so. We can also say this about every other homeland.</p>

<p>At this stage I only want to try and refer briefly to three aspects in respect of which the corporations&#x2014;the XDC, the BIC and the BMC&#x2014;have made their contribution towards creating, in our homelands as a whole, economic standards of which we can really be very proud today. I should like to refer to housing, transport and mining. Housing continues to be a basic need.</p>

<p>This is so. One can create as many growth points as possible and provide as many employment opportunities as possible, but if the necessary housing does not exist, then all those efforts are of little avail. Housing is a good barometer of the general level of development in a community. The socio-economic growth of a community or nation also determines the quality, type and particular need for housing. This is very clearly illustrated in the case of developing nations. Basically, we are dealing here with homelands in which, yesterday and the day before, the traditional hut satisfied the needs according to social norms and standards. Economic progress in the homelands, and the adaptations to and civilization which this involves, disclosed a completely different need for housing. This varies from simple scheme houses, with or without amenities&#x2014;and when I say amenities, I mean amenities in accordance <span class="col_2193-2194" refersTo="page_1113"/>with our White housing standards&#x2014;to the better type of house which compares with the best obtainable in accordance with White standards. The growth and development in the homelands also proved these statements. The creation of growth points and the stimulation and promotion of development&#x2014;in whatever form&#x2014;whether in the fields of agriculture, industry, or mining, resulted in more and better housing. When I say that, I do not want to say that housing is merely a by-product of development in other fields. No. Purposeful efforts have been made to develop towns which create their own form of infrastructure in the homelands. It is a fact that the creation of settlement points, like hospitals and towns in the homelands and the development of border industries which afford new possibilities of viability, make an enormous contribution to the development of a diversified economy in the homelands.</p>

<p>Before 1960 there were only three towns in the homelands. Seventy-four towns have since been established and altogether 130 000 houses have been built. These houses are built by various bodies which are backed by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. For example, there are the South African Bantu Trust, Bantu Affairs Administration Boards, homeland governments and the department&#x2019;s own &#x201C;development works&#x201D; section. From 1961-&#x2019;62 to 1975-&#x2019;76, R354,2 million was spent on township development and housing in the homelands. Of this amount, R122,3 million went on housing alone, i.e. 35,4%. The balance covered the cost of the supply of services like sewerage, water supply, stormwater drainage, roads, etc. In other words, one third of the total cost covers the houses. The balance is for the accompanying infrastructure. Nor do the corporations play an insignificant role in this regard. Apart from indirect stimulants for the provision of housing, there is also direct provision for housing. From as far back as 1962 the BIC has been making loans available to Bantu people to build their own houses in the homelands. This scheme operates like a building society and is aimed at giving the more well-to-do Black man the opportunity to build a better type of house than a scheme house&#x2014;which may of course be either let or sold. Such houses are designed according to the choice of the person concerned, subject of course to the final approval of the corporation, and are erected by the Blacks themselves. Statistics in this regard concerning the BIC are as follows: Up to 31 March 1974, 505 loans, totalling R1 299 million, were granted in this connection, and up to 31 December 1975, 667 applications totalling R2 185 million. The XDC, too, has similar facilities. Thus, up to the end of 1975, 324 housing loans, to the value of R1 207 million, were granted in the Transkei and the Ciskei. In the Transkei there were established municipalities at Butter worth and Umtata, which lacked, however, adequate infrastructure or plots. Looking, now, at the annual report of the Xhosa Development Corporation one finds statistics relating to what has been done recently in those two municipal areas in regard to housing. Unfortunately, time does not permit me to refer to this in detail now.</p>

<p>I just want to refer specifically to the case of Butterworth. Butter worth was designated a heart-land growth point in 1966. It was a dwindling town until the planning of the Zitulele industrial area and the erection of the first houses started in 1968. With the cooperation of the city council, the department and the Transkeian Government, the Xhosa Development Corporation has made good progress since 1968. Hon. members might say this is small progress, but each item I am going to mention in its turn provided people with employment and other services, roads and transport, to mention only a few. This industrial area was developed and fully equipped with railway lines, Escom power, tarred roads and sewerage systems. A start has been made at a second industrial area at Ibebeka, too. Three new township extensions have been established, and 164 houses and 30 flats built for key White personnel. An additional 400 houses and four-storied blocks of two-bedroomed flats have been erected as housing for single Bantu workers, and 1 604 <span class="col_2195-2196" refersTo="page_1114"/>houses have been built for industrial and other workers. A start has also been made on the development of an additional housing scheme of 1 000 houses for industrial workers. A sewerage system which makes provision for the 2 000 Whites and 20 Blacks already living in Butterworth has also been constructed. This is indeed progress! Hon. members can say this is small progress, but it is indeed progress, and it is good progress. Because building construction work, together with the creation of infrastructure, is very labour-intensive and therefore resulted in the circulation of considerable amounts of cash in the homelands, the economy of the Transkei and the Ciskei was stimulated considerably as a result.</p>

<p>This now brings me to transport. The development of growth-points, the establishment of towns and the resultant introduction of a large variety of services, immediately results in the creation of a demand for roads and transport. Since its establishment the Bantu Investment Corporation has assisted small transport contractors by granting loans to establish their business undertakings, in some cases with great success. However, it was realized that as peoples&#x2019; needs for more and additional services increased, there would be a corresponding increase in the demands made on transport concerns in terms of staff, vehicles and facilities. Most borrowers were not professionally equipped to meet all these expectations. A realization of the many problems facing the homelands concerning transport and development in general, and the importance of this for success in the decentralization policy, led to the creation of a transport department in the Bantu Investment Corporation. From 1 January 1973 to 31 December 1975, a total of 53,3 million km was covered, and approximately 8,3 million passengers are conveyed every month.</p>

<p>On 31 December 1975, 901 buses were being used by this corporation. Now I want to mention another important point. The highest percentage of these passengers are workers subsidized by the State, and most of them are conveyed between the White areas and surrounding homeland areas, as in the case of the transport from Bantu towns to the border industrial areas, i.e. the so-called commuters. What this means to the homeland as an incentive in the economic field alone, is something to inspire a paean of praise. Much progress has been made with the establishment of facilities, not only for the repair of vehicles, but also for the training of the mechanics of private operators. This is another by-product resulting from one thing leading to another. Because bus services were established, there must also be repair workshops, with the accompanying training of staff and mechanics.</p>

<p>I now want to discuss mining briefly. Since its establishment in 1960 the Bantu Mining Corporation has been actively developing the mineral potential of all the homelands, in the Republic and South West Africa. This corporation concentrates its activities mainly on the achievement of the following aims: To find and exploit economically exploitable mineral deposits; to furnish Black entrepreneurs with technical advice and to provide capital; to motivate long-term enterprises to extend their search for mineral deposits to the homelands; and, lastly, to give Blacks the necessary training and to train them at the technical level in such a way as to enable them to play a bigger role in the search for and the economic exploitation of minerals. At the moment, the Bantu Mining Corporation is establishing an intensive exploration unit to prospect in the various homelands. Apart from the current, general exploration, special attention is given to the locating of various base minerals, <i>inter alia,</i> copper, nickel, vermiculite, andolocite, tin, coal, etc. This is taking place not only in the homelands, but in South West Africa as well. Apart from the abovementioned exploration programme, the Bantu Mining Corporation has already established a few indigenous industries in the homelands. On 31 March 1975 the total capital investment in the mining activities amounted to R1 684 million. The time still at my disposal does not permit me to mention the most important projects.</p>

<p>The road to complete independence for the homelands is not a political one only. The hon. <span class="col_2197-2198" refersTo="page_1115"/>member for Lydenburg referred to this aspect. It is not only political institution that are needed for this. Economic viability goes hand in hand with this, not to the extent of perfection, sufficiency or self-sufficiency&#x2014;because which country measures up to that requirement?&#x2014;to the extent that a socioeconomic structure is established which seeks to guarantee a living to every man. Our homelands, thanks to the corporations which I mentioned, have already progressed a long way along this road.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by quoting from the report <i>Ten Years of Progress,</i> a report by the Xhosa Development Corporation. A Special message from the chief minister of the Transkei, Dr. Matanzima, appears in that report. I gladly support what he states in his message. I think this applies to all the homelands and not only to the Transkei. He states (page 7)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ever since the independence process was set in motion in the Transkei, little over a decade ago, the economic development of my country has been a matter of the utmost importance and concern to me &#x2026; Today, ten years later, largely through the initiative of the Xhosa Development Corporation, the Transkei&#x2019;s commercial and industrial growth is assured and my visions of economic viability for my country can no longer be regarded merely as a pipe-dream.</block>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Randburg is listening. I shall only quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Xhosa Development Corporation&#x2019;s sterling efforts at stimulating the Transkei&#x2019;s socio-economic progress deserve high praise indeed. The decision dedication, conviction and thoroughness with which the Corporation and its personnel approach and execute their appointed task in the Transkei, have over the years been an inspiration to me.</block>

<p>I gladly support this.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have been listening with particular interest to the hon. member for Koedoespoort, and later I shall come back to what he said. May I say to start with that it is difficult for me to understand the objection raised here by that hon. member and the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke to the amendment of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. They intimated that that amendment was not in order. I do not want to waste my time on that, but I do want to mention four reasons why, in my opinion, the amendment is in order. In the first place, &#x201C;the generally high level of economic development&#x201D; is referred to in the original motion. If hon. members wanted us to speak about the corporations only and not about &#x201C;the generally high level of economic development&#x201D;, it would have been better if the original motion had read that this House &#x201C;takes cognizance&#x201D; of the actions of the corporations. As soon as the actions of the corporations are linked to &#x201C;the generally high level of economic development&#x201D;, it is perfectly correct to speak about the standard of the development achieved through the corporations. In the second place it is said that the corporations are responsible for the development. Therefore it is completely within the scope of the subject to say that the corporations have not done enough in this regard. In the third place, all three hon. members on the opposite side have had a great deal more to say than just concerning the actions of the corporations. I need not go into this now. In the fourth place I just want to say that, if the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke will look at the amendment of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, he will see that it makes specific reference to the corporations and the tasks which they have.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself at once with the amendment of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and his motivation of it. I agree whole-heartedly with him. Obviously I also agree with a great deal of what was said by the hon. member for Randburg. [Interjections.] Let me say at once that it is very clear that in this regard dealing with a matter in connection <span class="col_2199-2200" refersTo="page_1116"/>with which probably all members of this House and all responsible South Africans will say, &#x201C;There are no differences in principle about the necessity of developing the Bantu homelands.&#x201D; I do not believe that this is at issue. Therefore I do not believe that we need trouble ourselves about it. There is great appreciation by all, including the hon. members on this side of the House, for the level of development which has been achieved and for the things which have already been done in the homelands. Everything which is being done to raise the standard of living of our people in the Bantu homelands and to create a situation where people do not have to leave the homelands to seek work elsewhere, will be welcomed without reservation by every right-minded person.</p>

<p>In this connection the argument is often advanced&#x2014;the hon. member for Lydenburg did it this afternoon and earlier, I think last week, the hon. member for Port Natal advanced it too&#x2014;that a comparison is possible between the per capita income of the Bantu of the homelands and that of the peoples of the Third World. I want to point out that that kind of comparison simply does not hold true.</p>

<p>It does not hold true for the simple reason that the Bantu of the homelands are involved in our economy. In other words, they do not stand separate from our economy, while the countries of the Third World do each have an economy of its own, separate from others.</p>

<p>Even the increase in the per capita income of the Bantu in the homelands, contributes to the general economic well-being of the whole country. Simply to ignore that situation and to draw a comparison between them and a country which has nothing to do with our economy and of which the people do not make a contribution to the proper development of that economy either, obviously does not hold true. Nor can a comparison be drawn in terms of the contribution which we make to the Bantu homelands and the contribution which developed Western countries make to the development of developing countries in the Third World. Any ability which we have to render assistance to the homelands and to the Bantu there, is directly related to the extent to which those Bantu help us to create those riches which make it possible for us to render that assistance. It is as simple as that.</p>

<p>I do not want to split hairs about this matter. I merely wanted to make a correction, because this kind of comparison is wrong.</p>

<p>Last year, with the discussion of the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill, which later became Act No. 9, we approved a new basis for financing in this regard. The attitude which we adopted in connection with this matter, that is to welcome it, surely is an indication of the fact that we are naturally very sympathetic towards the economic development of the Bantu homelands. In this connection, I want to refer with appreciation to the speech which the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke made at the beginning of this month when he spoke about the work of the national corporations and also of the Bantu Investment Corporation.</p>

<p>Economic independence is not a prerequisite for political development or independence. We all know this.

<p>We must naturally try to counteract unemployment in the homelands. Unemployment, as we know, is always one of the main causes of political unrest. A high level of economic development will also prevent those countries from possibly being forced to turn to other countries, possibly hostile towards us, to aid them in the economic sphere. We are indeed aware of these factors. Therefore we welcome any form of economic development in the Bantu homelands. But the actual issue is, that we are convinced that such development is not taking place at this stage at a rate which enables us to sit back and say, &#x201C;Thank you, Master, everything is going very well there. &#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>I want to say at once&#x2014;and the hon. member for Umhlatuzana referred to this&#x2014;that if we had accepted and implemented the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission 20 years ago, we would have been immeasurably further than we are as far as the economic development of the Bantu homelands is concerned. Allow me to explain this, Sir. It was my privilege to be a member of the technical staff of the Tomlinson Commission, and the report of that commission had a comprehensive development programme for the Bantu homelands. It covered all possible aspects. In fact, it was a commission on the socio-economic development of the Bantu homelands. Therefore, it went much further than merely the question of corporations. Indeed, it covered all fields, the Church, social services, education, economic development and administration. In respect of these things the commission gave us a blue print of what could be done as far as the development of the Bantu homelands was concerned. All we have had up to now, have merely been with due respect for what has been achieved in recent times, facets or fragments of that total plan of development which was outlined and suggested by the Tomlinson Commission. Sir, in the report you will find a whole argument concerning the recommendation of the commission that the emphasis should fall not on development in the border areas, but within the homelands themselves. I think it is well known that the Government of that time did not accept that recommendation, and thought that it could achieve better results by causing the emphasis to fall on the development of the border areas. If time permits, I shall come back to this, but I refer hon. members to paragraphs 13 to 16 on page 142 of the published report on the Tomlinson Commission.</p>

<p>In the third place, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana indicated, the commission realized, and put it very clearly, that the desired scope and rate of development could only be achieved if we made use of private White capital and initiative. Hon. members will also find a minority report published on page 144. That minority report was signed by two members of the commission, the late Mr. Young and Mr. Prinsloo, and in that report they dissociated themselves from these recommendations. Perhaps hon. members know that after the commission had completed its activities and had submitted its report, these two persons, who were officials of the department, requested that the commission be summoned to meet again so as to enable them to submit their minority report. Also as far as this point is concerned, there would otherwise have been a unanimous recommendation by the commission that private White capital and initiative be used to achieve that development. As far as this point is concerned, even up to this day, the Government has not taken adequate measures to ensure this. The agency basis is not the type of involvement of private <span class="col_2203-2204" refersTo="page_1118"/>assistance envisaged by the Tomlinson Commission.</p>

<p>The Tomlinson Commission also made recommendations in connection with comprehensive development machinery. The main body in this regard was a development council, which would undertake the complete development and planning of that development. That development council was never established. It does not yet exist today. I am convinced of the fact that the same need exists today for the creation of such a development and planning council as existed when the commission made its recommendation. The commission was of the opinion that the Department of Bantu Administration and its other auxiliary bodies were simply not able to do that work effectively. That motivation is in my opinion just as valid today as it was then. I think it is a major shortcoming that this recommendation was not implemented, because if this had been done, we should have had properly balanced and comprehensive development in all spheres in the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>However, what do we find? The Tomlinson Commission also recommended a development council, a development corporation. This appears on page 189 and 190 of the report. The latest proposals by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x2014;that private initiative be integrated with the umbrella body&#x2014;do constitute a small step in that direction, but do not in any way meet the requirements of the type of body envisaged by the commission. What did we get as far as a development corporation was concerned? We got the Bantu Investment Corporation. Investment was merely one small subdivision of the functions envisaged by Tomlinson Commission for the development corporation, whereas for many years investing was the only thing the Bantu Investment Corporation was authorized to do. It was only in 1968-&#x2019;69 that the Bantu Investment Corporation obtained the right to start undertakings itself, something for which we are grateful. Fourteen or fifteen years had elapsed, however, in which nothing had been done by the State concerning secondary industrial development in the Bantu homelands, because of the fact that the Bantu Investment Corporation was not the type of institution which the Tomlinson Commission had in mind. Indeed, as is often the case, we must now do things which should have been done 20 years ago, and this holds true not only in this field. As far as financing is concerned, I do not have to go into the matter. Hon. members need only look at the recommendations requesting the establishment of a Bantu commercial bank, of a savings bank and a loan bank, of a Bantu insurance company, of a Bantu building society and of all institutions of this kind, most of which have not yet been implemented.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Koedoespoort and other members that we are faced with major problems in the agricultural field. It is also true that the agricultural potential of the Bantu homelands, if it were to be developed as it should, is high and that production at the moment is not nearly what it ought to be. This we do realize, but I want to say once again that if we were to have adopted the approach of the Tomlinson Commission, we would have been further. I would readily concede, however, that wherever we have to deal with underdeveloped peoples, we experience an immense degree of psychological resistance against development in that field, because, as you know, it is connected with their whole way of life and built into their culture. I do want to say, however, that I believe that we could have advanced further in that field than we have, in fact, done. Let us be honest with ourselves.</p>

<p>If we go to the Bantu homelands we cannot get away from the impression of poverty. It is obvious and clear to anyone who goes there. This is aggravated by the fact that we have sent people away from the so-called White area to the Bantu homelands on a fairly large scale and by the ban which we have placed on families who want to move to the White urban areas. The fact that we have thousands of Bantu who are illegally in those areas, the so-called White areas, is an indication that things are not going well in the Bantu homelands. We also know that because of the population increase the demands on the soil will increase in any event.</p>

<p><span class="col_2205-2206" refersTo="page_1119"/>I just want to mention a few facts with reference to what has already been said. It has already been said that employment in the Bantu homelands amounts to only a few thousand annually as against the target of 60 000/65 000. The number of Bantu who are employed in factories in the homelands, is minimal&#x2014;only 24 000. Only approximately 12% of the Bantu who are employed, work in the border areas and in the homelands.</p>

<p>I should have liked to indicate that considerable progress should still be made and that we cannot sit back in a self-satisfied way and think that we have achieved what we could achieve, but my time has expired.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I reply to what the hon. speakers have said, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity&#x2014;since this is my first opportunity now to be able to speak on the matter which has been entrusted to me&#x2014;to tell you and this hon. House that I have never before been so inspired by a task entrusted to me than I am by this one, in spite of the prophecies of doom which we have had to listen to today from that side of the House. Secondly, I want to tell you that, the more I have to do with these matters, the more convinced I become that the future, the economic future of the homelands is a tremendous and a bright future. Naturally I say the same of the economic future of South Africa. I am becoming more deeply convinced of this every day.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Edenvale is concerned, it is a pity that the hon. member has not yet assimilated the fact that the Government has not implemented the report of the Tomlinson Commission as he would have liked it to have done, but as the Government saw fit to do, and consequently that results have not been lacking. It is a pity that the hon. member has not yet digested that fact. In the second place, it is also a pity that the hon. member should have said at the outset of his speech that we should not compare the growth and development of the homelands with that of the Third World. The hon. member does not want to allow what is happening in practice to prove that the judgment of the Government was correct. For that reason he tries to avoid putting it to the test. I shall have more to say about this later.</p>

<p>With regard to what the other hon. members said, I should like to point out a few fundamental facts. In the first place we must bear in mind that the development in the homelands has only been in progress for approximately two decades&#x2014;for only approximately 20 years. After all, we know that during its r&#x00E9;gime the United Party did absolutely nothing in the homelands.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Even at that stage a great deal was done by us in the homelands. We must not make the mistake of comparing the development in the homelands with developed Western countries, which have been developing for centuries. We should rather compare the homelands today with the homelands 20 years ago; we should consider the progress each of the homelands has made during the past 20 years, and we should take note of factors such as progress and the growth rate. For the rest, we could compare the homelands with comparable States, i.e. with other African states.</p>

<p>In the second place, I want to refer to the impression which one gained of this debate today. Hon. members on this side of the House had obviously made a study of their subject. They stated facts. Of the hon. members on the opposite side I can only say that, while I was listening to them, I wondered whether they were living in South Africa. Do you realize that foreigners have greater confidence in the future of the homelands than those hon. <span class="col_2207-2208" refersTo="page_1120"/>members, they who are part of South Africa? One really got the impression that those hon. members were totally uninformed. And truly, Sir, the reason why they adopted such a standpoint was because they are uninformed of what is happening.</p>

<p>I want to state a third point, and that is the economic growth rate of the homelands. This is not so terribly low if one compares it with the rest of Africa. On the contrary. Most of our homeland economies are greater in extent than those of other African countries.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and I am going to give you the facts. In Africa there is nothing that compares with the rate of development and the economic growth rate of the homelands. There is also a fourth misconception which I want to eliminate.</p>

<p>Hon. members discussed what the corporations are doing and also the general development. They tried to create the impression that it is only the corporations which are responsible for the economic development and growth in the homelands. Apart from the three corporations we know about and the national corporations which are still going to be established, there are at least eight other groups, bodies or State undertakings which, in an executive capacity, are actively engaged in development operations in the homelands. In the first place they are the homeland governments themselves&#x2014;by far the most important bodies as far as development in the homelands is concerned. Then, too, there are the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, the Department of Bantu Education, the Department of Health&#x2014;which acts as an agent of the Bantu Trust&#x2014;the Bantu Trust itself and the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards which in some cases act as the agent of the S.A. Bantu Trust in regard to township development. Then there are other departments as well, for example the Department of Forestry, and public corporations such as Escom, the Post Office and the Railways. Then, too, there is another very important sector which we should not forget, i.e. the private sector within the homelands and the private White sector in South Africa which is active in the homelands.</p>

<p>Allow me to put the matter into perspective. The contribution to the development of the homelands which is being made by the corporations which specifically fall under this ministry comprises only 15% of the total funds which are being made available in this year&#x2019;s estimates by this ministry. The contribution by the homeland governments is 57&#x00BD;% and in addition to this there are all the others.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that we should look at the results if we want to see what progress we have made. That is the only criterion to see whether progress has been made.</p>

<p>It is no use simply saying that we have tackled so many hundreds of projects, or that we have not done this, that or the other. The true criterion is to test and compare comparable things in order to determine whether success has been achieved. The hon. member said that we could not compare the gross national income of a homeland with those of other African countries. Let us then disregard the gross national income and let us consider the gross domestic product. The hon. member is making a big mistake when he says that all the people in the homelands are involved in our, i.e. the White, economy. That is not true.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, you said all. The hon. member should look it up in Hansard. I therefore take it that the hon. member did not mean it in this way and for that reason I shall not go into this matter any further. Be that as it may, the growth rate of the gross domestic product, i.e. what is produced by the homeland itself through its agriculture, its industries, its services, etc., for the years 1960-&#x2019;61 to 1964-&#x2019;65 was only <span class="col_2209-2210" refersTo="page_1121"/>2,2%. In the years 1964-&#x2019;65 to 1968-&#x2019;69 the growth rate rose to 6,3%, and in the years 1969-&#x2019;70 to 1973-&#x2019;74 to 16%.</p>

<p>I want to refer hon. members here to the reports published from time to time by organizations of the UNO. I am thinking of organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, the Economic Commission for Africa, the Industrial Development Organization of Africa, as well as other reports which establishes targets in respect of Africa. The United Nations Development Organization propagates a growth rate of 7%, and states it as a target for African countries in the second half of this decade. They will be highly satisfied if this could be reached, while our homelands are at this stage already maintaining a growth of 16%. We must test ourselves against comparable things. I want to return to the gross national income, in spite of the fact that the hon. member does not want to use it as a criterion. I am going to use it to reply to the hon. member for Randburg. He said that the Black people of South Africa are the poorest in the world. This is a completely erroneous statement.</p>

<p>Sir, I am not prepared to allow the hon. member to ask any further questions. I shall tell the hon. member what it has to do with the economy of the homelands. Those people spend their money in the homeland, and the effect of this is that while there were 3 900 Black traders in the homelands in 1961, there are 9 000 today. If that money is not being spent there, what are those traders doing there? With that I want to reject the statement of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana&#x2014;that this is a socialistic system&#x2014;with the greatest emphasis. The hon. member based his statement on the fact that it is a State corporation and that it is going to be <span class="col_2211-2212" refersTo="page_1122"/>handed over to the homeland governments. From that the hon. member deduced that there is no private ownership. Surely that is not the case. A total of 2 400 of those 9 000 traders received a loan from the Bantu Investment Corporation. These were only loans, and there is nothing preventing them from owing land. Only a White person may not own land there.</p>

<p>In other cases the corporation establishes another company in which it owns a few shares. Surely this is not a socialistic system, for the entire system is aimed at developing and encouraging private ownership and private initiative. What is more: When the corporation lends these people funds and when it plays a part in industries, the technical officers of the corporation go to these enterprises and give them advice. The result of this is that the total amount of bad debt written off by all these co-operations in all these years amounted to less than R300 000. This demonstrates to us that success has been achieved. The gross national income of the homelands is R175 per capita. In Malawi is R78, in Lesotho, R70; in Somalia, R60; and in Tanzania, R94. The hon. member said KwaZulu meant nothing, but I want to tell him that KwaZulu&#x2019;s gross national income is already R489 million. This is more than that of Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho, whose gross national incomes are respectively R117 million, R94 million and R62 million.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, let me tell the hon. member a thing or two. This means a real growth of 5,8% for the individual. And during that same period from 1960 to 1970 the populations of the homelands increased by 7% per annum, owing to our policy of return to the homelands. Hon. members cannot show me a country in the world in which the population has grown by 7% per annum. Nor can hon. members show me a country in which the personal income of the individual has grown at a rate of 5,8% per annum.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the homelands governments have confidence in the future of their homelands and in the future of their economies. Last year some of the homeland government leaders went abroad to address industrialists and manufacturers and to explain what their policy was so as to create confidence and a healthy economic climate and in that way encourage industrialists. Then this hon. member came here and said it was socialist system. Surely that is not true.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In my speech which I made when we dealt with the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill a few weeks ago, I gave hon. members the assurance that, as far as the present financial year was concerned, any supplementation of the amounts voted for the Votes would be requested only in urgent and essential cases. In the Additional Appropriation Bill which is now before this House, Parliament is being requested to make a total additional amount of R246,5 million available to departments for the 1975-&#x2019;76 financial year. I want to add at once that this does not mean that State spending in terms of the Main Budget for 1975-&#x2019;76 will increase by this amount. To this extent there is in fact greater parliamentary authorization to spend, but as against the additional amount we definitely expect departments to refund approximately R100 million in all. Under the provisions of the Appropriation Act I am of course not empowered to transfer savings under one Vote to another Vote. The total actual spending for 1975-&#x2019;76, as estimated in the Main Budget, should not exceed more than a net amount of R150 million.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that, having regard to the general rise in costs since the original estimates for 1975-&#x2019;76 were finalized approximately 15 to 18 months ago, as well as to circumstances which have arisen since then and which could not have been foreseen at the time, the amount which is being requested is not an unreasonable one. In fact, we have reason to be grateful that, with the cooperation of my colleagues and their senior officials, it was possible to keep the additional demand within limits in this way.</p>

<p>I can give hon. members the assurance that this was not easily accomplished. There are few, if any, commentators who a few months ago had much hope that we would be able to succeed in curtailing State spending to this extent and keep in such measure to the undertakings given by the Government in the anti-inflation manifesto. The total or gross additional demand represents an increase of approximately 3,5% on the Main Budget. The net additional State expenditure, however, is expected to be only 2,1% greater than the initial estimate. This figure testifies to a financial discipline of which we may be proud, particularly at the present juncture.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, the specific increases under the various Votes will, as is usual, be motivated and explained by the hon. Ministers concerned. The main increases are as follows: Defence requires an additional R31,5 million on the Revenue Vote and R1,5 million on the Loan Vote. I doubt whether hon. members will begrudge them this in the circumstances prevailing. Loan Vote N, Bantu Administration and Development, shows an increased grant-in-aid of R30,4 million to the Bantu Trust Fund in respect of the purchase of land for the consolidation of the Bantu Homelands. A further amount of R5,5 million is requested on the department&#x2019;s Revenue Vote to finance preparations for the independence of the Transkei. An amount of R18,3 million is requested on Revenue Vote 22, Mines, as follows: R13,7 million to assist needy gold mines in terms of the Gold Mines Assistance Act, 1968, and R4,5 million to finance the oil exploration activities of the Southern Oil Exploration Corporation (Soekor). Provision is made for additional subsidies, amounting to R16,6 million, to the provincial administrations. I may mention that, as part of their contribution to curtain Government spending, the Administrators agreed to accept substantially lesser amounts than would normally have been due to them in terms of the subsidy formula.</p>

<p>The Department of Transport requires an additional R16,8 million on Revenue Vote. This amount includes R9 million in respect of the subsidization of non-White bus and train services and R3,7 million in respect of the construction of national roads in and around the Transkei. On Loan Vote a further amount of R5 million has been provided to finance urgently required extensions to the Upington airport. An additional R13 million is required <span class="col_2215-2216" refersTo="page_1124"/>under the Agricultural Economics and Marketing Vote in respect of subsidies on maize (R8,4 million) and grain sorghum (R0,5 million) as well as to the fresh fruit industry (R2 million) and the wool industry (R2 million). The Government&#x2019;s commitments in respect of contributions to pension and provident funds are now estimated to exceed the existing provision by approximately R12,8 million and this additional amount has been included on the Social Welfare and Pensions Vote. Increases have also been included on the following Revenue Votes: Interior, in respect of the repatriation of Portuguese refugees (R3,2 million); Public Works (R7 million); Community Development (R8,5 million); Health (R6,5 million); Industries (R4,8 million); Police (R3,0 million) and Prisons R2,6 million). On Loan Account further additional amounts are also required in respect of the purchase of land by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure (R2,8 million); to finance water schemes (R6,3 million); to finance the Industrial Development Corporation&#x2019;s activities in promoting the development of border areas (R7 million); for the erection of official quarters, mainly for the Department of Defence (R5,5 million); to supplement the share capital of the Uranium Enrichment Corporation (R5 million); and to complete the Richards Bay coal terminal installations timeously (R8 million).</p>

<p>The main increase on the South West Africa Account concerns an amount of R3,163 million in respect of Government water supply schemes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, basically this Bill is debated in the Committee Stage and I shall therefore not take up the House&#x2019;s time with further detailed explanations now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House will not oppose this measure. However, we have come to that decision with certain serious reservations and with certain misgivings. The first reason why we have decided to support the Bill is because it makes provision for an additional sum of R17 million in respect of salaries, etc., for the Defence Force. We had had enough trouble in recent weeks in regard to delays in payment to members of the Defence Force. [Interjections.] Only this past weekend I received complaints from wives in regard to delays in receiving their husbands&#x2019; pay. For that reason we on this side of the House are going to put no impediment in the way of providing the necessary funds so that members of the Defence Force can be paid timeously and in full.</p>

<p>The second reason why we are not opposing this Bill is because it provides for a sum of nearly R13 million for additional contributions to pension funds and provident funds which we have no doubt are necessary in the light of the present inflationary situation. Having said that, I would also like to remind the House that we on this side of the House have already made several speeches this session emphasizing the need for a curtailment in Government expenditure. There is not going to be a hope of fighting inflation successfully unless the Government makes real efforts to curtail its own expenditure.</p>

<p>I believe the hon. the Minister of Finance and the Government generally realize that. At least they have given verbal utterances and public support to the collective programme to fight inflation, an important leg of which is the curtailment of Government expenditure. I would also like to remind the House that the collective programme to fight inflation was first announced in the first half of last year, nearly a year ago. The Pretoria Manifesto which put it into operation was signed as long ago as October 1975. I consider that there has been plenty of time in which to put the programme into effect and to show some results from it. It is, after all, only results in which we are interested.</p>

<p>In this Bill we have the first measure by which we can judge whether the Government is putting words into deeds, because this is the first occasion on which the Government has come to the House to approve expenditure in respect of the current financial year since the programme was announced. What do we find? We find that out of 45 Government departments, 36 departments, in other words, 80% of the Government departments, are spending more than they budgeted for on Revenue Account this year, so that where the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s saving of R100 million is to come from, is a bit obscure. He referred to savings of R100 million. It will have to come either out of the remaining nine departments which are not spending more than their budgets, or out of Capital Account.</p>

<p>If we go back three years to see what the trend in additional expenditure over and above <span class="col_2217-2218" refersTo="page_1125"/>the original budget has been, we find that this is a rising trend, both in absolute amounts and relatively, as a percentage of the original budget. If we look at the Revenue Account two years ago, i.e. in 1973-&#x2019;74, we find that additional expenditure amounted to R86 million. This represented 2,5% of the original budget. Last year it amounted to R90 million, which represented 2% of the original budget. This year, 1975-&#x2019;76, the year of the great economy drive, the year in which the Government committed itself to effect economies, we find that additional estimates, as presented to us, represent in total on Revenue Account R162 million, which is 3,3% of the original budget, nearly double what they were last year. I do not think that we must be misled. There may be a general impression that this additional expenditure on Revenue Account is caused primarily by defence expenditure. It is not. The percentage increase over the original budget by departments other than Defence, is about the same as it is for Defence.</p>

<p>The same picture emerges also on Capital Account. If we go back two years to 1973-&#x2019;74, the additional estimate was for R31 million, which represented 3,2% of the original budget. Last year it was R49 million, representing 4%, and this year it is R78 million, representing 4,9%, which is a rising trend all the time. If we look at the figures for the South West African budget, they represent a smaller, but even more acute rise. These additional estimates do not reflect to any great extent the additional cost to the country as a result of the devaluation of the rand. I have examined all the items in the additional expenditure on Revenue Account which total more than R1 million. These items total R145 million out of a total of R162 million in all. Of that R145 million I would say that R125 million is for items like additional pay for the Defence Force and additional contributions to pension funds, which are not directly affected by devaluation. I would like to point out also that in these additional estimates of expenditure no provision is made for the additional cost of servicing and of repaying foreign loans, which additional cost results from the devaluation of the rand. We know, from a reply to a question in this House, that the additional annual bill, as a result of devaluation, for servicing foreign loans, amounts to R48 million per annum. There is no provision at all for any part of that expense in these additional estimates. I find it rather surprising that it has been unnecessary to so provide in the light of the fact that by the end of the current financial year it will have been more than six months since the devaluation of the rand. I would like the hon. the Minister to comment on that in his reply to the Second Reading. Presumably, as there has been no provision, this is a substantial additional cost still in store for us.</p>

<p>Despite the savings which the hon. the Minister states he will make before the end of the current financial year, I do not get any impression from this Bill or the items contained in it that the Government really means business when it comes to playing its part in the collective programme to fight inflation. This Bill certainly does not add to my confidence in its ability to do so. As I have said, for the reasons I have given, we shall not oppose this Bill at Second Reading, but when it comes to the Committee Stage we will examine a number of items in detail.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one must obviously, in a budget the size of the Republic&#x2019;s present budget, anticipate that there must be additional expenditure which cannot be foreseen or that there must be increased expenditure in respect of items which one hoped would have cost a little less. There are, quite obviously in these particular estimates, clear examples of expenditure that could not have been anticipated. It is also fairly clear that the hon. the Minister certainly did not anticipate that he would have to devalue and have the consequences of that devaluation, because if he did anticipate that, we would have even more serious complaints to lay at his door. Similarly, one could of course not anticipate that we would have to incur the defence expenditure which was incurred as a result of the events concerning Angola. There are therefore many items in these additional estimates about which there can be no criticism and should be no complaint.</p>

<p>The important factor that we need to look at in regard to these estimates is that the Government has now for some considerable period of time appealed to people to make sacrifices in respect of the fight against inflation. What is important is that the people of South Africa expect the Government to do the same. It is not enough if the Government merely appeals to other people to make <span class="col_2219-2220" refersTo="page_1126"/>sacrifices; the Government too must show the way in regard to this matter. The matter on which the hon. the Minister has so far not convinced me in respect of many of the items is that there is not enough of an indication to the public that this is a joint effort and that there is in fact as much sacrifice on the part of the Government as there is on the part of the ordinary individual, the working man in South Africa. That is something which is important for the hon. the Minister to do if he is going to show that this is a fight in which everyone is involved.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I think is important, and I think it is important that it is raised at this stage. That is that the most important factor in so far as the economy of South Africa is concerned at the moment, is the need to ensure that there is confidence in the future of South Africa, the need to ensure that confidence on the part of the people in South Africa and on the part of the people outside South Africa who are expected to invest here and are expected to lend money to South Africa. This to me is the most important factor, and I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister today to go out of his way to bring about this state of affairs, not by means of shallow statements which any businessman can see through, but by means of conveying to the public in real terms what the problem is, that the problem can be overcome as far as our economy is concerned, and that there is no need for anyone to lack confidence in the economic future of this country. That to me is the most urgent thing of all that is required. When we look to the fact that we have to finance our expenditure, when we look to the fact that we need foreign loans, when we look to our balance of payments, it is clear that confidence is the most important factor of all. If the hon. the Minister does not do everything in his power to ensure that there is this feeling of confidence in the future of South Africa, then he is not doing his job. That to me is the most important factor in regard to these particular estimates. I can ask specifically of the hon. the Minister, because he has not said so, how he proposes to finance this increased expenditure. One of the matters that is important is that we need to know that the expenditure which is necessary is also being financed in the least inflationary manner possible. We have heard nothing in regard to this matter and we have heard nothing, for example, about the extra R150 million which is going to be required on balance, as he has indicated, and how this is going to be financed.</p>

<p>I would also like to know from the hon. the Minister whether in fact any portion of this is going to be financed by means of loans to be raised overseas. If any portion of it is to be financed in this manner, are we still in the short-term league, or are we able to get longer term money? Sir, I believe this is something we also need to know.</p>

<p>I would like to draw attention to what, I believe, are three characteristics of these additional estimates which should be a warning to South Africa. In the first place there is the obvious increase in defence expenditure, and I believe it is clear that there is no opposition from these benches in respect of that expenditure. What is important, is that we have to bear in mind that we are going to have to spend more and more money on defence in the future. We are entering a different situation in Southern Africa, in which we shall have to reconcile ourselves with this kind of situation. I believe this is a lesson which we in South Africa cannot afford to ignore. There is one other factor to which I would specifically like to direct the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. That is that it seems as if we may be entering a different type of war situation in southern Africa, and there are many South Africans&#x2014;not only the young people in our forces, but also perhaps their parents and others&#x2014;who know that a different type of war has come about and they want an assurance that we shall be adequately equipped to deal with this type of war that is lying ahead of us.</p>

<p>I do not ever want to hear, in the years that lie ahead, that the hon. the Minister of Defence gets up in this House&#x2014;at an ay stage in the future&#x2014;and says that our soldiers are not adequately equipped to deal with a new type of war that may be upon us.</p>

<p>The second point to which I want to draw attention, is in connection with the increased subsidies which the hon. the Minister has dealt with, subsidies that are necessary for non-White bus services by reason of changed circumstances. This is perhaps the most sensitive area and we must realize that, in a time where there are these inflationary pressures, in so far as our economy is concerned inflation is a political issue, a race relation issue, with which we have to deal in order to ensure that there is racial harmony in South <span class="col_2221-2222" refersTo="page_1127"/>Africa. I particularly want to refer to non-White bus services, because we have again in recent time learnt about at least one bus company on the Witwatersrand which proposes to increase its fares. I want to say here and now that we very often find that a slight spark can set off something which can have far more serious consequences and I do not believe that we can afford that spark being set off by reason of a subsidy in respect of bus services that is perhaps not given, or perhaps by a desire to make profits which, at this stage, may not be warranted. We have to realize that in this age in which we live, we cannot afford to take chances, and that economic circumstances can set off situations in South Africa which may well have consequences far beyond the immediate problem that may exist.</p>

<p>Sir, the third point that arises from these additional estimates, is that we have to vote more money for the agricultural Vote, and here we have attention drawn to the fact that food prices are perhaps the most important thing to keep an eye on. In our country we have to bear in mind that in the lower income groups we need either to see to it that living costs, and more particularly the prices of food, are kept down, or, alternatively, that wages in real terms keep pace with the necessities of the lower income groups.</p>

<p>It is for these reasons that I believe that there are very real warnings for South Africa contained in these additional estimates. They are lessons which we cannot afford to ignore, because I believe that South Africa is entering a different era where perhaps we will have to be very much more careful in respect of many things which on the face of it appear to be merely purely economic, but which may have far wider consequences for South Africa as a whole. Sir, we on these benches will not vote against the Second Reading of this Bill but as far as individual items are concerned, we will during the Committee Stage check that every item is being expended in the interest of the country and that is necessary in these times.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall be as brief as I can, because the main debate on these estimates takes place in the Committee Stage. The hon. member for Constantia had a good deal to say about the portent of this budget in relation to coming expenditure. He seemed to criticize in advance that we were not economizing sufficiently on Government spending. I have said from the very start, and I have said it for many months, that it is a very difficult thing to cut down amounts which have been approved by Parliament many months ago. It is very difficult when there are considerable and substantial contractual obligations, such as any Government has, and which the various departments have to meet. Furthermore, you cannot simply reduce the salaries of the various Government departments&#x2019; personnel or retrench the personnel. I do not think the hon. member would like to see that either. Therefore I have said all along that it is a very difficult matter to come to Parliament at this stage and say that on existing budget we have been able to cut spending in various ways. What I said was that we would make every effort in the main budget&#x2014;which is very soon to be presented to this House&#x2014;to show what this Government is really doing in this respect. The hon. member&#x2019;s reason for saying that his party will not oppose this measure, seems to me to be almost frivolous. If I understood him correctly, he said that the Government was now paying the salaries of our troops, our soldiers, and therefore this measure would not be opposed. Sir, that has nothing whatsoever to do with this additional budget. What sort of reasoning is that? However, another point is that the hon. member asked me whether provision had been made, and if so where, for the repayment of loans&#x2014;which were negotiated abroad&#x2014;after devaluation had caused a bigger amount to be owed. But, Sir, I think the hon. member will know that the repayment of loans is not a question to be voted on by Parliament.</p>

<p>The servicing of the loans.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In terms of the Loans Act, loans are repaid as statutory commitments. The hon. member referred to the increase in the capital amount of the loans. [Interjections.] It is no use saying he did not; of course he said so. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South must listen. He might then learn something about capital financing. The fact is that the bigger amount involved here relates to the actual capital extent of the loans. It is far bigger than the interest increase, and is not a matter for parliamentary approval at all. But as far as the increased interest commitments are concerned, of course that will be provided for <span class="col_2223-2224" refersTo="page_1128"/>as they fall due. The hon. member for Yeoville also said that there was not much indication of economy in Government spending. My reply to him is exactly the same as to the hon. member for Constantia. But I would like to say that hon. members opposite vie with each other to ask Ministers to say to the House in what ways they are economizing. If the hon. member for Yeoville would take the trouble to analyse the replies already given&#x2014;and there have been many of them&#x2014;he might find that quite an impressive picture emerges bearing on this question of economy in Government spending. Those facts are available.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville asked how I would finance this spending. That has been provided for. This money has already been obtained from essentially non-banking sources. We have, in fact, made provision for this in the least inflationary manner possible. We have done this by raising various loans in good time&#x2014;not overseas loans. Those overseas loans that were budgeted for were raised earlier. What we have done more recently is that we have raised new loans domestically. So this amount has been provided for in an essentially non-inflationary manner. These are the main points I want to raise at this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister of Defence whether he is prepared to furnish us with more details regarding subhead R. In the 1975-&#x2019;76 budget provision was made for an additional R450 million and here we see that an additional amount of R5 300 000 is being asked for under the Special Defence Account in terms of Act 6 of 1974.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the first instance, item A deals with the results of the Riekert report. The Riekert report followed upon the last adjustment made to the salaries of Public Servants. The Government appointed the Riekert Committee to investigate the conditions of service of the Services and the Riekert committee reported to the Cabinet that as far as the Services are concerned certain privation and service allowances should be paid under given <span class="col_2225-2226" refersTo="page_1129"/>circumstances. This would apply to the general service risks, potential and real privations due to service in the field, liability to immediate mobilizing and classified or other missions without prior warning. The service allowance concerned long and irregular hours of service and stand-by duty for regimental or security services. The Riekert committee recommended that certain privation and service allowances be paid to the Services, i.e. for the Army, the Police and the Prisons on the basis of certain principles. The amount paid out as privation allowances is R7,8 million and as service allowances, R2,7 million. This gives a total of R10,5 million for the 15 months from January 1975 to March 1976. In other words, these allowances were paid to members of the Permanent Force. This is an improvement in their conditions of service.</p>

<p>Then there is an extension of the establishment for which provision is also being made. A special effort was made to recruit personnel for the Permanent Force. We succeeded in filling a number of vacant posts. An amount of R6,5 million is required for this. This gives an additional amount of altogether R17 million as far as subhead A is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch put a question concerning subhead R&#x2014;Contribution to Special Defence Account. The net increase amounts to R5,3 million and is due to the fact that initially an additional amount of R80 947 000 was asked for in the second revised budget. However, owing to the present economic climate and the anti-inflation manifest, the department reconsidered the cash position and, although this is not a saving, estimated that only R5,3 million will be required to meet its commitments. This is the only explanation for it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister to give us an explanation of the two <i>ex gratia</i> payments listed under subhead E? Could he also give us the details in respect of subhead 2&#x2014;Standard Stock Capital, under Loan Vote O? This is a new item for which an amount of R1,5 million is to be voted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let us start with subhead 2&#x2014;Standard Stock Capital, under Loan Vote O; the increase of R 1,5 million is due to the recent devaluation of the rand which had an adverse effect on the cost structure of medicine and equipment. As hon. members will know, the Department of Defence controls the central medicine store for all Government departments. This falls under the Surgeon-General. The Department of Health asked that tuberculosis medicine be supplied to local authorities by this department, tuberculosis medicine which they previously purchased from the private sector. It is expected that more favourable prices at which the central medicine store can supply these medicines, should bring about a considerable saving for the local authorities. However, this will mean an increase of approximately 20% in the turnover of this department.</p>

<p>Why is this a new item? Why was the increase not included in existing items?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because fresh provision had to be made in order to comply with this request of the Department of Health.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked for an explanation concerning the <i>ex gratia</i> payments under subhead E. I shall first deal with the payment to Barlows. On 2 June 1971 the State Procurement Board signed a contract with Specialized Electronic Systems for the supply to the South African Air Force of 30 altitude encoders&#x2014;this has to do with the system of information concerning hostile and friendly aeroplanes&#x2014;and supplementary equipment at a total cost of R184 359. No deliveries were made during the contract period and on 31 July the department agreed to an extension and a final delivery was to be made before the end of February 1973. However, delivery only took place on 6 August 1973. On 6 August the contractors submitted an application for the re-imbursement of a loss of R19 636, compiled as follows: Loss due to fluctuation in the exchange rate, R15 154; costs concerning freight and insurance for which, accidentally, no provision had been made, R3 767; loss due to a too low selling price quoted in the tender, R714,54. This amounts to altogether R19 636,36. The contractor reminded the foreign suppliers on several occasions to expedite delivery. It seems that, after the people concerned had finally reached a decision on the composition of the equipment, Messrs. Jagger had to make provision to comply with the requirements of all Mirage aircraft. The total claim of R19 636,36 includes <span class="col_2227-2228" refersTo="page_1130"/>no element of profit, but only represents the direct loss on the contract.</p>

<p>The other <i>ex gratia</i> payment was made to Criterion Equipment Company (Pty.) Ltd. On 24 September 1973 the Procurement Committee of the Armaments Board gave permission for certain contracts to be concluded with the firm I have mentioned. This was for the provision of seven diesel-driven forklift trucks with five metric tons capacity, at R9 995 each. The price-in-delivery period was 180 days. Contract E25 provided for the supply of nine diesel-driven forklift trucks with a two metric tons capacity at R5 395 each. The price-in-delivery period was also 180 days&#x2014;this sounds familiar in this House. Due to problems of his overseas supplier, the contract could not fulfil his delivery promise and the department postponed the delivery date on condition that no price increases or further postponement would be considered. Delivery was completed between June and August 1974. The contractor informed the Armaments Board on 28 January 1975 that a loss of R7 839,63 had been incurred due to the increased prices at which items had to be imported owing to the fact that they were imported by the overseas suppliers at the prices which prevailed on shipment. Documentary evidence was submitted to support this. An application for an increase of 15% in the price in order to cover further costs, was submitted by the contractor, but the department recommended that the firm only be refunded for the real loss of R7 839,63.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the first place the increase concerns salaries, wages and allowances because of the problem of inflation with which the whole world has to contend. This results in a continuous increase in salaries abroad. As is also generally known, we employ foreigners there. They are locally recruited staff, and in order to obtain their services, it is necessary for us to compete on the labour markets of those countries. So we must pay them more. In the second place the devaluation of the rand has also resulted in an increase in the salaries and wages of locally recruited staff. The amount required for this, is estimated to be R280 000; I must, in the last instance, mention the annual revision of our officials&#x2019; foreign service salaries. These salaries are revised annually in view of the rising cost of living abroad and other factors. It is impossible to conclude this revision every year in time for the main Budget, because the revision demands a considerable amount of research. Consequently it cannot be ready in time for the main Budget.</p>

<p>The additional R30 000 for special departmental services is required in connection with emergency relief in the form of medical supplies which the Government decided to give to Guatemala after a state of emergency had developed there as a result of the recent earthquake.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall give the information to the hon. member with pleasure. The hon. member for Griqualand East apparently wants the same particulars. It is money which the Transkei needs in its development so as to be able to enter independence. The money is required for the provision of certain facilities in the form of buildings.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is necessary for certain administrative buildings with a view to the Transkei becoming independent later this year and also to make provision for meeting the extra financial burden which the Transkei will have to carry during the year with a view to the inclusion of the Herschel and Glen Grey areas in the Transkei administration. Funds were not made <span class="col_2229-2230" refersTo="page_1131"/>available for including those two areas under the Transkei, but under the Ciskei. There are certain sums which may be deducted from the Ciskei&#x2019;s allocation since the Ciskei is not going to use those funds. In total we have to vote an additional amount of R5 539 million under subhead O. This amount comprises three components, if I may call it that way. In the first instance there is the building aspect with which I have already dealt. The second component is the provision for health services, for which R432 000 is required in the two above-mentioned areas. The Transkei will be responsible for those areas during the last few months of the current financial year&#x2014;in other words, from December until March. In the third place there are several other groups of services for which provision will also have to be made, since the Transkei has now taken over from the Ciskei responsibility for Herschel and Glen Grey. As I have already stated, R5 539 million is required under this subhead.</p>

<p>Yes, it has to do with Port St. Johns as well. However, the hon. member ought to know that Port. St. Johns received only a small part of that amount over the past year. As regards land purchases, the position is, as hon. members know, that provision was made in the main Budget for an amount of R25 million. However, the department had an understanding with the Treasury that over and above the sanctioned amount, we would be able to spend a further amount of R25 million, if necessary. The further amount of R25 million would then have to be voted by means of the Additional Appropriation. The process of land purchases continued in the course of the year&#x2014;and we then established that we would require more than the additional amount of R25 million. Consequently we started both written and oral negotiations with the Treasury and the Minister of Finance as to how much more we could obtain. These negotiations naturally took some time. Several discussions were held, and it was finally decided on an amount of R30 million and not R25 million extra as the understanding originally was. R30 million extra is therefore being provided for land purchases. The amount of R450 000 mentioned under Loan Vote N, is an amount which is required for Vendaland. The money was originally available for Vendaland,</p>

<p><span class="col_2231-2232" refersTo="page_1132"/>but under another subhead which could not be transferred by means of <i>virement.</i> This is intended for an industrial park, or industrial area, or industrial township. The money is required for the establishment of the township and for the provision of facilities there. The establishment of the Venda Corporation, the national corporation for the Venda, however, resulted in the decision being taken that the corporation and not the Vendaland department concerned should rather develop the park. The money could not be made available, by means of <i>virement,</i> however, because this is against the rules. Consequently it is not being paid out under the original appropriation, but is paid out additionally so that the Venda Corporation may obtain the money to establish the industrial park. This explains the total amount of R30 450 000.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is not R30 million, but R25 million. Perhaps the hon. member did not understand. In the beginning of the last financial year Parliament voted R25 million for land purchases. At that stage there was an understanding between us and the Treasury that, should it be necessary, another R25 million could be made available later. That time is now. However, during the course of last year we realized that the extra R25 million in terms of this understanding would not be sufficient. Therefore we started negotiations, in written form and verbally with the Treasury and the hon. the Minister, and at the end of the year&#x2014;I think it was the beginning of December&#x2014;we came to the final agreement that the additional amount would not be the R25 million we originally had in mind, but R30 million, plus the R450 000 I have mentioned for Vendaland.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister of Transport to give us details of the amount of almost R5 million under item J&#x2014;Contributions, Grants-in-Aid and Subsidies? Could the hon. the Minister also give us an explanation of the figure of R152 418 under the same heading<i>&#x2014;ex gratia</i> payment: Border Passenger Transport Ltd.? Under the same heading an amount of R214 000 for research into the improvement of urban transport facilities is being asked for. The latter two items are new items. They raise <span class="col_2233-2234" refersTo="page_1133"/>a new principle. We want to debate this. However, before doing so, I would like to give the hon. the Minister an opportunity of giving us an explanation.</p>

<p>Under sub-head M&#x2014;Construction and Maintenance of National Roads in and around the Transkei&#x2014;and additional amount of R3 750 000 is being asked for. Could the hon. the Minister give us an explanation why, whereas less than R6 million was voted originally, this amount has now increased by more than 50%?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member asked so many questions that I should like to answer him first. In the first place the hon. member asked a question in connection with subhead J&#x2014;Grants-in-Aid and Subsidies&#x2014;for which an additional amount of R4 956 582 is being requested. As the hon. member will know, the department has been subsidizing Bantu transport services in terms of the Transport Services Act for the past 18 years. Contributions are made by employers to a fund from which the subsidies are paid. In so far as the fund is unable to pay the subsidies, the balance is provided by the Treasury.</p>

<p>As a result of increased costs of transport, including petrol, tyres, vehicles, etc., several applications for the increase of fares have reached the road transportation board in recent times. When it was justified, the road transportation boards have approved the increased fares. The increased fares naturally brought about an increase in contributions by means of a subsidy. As a result of this, one now finds an increase of nearly R5 million for Bantu transport services.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked about the amount of R214 000 which is being requested in connection with research for the improvement of urban transport facilities. Last year a White Paper was tabled in consequence of the Driessen Report. Several of the recommendations of the Driessen Report were accepted by the Government in this White Paper. In order to commence the necessary administrative and preparatory work, the Treasury agreed that an amount of R750 000 be voted for the financial year ending at the end of this month. This was done so as to implement some of the recommendations as set out in the Driessen Report and as accepted in the White Paper. In consequence of this, it was necessary for the department to have certain research work done by the CSIR, the Provincial Administration and the local authorities of the five major cities in the country. It is in respect of that research that this amount of R214 000 is being provided.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what the amount of R152 418, which is being provided as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, involved. The hon. member will remember that there was a bus boycott in East London at the end of 1974. This led to this amount of R152 418 being paid to the Border Passenger Transport Ltd. The circumstances which gave rise to the granting of this <i>ex gratia</i> payment are the following&#x2014;I do not want to go into the preceding history, because this will draw matters out. From 2 December the Bantu who used this bus service, refused to do so any longer because an increase in fares had been approved by the local road transportation board which was put into effect on 2 December 1974. Negotiations were then conducted from time to time between the various departments, in conjunction with the bus company, on possible ways and means of terminating this boycott. The result of this boycott was that as from 2 December 1974 to 12 January 1975 there was for all practical purposes not a single Bantu who made use of this bus service. The only people who made use of the bus service, were the odd few Coloureds. Throughout these negotiations the company said that for the purpose of saving&#x2014;and this is self-evident&#x2014;it wanted to terminate the service. With the termination of this service they wanted to dismiss the bus drivers. The various departments and I myself attended a meeting in the Verwoerd Building on 23 December 1974 at which this whole affair was discussed, and representations were then made to this company not to terminate this service and not to dismiss the drivers. Hon. members will realize that if this service had been terminated and the experienced drivers had been dismissed, it would have meant that there would be no continuity in the service should it have to be resumed. Naturally everyone felt that this bus service should continue. Negotiations were conducted with the Department of Bantu Administration, and in due course it was <span class="col_2235-2236" refersTo="page_1134"/>agreed that this transport organization would be taken over by the XDC and that affair was settled. However, seeing that the authorities had requested the company to continue with the costs and had also given it to understand, that on the successful settlement of the matter, it could lodge a claim with the National Transport Commission for the losses it had suffered, the company subsequently&#x2014;please note only in July last year&#x2014;lodged a claim for its losses. The original claim exceeded R500 000, which was reduced to R402 000 after auditing and correction. It was then agreed and the National Transport Commission recommended to me that under the circumstances an <i>ex gratia</i> payment be made to them, only for the wages and salaries for the period for which the company had continued to employ the people at the request of the authorities. The wages and salaries amounted to R152 418, the amount which appears in the Estimates. The final question which the hon. member asked, concerned the amount of R5 million under the Loan Vote &#x2026;</p>

<p>And the Transkeian National Road?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I shall first deal with the question of the Transkeian National Road. The roads in the Transkei are not built by the Department of Transport but by the Provincial Administration. As in the case of so many other services and the financing of services&#x2014;as also in the case of the bus service which I have just mentioned&#x2014;payment for such services is channelled through the Department of Transport, because it is the most suitable department to effect such payments. This is indeed what is being done here. In other words, the Department of Transport is merely the channel through which the financing goes as far as payment for the roads built by the Provincial Administration is concerned. In this case I have been informed that the work which was done, had been expedited to a considerable extent and that costs had escalated considerably. Because of this, the work was not only more expensive, but more work was done than what had previously been foreseen. This increased amount is required as a result of this.</p>

<p>The final question which the hon. member asked, concerns the amount of R5 million which appears on the Loan Vote. This is for the construction of a landing strip at Upington airport. It is generally known that under present circumstances, especially political circumstances in Africa, it is felt that a more efficient airport should be constructed so as to enable our aircraft to fly from here to Europe with greater ease and with an increased economic cargo. They can in fact do this to a larger extent when they fly from Europe to South Africa, because the airports in Europe are very much closer to sea level. Our international airport in Johannesburg is 5 000 feet above sea level and in the end it was found that Upington would be the most suitable place for the construction of such an airport. It was then agreed that this landing strip would be constructed there, because Upington is approximately 3 000 feet nearer sea level than Johannesburg. The estimated cost of this airport, and indeed the tender we received, is in the region of R8,5 million. Hon. members will remember that we made provision for the building of the <i>RSA 2,</i> the research ship, in the estimates for this year. The building of this research ship has been delayed, however, because the design architects did not complete the work at an early enough date for us to call for tenders. Therefore we shall not have to incur that expenditure in this financial year. We came to an agreement with the Treasury that we would have a saving of R3,5 million on the <i>RSA</i> 2, and this R3,5 million plus the R5 million which is now being requested, will pay for the Upington landing strip.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with reference to Vote No. 9, subhead J&#x2014;Contributions, Grants-in-Aid and Subsidies&#x2014;I should like to ask whether any amount is included in that for Putco operations on the Witwatersrand, specifically the Alexandra Township bus service. There is also one other question I want to ask. The other day, in the debate on the Railway additional estimates, we talked about the purchase of the new SP Boeings, and I understood the hon. the Minister to say that it would not be necessary for them to use Upington airport at all and that they could do the complete hop without coming down at sea level. Is this a belt and braces operation to make absolutely certain, or do we have to do both? It appears to me that there is a possibility of covering a problem that has arisen in two directions. Was it really necessary to spend this money?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from><span class="col_2237-2238" refersTo="page_1135"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is absolutely nothing included for Putco in this. As far as Upington airport and the new Boeing SPs are concerned, may I mention that we can fly from Jan Smuts Airport to Europe with the new SP, but then we must give up our cargo. We are in fact doing this at present every Monday night from London to Johannesburg. The Monday night flight from London to Johannesburg used to be an unpopular one because it does not suit one to fly from London to South Africa on a Monday night. The aircraft were fairly empty, and we made an arrangement to have a direct flight from London to Johannesburg on Monday nights, but we were aware of the fact that we would have to limit the number of passengers to 250 instead of 345, and since that decision was taken, that flight has been full every Monday night, because the people like an uninterrupted flight. We can in fact fly from Johannesburg to Europe in the same way, but because Johannesburg is so much higher above sea level, we will have to give up our cargo. In order to have a good economic load of cargo, we need another airport and Upington will make it possible for us to operate much more effectively.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to come back to the <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the Border Transport Company. I want to ask the Minister why it is that the Department of Transport asked the company to continue the service when they wanted to stop. The Department of Transport controls the National Transport Commission and they authorized an increase in fares. There was a boycott. Now, surely, the responsibility does not fall on the Department of Transport to deal with this matter, but on the people who wanted the passengers moved. Why should it be the responsibility of the Department of Transport while it was the Department of Bantu Administration who wanted the people moved? The hon. the Minister said he attended the meeting. Did he convene the meeting, or was he simply an observer at the meeting? I think we are entitled to know who exerted the pressure in asking for this service to continue. If it was his department, is this not a completely new departure? The Minister dealt with the question of the R4 956 582 for subsidies, contributions and grant-in-aid, but in addition there is also another R4 100 000 under subhead L for subsidizing the Railways for non-White passenger services from non-White townships. So we have altogether R9 million in respect of subsidizing transport from the townships. This is additional, unforeseen, uncalculated and unplanned. It seems strange that on a R13 million budget there should be a R5 million increase, unplanned, plus the R4 million. Now through Transport we are in addition subsidizing private companies. I think we are entitled to a further explanation in regard to this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in regard to this <i>ex gratia</i> payment, I may mention that there was of course great concern at that time over this bus boycott that was taking place in East London and the various departments concerned with transport, and more specifically in regard to the transport of Bantu at East London go together. Because of the department&#x2019;s interest and responsibility for transport services, I, too, played a role in this. But in fact it was more specifically the Department of Bantu Administration that made this request. On 23 December I acted as chairman in the Verwoerd Building because of my seniority. We had discussions there, and on that occasion the company informed us that they were no longer able to continue; that they did not see their way clear to incurring these unnecessary costs. However, it was generally felt that this service should continue, and I do not think we can find fault with this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But did Bantu Administration not purchase this service?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Not at that stage; and what is more, it was not Bantu Administration, but the Xhosa Development Corporation. The XDC eventually purchased the service, but that transaction was only finalized a good while later. He then asked them not to dismiss the people, because there had to be a service. Then, at the beginning of January 1975, Bantu Administration made a further request to them not to stop the service. They wanted to stop the service at the end of December, and they were then requested to continue until 9 January. On 9 January they were then asked to continue with the service and not to dismiss the people before the 12th. Later a request came for them not to do so before 17 January, but meanwhile a solution was arrived at, and from 12 January <span class="col_2239-2240" refersTo="page_1136"/>the services again continued as normal. What happened, was that they went back to the fares that had been applicable before the dispute arose, i.e. before the increase that was approved by the local road transportation board. They then started making use of the service as before. It was during this period&#x2014;2 December to 12 January&#x2014;that this company suffered these great losses in continuing the service without any passengers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>When did the XDC purchase?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>On 13 January, therefore they started using the bus service again. On 7 February 1975, the service was purchased by the XDC. But by then the service was back to normal again. If this step had not been taken, the service would have been far from normal by the time the XDC took over.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me a question in regard to subhead L in respect of resettlement services rendered by the Railways. There is an agreement between the Railways and the Treasury that the Treasury will pay deficits on that service. As a result of rising costs lately, it was found that there will be a deficit of R4,1 million and provision has to be made for that. The hon. member is obviously concerned about the large amounts being paid to transport services by way of subsidies. I am not surprised by his attitude. The matter is indeed getting a bit out of hand and it deserves our attention in future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions in regard to the Border Passenger Transport Company Ltd. He will recollect that the Border Passenger Transport Company Ltd. was purchased by the XDC for a total sum of R7,9 million. Last year the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration spelt out in detail just how that R7,9 million was made up. One of the items he mentioned was the goodwill. He said (Hansard, Vol. 55, col. 1705) that the goodwill was calculated at three times the adjusted profit of R673 000.</p>

<p>Now, if the purchase was made by the XDC on 7 February 1975, as the hon. the Minister has just said, that is subsequent to the company making the loss by conducting operations at a lower tariff, why was that fact not taken into account in the assessing of goodwill which was paid by the XDC? Why did it have to be done by the Department of Transport?</p>

<p>I think we have an incredible situation here. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration called a meeting in order to deal with the transport of Bantu workers by a bus service against which there was a strike and which bus service the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration wanted to buy, and which he subsequently bought. In order to make his purchase a good one and in order to keep the bus service operating, in order to maintain it as a &#x201C;going concern&#x201D; so that he can buy it, he comes to the hon. the Minister of Transport and requests him to subsidize the firm he is about to purchase so that when he purchases it, he will purchase it as a going concern. What sort of Minister is this, who allows himself to be used, who allows his department to be used, and who now asks Parliament to pay R152 000 as a free <i>ex gratia</i> gift, a bonsella to a company for doing something which he did not want but which the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration wanted? The Department of Bantu Administration wanted to keep the service going. The hon. the Minister said that the request came from them. I asked him specifically, and he answered that this was the case.</p>

<p>The Department of Bantu Administration wanted to buy the business, which they subsequently did, at what we believe to be a highly inflated price. If there were any losses involved in making it an attractive buy, why should the Minister of Transport carry the losses? I have already pointed out the additional burden he is carrying in subsidizing transport and that this figure amounts to an additional R9 million. Why should he at the same time pull the chestnuts out of the fire for the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration asked him to do it so that he could buy the business later at an inflated price, a highly inflated price, for which he paid goodwill. If the service had not been operating, if they had sacked all the drivers, for which we are told this subsidy was required, then that business would have had no goodwill. If it is not operating and it has no drivers and it is not being used, what are you buying? You are buying the vehicles, that is all. You are not paying tens of thousands of rands for goodwill. What I want to get at is why this hon. Minister of Transport subsidized this. I want to know under what legal provision he is acting. What law authorizes him to ask Parliament for money to subsidize a private enterprise operation for which he was not responsible? He did not do anything which gave them a claim against Transport and against the Government. He had not done anything wrong and he had not caused a loss. He suddenly becomes Father Christmas. By what right is he asking Parliament, this Committee, to vote this money? He is asking Parliament to vote money for something for which he was not responsible. I do not see why we should approve this expenditure, because this is money for which the hon. the Minister of Transport should not be asking. If the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration had it on his budget, then we could say that the Government, through the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, asked them to sustain a loss and therefore the Department of Bantu Administration is responsible. In this case, however, I can think of no statutory provision which entitles the Minister to ask for this money. It is not a subsidy in terms of the levy which is paid by employers. It is not a subsidy in terms of the agreement with the Railways. It is not a subsidy which is being paid because of a responsibility of the Department of Transport. The Department of Transport has no responsibility in this matter, none whatsoever. On what grounds, therefore, does he ask Parliament for this money?</p>

<p>The hon. member now wants to create the impression that the Department of Bantu Administration came a long way with the purpose of purchasing the bus service. If the problem did not arise, there would never have been any question of them now buying the bus service. The Local Road Transportation Board approved the increased fares, and I want to point out that these fares were approved on the basis of a request that came from the Chief Minister of the Ciskei. He requested that drivers be put on a higher salary scale, i.e. R36 per week instead of R22 per week. They knew about this increased expenditures that would result, and because of this they went to the Road Transportation Board to have the fares increased. At the Road Transportation Board nobody had any objections whatsoever to the increased fares. The increased fares were introduced.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not the Bantu either. No one made any objections, but when the increased fares were introduced, the fat was in the fire. Then they did not want to make use of the buses any more&#x2014;in fact, not one Bantu boarded the buses. We had great problems. Do you know that they got onto the trains so that the train coaches buckled because of the loads they had to carry? On top of the roof and wherever there was space to climb, they climbed, but they did not want to travel in the buses. What was the solution we were looking for? That is where the hon. member is wide of the mark. The solution we were looking for, was to try and persuade these people to use the bus service again. If they would use the bus service and were willing to pay the increased tariffs, the problem would have been solved. Then this transport concern would still have been in the hands of Border Passenger Transport today. Then Bantu Administration would never have bought the concern, and that is why it was our first motive to persuade the Bantu who had previously made use of the bus service, to use the bus service again. Therefore we made a joint effort, with the Department of Bantu Administration and its officials, in consultation with the Treasury as far as the financial side was concerned, to keep this bus service going. We did not want to undertake negotiations on behalf of the Department of Bantu Administration to purchase the bus service, but wanted the bus service to continue. We did not succeed in this. We realized that they would under no circumstances do so. Week after week passed and they still did not want to use the buses. The only solution was negotiations through the Department of Bantu Administration with the XDC for the take-over of the bus service. The first step was to then revert to the original fares. After this had been done and the assurance had been given that the XDC would take over the bus service, they immediately began to use the bus service again.</p>

<p>The hon. member alleged that I have no responsibility. I am responsible for transport matters, for all transport matters. I cannot shut my eyes to any of them. The <i>ex gratia</i> payment that has been mentioned, was nothing but a subsidy. If the hon. member wants to object because the money is being channelized through my department, he should also object to bus service and railway subsidies being channelized through my department. I refer here to the subsidies payable under subheads J and L of Vote No. 9.</p>

<p>We came to the conclusion that in accordance with our undertaking to the company&#x2014;this transaction has nothing to do with the purchase of the comapany&#x2014;we were morally and legally obliged to give them assistance. Accordingly we arranged to offer them R152 000 by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. This is a new item. If the hon. member wishes to vote against this, he is quite free to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I regret that we now have to take this matter further, but the hon. the Minister raised a point which is of importance to me. As I see the position, the firm asked the Transport Commission for permission to increase their fares. The task of the Transport Commission was to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; <span class="col_2245-2246" refersTo="page_1139"/>or &#x201C;no&#x201D;, of course after they had thoroughly investigated the matter. In the end, however, it was the bus company itself that was responsible for the increase.</p>

<p>We take it that 50 000 people are concerned. Should the Transport Commission therefore react positively to the application of the bus company and agree that fares may be increased, it may happen that the Coloureds say: &#x201C;Now we are no longer going to travel by bus, but trample the train floors till they buckle.&#x201D; How can we, therefore, now establish a principle according to which we can expect the Transport Commission to subsidize the bus company? Surely we cannot do this. I have every sympathy with the hon. the Minister. He acted in the best interests of transport, but the problem still remains that the R152 000 he paid was not his responsibility. It was the bus Company&#x2019;s own responsibility. If someone had to pay for this, it was the XDC, not the Department of Transport.</p>

<p>From the same pocket. However, that is not what bothers me. What does bother me, is that the hon. the Minister by this payment accepts a principle that could cause enormous problems in future. How can the hon. the Minister&#x2014;apart from the poor bookkeeping&#x2014;accept the responsibility and subsidize a firm suffering losses as a result of the fact that it raised its fares?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it would seem to me that the hon. the Minister should reconsider this matter.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to state quite unequivocally that we have no objection whatever to the action which the hon. the Minister has taken in this regard. In fact, Sir, we approve of it, we approve of it wholeheartedly. We agree 100% with the hon. the Minister when he says that it is absolutely essential that the transport charges as far as the carrying of passengers from the townships, the Coloured and the Black townships, to their places of work is concerned, should be kept to the very minimum.</p>

<p>We agree with the hon. the Minister that high transport costs are a dangerous flashpoint and that it must be avoided and prevented at all costs. I believe the hon. the Minister took intelligent preventive action in this regard. We have seen over and over again through the years&#x2014;starting with the bus boycott in Alexandra township, in Johannesburg, in Newcastle, in Port Elizabeth and elsewhere&#x2014;how these things can lead to real trouble. Therefore I believe the hon. the Minister took the right steps. I cannot understand why he should be surprised that the same annoyance and anger are not generated when the prices of foodstuffs go up as happens when the price of transport goes up. The answer is obvious: People cut down on the purchase of food. They have no option. They do not like it, but they have no choice. As far as transport is concerned, however, people cannot cut down on the costs. It is a fixed charge, and they have to get to work. That is why an enormous hostility is generated when the price of transport goes up. It was one of the major causes of the strikes in Durban in 1974.</p>

<p>So we want to make it quite clear from these benches that we thoroughly approve of the action by the hon. the Minister to subsidize transport, and this private company in this case. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will extend the same consideration to Putco, if it becomes necessary, in order to keep that company going in order to provide much needed transport.</p>

The first point that I want to make clear, is that we agree entirely with the sentiments expressed by the hon. member for <span class="col_2247-2248" refersTo="page_1140"/>Houghton. However, that has nothing whatsoever to do with the payment of this sum of R152 000. In point of fact, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the justification for the payment of this sum. I really think that the hon. the Minister is trying to pull the wool over our eyes in this respect. If the hon. the Minister had investigated fully the question as to why it was necessary to pay R152 000 as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the Border Passenger Transport Company, he would have realized that he should never consider making payment at all. He should never have made that payment. The point about it is this: If any amount should have been paid, it should have been paid to the XDC.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that hon. member there must rather stick to agriculture. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, the point I want to make is this: When the negotiations for the payment of R152 000 started, the Border Passenger Transport Company has already been paid out for its business, it does not matter by whom. It had been paid out for its business at the time when it was purchased, which was after the obligation the hon. the Minister states he had entered into with this company, i.e. the obligation that he would ask them to continue to run the business. Subsequent to that event, the business was purchased, and incorporated in the purchase agreement in respect of the business, was an amount for goodwill. Goodwill is calculated on the profits made over the previous three years. These are facts. I believe that the hon. the Minister, being an ex-lawyer, will agree with me that that is so. Now, if that is so, how can he pay an amount to compensate a company for a loss that they had sustained previously, when they had already been paid out for the goodwill? If payment was due, that payment should have been made to the XDC, because they bought the company and paid for the goodwill. Now if that had happened the XDC gets something back which it should have obtained for itself, and not the Border Passenger Transport Company. I am firmly convinced that we simply cannot pass this payment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, firstly I should just like to tell the hon. member for East London City that I am not an ex-lawyer. I am still on the roll.</p>

<p>Now, I want to come to the hon. member for Maitland. The hon. member for Maitland looked for reasons for our paying this amount of R152 418. He then came to the conclusion that it has to be paid because the company increased its fares, and that because the company increased the fares and found itself in difficulties, it was the company&#x2019;s responsibility and not ours. This was more or less the hon. member&#x2019;s line of thought, was it not?</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>How could the hon. the Minister be responsible?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, now how could I be responsible? I told the hon. member clearly why we were responsible. The company, quite justifiably, told us that they were not able to continue the bus service and employ people day after day and week after week and that they were going to discontinue the bus service. Because we did not want to face the chaotic conditions that would have resulted if these services had been discontinued, we asked the company not to discontinue the services. Therefore, because we asked the company not to dismiss its people and not to stop its services, we had certain obligations towards that company. We also made this clear to the company. They gave us an ultimatum that they were unable to continue because it was an unproductive service. They said they would terminate the service on 31 December, but we said they were to continue. We were not of the opinion that the solution we had in mind <span class="col_2249-2250" refersTo="page_1141"/>would succeed, if the service were to be terminated. We told them that they should continue with the service and that they could not merely dismiss so many people. We pointed out that if they were to do this, we would experience even greater difficulties. Therefore we put a request to them&#x2014;the hon. member should understand this well&#x2014;and assured them that they could apply to the National Transport Commission for a subsidy by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. It is because of that consideration that we want to discharge our responsibility towards this company.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City insists that it should be part of the goodwill. However, it is part of the activities of the company, and expenses the company incurred with our knowledge and because of what we did. When the Xhosa Development Corporation agreed to take over this company this was a matter that had been disposed of. Then the company began to function normally again. The Bantu again made use of the bus services. Therefore it was a completely isolated matter that had been disposed of. Therefore, I think that we are quite justified in feeling that we have a responsibility towards this bus company. When they therefore, presented their account, we examined the matter and intimated that we were prepared to honour our undertaking to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Griqualand East asked me about the roads in the Transkei. A short while ago I explained that these roads are being built by the provincial administration. We are only the channel through which the finances flow. We are in no way involved in the particulars of where the roads are being constructed, etc. The construction of roads is being dealt with by the provincial administration. All I am able to give the hon. member, are the reasons why provision is made for an increased amount for the financing of those roads. Unfortunately, I am not able to tell him that one road has been constructed and another has not been constructed.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are three items the hon. the Minister must account for in this House. I would like to ask him to motivate the amounts required in respect of subhead G on Revenue Vote 10 and subheads 1 and 3 of Loan Vote E. I particularly want to point out that on Vote 10 an amount of nearly R1 million extra is required over the original budget of approximately R4&#x00BC; million. This seems a very large amount. A similar situation pertains in relation to subhead 3 on Loan Vote E. An amount of nearly R1&#x00BD; million, if one takes the savings into account, now has to be found over and above the original estimate of R3 642 200. Can the hon. the Minister explain to us why these apparently excessive amounts now have to be voted?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the amount requested under Revenue Vote 10 is mainly for the maintenance and operation of Government water works. The increase under subhead G is mainly a result of the increased expenses in respect of the purchase of electricity, as well as the repairing of flood damage to departmental works. I want to give the hon. members the particulars in brief. The department provides water on a large scale to various bodies, <i>inter alia,</i> the Eastern Transvaal/Usutu scheme which supplies water to Escom, Springbok, <span class="col_2251-2252" refersTo="page_1142"/>the Northern Cape, the Free State gold fields, and the Tugela/Vaal River complex, where a larger amount of water is pumped. In the course of last year, Escom increased the tariffs for electricity. This year, of course, we have to bring water tariffs into line with this. The department announced certain tariffs for water at the time, and because the tariffs have been increased in the meantime, we must provide accordingly for the additional cost.</p>

<p>Approximately R257 000 is in respect of flood damage which occurred in the Vaalharts area from 17 January, as well as in the Orange River, at Upington. The damage at Upington amounted to approximately R100 000 and that at Vaalharts to R157 000. We suffered great losses at the outset because of the washing away of storm-water and drainage canals which had to be repaired as soon as possible to enable normal farming operations to continue.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the additional amount under Loan Vote E. Here too drainage and improvements to Government water schemes are involved. This item is mainly concerned with the Hammarsdale area, which is a point of development which does not have a local authority yet. The Department of Water Affairs has to handle the sewerage and all facilities. That area has grown so rapidly that the existing sewerage system and water purification works there have proved to be much too small during the past year, and very urgent attention had to be given to this, or very unhealthy conditions would have resulted. Also, housing had to be provided for employees and so forth.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a pity that this small amount has to be obtained in such a complicated way. The position is that the Forest Amendment Act, Act No. 36 of 1975, provides for the building and maintenance of the national hiking way system to be financed from the National Hiking Way Fund. The department was unable to finance it in that particular manner last year. Consequently, departmental funds for recreational facilities have not been used for the building and maintenance of the hiking way system in Government forests since the commencement of that Act last year. Now the national body in control of this hiking way system&#x2014;I have forgotten the name of the body for the moment&#x2014;has to draw up a budget and the department is making a contribution. Just to get things going, we are asking for R50. We shall have to request more for the coming financial year to enable that body to build and to maintain the hiking way.</p>

I should also like to ask him about subhead D&#x2014;printing, stationery, advertisements and publications. The distinction between advertisement and publicity is often not <span class="col_2253-2254" refersTo="page_1143"/>very clear, as the hon. the Minister will accept. As far as publications are concerned, last week in reply to a question I put to him, the hon. the Minister spoke of saving nearly R1,5 million in his department, most of it on publications. I wonder whether there is not some contradiction in this or whether the time factor explains why further money is now required in respect of publications after he has indicated that there was a saving here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_information">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INFORMATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the shortage under subhead D is chiefly owing to the provision for the printing costs of the department&#x2019;s annual report for 1974. This could not be paid for during the financial year 1974-&#x2019;75 because the invoices could not be delivered in time by the printers and therefore had to be transferred to the next financial year. The second reason for the increase is a rise of 35% in the cost of copying paper. This had an effect of the overall situation.</p>

We also have to appoint people in good time to plan the publications required in this connection. In order to initiate these projects we need capital, and for that reason a part of the cost is being provided for in this financial year in the Additional Appropriation, because we did not originally foresee it.

<p>Mr. Chairman, as I have said, the amount of R420 000 is mainly required for publicity in connection with the Transkei. Perhaps I should say something more about this. For so many years we have been working on a policy aimed at creating independent homelands. The Department of Information was continually faced with the problem abroad that our opponents told us: &#x201C;You are not honest with your policy; it is just a camouflage, you are just trying to mislead us; it is just a way of getting away with your policy of oppresion and it will never lead to independence.&#x201D; In October this year the first of the homelands will achieve true independence in terms of our policy, and we felt that this simply had to be given maximum publicity. By this means we want to say, &#x201C;Here is the proof of our honest intentions.&#x201D; It must receive so much publicity that the world will know that the policy is being implemented in practice as well. To be able to do this and to publicize as widely as possible the first really big positive fruit of our policy, we felt that there must not be any shortage of money in this connection. That is why we are requesting this money for the initial operations. Plans have already been drawn up&#x2014;I am not going to announce all the particulars <span class="col_2255-2256" refersTo="page_1144"/>now&#x2014;for publications, for guests from various countries to attend the independence celebrations, for television teams to film the event with a view to wide publicity and so forth. Films and publications will be prepared in this regard to bring the matter to the notice of the world in a really big way. In order to begin this enterprise we need this amount.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in introducing the Additional Appropriation Bill this afternoon, the hon. the Minister of Finance indicated that this considerable sum, R3 170 000, was required by the Department of the Interior for the repatriation of various people. Could the hon. the Minister indicate to us the extent to which this money was expended on travelling expenses, housing and maintenance of refugees and whether there is any possibility of recovering some of this money?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the expenditure with regard to the handling of the refugees consists mainly of repatriation and transportation costs. The heaviest item of expenditure is transportation costs. We repatriated 2 919 refugees by ship from Walvis Bay; 1 422 were repatriated by air from Windhoek and 5 750 by air from Jan Smuts. In addition, 750 refugees left the country at their own expense. With them, of course, we did not have much to do. I am unable to give any indication of the total amount, because, as hon. members know, we are again engaged in such a scheme at the moment. The amount of R3,2 million which is being requested here is therefore essentially an overall provision to cover all the costs. A certain part of this amount is, of course, recoverable from the Portuguese Government. We conducted negotiations with that Government and they accepted responsibility for a certain amount per person. The amount for which they accept responsibility would cover the full cost of the airfares of those whose conveyance it was possible to schedule on the ordinary flights. As regards persons travelling by ship, the Portuguese Government accepted responsibility for only a percentage of the costs. A journey by ship is obviously more expensive, and the Portuguese Government did not want to commit itself to the full amount. We adopted the standpoint that in spite of the fact that we would have to pay for a part of it ourselves it was to our advantage to get the people away as soon as possible rather than keep them here and have to provide them with food and other requirements. What has up to this stage been recovered from the Portuguese Government is an amount of R75 000; The principle that the Portuguese Government accepts responsibility has, therefore, already been established, and we have already begun to negotiate with them about the remaining amounts.</p>

In the first instance I should like to know whether he considers it necessary for this to be catagorized under passport control so that in fact it will not be highlighted in the public eye that we are spending this on humanitarian services. Quite a different impression is created when it is spent on passport controll. In the second instance I should like to know whether any portion of this amount is being spent on refugees who are unable by reason of nationality to go back to Portugal. In other words, are we spending anything on people who cannot go back to Portugal and what, in fact, are we doing in respect of such people?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, arising out of the reply of the hon. the Minister to my question, I notice that under the Social Welfare and Pensions Vote there is no additional amount being sought. I take it, therefore, that the cost of all the maintenance and welfare work that was done by that department has all been brought into the Vote of the hon. the Minister of the Interior. If that is correct, then the amount shown in this respect, I take it, will be the total cost.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was decided to provide for the whole amount under this Vote, instead of in bits and pieces under the Votes of the various departments. The costs incurred by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions have therefore been included in this amount. We have decided to provide one overall amount. Because repatriation and transportation costs were the heaviest item of expenditure, it was decided to provide the overall amount under the Interior Vote.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that, although the amount is provided under the general head &#x201C;passport control&#x201D;, there also is the subhead &#x201C;repatriation&#x201D;. Repatriation is what we are in fact dealing with here, and it falls under passport control. Everyone knows that the amounts which were spent in on repatriation, were in connection with refugees. Repatriation normally falls under passport control, and that is why the amount was provided under that head. I do not believe anyone in or outside this country can doubt that it was used for refugees and humanitarian assistance to refugees in the form of transportation, the provision of food, and so on. So much publicity has been given to this that I do not believe there can be any doubts about it. The reason why we are doing it under this Vote, is that the most convenient arrangement for administrative purposes is to keep it here.</p>

<p>This amount is mainly for the handling of the refugee problem to date i.e. the previous time there were refugees in our country. There were no people among them who were unable to go to Portugal. The 13 000 people whom we dealt with previously, all returned to Portugal. At the moment we have a situation in Southern Angola for which provision is not being made at present. Provision will have to be made for it in some other way. There are people in the refugee camps in Southern Angola whom it will not be possible to repatriate to Portugal, since the Portuguese Government does not regard them as citizens of Portugal. I do not believe the provision which has to be made for them, is under discussion at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I notice that an increase of approximately 25% in the grant-in-aid to the National Monuments Council is being asked for under subhead H. Percentage wise this increase is the largest of the three items for which additional funds are being asked for. Could the hon. the Minister furnish us with an explanation in this regard?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the large bush-fire we had on Table Mountain in February 1974 caused large-scale soil erosion. Repair costs were estimated at R100 000. The Table Mountain Conservation area is a national monument and any State contributions utilized for repairing the damage go through the National Monuments Council. The Cape Town City Council and the Cape Provincial Administration also contributed to the repair costs. Initially provision was made in the 1974-&#x2019;75 Additional Appropriation and the work was to have been carried out by the Cape Town City Council under the supervision of the NMC. However, owing to a shortage of labourers to carry out this work, it could only be started after March 1975. Therefore, the amount was not spent in the 1974-&#x2019;75 financial <span class="col_2259-2260" refersTo="page_1146"/>year and because it was too late to make provision for this in the 1975-&#x2019;76 Budget the Treasury, in March 1975, approved that the amount be included in the revised estimates. Because the expenditure constitutes a column 2 item and the amount voted for 1974-&#x2019;75 had to be surrendered since it was impossible to use it for any other purpose, the amount as it now appears in the additional estimates, has to be voted again.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask a number of question. Firstly there is subhead K, against which an amount of R69 000 is shown. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can deal with that and explain what that represents. In respect of subhead M&#x2014;Financial assistance to universities and bursaries for university education&#x2014;I should like the hon. the Minister to break up the amount of R1 774 500 which is being asked for. He should indicate, firstly, what portion of the amount is for financial assistance to universities and, secondly, for which universities. In the third instance he should indicate on what basis the financial assistance under that heading has been calculated. Is it on a basis which is equally applicable to each of the universities, or does it deal with a particular circumstance in a particular university? He should also indicate what portion of the amount is for bursaries for university education and to what universities that has been allocated. I should also like to know whether any special conditions are being attached in respect of the bursaries for university education. In the last instance I should like to know under what items the amount of R800 500 has been saved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Quite a number of questions have now been asked and if I do not answer them all now, the hon. member will have to remind me again. The first question concerns subhead K, the increase of R69 000. Of this amount, R30 000 is allocated for the construction of camps and camping areas. The position is that years ago a firm, Richardson Citrus, donated 1,7 morgen of the farm Seaview West in Port Elizabeth to the then Department of Agriculture for the exclusive use of the Land Service Movement. Quite complicated negotiations took place in terms of which the Port Elizabeth City Council undertook to make available a piece of land at Sardinia Bay in exchange for the Seaview West land needed for town development, but laid down as a condition that the land should be developed as soon as possible. Because it was impossible to make provision for the amount of R30 000 on the initial estimates, the Treasury agreed, in the light of the condition laid down by the Port Elizabeth City Council, and because this was for this good cause and because it was a column 2 item, that provision could be made for this amount of R30 000 on these additional estimates. That is one portion of the R69 000. There is also an amount of R32 500 in respect of the adjustment of salaries at the regional councils of the performing arts to which 50% is contributed by the provinces, as well as an amount of R6 500 in respect of Pact&#x2019;s administration costs at the theatre centre on Strydom Square in Pretoria. These are the items which altogether represent the amount of R69 000 under K.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked some questions about subhead M&#x2014;Universities. I think the quickest way in which to reply to this would be for me to break up this item in its different categories. The additional provision which is being asked for here by universities is: subsidy payment, R570 000; establishment aid to the Universities of Port Elizabeth and RAU, R297 100; for the training of marine engineers, a subsidy of R9 600; for the dental faculty at Stellenbosch, a subsidy of R199 300; non-pensionable allowances, R74 000; interest and capital redemption on loans, R1 089 000; nuclear research, R14 500; and housing loans, R451 000. This gives an amount of R2 704 500. As against this there was a decrease in the provision for agricultural faculties to the extent of R5 000 and for the supplementary Public Service bursary scheme of R24 500&#x2014;therefore, a total decrease of R129 500. This gives a total of R2 575 000, minus the savings on services under other subheads, R800 500, which leaves the net additional amount which is now being asked for, i.e. R1 774 000.</p>

<p>I do not know which would be the easiest way in which to answer the other questions. There was a decrease in respect of bursaries, as I have just indicated, of R124 500. The original appropriation was R450 000 and the revised estimate R325 500&#x2014;a decrease of R124 500. I am glad the hon. member asked the question, because an interesting aspect <span class="col_2261-2262" refersTo="page_1147"/>came to light in this respect. These bursaries are for the training of engineers, architects, quantity and land surveyors, doctors, geologists and economists at South African residential universities for Whites.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Are these ordinary Public Service bursaries?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, these bursaries other than the ordinary Public Service bursaries. These are in addition to the ordinary Public Service bursaries. They were introduced in 1970-&#x2019;71. Initially the amount of R60 000 was voted, with a gradual annual increase to R720 000 in 1973-&#x2019;74 and after that R780 000 per annum. Loans can at any time be converted into Public Service bursaries which can then be redeemed on the usual basis by serving the State. For the first three years the bursary loan amounts to R600 per annum and from the fourth year, including post-graduate studies, R650 per annum. But&#x2014;and this is the point I should like to draw attention to, for that reason I am grateful that the hon. member put this question&#x2014;because interest in this scheme seems to be limited interest, only R450 000 was appropriated for 1973-&#x2019;74, 1974-&#x2019;75 and 1975-&#x2019;76. According to applications at the universities for bursary loans for 1975-&#x2019;76, it is expected that R124 500 will not be taken up. And, Sir, I do not know whether this is the proper occasion to appeal to the public. The hon. member says the situation is incredible, but this is after all the position. It is a great pity that this is so, and one can only hope that the position will improve.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Arising out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply I have grave difficulty in understanding that there should be a reduction in the demand for this type of bursaries, because, as he knows, there is a tremendous increase in fees and a tremendous increase in the demand for bursaries at all the universities. Now, what is the reason? Is there a catch in this? Is there some snag? Has it not been publicized? Because it is quite clear that in respect of other bursaries there is a tremendous demand, so much so that the universities cannot meet that demand. Is there something in the conditions which put people off from applying for these bursaries?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>There is no catch in it. It is just a fact, and I do not think it reflects very favourably on our society. I think one reason why it is so is that these students do not want to be bound to work for the State for a specified period. That is the only reason I can think of, together with, perhaps, a lack of knowledge that these bursaries are available, and also a lack of interest in these very major fields. I should like to give the hon. member and the House some figures in this respect.</p>

<p>*Since 1971 provision has been made for the following global grants, and the amounts, as indicated that were taken up by the universities: 1970-&#x2019;71, R60 000, and taken up by the universities, R60 000. In 1971-&#x2019;72, R300 000 was appropriated and R57 670 was taken up. In 1972-&#x2019;73, R441 000 was appropriated and R106 000 was taken up. In 1973-&#x2019;74, R450 000 was appropriated and R235 300 was taken up. In 1974-&#x2019;75, R450 000 was appropriated and R204 000 was taken up, and in 1975-&#x2019;76, R450 000 was appropriated and up to date R249 000 has been taken up. Because I am very interested in this matter, and because, like the hon. member, I also thought this was impossible, I asked how much is expected to be taken up this year. My department estimates that not more than R325 000 of the R450 000 will be taken up. I was going to lay great emphasis on this matter under the main budget, because there is definitely something wrong with this state of affairs.</p>

<p>Then I will try to do it in another way. May I ask the hon. the Minister whether in the additional amount any amount in respect of the financial plight of the universities is included because of the implementation of the formula and their difficulty in reducing the staff numbers to comply with the staff-student ratio. Is there any amount included for that, in these particular figures? This plight is one which has affected a large number of universities and indeed creates a very serious problem. That has a relation to the fact that the fees have had to go up, and if the fees go up you have the situation where you should have more money available for bursaries. If the bursaries are in fact not being used, then you have this hardship in respect of the students, and you have the problem that the ordinary individual can no longer send his child to the university. That is why the bursaries become relevant to this, because you need to promote and publicize this issue. That is why I think this has relevance to the very question I am asking.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we had to give Treasury the assurance that we would not exceed the amount of R1 731 500, as has been appropriated for universities in the Estimates. From the nature of the case we shall assist the universities as much as we possibly can, but we shall have to keep within the limits of the amount of R1 731 500, as appropriated. I told the hon. member at the outset that an additional amount of R570 000 had in fact been appropriated under the subsidy formula. This amount of R570 000 was due to errors of calculation, mainly because full details had not been available while calculating the subsidy formula during the drafting of the original estimates. The increase was requested for the following universities: For Rhodes an increase of R100 879; for Natal, R297 875; and for the Orange Free State R238 185. This gives a total of R636 959.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, under this Vote there is only one item, namely Contributions to Pension and Provident Funds. In this regard R12 780 000 is to be voted. If one takes into account the amount to be met from savings, the original estimates and the revised estimates differ by something like R14 million. I would be glad if the hon. the Minister could give an explanation of the reason for the large amount now required.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are four reasons for the additional amount to be voted. The hon. member will recall that in 1974 the salaries of civil servants were increased. These increases, of course, resulted in higher contributions by the employees as well as by the employer, in this case the State. The greater part of the increase was necessitated by this. It was, however, not possible to determine the exact amount until we had had, for at least two successive years, a recurrent average figure.</p>

<p><span class="col_2265-2266" refersTo="page_1149"/>*The effect of the reclassification of posts in consequence of the Public Service Commission&#x2019;s policy and the permanent appointment of persons who were temporarily employed in the Public Service, was greater than we could have foreseen at the time when the Budget was drawn up. It necessitated additional expenditure.</p>

<p>Provision was also made&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Durban Point will be pleased about this&#x2014;in the course of the year for members of the Defence Force to receive a year&#x2019;s added service for pension purposes after four years&#x2019; service, as in the case of the Police and the Prisons staff. The additional amount required for this, has also been included here. With the establishment of the Bantu Administration Boards, when municipal officers had to become members of the Pension Fund or Associated Institutions, payments had to be made from the municipal pension fund into the Pension Fund for Associated Institutions. It was not possible to determine an amount at that stage, and initially only a nominal amount was voted. It has now become apparent that the amount is R2 300 000 and this is also included in the amount asked for.</p>

<p>The savings which were affected are small amounts under several sub-heads which fall under the Vote.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, over the past year there has been an increase of 12% in the price of paper, for which provision was not made. Then, too, a larger number of questionnaires and reminders had to be printed at a cost of about R7 000. Four questionnaires had to be reprinted to obtain revised information which was considered necessary. This gave rise to an additional expenditure of about R38 000.</p>

<p>In addition, the date of printing of a questionnaire which had to be ready for distribution during July 1976 had to be advanced. This resulted in expenditure of R15 000. According to the original planning those expenses would only have been incurred in the year 1976-&#x2019;77, but fortunately it was possible to advance this date and that is why the additional amount is now being requested. Purchases of paper were carried out in such a way that a saving of R5 000 was possible. That is why the additional amount requested only amounts to R65 000.</p>

The other R7 000 is for the transfer of telephones and for the provision of connecting points for which compensation had to be paid.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have here, particularly in the Loan Vote, a number of new services for which we are being asked to vote funds for the first time today. We have previously protested in the House against this type of budgeting. Here we find that we are suddenly asked to vote hundreds of thousands of rand for new works in respect of which we have no information whatsoever. I am particularly referring to Loan Vote B. It so happens that we have a number of items this year for new schools for the Department of Indian Affairs. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could tell us whether he has, in fact, commenced construction of these schools, how far he has got and whether the Indian community is going to benefit from this expenditure during this financial year. Or is it, once again, a case of asking for an additional amount of R50 simply <span class="col_2267-2268" refersTo="page_1150"/>to get the item on the estimates without any answer regarding the total expenditure or when they will become available.</p>

<p>Then we come to the item dealing with Richards Bay. The way it is set out is not quite clear to me. Does the item &#x201C;Standard Stock Capital&#x201D; of the Loan Vote refer to Richards Bay? Here there is a total expenditure of R400 000. If it does not refer to Richards Bay, what is the R400 000 being asked for? We have under Revenue Vote 20 an additional amount of R190 500 under item E&#x2014;Miscellaneous expenses.

<p>Mr. Chairman, with regard to the question on Indian schools, I am unable to give a general answer in respect of all of them. It would be better if the hon. member would limit his question to a specific item. I could then give him a specific reply on that specific item.</p>

<p>As far as Richards Bay is concerned, the development of the harbour there has now reached the stage where accommodation will have to be provided there for the Departments of Customs and Excise, Health, Industry, the Interior and Transport before 1 April 1976, so that those departments may be able to fulfil their functions within or on the boundaries of the harbour area. The Department of Public Works intended to rent temporary accommodation from the Railways Administration while awaiting a decision on the final layout of the harbour area and the location of permanent buildings, but the Administration stated that it was not able to do that. In view of the time factor, approval was obtained from the State Tender Board to call for quotations from various firms for the erection of temporary, removable, prefabricated buildings on a site which had been provided by the Railways Administration for this purpose. Based on the lowest offer, the cost of the service was estimated at R260 000. No provision for this service was made in the then current Estimates, and a special warrant was therefore obtained. Only a nominal amount was requested, because it is possible to finance the scheme from savings under Loan Vote B for the current financial year. What was the other question of the hon. member?</p>

<p>The authorized stock-up for the Department of Public Works is R1 200 000. Certain items are purchased against the Standard Stock Account and when they are issued, this account is credited and the relevant subheads of the estimates are debited. Orders for certain stock have to be placed well in advance to ensure timeout delivery. Many orders had already been placed when departmental measures were introduced in October 1975 in terms of the action programme to combat inflation and they could not be cancelled. These orders have since been executed and the cost debited to the Standard Stock Account. Expenditure against the relevant subheads of its estimates, however, has been curtailed to such an extent that the Department of Public Works is unable to issue all items like furniture, etc., which other State departments require. The result is that the authorized amount in respect of the Standard Stock Account will be exceeded by the value of stock held on 31 March 1976. Treasury approval has been obtained to increase the capital by R400 000 to enable the department to meet its commitments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I refer to Revenue Vote, subhead J&#x2014;Rent, rates, electrical current, etc. I see that an additional amount of R3 435 000 is required, which is nearly 17% more on items which, because of their very nature, are usually controlled. Rent falls under the Rents Act, rates are controlled and electrical current is something that is controlled too. Perhaps the &#x201C;etc.&#x201D; at the end contains a multitude of sins, but I would like to ask the hon. the Minister why there should be this substantial increase in the cost of rented property and the servicing thereof. My other question applies to subhead K, where an increase of R1 185 000 is required for general maintenance services. This is an increase of nearly 40%, and as such seems out of all bounds. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can throw some light on why there should be this enormous increase in something like maintenance?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with regard to subhead J, I am able to give the following explanation: Firstly, the expiry of existing leases where accommodation was leased at 70 cents per square metre and is now being renewed at R1,75 per square metre. Secondly, the escalation basis at a rate of 5% to 6% annually at which leases were concluded. The increase in rental is a result of the increase in rates. Another reason is that more state-owned buildings are being erected and occupied, as well as additional accommodation which is leased where municipal services are rendered. Lastly, there is the increase of municipal tariffs for water, electricity, sanitation services and removal of refuse&#x2014;in some cases up to 32%. As far as subhead K is concerned, the explanation is briefly as follows: Completion of more state-owned buildings where installations have to be maintained; the increase in prices of material, such as fuel, coal, cleaning material; and, lastly, the modernization of fire-fighting apparatus.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are several items to which I would like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister. The first one is subhead E of Revenue Vote No. 21 where there is an extraordinary increase of something like 100% or more in miscellaneous expenses&#x2014;from R72 000 to R155 000. Miscellaneous expenses is something like a carpet: You sweep those things under it you do not want to have in sight. I would like the hon. the Minister to explain the increase in the expenditure&#x2014;more than double the original estimate in the course of a short period of time. Under subhead F, which is also one of these omnibus headings&#x2014;Losses and other Expenses under Housing and Community Development Legislation&#x2014;we have an increase amounting to 30% of the original figure, an additional amount of R3 060 000. Here again I ask the hon. the Minister to give me details of the expenditure. Under subhead J there is a contribution in respect of subsidies. Experience seems to be that contributions in respect of subsidies are being cut back, at least in the Minister of Community Development&#x2019;s department. Yet there is a substantial additional figure here of R3 272 000, and perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain what it represents.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, subhead J. As far as Loan Vote K is concerned, I wish to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to subhead 4&#x2014;Official Quarters. I do not know what these official quarters are which are to be constructed from the additional R5 500 000 which is being asked for. It is actually R7 million, because there is the saving of R1 500 000 and the additional R5 500 000 required under Loan Vote K. Are these quarters being built in the Transkei, or something of that nature? There seems to be a substantial amount of official quarters being built for his department. This is not a Public Works job.</p>

<p>Finally, subhead 5 under Loan Vote K provides for a contribution to the Deposit Fund for Housing. The amount under this subhead shows an increase of 50%, and I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will explain whether that is in connection with the savings accounts at building societies for deposits on houses and, if so, can he give some indication of the extent to which these are supported and how they have developed in the public sector?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member has put quite a few questions, all concerning very interesting matters. The first one, as he pointed out, seems small, the figure under miscellaneous expenses, subhead E, having increased from R72 000 to R155 000. The chief reason for that is that we had to provide another R65 000 for programming services, an item which is suspended under <span class="col_2271-2272" refersTo="page_1152"/>subhead J of the Vote of the Public Service Commission. This is therefore a bookkeeping item, an adjustment between the two departments. Then additional funds were needed for the hire of photocopying machines, because the hiring cost had increased. Money was also required for the levies we have to pay in respect of our Bantu employees to municipalities. These fees almost doubled and account for a considerable proportion of this money. Additional money also had to be found for class and examination fees for the diploma courses in public administration which public servants follow at the various technical colleges. I think if the hon. member looks at these various items, he will find that it is not such a surprising increase. It is, furthermore, the public interest.</p>

<p>As far as the amount of more than R3 million mentioned under subhead F&#x2014;Losses and other Expenses under Housing and Community Development Legislation&#x2014;is concerned, I wish to point out that it is impossible to estimate correctly under this subhead, especially as far as the loss on interest is concerned, because of the many unknown factors which influence the situation. The increase of R2 900 000 mentioned under &#x201C;Loss of interest&#x2019;&#x2019; can be ascribed to the fact that there was a considerable increase in the interest rate during the past year. Then there was a considerable increase in the number of loans granted at the sub-economic rate of 1%. The provision for valuation expenses and arbitration expenses was also insufficient because everything depends on how many valuations are to be made per year and how many expropriations are to be settled by arbitration. It is impossible to determine what these amounts will be until you approach the end of the year. You cannot determine them accurately in advance.</p>

<p>Under &#x201C;Loss of interest&#x201D;, cannot the loss of interest in respect of the property, valued at R23 million, lying vacant in District Six be included?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think that the two are related in any way whatsoever. The hon. member has also expressed interest in subhead J&#x2014;Contributions and Subsidies. This increase is in respect of the interest subsidy on housing loans. It is impossible to make an accurate estimate of the expenditure under this subhead, because it is not known how many properties will qualify for the interest subsidy in a particular year. At the time when the 1975-&#x2019;76 draft budget was being prepared, the financial implications flowing from the increase of the valuation limit from R18 000 to R20 000 was not foreseen. Also the limit on loans which was increased from R12 000 to R15 000 under this scheme, could not be accurately estimated in advance. That accounts for the difference. Under Loan Vote K the hon. member was interested in item 4&#x2014;Official Quarters.</p>

<p>*The excess is attributable to the following unavoidable factors: Projects which should have been completed during the financial year 1974-&#x2019;75, could not be completed in time, especially as a result of heavy rains and financial problems which were experienced by the building contractors, with the result that payments still had to be made in respect of these projects during the present financial year, something which would not have happened if everything had gone according to the contracts and estimates. The department has no control whatsoever over factors such as these. In terms of a State President&#x2019;s warrant, a newly erected block of flats was bought at R690 000, on the express understanding that transfer and payment would take place before 31 March 1975. For several technical reasons, <i>inter alia,</i> the subdivision of the area, it was not possible to comply with this condition and the sale price, less R34 000 which is still being held back as retention money, had to be paid during the current financial year instead of during last year. This resulted in unforeseen expenditure of R650 000. At the rate of spending during the previous financial year, R4 million was budgeted for project &#x201C;Threshold&#x201D; for the present financial year. This project concerns the construction of homes for Defence Force staff. Due to escalation of hostilities in certain areas, it has become essential for strategic reasons to step up the work on this project drastically and to date, nearly R3 million more than the appropriation has been paid out, with anticipated further spending of approximately R2 million for the months January to March 1976.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I believe, Mr. Chairman, that this is an explanation which the hon. member will <span class="col_2273-2274" refersTo="page_1153"/>immediately accept. The expense was unavoidable and very necessary. I agree that the increase under this item, &#x201C;Deposit Fund for Housing&#x201D;, seems to be a strange item, but once he has heard the explanation I think he will understand.</p>

<p>Certain factors left the department no alternative but to ask for these additional funds. We have tried very hard, in view of circumstances, not to ask for additional funds. On the recommendation of the Riekert Committee the Cabinet agreed that collateral deposits in respect of the housing loan scheme for officials and employees of the State, of statutory bodies and of State-supported bodies would, from 1 December 1975, be increased from 50% to 100% of the guaranteed amount, viz. to 20% of the amount of the loan. Apart from this, building societies may now use 30% of their available funds for loans above R20 000. On these loans the department will also fund the full 20% of the loan amount in cash, rather than by way of guarantee, with the result that the tempo of expenditure has increased considerably. The fact that the State now has to pay the building societies, also causes one to expect that building societies will be more inclined to lend money to officials and employees of the bodies I have mentioned, than was the case originally when they only received 10% of the guaranteed amount in cash. This expectation was expressed by the Riekert Committee. As a result of the factors I have already mentioned, and because of the expenditure during the first eight months of the current year, when only 50% of the guaranteed amounts was paid in cash, it is clear that an excess of R2 million on this Vote was completely unavoidable. It is firstly due to the fact that we have to pay this larger amount in cash, instead of merely as guarantees, and secondly to the growing popularity of this scheme for State employees and officials.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister whether this 20% deposit, which is now paid in cash to the building societies, is paid by way of an interest-earning deposit as far as his department is concerned, and if so, what rate of interest is earned on that money? Is it perhaps an interest-earning deposit, or is it an amount which is paid as additional assistance to the State employee? In other words, is that 20% regarded as an advance from the department to the employee, and are his bond charges then limited to 80% of the total amount of the loan?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as subhead F is concerned, I gave a complete answer to the hon. member for Green Point. It was made quite clear that these moneys are required because of the increase in the rates of interest, and also because of the larger amounts that will be given to people under the rent subsidy, on which only 1% interest is being charged. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the removal of people. Secondly, no provision is being made for additional funds in connection with Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are various questions I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. The first question concerns assistance to the gold <span class="col_2275-2276" refersTo="page_1154"/>mining industry. The total amount is quite substantial. One realizes, of course, that this has to do with the Gold Mines Assistance Act. Before I put my questions, I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that the amounts in question were R11 million, R2,7 million and R3,2 million in the years 1973, 1974 and 1975 respectively. Although the price of the gold produced has dropped again, the price is still substantially higher than it was in 1973 and 1974. I therefore want to know from the hon. the Minister to what this enormous increase may be ascribed. Secondly, under the same subhead, I want to know from the hon. the Minister the value of the gold production of these mines which receive assistance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member referred to the fact&#x2014;and he is therefore aware of it&#x2014;that the real aim of the formula drawn up at the time in co-operation with the Chamber of Mines and the Treasury, was to ensure that certain mines which would have had to cease production, continued to produce. There are a number of reasons for this, such as the earnings of foreign exchange and the maintenance of the industry in general. It is therefore essential that the formula be kept in force. The hon. member wants to know why it is that in spite of the fact that the gold price is higher now than it was then, it is nevertheless still necessary to subsidize these mines. I want to put it to the hon. member that it is not the department itself, but the formula which was laid down, which determines which mines come into consideration for assistance.</p>

<p>At first sight it would seem that certain mines which were able to get along without subsidies some years ago when the gold price was substantially lower, should still be able to do so. The gold price, is, undoubtedly, still substantially higher than it was then. However, some mines are still unable to stand on their own two feet. The reason is simple, but nevertheless very important. The operating costs of mines have rocketed in the meantime and although the gold price is varying between 130 and 140 dollars at the moment, there are always mines that are in a difficult position. The hon. member will probably not expect me to furnish the names of the mines in question. However I can tell him that there are 13 mines which are still being subsidized in terms of the formula and at the present gold price.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>From the document which has been tabled, hon. members will perceive that an additional appropriation of R 15,488 million is requested for operating expenditure. This brings the revised budget for operating expenditure up to R498,101 million.</p>

<p>As a result of the substantial increases in the prices of fuel in December 1974 and again in March and October 1975, as well as the increased railway tariff introduced in November 1974, an additional appropriation of R1,403 million is required for transport under subhead 5. Similarly, increasing prices and higher costs necessitate the additional appropriations of R575 000 and R2 million under subheads 6 and 7.</p>

<p>The additional amount of R1,174 million requested under subhead 11 is required mainly to cover the losses on foreign payments caused by exchange fluctuations, especially as a result of the devaluation of the rand in September last year. The effects of devaluation and further substantial price increases since April last year also necessitate an increase of R4 million, from the existing R23 million to R27 million, in the standard stock capital, which is required for financing the stock spares and materials used for the maintenance and extension of the telephone system. The appropriation under subhead 19 is required for this.</p>

<p>The biggest appropriation for operating expenditure, namely R6,321 million under <span class="col_2277-2278" refersTo="page_1155"/>subhead 16, is required for the payment of interest on investments by the public in the savings facilities of the Post Office. These investments were bigger than had been expected.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In respect of capital expenditure an additional appropriation of R 15,365 million is requested. This will bring the revised estimates for capital expenditure to R228,402 million.</p>

<p>Under subhead 1&#x2014;Telecommunication Services&#x2014;an additional amount of R11,572 million is asked for. Higher prices of equipment, the effect of devaluation, the stepping-up of efforts to reduce the backlog in the provision of telephone services, and works carried over from the previous financial year are the main reasons for the increased expenditure on telecommunications services. Price increases, and the delivery of equipment sooner than expected, necessitate the additional appropriation of R2,193 million under subhead 3. The additional amount of R920 000 under subhead 6 is necessary as a result of various building works progressing more rapidly than expected.</p>

<p>Seen against the background of the Post Office&#x2019;s original estimate of R695,65 million for operating and capital expenditure for the present financial year, the various factors that affected prices and costs since the estimates were drawn up, and the increased interest burden resulting from the additional investment in the Post Office&#x2019;s savings media, I think the essential additional expenditure of R30,853 million, for which appropriation is requested, may be regarded as very reasonable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of the hon. the Minister delivering his first additional appropriation speech, I should like to congratulate him from this side of the House on the new position he has assumed. I hope there will be a very happy period of co-operation between him and this side of the House.</p>

<p>It is probably fortuitous that the amount to be voted for operating expenditure in terms of these additional estimates and that to be voted for capital expenditure are more or the less the same, i.e. approximately R15,4 million. I do not believe that this phenomenon is the result of the fact that 50% of our operating revenue must actually take care of capital expenditure, but it is rather strange that the additional amounts for both capital and operating expenditure are more or less the same. Perhaps the hon. the Minister, in replying to the Second Reading debate, will explain why it is that the figures are so similar. Perhaps there is some reason. On the other hand, this may be completely fortuitous.</p>

<p>The increased expenditure in respect of operating expenditure is approximately 3% higher than the original estimate, but the increased capital now to be voted is 7,2% higher than the original estimate. Since 3% is already high, in relation to a budget of this size, a 7,2% difference in capital amounts originally voted and now found necessary seems to me a very great difference indeed. I think the hon. the Minister must give us some explanation as to why this additional amount is so very much higher.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has not said how he proposes funding this expenditure. I believe, however, that he will apply the same rule as has been applied in respect of the original budget. He will take out of operating revenue approximately R15&#x00BD; million for operating expenditure, and then he will also take from operating revenue 50% of the capital requirements of almost R15,5 million, i.e. R7,7 million. The total amount he will therefore require out of operating revenue will be R23,2 million, and the amount he will then be taking out of Loan Funds I assume will be in the vicinity of R7,7 million. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to enlighten us on this point, because I do think it makes a difference to how we view the future. If he is taking the whole amount out of operating revenue, I wonder whether he can tell us at this stage if his revenue is more buoyant than he thought it was. When I look at the statement of revenue and expenditure for the period April to December of last year, I find that it shows revenue at R404,2 million and expenditure at R345,2 million. The last monthly figures are for December 1975, and they show revenue at R46,2 million and expenditure at R32,3 million. Now if the revenue and expenditure for the months January to March of this year are in the same ratio as for the month of December 1975, the year should end with a total revenue of R542 million and a total expenditure of R442 million, giving the hon. the Minister a rather delightful surplus of <span class="col_2279-2280" refersTo="page_1156"/>R100 million. If it is a fact that there is going to be a surplus of R100 million, then perhaps the hon. the Minister can now tell us whether he is going to use that surplus for the whole of this capital expenditure or whether he is going to borrow the R7,7 million from Loan Funds.</p>

<p>Some of the items in this additional appropriation are quite surprising. One would probably have expected the item &#x201C;Transport&#x201D; to have been higher than it is now. One must, however, bear in mind the fact&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister did not tell us this&#x2014;that transport has been very severely curtailed, and as a result of the curtailing of transport the actual postal delivery service has suffered. In other words, he is now providing a lesser service than the one provided before but it is costing a great deal more. I think the hon. the Minister owes it to the House to explain to us just how he has curtailed the services, what saving has been brought about by the curtailment of the services and what this figure would have been had he not curtailed the services.</p>

<p>Then there is a bit of confusion, I believe, in regard to subhead 7, Material, Stores and Maintenance Service, for which an additional amount of R2 million is to be voted and in regard to subhead 19, Increase of Standard Stock Capital. The latter is a new subhead. The hon. the Minister, in his opening remarks, mentioned that in respect of standard stock capital, there was already an amount of R23 million. However, I did not quite follow&#x2014;the hon. the Minister was too quick for me&#x2014;how he relates this additional R4 million to the R23 million. I think it is necessary for the hon. the Minister to explain to us to what different uses the R4 million under subhead 19 and the R2 million under subhead 7 are to be put. As I see it, the R2 million is in respect of the stock, material and stores required in order to operate, i.e. to keep the telephone services, the telecommunication services and other services going. One must have the necessary material at hand at all times. Therefore, if the stocks run down, they must be replenished. Apparently his stocks in this regard have run down and he is now replenishing them with R2 million. However, an additional R4 million is required in regard to standard stock capital under the new subhead 19. It seems to me that the standard stock capital fulfills more or less the same function. I do not know why it should appear under a separate subhead. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain that to us because it is very confusing. It is very difficult to determine whether the standard stock capital is related in any way to operations and operating expenditure or whether it is regarded as a capital item. If it is to be regarded as a capital item, one wonders why the hon. the Minister has inserted it in the estimates of additional operating expenditure and not in the estimates of additional capital expenditure. There appears to be some reason for it, but unfortunately the hon. the Minister was silent on this when he introduced the additional estimates. We do not know why a distinction is made between subheads 7 and 19. We do need to know what the difference is and why the standard stock capital is shown as operating expenditure and not capital expenditure. If in fact it concerns capital perhaps to be kept for future use, it seems to me that it should not be shown as part of the operating expenditure, but rather under capital expenditure.</p>

<p>There are certain other points I should like to raise. I am not quite clear on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in regard to subhead 1, Telecommunication Services. Does this deal with telecommunication services generally or does this refer to a particular service of the telecommunication services? Does it refer, for instance, to subscribers&#x2019; telephone equipment or does it perhaps refer to electronic exchange equipment? I think we would all be very happy if we knew exactly what it refers to. I think the hon. the Minister did make the point of saying that devaluation had a great effect on the budget. According to information I and other members on this side of the House have, devaluation has not really shown its effect yet on the equipment that is being used at present. I take it that this additional expenditure refers to equipment that is already in use and has already been purchased and is not to make provision for the future. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will explain just how devaluation has in fact affected telecommunication services other than in respect of goods still to be imported from abroad. I am under the impression that a great deal of our telephone subscribers&#x2019; equipment is actually manufactured here in South Africa. Consequently, devaluation will only have a very small effect on that sort of equipment because the parts that have to be imported form only a very small component of the telephone subscribers&#x2019; equipment.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister rather glossed over <span class="col_2281-2282" refersTo="page_1157"/>subhead 3, Office, Electronic Data Processing, Mail Handling and Stores Equipment, under capital expenditure, in respect of which an amount of just over R2 million is to be voted. When I saw this figure I thought it referred more particularly to mail handling. We now have a system of expeditious mail handling in Cape Town and I believe another one is being installed or has just been installed in Johannesburg. I thought the sum to be voted was in connection with those systems, but apparently it may be in respect of something else. I would be very grateful if the hon. the Minister would explain that to us.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister made a great deal of the price increases. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us in reply to this debate what effect price increases have had. Just the bald statement of fact that we are subject to price increases is not very illuminating. I believe we should be told just how price increases have affected us, what price increases there have been, when the prices were increased and whether we planned for such price increases. Did we budget on the basis that all prices would remain static during the year or did we take into account the fact that there would be price increases? I would be very grateful indeed if the hon. the Minister would enlighten us in regard to these matters.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on these benches would also like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his assumption of this very important portfolio. One sometimes wonders whether one should not commiserate with him rather than congratulate him. I say that because the hon. the Minister and his advisers have inherited a situation from the past which means that they are battling against tremendous odds because of a good deal of political myopia that existed in the past. I am now talking about a decade or more ago. Anyway, we wish him well. He is in a hot seat and there are few tasks that are more important than the task he has today to give this country the telecommunication service it needs.</p>

<p>While we are voting this money today, I think it is only fair to say something about the incredible achievements of the Post Office in the past 12 months. We know about the criticism of the Post Office and I shall deal with one or two criticisms in a moment. However, I think too little is known by the public of the really magnificent work which is being done by the Post Office in certain fields. I refer particularly to such things as the earth satellite station. I do not think people realize the extent of the Post Office&#x2019;s contribution to television. I think that the Post Office&#x2019;s contribution is not generally appreciated. Anyone who has read the annual report of the Postmaster-General will realize that the Post Office&#x2019;s contribution was a very vital one. I think the Postmaster-General and the hon. the Minister, as the political head, deserve credit for the work they have done. Unfortunately, the man in the street and the woman in the home particularly look at the Post Office primarily from two angles: One is the quality of the telephone services and the other the quality of postal deliveries. I want to raise this question briefly and not waste too much time of the House. I think it is the quality of the telephone services in the bigger centres that is exasperating people at present: The failure to get a dialling tone, the frequency of wrong numbers, the deafening silences, etc. The lack of telephones is bad, but it is too often the quality that falls short of what the public expects. I am sure that the Postmaster-General and his staff would like to provide a better quality service. I hope the hon. the Minister when he replies to this debate, will try to explain to us and therefore to the public outside, why there is such a difference between the quality of the international telephone service and the domestic service. I think it has been the experience of lots of hon. members that it is much easier to get through to Toronto than it is to get through to Taaibosspruit.</p>

<p>In any case, we should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether any of the money we are voting today is in fact going to be used to alleviate the desperate shortage of telephones in the Black areas. In reply to a question I asked the other day, the hon. the Minister told us &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the hon. members who have taken part in this debate for their congratulatory messages. The hon. member for Parktown was doubtful as to whether congratulations or sympathy should be conveyed. In any event, this attests to sympathy as regards my task, and I should like to thank them sincerely. I believe that we shall cooperate well with each other.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure, but I interpret the fact that the hon. member for Wynberg spoke here this afternoon as an indication that he is acting as the chief spokesman for his side.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then it was purely fortuitous. I had intended to congratulate him, too, if he had been appointed as the chief spokesman of his party. The hon. member asked a number of questions to which I shall attempt to reply to the best of my ability. To begin with, he said that it had struck him that the amounts required on the operating side and on the capital side were almost the same, and asked whether there was any explanation for that. I do not know whether he thought that perhaps there had been manipulation, but I can tell him that it is purely coincidental that this should have occurred. When we discuss the individual items at a later stage, it will be clear to him that we can motivate all these points. But it is purely a coincidence that the amounts are much the same. He then went on and, in his own way, calculated the expected revenue of the Post Office. In fact, he painted a fairly rosy picture, and I hope that his fortune-telling is as good as his efforts at fishing here this afternoon. I can tell him that the revenue of the Post Office is quite promising, but it goes without saying that I do not want to anticipate my Budget and consequently I do not want to react to the figures he mentioned here.</p>

<p>He asked how we were going to finance the additional expenditures. I want to tell him that the promising revenue of which we have had indications thus far will assist us to a very great extent in financing them, and for the rest we shall, of course, adopt other methods as experience leads us. The hon. member also referred to subheads 7 and 19, and to subhead 19 in particular, which relates to standard stock capital. In the first place he asked whether this belonged under &#x201C;operating&#x201D; or under &#x201C;capital&#x201D;. I want to tell him that as far as that aspect is concerned, it is ruling by the Auditor-General that it must fall under the operating side. We therefore have no choice in the matter. To deal with the facts as regards these two subheads, I want to put it to him as follows, that the standard stock capital of the post office amounts to R23 million at present; in other words, in the past. Parliament has voted R23 million for this stock. Owing to the increases that have occurred and the withdrawals from this pool, if I may call it that, it is necessary to supplement those funds, because I want to tell you that no fewer than 23 000 different catalogue items of spare parts are provided from that fund or pool. These are stocks which the Post Office must have in store in order to maintain its services. The hon. member must also take into account that in our telecommunications network we make use of a number of systems&#x2014;some are already quite old and others reasonably modem&#x2014;and that we are at a transitional stage, as he well knows. However, this requires of the Post Office that it be capable of supplying all requirements from the standard stock capital. To be able to do this, we decided to request Parliament to vote an additional amount of R4 million for this purpose, and to increase the R23 million to R27 million to enable us to supplement what must be supplemented and in addition, to be able to reckon with increased expenses and other increases which have taken place.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Why, then, is it a new subhead?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a new subhead in the Budget before us, but in the main budget of the Post Office, of course, it is not a new subhead. As I said, R24 million had already been budgeted previously. In the previous budget this fell away since there was no increase in the amount requested. We now want to increase the amount and that is why we are <span class="col_2285-2286" refersTo="page_1159"/>bringing this subhead back. It is therefore a new subhead in the sense that it did not appear in last year&#x2019;s main budget, but if one looks at Post Office budgets in previous years, one will note that it is not a new subhead.</p>

<p>I now come to the connection between subhead 19 and subhead 7. In the case of subhead 7, the main components of expenditure are general stores, viz. stores which are purchased from the standard supply pool, if I may call it that. Specific requirements may develop in a specific region. The spare parts required have then to be purchased from the central pool in order that the service may be provided. This relates to material and spare parts for the maintenance of the telephone network and the carrying out of smaller jobs to the value of not more than R1 000. This is the only connection between the two matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked how we compiled our budget. He wanted to know whether we took increases into account. It would be an unwise financial policy for the Post Office not to take into account a possible escalation of prices. The hon. member knows that in his personal requirements, his personal budget, he does not always find it possible to make exact estimates which correspond to the actual increases which may occur later. The same applies with regard to the effect of devaluation. I have already replied to questions by the hon. member for Constantia in the course of this session and furnished figures relating to the additional funds required as a result of devaluation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown referred to the achievements of the Post Office and I am very grateful for that. It is true that there is in fact a great deal for which we can be grateful and about which we have a right to be proud. However, he complained about the quality of the telephone service. He asked how it was possible that our international telephone service was better than our internal service. I want to explain this to him. I do not know whether this is the full explanation, but our international service has of course been modernized in the sense that we have a modem cable at our disposal. Furthermore, the satellite earth station was inaugurated recently&#x2014;the hon. member attended the inauguration. The cable and the satellite connections, of course, make it possible to provide a good international service. As far as the interior is concerned, as I have said, we have various systems which have been introduced over the years, systems which were very suitable and sound in their time, systems which still function reasonably well today and, in some cases, still function well and give reasonably satisfactory service.</p>

<p>If one wants to look at the overall picture, one will note that on the Witwatersrand, where widespread floods occurred this year, serious interruptions occurred for shorter periods and to a lesser extent. The reason for this is that the Post Office has introduced a system of preventive maintenance. It is one of the achievements of the Post Office and its technicians that in terms of the policy it is now following, it has already achieved so much success with preventive maintenance at this stage. This is a problem which we shall probably still have to live with for quite some time, but seen in general terms, and taking into account the overall picture, we shall see that substantial progress has been made.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the &#x2018;&#x2018;desperate need for telephones&#x201D; in the Bantu residential areas. We must, of course, take into account an increasing demand which will develop in the Bantu residential areas and which, to a lesser extent, already exists. I do not know whether the need is as great as the hon. member stated here. I replied to questions in the course of the present session and in my replies I furnished figures indicating that the demand was not yet so great.</p>

<p>Then, too, there is the fact that one must determine priorities. Both the hon. member for Bryanston and the hon. member for Sandton put questions and are very concerned about the telephone situation in their fast-developing areas. If one were to ask them to which area they would give precedence and whether they would prefer the telephone requirements of Bryanston and Sandton or those of the Bantu residential areas to be met first, then I think they would probably have a very difficult task. I think the hon. member for Orange Grove is right. We must try to meet the telephone requirements of all areas. This is a service which we must make available wherever there is a demand. However, the question is how one is to do this and at what rate it can be done with the means at one&#x2019;s disposal. I think that I have now replied to all questions.</p>

<summary>(The proposed development of Sandy Bay before the guide-plan for the Greater Cape Peninsula is completed.)</summary>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move, pursuant to Standing Order No. 24&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House do now adjourn.</block>

<p>I take the opportunity of invoking Standing Order No. 24 to raise the subject of the proposed development of Sandy Bay before the guide-plan for the Greater Peninsula is completed for two reasons. One reason is that I have an interest in this as I am the member of Parliament for the constituency in which Sandy Bay is located. I also represent the urban community of Sea Point which today is suffering as a result of social problems created by short-sighted planning in the years that went before. I chose today because it is the date on which the Administrator of the Cape said a final decision should be made in respect of the Sandy Bay development.</p>

<p>I am aware that the mere name of Sandy Bay arouses different mental pictures in the minds of different people who have not been to Sandy Bay. There are the township developers who see this in terms of houses and apartments rising up the cliff-side and ending up with hotels, clubs, funiculars and tourists. There are others who see secret sessions of the Cape Divisional Council deciding on what should be done. Others will see it in the form of student protests and the protests of environmentalists. Others will recall the satirical and humorous cartoons of the late David Marais.</p>

<p>I am sure there are others, even in this House, who will associate Sandy Bay, most unfortunately, with nudism. This has undoubtedly aroused a considerable interest on the part of the public; in the Cape and around the country this has been reflected in the Press. Nearly all the national newspapers have dealt with the issue of the development of Sandy Bay. In the Cape <i>The Cape Times, The Argus</i> and <i>Die Burger</i> have all given extensive editorial and news coverage to this development. I cannot believe that this is centred on the issue of nudism. The editor of <i>The Cape Times</i> is a keen surfer, but no nudist. Mr. Wally McKenzie, the editor of <i>The Argus,</i> with his Scots and Orange Free State background, is hardly going to take to nudists cavorting on beaches. I think of that pillar of the Cape Nationalist establishment, Mr. Piet Cilli&#x00E9; of <i>Die Burger,</i> who received his &#x201C;erepenning&#x201D; for good services to the party from the Minister of Defence last year. I can hardly believe that Mr. Piet Cilli&#x00E9; is now going to be accused of having gone soft on nudism.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why this has attracted public attention and why it is important. One has to do with Sandy Bay and the other has to do with the mood of people towards the issue of the protection of their natural heritage. I would like to deal with these two very briefly. Firstly, Sandy Bay is unique. It is unique in that here we have a magnificent, secluded natural amphitheatre with the unspoilt slopes, which form one of the edges of the Table Mountain massif, sweeping down towards an unpolluted coast with, in turn, rock and sand and sea combining to provide a perfect natural habitat for a rich variety of marine life. That is the scene, that is Sandy Bay and its environment as it exists today. It is unique because it is the only part of the Table Mountain massif that reaches all the way down to the sea unencumbered by existing or future commercial development. Add to this that it is located within 20 kilometers of the central business district of South Africa&#x2019;s oldest city, a city of a population of one million inhabitants, to grow to two million inhabitants within the next 25 years, and one realizes that one has to do with a situation which is not only unique in itself as a piece of natural beauty, but unique in its relationship to the future urban development of the metropolitan Cape Town. Because of this, because of its uniqueness and because of the uniqueness of the opportunity it provides, I believe that everything should be done, particularly by the Ministry of Planning, in terms of environment and in the field of planning and priorities, to see that this important piece of the South African natural heritage is not going to be cut up by bulldozers and, eventually, covered by brick, tarmac and concrete. This is the first reason why it is important.</p>

<p>The second reason is the attitude of the people. There is no doubt that the people of South Africa are changing in their attitude towards the preservation of our natural, historical and cultural heritage. There is a big move in this direction amongst all people in <span class="col_2289-2290" refersTo="page_1161"/>this country and in all parts of society. This is a new mood, and it is reflected in the brochure which was issued by the Department of Planning in 1973. I refer to the foreword by Mr. J. J. Loots, the present Speaker and former Minister of Planning, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The sudden awakening of public concern about man&#x2019;s relationship with his environment is undoubtedly one of the most striking developments of our era.</block>

<p>This is a recognition that there is a new mood in relation to the protection of our environment. The case of Sandy Bay, because it is associated with the question of environmental control and preservation and with the question of urban planning, has aroused the interest, very largely of younger people, but also of older people who are concerned with the whole question of man in his habitat, whether natural or developed. It has aroused widespread public interest and it has caused organizations of a wide variety to make representations. I shall mention but a few. There is the Hout Bay/Llandudno Ratepayers&#x2019; Association, which has made its representations to the Cape Provincial Administration on the basis that any development which affects our natural heritage of mountain and coast should first be preceded by a careful survey of resources available. The South African Institute for Town and Regional Planners has gone to considerable expense and has spent much time in preparing memoranda on this issue. The South African Institute for Architects refused to take part in a competition for the development of this area, because they found that the very concept of the development of that area offended against their approach to urban planning and the preservation of the natural environment. We have the Council for Habitat, a very prestigious organization, link ing together some 50 organizations concerned with the environment, with development and with planning, which has co-ordinated the opposition to this scheme and which has made representations both to the hon. the Minister and to the Administrator of the Cape. I would like to believe that the Government shares the concern of all these organizations for the preservation of places of scenic beauty, and sees this as a question of the natural environment in relation to urban planning. I quote once again from this preface by the hon. the Minister of Planning and the Environment, when he said in 1973&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our philosophy of environmental conservation covers a broad spectrum which embraces not only the prevention of pollution in all its forms, but also the optimum utilization and safeguarding of the country&#x2019;s valuable resources, including our natural fauna and flora. Planning should not only be aimed at a maximum of material and social progress; it should also be tempered and balanced by healthy concern for the conservation of our habitat.</block>

<p>This was the philosophy of the Department of Planning as expressed by the hon. gentleman who is now the Speaker of this House. In all these circumstances, I believe that in the case of Sandy Bay and its projected development, the Central Government, being the custodian of national planning, of the protection of our environment and of our natural heritage, has a very special role to play. The objectives of the Department of Planning were set out in the planning and environmental brochure of 1973. Added to its general objectives, it has special powers and responsibilities, which have been given to it by this House. In 1967 we had the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Act and last year the hon. the Minister asked for amendments to this Planning Act. He changed the name to the Environment Planning Act, and it is an Act under which he could operate in relation to the development of Sandy Bay, firstly under section 5 of the Act, which allows the State President to declare controlled areas. Once an area has been declared a controlled area there can be no sub-division or further development without the approval of the Minister of Planning and the Environment. Secondly, last year the hon. the Minister asked us to include in the Environment Planning Act a special provision, Section 6A, setting up guide plans. He indicated to us that there had been guide-plans of an informal nature before. He said that committees had been set up since 1971 and then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many of the committees have been appointed and the guide plans for a number of areas have been completed and released. In certain respects these plans are vague and have no legal status. At the instigation of the <span class="col_2291-2292" refersTo="page_1162"/>provinces and other bodies, it has been decided that the time has now arrived for provision to be made for the compiling of statutory guide-plans which will be binding on the Government and on the general public.</block>

<p>So, the hon. the Minister came to the House for specific authority to set up statutory guide-plans. We now have a situation in the Cape where the hon. the Minister has set up a guide-plan committee, which produced its first report in November 1975. It is a hopeful report, but it is essentially a collection of data and information and it does not do much in the way of forward planning. I think the hon. the Minister realizes that it is necessary to take this guide-plan, and from the existing position set out in it to develop a plan for the future. On two occasions the hon. the Minister, in reply to questions I put to him during question time, said that there was a guide-plan committee. He stressed the need that work had to continue and he stressed the fact that he would consult with the Administrator of the Cape in the interim period should there be any apparent conflict between his department, which was responsible for preparing the guide-plan, and the views of the administration, which would be responsible for giving authority for the proclamation of a township.</p>

<p>Now circumstances have arisen that the hon. the Minister has said that there must be a guide-plan for the coastal areas of the Cape Peninsula. He said we already had report No. 1 but not a final or detailed report relating to matters like Sandy Bay. I believe that in these circumstances the hon. the Minister must step in to steer the whole argument about Sandy Bay away from nudism&#x2014;which, I think is irrelevant to the central theme&#x2014;and to take it away from the party political arena. He must particularly see that there is no mutilation of the area and that no damage is done to this unique and sensitive bit of natural scenery in the Cape Peninsula until the proposed developments can be assessed for desirability and for need against the guide plan for the coastline of the Cape Peninsula.</p>

<p>There are two major considerations why the hon. the Minister should act. The first is for reasons of environmental conservation. The area is unique. It is the terminal of the Table Mountain massif in the south-western area. It is a unique combination of mountain, shore and sea in an unspoilt condition. It has a sensitive ecological balance, and I think the hon. the Minister is aware of this. Reference is made to the ecological balance in the report of the Cape Metropolitan Guide-Plan Committee, wit is an area which is set out in the present guide plan partly as an existing open space on the lower reaches and in the upper areas where the slopes are more than one in three, it is earmarked as a possible open space. Every effort should be made to see that this area is kept in its natural state, to maintain it, if need be as a wilderness area, a place for outdoor living where there can be walking trails, climbs and marine exploration. The Sandy Bay area together with Karbonkelberg and the forward slopes going around to the harbour at Hout Bay provides an area which is large enough to be proclaimed as a wilderness area under the Department of Forestry. It must be steered away from nudism but also away from commercialism, away from apartments, away from plastic living. There must be tourists there, but not the fat cats who jet in and out of South Africa from one five-star hotel to the other, who demand to see our splendid scenery from air-conditioned buses, but tourists consisting of local and foreign citizens who want to escape from the claustrophobic environment of modem urban living and who want to enjoy some of the peace of outdoor living in an environment of nature.</p>

<p>Secondly I believe that every effort must be made to hold up this development in the interest of sound urban and regional planning. I do not want to criticize the development in detail because if you want to have development of that kind it may be adequate. But this is a development for placing on 283 ha, 2 100 housing units&#x2014;a population in size roughly the size of Fish Hoek. It is going to create problems. There is, first of all, no priority need for it. There are 40 000 erven vacant and available for White ownership in the Cape Peninsula. This is mentioned in the Guide-Plan Report. There is no need to add to this at this stage. Secondly, there are already up to 2 000 coastal erven in the area from Camps Bay through to Oudekraal, Llandudno and Hout Bay. Thirdly, it is away from areas of employment and it is off the main access of transportation and is going to increase both the commuter population and the motor-car numbers and with that it is going to have concomitant effects on the cost of the services in <span class="col_2293-2294" refersTo="page_1163"/>that area. Finally there is the question of priorities. Because of the topography the geological formation and the location and the effect these will have on costs, this will be a very costly development. It will only be used or occupied beneficially by people of the higher-income group. This is a time when we are cutting back expenditure on Coloured housing in the Cape Peninsula. If reports are correct, housing for lower-income group Coloured people has been cut back from R38 million to R15 million, and yet in the same week it may well be that the Government will give the green light to the start of a housing project costing R80 million for higher-income group people in an area in which it is not really required. We ought to get our priorities right. In the field of priorities, in the field of urban planning and in the field of environmental conservation, Sandy Bay has become a test of this Government&#x2019;s earnestness.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the request to investigate the possibility of proclaiming Sandy Bay a nature and recreation area and protect it, was debated in the provincial council as far back as two years ago&#x2014;in May 1974, to be exact. Members of the United Party raised the matter, in particular the leader of the United Party, Mr. Cyril Brett, and also Mr. Kent Durr and Miss Annette Reinecke. This matter, therefore, is one which has been under consideration for some time, and I am pleased that the hon. member for Sea Point is also associating himself with this important matter now. Right at the outset I want to say that these pleas have nothing to do with nudists. In the past, nudists have been used as a smokescreen by means of which to evade a difficult decision. There are laws of the land under which action can be taken against nudists. The protection of our coastline against township development and over-commercialization is being advocated by conscientious scientists and also by their associations. The hon. member for Sea Point has already mentioned that the council for the Habitat has made representations, and it represents a number of other associations. The chairman of their Sandy Bay Advisory Committee is Dr. A. V. Hall, a botanist at the University of Cape Town. They strongly recommended that this area be protected. The Association for the Protection of the Environment at Stellenbosch, under the chairmanship of Dr. R. C. Bigalke, also made representations. He is a professor of nature conservation at the University of Stellenbosch. These representations, therefore, do not emanate from eccentric individualists who want to promote their particular eccentricity, but from thinking, balanced scientists and from the public as a whole, too. A number of representations have been made by various organizations, <i>inter alia</i> the Cape Institute of Town Planners. Architects, too, submitted objections, as did the taxpayers of Camps Bay, and there were about 2 000 people who were willing to give money and make donations to purchase this area. Consequently these are not people who run around with a desire to display themselves there, but people with an inherent interest in our country and its flora, and in nature conservation.</p>

<p>To me this looks like a confrontation between the Cape Provincial Administration and the Government on the one hand, and citizens of South Africa who are true nature lovers and who appreciate our country as it originally was, on the other. It is in the interests of posterity that this exceptionally beautiful area be protected. Sandy Bay falls within the Cape fynbos area, one of the six best-known botanical regions in the world. This Cape floral kingdom attracts botanists from throughout the world to come and study plants here. It is estimated that the size of this region has already dwindled by about 60% as a result of the activities of man&#x2014;ploughed lands, roads and townships development. Where such regions still remain I think it is in the interests of the country that they be preserved. It is known that plants in this region occur in very limited areas. There is the well-known case of the blushing brides, which have almost been exterminated in the Franschhoek Valley by afforestation. The same applies to certain varieties of erica in the Simonstown area which only occur on one hectare. This species has also been threatened by afforestation. I also have in mind the meadow-sweet, which grows high up on the mountains and which is very vulnerable and easily destroyed. If one disturbs this delicate ecology by irresponsible township development before a proper ecological survey has been carried out, I really think that we are not acting in the interests of South Africa. Sandy Bay is a particularly pleasant beach. It is surrounded by the Karbonkelberg and the <span class="col_2295-2296" refersTo="page_1164"/>great amphitheatre. It is unique in that it is as yet undeveloped and is still within easy reach of Cape Town.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the time at my disposal is very limited, and hon. members will therefore understand that I shall not be able to reply to all their questions. I shall reply to the remaining questions with pleasure when the Vote comes under discussion later on. To begin with I want to say at once that it is actually a pity that the debate on Sandy Bay&#x2014;which has been going on for some time now&#x2014;has gone as it has.</p>

<p>As an outsider in this matter, but as a person who is nevertheless aware of the correspondence and the people involved here, I sometimes get the impression that we are dealing here with the battle between the nudes and the prudes. There are those who want to see the region developed, and there is the other group which opposes the proposed development. It would appear that each group regards the other as bad. The nudists and those who are opposed to the development of the area, are accused of harbouring evil motives in this regard.</p>

<p>As far as the department is concerned, we welcome the interest of all people who have the conservation of our nature and our cultural heritage at heart. I should like to convey my appreciation and that of my department to those people who have played a part in this matter in an honest way. We are grateful for people who are honest in their dealings.</p>

<p>I believe that we shall also have to take into account the fact that if our intentions are sincere, we should not ascribe different intentions to other people whose opinions differ from ours. Unfortunately I have noticed recently&#x2014;I refer to this merely in passing&#x2014;that such things have in fact occurred. That is why I am putting it clearly&#x2014;and I am speaking on behalf of my department, too&#x2014;that I dissociate myself in the strongest possible terms from any suggestion or insinuation made by individuals in respect of the Administrator of the Cape and members of his Executive Committee, insinuations which amount to their having acted negligently, to their having ridden roughshod over the wishes of people and taken no notice of the representations addressed to them. I have been into the matter thoroughly, and I want to state clearly that the Administrator and the Executive Committee, and the Divisional Council, too, gave their due attention to this matter and that they acted with the greatest responsibility. However, people may differ from the conclusion which they reached. Allegations to the effect that certain people or bodies had allegedly been favoured, is something my department dissociates itself from entirely.</p>

<p>I find it a pity that the hon. member who introduced the motion advanced an argument which, in my opinion, was worthy neither of him nor of the rest of his speech. He argued that this was a case of &#x201C;providing for the rich at the expense of the poor&#x201D;. That is not true. Nor, it is certain, did the Administrator and his Executive Committee view the matter in that light when they considered it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I state on behalf of the Council for the Habitat, a body which is subsidized by this Government, that the members of that Council, too, dissociate themselves from the insinuations made and the kind of action taken recently. I believe that all members of this House will agree with me&#x2014;and I do not say this merely in order to sound pious&#x2014;that they cannot associate themselves with the methods adopted by certain opponents of the development of Sandy Bay, about which there have been reports in <i>Die Burger.</i> I investigated the accuracy of those reports, and I am satisfied that they are correct. According to these reports, after certain concessions had been made by the Administration, a meeting nevertheless took place, attended about 1 000 naked people at which, <i>inter alia,</i> a decision was taken to boycott the owners of the land&#x2014;who happen to be a commercial undertaking. I hope I have the approval of everyone in this House to say that methods of that kind&#x2014;whoever adopts them&#x2014;are unacceptable. A person who uses such arguments to state his case, can only come off second best. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mention has been made here of affiliated bodies. I want to say that the Council for the Habitat does good work, and I hope they will continue to do so. I also want to point out to hon. members that you can assist the Council for the Habitat&#x2014;particularly in future, if such a case should occur again&#x2014;by joining it or becoming affiliated as members of the Council for the Habitat. I feel it to be my duty to point out that allegations such as those made <span class="col_2297-2298" refersTo="page_1165"/>recently in a newspaper&#x2014;that the Council for the Habitat made its representations with the full support of all its affiliated bodies&#x2014;were untrue and misleading. In the execution of my duties it was necessary for me to check whether this report was correct or not. I do not want to mention the newspaper in question by name, because I believe that the people who wrote that meant it sincerely. However, I regard it as my duty to point out that there were misleading reports. It was mentioned that the Vrouelandbou-unie was an affiliated member of the Council of the Habitat, and associated itself with the appeals made. The Vrouelandbou-unie gave me the right to say here that it dissociated itself entirely from the representations. Quite apart from the merits of the case, the matter has nothing to do with the Vrouelandbou-unie. The mouthpiece of the South African Agricultural Union said the same thing. The Voortrekker movement, which was also mentioned by the newspaper, stated that it dissociated itself entirely from the representations. The Automobile Association not only dissociated itself from the representations, but added: &#x201C;We have said to them in writing that we do not want to be associated with this type of thing.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, is all this relevant? It was mentioned by the hon. member for Sea Point. When he introduced this motion, he said that the Habitat Council was being supported by the affiliated organizations. I say that all the organizations that were mentioned, dissociated themselves from the representations lodged by the Council of the Habitat. I now want to get back to the merits of the case.</p>

<p>*I just want to say this: As far as this department is concerned, everything will be done to allow only proper development there, development which will afford the protection requested as far as possible. Everything will be done to preserve the amphitheatre, the scenery and other things worthy of preservation there as far as possible, and even, where possible, to improve them. Consequently, certain decisions have already been taken and there is a continual process of consultation, between my department and the Administration as well, to ensure that no disfigurement of the environment occurs. However, disfigurement of the environment is taking place at the moment. I have no wish to be crude about it, but I do want to ask this: Do you regard the provision of certain facilities as important or not? We must at least provide certain facilities.</p>

<p>Would you believe me, Sir, if I were to say&#x2014;and I say it on acceptable authority&#x2014;that the vegetation there is being destroyed and that the lack of public facilities is giving rise to a situation there which no decent person could feel happy about?</p>

<p>&#x2020;I do not say this to belittle the hon. member who moved this motion. I agree with so much of what he said, but if civilized people feel that they even have to provide facilities for their dogs in a certain constituency, I think we must at least provide facilities for people at Sandy Bay too. I can assure the hon. member that these things can also get out of hand, as it did in fact happen at Sandy Bay. There are certain conditions there with which no decent civilized person can ever associate himself.</p>

<p>*We shall continue to negotiate with the Administration to the best of our ability, and to ensure that the things which the hon. member asks for, things with which I agree, will be preserved. I want to assure the hon. House that this department&#x2014;although it has no statutory powers to do so, and although at this stage, when the guide plan has not yet been completed, it does not have the statutory power to stop certain things happening there either will as far as possible see to it that this development is carried out as well as possible to the satisfaction of all people of South Africa, and bearing in mind the preservation of our fine heritage. I give that assurance to hon. members and to the hon. member who introduced this motion. I hope, too, that the heat will go out of this argument, and that we shall be able to go ahead in a sober way to ensure that what is to be allowed there will be of such a nature that everyone will derive satisfaction from it.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister in replying to the Second Reading debate did not give a very clear explanation of why the increase of standard stock capital appears under a new subhead, viz. subhead 19, as operating expenditure in the estimates of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. The explanation the hon. the Minister gave was that the Controller and Auditor-General said that that was the place where this should figure. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister: If he were to look at the balance sheet of the Post Office, he will notice that there is a reserve for standard stock, shown as capital employed in the balance sheet, and that there is also an item under the employment of capital in the balance sheet, viz. standard stock. The hon. the Minister told us yesterday that this figure was R23 million, that that was the reserve. It is not clear to me, and I do not think that it is clear to other members on this side of the House, whether this increase of standard stock capital is an increase of the reserve or whether it is actually an increase in regard to standard stock. In either event, whether it is an increase in the reserve or whether it is an increase in the standard stock, it is reflected in the balance sheet as a capital item. It would seem to me that if it is reflected in the balance sheet as a capital item, there must be a very good reason for now showing it in schedule No. 1 as operating expenditure.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said in his explanation in regard to this standard stock capital, when I asked what the exact difference was between standard stock capital of R4 million and the material, stores and maintenance services of R2 million, also shown as operating expenditure, that they were in fact the same thing. I do not have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s exact words before me, but my recollection is that the Minister said in regard to subhead 7&#x2014;material, stores and maintenance services&#x2014;that those were stores required in the operation of the Post Office&#x2019;s telecommunication and other services. In regard to the increase of standard stock capital, he gave exactly the same explanation. It would seem to me that there must be a vast difference. I do not believe that subhead 7 as operating expenditure&#x2014;material, stores and maintenance services&#x2014;can be the same as the increase in standard stock capital. For that reason it appears to me that these have very different uses and that subhead 7&#x2014;material, stores and maintenance services&#x2014;is in fact regarded as an item which is to be used in regard to the operations of the department, whereas the standard stock capital is regarded as a stock item of a capital nature from which items can be drawn from time to time for use under subhead 7. The matter is rather more confused now than before the Minister gave his reply because of the reply he gave, viz. that both were to be used for the same purpose. It seems hardly likely that this is a correct explanation. That leads me to the following point. If in fact there is a difference&#x2014;which I believe there should be&#x2014;between these two items, viz. that material, stores and maintenance services require items for operating and that standard stock capital is rather long-term stock which is maintained for a longer period than is required in the material, stores and maintenance services, then that stock which is kept for a lengthy period should surely be stock of a capital nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it should not appear under operating expenditure at all. It should appear under capital expenditure. I believe that my argument is correct because, if the hon. the Minister is correct in saying that the Controller and Auditor-General says that this must be shown as operating expenditure&#x2014;I refer now to subhead 19, Increase of Standard Stock Capital, R4 million&#x2014;it seems to me quite incongruous that, in drawing up the balance sheet, the Acting Controller and Auditor-General <span class="col_2301-2302" refersTo="page_1167"/>approved of a balance sheet which shows this item as a capital item in the balance sheet as at 31 March 1975. We find that on page 20 of the report of the Controller and Auditor-General.</p>

<p>I do believe that there is some simple explanation, but it makes a big difference. If I am correct and the hon. the Minister is wrong, then of course it is a capital item, and then operating expenditure is not going to contribute the whole of this amount of R4 million, but only approximately 50% of it. In other words, the other 50% will be contributed by loan funds. This will make quite a difference to the running of the department and it will make a great difference to the sort of tariffs that he is going to revise, probably with the introduction of his new budget. I believe that it is most important that we should have this position cleared up this afternoon as to where in fact this item resides. Should it be a capital item shown on the balance sheet as capital and should only half of the item then be funded by way of operating expenditure?</p>

<p>I believe that, when the balance sheet for 1976 is drawn, this item presently shown in the balance sheet as reserve for standard stock, will not be shown as R23 million, but will in fact be shown as R27 million. I believe that is what the hon. the Minister said yesterday. He said that we already had R23 million, and that we were adding to it. The only way one can add to it, is by adding capital to capital. One cannot add income to capital.</p>

<p>I believe therefore that my argument is correct, and that, when this balance sheet is drawn next year, we shall see that the reserve for standard stock has been increased from R23 million to R27 million. We shall probably also see that the item on the other side of the balance sheet&#x2014;the employment of capital&#x2014;which in the present balance sheet provides for standard stock of R21 086 743, will be an increased figure as well, bearing in mind the increase of R4 million. I would be very glad indeed if the hon. the Minister would explain exactly what we can expect in regard to this and how this is going to affect the operating expenditure and the operation of the department as a whole.</p>

<p>There were a few other matters to which the hon. the Minister did not reply, matters raised by me during the Second Reading debate. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister again if he would explain to me the increase in respect of transport. It will be remembered that I said I had expected the figure of R1,4 million to be very much more than was shown in schedule 1. I said that I believed that the reason for this amount being less than I expected it to be was that the actual services covered by transport had been curtailed. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us in what way the services were curtailed. If they had not been curtailed, to what extent would this item have been increased in excess of what it is now? [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg built his argument around the question whether this standard stock should be brought into account under operating expenditure or capital expenditure. The point which he has raised is a very interesting one. I want to concede immediately that it is a point about which many differences exist or can exist. If he understood my reply to the Second Reading to mean that subhead 7 and subhead 9 cover the same field, I either expressed myself badly or he understood me wrongly, because they are in fact not the same. I tried to explain that under subhead 19 we are actually concerned with the standard stock capital which consist of approximately 23 000 different catalogue items of parts which are required for the maintenance and expansion of the telecommunications network over the whole country. I pointed out that the turnover of some of these parts is considerable, because there is a great demand for them, while for others the turnover is much less because the systems which we use and which are effective to a lesser or greater degree, are fairly outdated.</p>

<p>I also explained that the increase here was due to the price increases which occurred especially with respect to the more sophisticated parts and apparatus and that we now want to increase the R23 million, which is available for this, to R27 million. Subhead 7, on the other hand, deals with general stock, material and parts which are required for the maintenance of the telephone network in specific regional areas and for the execution of minor works not exceeding R1 000. While referring to this, I want to mention a few examples of works of this nature. The Post Office has many problems with the repositioning of telephone routes as a result of road and street deviations and extensions, and this causes <span class="col_2303-2304" refersTo="page_1168"/>expense. I also referred to the exceptional attempts made by the Post Office to undertake preventive maintenance work, especially in the metropolitan areas, and I also said that considerable success was achieved there. To come back to the essence of the hon. member&#x2019;s question, I want to tell him that there is a considerable difference of opinion concerning the specific point he raised. In 1972 the Auditor-General accepted the standpoint that the standard stock capital should come under operating expenditure and this is still the position today. Of course, the Post Office must respect this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Why is this capital?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because it was the standpoint of the Controller and the Auditor-General at that time. I conceded that it is a standpoint about which there may be differences of opinion. Indeed, the Post Office differed with the Controller and Auditor-General at that time as far as this standpoint was concerned, but this is what the Auditor-General decided and the Post Office accepted it in this way. However, I would now like to suggest that this matter be taken further in the Select Committee. I think that this is the appropriate place to do so, because the Controller and Auditor-General is not present in this House to put his standpoint or gainsay us. The Select Committee for Posts and Telecommunications is however, in my opinion, the proper body to thrash out this matter. I hope that the hon. member will be content with this. At this stage I can merely tell him what the factual position is. As I have explained here, an instruction was received from the Controller and the Auditor-General, and I think the Select Committee is the place where the matter can best be settled.</p>

<p>The second point which the hon. member raised, is in connection with subhead 5&#x2014;Transport. The cost of the conveyance of post by rail, by road, by air and by sea falls under this subhead. The conveyance of mail naturally takes place on agreement. The hon. member knows that an agreement was made with the Railways, the airlines and the shipping companies. Fixed terms have therefore been laid down. Furthermore this subhead provided for departmental motor transportation, i.e. the transportation of officials in service, for example on transfer, and also the transportation of departmental equipment and supplies, and so on. The hon. member specifically asked whether we had cut down and what the result of this was. I want to answer him in the affirmative, and this he will also see is in my reply to a question last week. In an attempt to economize, the Post Office had to curtail certain uneconomic and non-essential services in a sensible manner wherever possible. This we have in fact done. I also said in my reply that it is not possible to determine the exact result of this economizing campaign at this stage, but I can assure the hon. member that no essential services have been curtailed in this way. If the hon. member looks at subhead 2&#x2014;Vehicles&#x2014;in the Estimates of Additional Capital Expenditure, he will see that in spite of our economizing campaign we have an increase under that subhead. In other words, we bought additional vehicles. Obviously one cannot paralyse a developing service by curtailing necessary services and in this way actually undermining efficiency. I can therefore assure the hon. member that the cutting down which we have done, only applied to non-essential services, and to such a degree that it cannot be determined at this stage. I think this answers the two questions put by the hon. member.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I welcome the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s undertaking that the question of standard stock capital will be reconsidered after having been referred to the Select Committee. The very name of the heading is &#x201C;Standard Stock Capital&#x201D; or &#x201C;Standaardvoorraadkapitaal&#x201D;. It is obviously a capital item and the hon. the Minister will find that in the additional estimates on the Consolidated Revenue Fund, under two headings&#x2014;one of which is Defence&#x2014;this is reflected under the capital accounts, and rightly so. The Post Office is therefore out of line with what is done in the normal budget.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to subhead 3 in the Estimates of Additional Capital Expenditure. The hon. the Minister indicated that the amount of R2 193 000 was largely for mail-handling equipment. What I should like to know is why it is that although the whole programme of mechanized mail handling was planned well in advance and was well known, having been dealt with in some detail in last year&#x2019;s annual report, the department did not know what the cost was going to be. Why do we have to vote <span class="col_2305-2306" refersTo="page_1169"/>an amount which is approximately 40% of the original estimate of R5,728 million under this subhead? It seems that somebody has slipped here, or else there is further information which can explain the situation. If that is so, I believe this Committee is entitled to that information.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am indebted to the hon. member for accepting the explanation in connection with the standard stock capital and being content that we shall take the matter further in the Select Committee.</p>

<p>As far as subhead 3 is concerned, I simply want to tell him that this was planned in a very thorough way, as he correctly said, and that this increase is actually not due to any error made by the department or any of its officials. What happened here, was that the equipment, especially the mail sorting machines, were delivered earlier than what we originally expected. As a result of this we had to meet these obligations. This is the explanation given to me for this increase. The Postmaster-General informs me that there was an escalation clause in the purchase contract which came into operation only after devaluation, and that we were only informed of the final price by the manufacturers last year. These are the reasons for this increase.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister said that it was the result of devaluation. However, devaluation took place in September 1975. As far as I know, the machines were already in operation before that date. If not, they were in any event being set up. How did it happen that payment only took place after devaluation? I remember seeing reports of the arrival of those machines earlier than September last year. I think that the hon. the Minister should make sure of his dates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telecommunications">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, according to information received from the Postmaster-General there was an escalation clause in the purchase contract which was put into effect only after devaluation. Furthermore, we were informed of the final price by the manufacturer only late last year. Perhaps this throws a little more light on the subject. The Budget date was March 1975, but devaluation was in September 1975 and payment was made in December 1975.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation concerning the additional amount of R2 193 000 which is being asked for under subhead 3&#x2014;Office, Electronic Data Processing, Mail Handling and Stores Equipment&#x2014;is that the increase is due to the fact that adjustments had to be made as a result of price increases and that payment actually took place only after devaluation. I experienced some difficulty in accepting this. I see that under the Post Office Capital expenditure for last year, R2,6 million less than what was voted, was spent. The explanation for this saving is &#x201C;delivery of automatic mail sorting machines postponed in expectation of alterations&#x201D;. It therefore seems to me that this equipment was ordered last year, the year ending on 31 March 1975.</p>

<p>I therefore cannot understand why devaluation should affect an order which was made in the previous financial year. There was a saving as a result of the fact that the equipment concerned could not be delivered because the alterations to the buildings were not yet completed. It seems to me that there may be something behind this and that an additional sorting machine or machines has been purchased in the current financial year. This does not, however, explain what happened in connection with the orders which were placed in the previous financial year. Orders to the value of R2,6 million which were placed in the previous financial year, were not delivered. I think that the hon. the Minister must explain to us what happened to those orders which were placed in the previous financial year and were not carried out immediately, but only later. Why was the price R2,1 million higher then, <span class="col_2307-2308" refersTo="page_1170"/>while it is quite clear that the orders concerned were placed in the previous financial year? If this is not the case, I would like to know what happened to the machines which were ordered in the previous financial year, machines for which R1,2 million was spent and R2,6 million that has not yet been spent.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telecommunications">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member has lost sight of the fact that the contract makes provision for an escalation in price which may follow wage increases, higher steel prices, and so on, in the country where the equipment is manufactured&#x2014;in this case Germany. Devaluation affects the final price and has nothing to do with the date of the order. I have already explained in my reply to the hon. member for Durban Point that this escalation clause came into effect only after devaluation. As I have indicated, it concerns the final price and not the date of the order.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the two amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 3, in lines 40 and 41, to omit &#x201C;, or of an institution or portion of an institution&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(2) on page 5, in line 1, to omit &#x201C;(b) who&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;(iii)&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>I should like to say at the outset that although I do not want to repeat what I said during the Second Reading debate, we are totally and entirely opposed to this clause firstly because we believe that it is unnecessary to have these powers and, secondly, because if they are implemented, they will constitute a further curtailment of the freedom of the Press; in other words, the right of the public to have the facts to which they are entitled. However, since the hon. the Minister is obviously determined to press on with the Bill, I have moved these amendments in the hope that we shall at least reduce the mischief in this clause.</p>

<p>The first amendment seeks the omission of certain words in lines 40 and 41. The words which we propose should be omitted are &#x201C;or of an institution or portion of an institution&#x201D;. I accept and concede that there is a case, although I do not necessarily agree that it is necessary to legislate for it, against the publication of the pictures of inmates of mental institutions, whether those pictures are of individual inmates or of groups of inmates. I find it difficult to think of circumstances under which such photographs would normally be published, but let us accept that it is necessary to prohibit such publication. However, I cannot for the life of me see why there should be any prohibition on the publication of sketches or photographs of an institution or a portion of an institution. I do not know what the purpose of this is. Surely this is not protecting anybody. If there are institutions of this nature which ought not to be photographed, then they are probably in such a state that they are not fit for habitation. There may be some other explanation and I hope that the hon. the Minister will give us some kind of an explanation for specifically including institutions or portions of an institution. I just cannot see the reason for it at all.</p>

<p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, I am simply striving to do what the hon. the Minister himself did in the proposed section 66A(a)(i) and (ii), namely to exclude from the provisions all members of the Newspaper Press Union of South Africa; in other words, every single daily newspaper in this country as well as about 95% of the magazines and periodicals. I do not understand why, if they are exempt in (a), they should suddenly not be exempt in (b). I believe for a variety of reasons that this prohibition is unnecessary. One is that the law as it stands at the moment is adequate. What situations have changed now to introduce this restriction all of a sudden? I argued this during the Second Reading debate and I want to say again that the common law is perfectly capable of looking after a situation of this nature. The presumption in common law is such that it makes it possible to institute prosecutions successfully for malicious or false reports in articles. As I said earlier, articles of this nature are the complete exception and I think the hon. the <span class="col_2309-2310" refersTo="page_1171"/>Minister will agree with me. They occur so infrequently that it seems to me to be going to inordinate lengths, and that it is an overreaction to the activities of a certain very few&#x2014;probably one or possible two&#x2014;periodicals if such legislation is passed. If the common law is not regarded as being sufficient&#x2014;apparently some lawyers will argue this&#x2014;then I say that there is other machinery, for example the Press Council, which exists for precisely this kind of thing. The Press Council gives aggrieved persons or parties the right to be heard and to put their case. As the hon. the Minister knows, under the Press Council system as it operates at the moment, a newspaper is obliged to publish any correction if the Press Council has made such a finding.</p>

<p>As far as one can find out, the provision in the clause is aimed at the scientology movement and one other journal that has been named in the Second Reading debate. I should like to say that although I hold absolutely no brief for either the Scientology movement or this other journal, I feel as a citizen in a democratic society that I have the duty to defend their right to be heard, provided obviously that they operate within the four corners of the law. That is what the law is there for. It has been adequate all these years; in fact, it has been adequate for 50 years. If under these circumstances the Press Council does not work, then, as I say, the common law can be invoked.</p>

<p>*It really seems to me as though we are using a sledgehammer to kill the Bushveld mosquito. Why these excessive powers?</p>

<p>&#x2020;My main reason for asking that NPU members should be excluded from this is, as I have already said, the very real difficulty&#x2014;I want the hon. the Minister to accept this&#x2014;which practising newspaper people have. There is no question of wanting newspapers to be able to publish false information; that is absolute nonsense. No decent newspaper wants to publish false information knowing it to be false. Such a suggestion would be simply crazy. However, there is in fact a very real practical problem, particularly in the area of which we are now talking, the area of mental health and the treatment of individuals or groups of people. It is not always possible to say what is false and what is true. There is a huge grey area in all these things which is open to wide interpretation. It seems to me that it is often impossible to distinguish. This was certainly our experience as newspaper people.</p>

<p>I say again that the exceptions are so few that it seems to me that we are going inordinately far just to cope with an evil which I believe can be coped with quite adequately under existing circumstances. I think it is utterly wrong for us to start from the assumption&#x2014;this seems to me what this whole clause is based on&#x2014;that newspapers or journals will publish false information if there is not a law to stop it. This inference which is drawn seems to me to be utterly unfair and unreasonable. If the Government is able to exclude newspapers which are members of the NPU from the provisions of the Publications Act, for instance, why is it not possible to do the same thing here? Why make an exception in this case? Why bring them in here? I would argue that this is really enshrining in law a vote of no confidence in the Press of South Africa, the same Press to which the hon. the Minister paid very eloquent tribute when he moved the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>I am arguing that the provisions of this clause are so illogical and so potentially mischievous and dangerous, that one really hopes that the hon. the Minister will accept these amendments. I am not happy with that which the amendments leave, but I maintain that it is better than what we have. I want him to accept these amendments. I believe that the provisions of the clause as it reads at the moment are dangerous because the Minister will be able to withhold from the public facts which it is necessary to publish in the interests of good government and administration. I say again that the provisions constitute an invasion on the rights of the individual and that is why I hope that the hon. the Minister will accept these amendments.</p>

<p>This is not a plea for licence on the part of the newspapers. The vast majority of our newspapers are completely and utterly responsible and they are capable of exercising the desired kind of self-discipline. In my view these provisions are enshrining, as I said earlier, a vote of no confidence in the entire Press of South Africa, which I think is totally unwarranted. I hope the hon. the Minister will consider and accept these amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as the first part of clause 2 is <span class="col_2311-2312" refersTo="page_1172"/>concerned, members of the Newspaper Press Union are exempted in any case. We assume that the responsible Press, to which I have already referred and in which I have great confidence, is exempted in any case when it comes to the publication of what can be regarded as ordinary information. However, the hon. member has put certain questions to me.</p>

<p>In the first place, the hon. member says that we should not take into account the fact that irresponsible persons could take photographs or make sketches of dilapidated buildings which are going to be demolished. However, we cannot do that. It is often the case that persons photographed dilapidated buildings which we are planning to demolish.</p>

<p>&#x2020;These are mock-up photos which do not convey reality, and this is the problem. These mock-up photos are then distributed.</p>

<p>*In that way an irresponsible person can take photographs and make them public and create a completely false impression of the housing we establish for the mentally ill, and make this false impression public. That is what I am opposed to. It is not necessarily the Press alone which is guilty of this. Afterwards the authorities have to make statements and rectify the matter, but those statements never receive the attention that the original malicious information has received. The public information media in which we have confidence, are exempted in any case. In fact, very good provision has been made to ensure that the ordinary public Press will be allowed to take photographs, make sketches, etc. They may obtain permission from the Secretary for Health. Nor will permission arbitrarily be withheld from others. The purpose is to curb irresponsible publication in this regard. Therefore I am unable to accept the first proposal of the hon. member.</p>

<p>I found it really amusing that the hon. member, who is a seasoned newspaperman, a seasoned journalist and who is concerned about the Press, could move such an amendment as this.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member is asking me to accept an amendment by which the Secretary of Health will be authorized to give somebody permission to publicize false information.</p>

If the hon. member is so concerned about the freedom of the Press, I would say that he should accept that we are acting quite correctly towards the Press. He should also accept that we have made exceptions as far as the Press is concerned, and that we are unable, as far as this aspect is concerned, to make an exception, for if we should allow the Secretary to give any other person, excluding the Press, the right to publish false information, it would be a reflection on the Press.

<p>Mr. Chairman, with all due respect I should like to say that I find it virtually impossible to advance any intelligent argument in view of the kind of arguments we are getting here this afternoon, which boils down to my asking that the Press of South Africa should be allowed to tell lies. With all respect, it is utter nonsense. If the hon. the Minister still does not understand my pleas, he will never understand them. I am sorry to have to say this, but it is of no avail to advance further arguments. Therefore, I shall leave it at that. The hon. the Minister said he is no fool, and I accept it.

<p>Mr. Chairman, if they are mock-up photos, then the hon. the Minister can take action against newspapers for misrepresentation. Why does he want a special law for this? The hon. the Minister now wants to place every newspaper in South Africa under this kind of restriction, because of the irresponsible action of a single individual. Can the hon. the Minister quote any other journal, except the one he has in mind, that has done this? If the hon. the Minister cannot, then he is now trying to place the entire Press under a restriction for the mis-demeanour of one obscure little journal which nobody would have heard of if the hon. the Minister had not come with this Bill.

<p>The hon. the Minister speaks about &#x201C;toe-stemming&#x201D;.</p>

<p>*The hon. the Minister is saying that newspapers may always obtain permission to take photographs and make sketches. We have just spoken about people who are foolish. Can anyone imagine a Public Servant giving permission for the publication of photographs of a dilapidated building of which they are themselves ashamed? It is nonsense, is it not? They are people like us, and of course they would not do it. It is precisely in such cases that newspapers should do it. They should do it when it is a question of dilapidated buildings in which people should not be living at all. The right should exist to publish the facts as well as photographs in this regard. The hon. the Minister, however, now wants to do away with this right. He says that permission may be granted for this, but under what circumstances will that happen?

<speech by="#minister_of_forestry">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>For historical reasons a large number of sawmills have been established in this country which are, in most cases, dependent on relatively limited supplies of timber from remote plantations. Naturally, this situation cannot continue indefinitely, and in the interests of more effective utilization of manpower, capital and raw materials, a rationalization of the country&#x2019;s sawmill industry has become essential. The necessity for meaningful rationalization has not been overlooked and <span class="col_2315-2316" refersTo="page_1174"/>was realized a long time ago. Admittedly various steps in this direction have consequently been taken, but for the first time it is now being anticipated that the State and a private timber processing industry will act as partners to give effect to the rationalization concept.</p>

<p>The Weza State Sawmills, as well as the Clan Sawmills (Weza) of the Hans Merensky Foundation, are at present processing sawlogs from the Weza State forests in southern Natal. In addition to this, Clan Sawmills (Weza) purchases conifer sawlogs from private plantations adjoining the Weza State forest. The yields from these two timber-supplying plantations is insufficient to satisfy fully the intake capacity of the two separate sawmills, and at present there is no prospect of possibly increasing the yields to such an extent that both sawmills could be operated at full capacity, and consequently more advantageously. The consolidation of the activities of the two sawmills into a single enterprise, the processing capacity of which could be fully utilized is consequently being proposed.</p>

<p>This intention was preceded by exhaustive feasibility studies which indicated that a consolidated sawmill enterprise was not only likely to entail considerable savings in capital spending, but also to be capable of producing increased profits from the outset, with the potential of even better ultimate achievements as far as profitableness is concerned. Apart from this, a single sawmill unit has the added advantage that it will afford an opportunity for the selective utilization of timber&#x2014;which would be beneficial to the timber grower as well as the timber processor. The increased combined permanent yield which will be available from the time-supplying plantations to a single processor will make it possible for timber to be utilized more selectively, because sufficient sawlogs of larger dimensions will be available for processing into sawn timber and veneer, while there will at the same time be an increased volume of small-sized wood which could be disposed of and utilized more advantageously as pulpwood than in the form of sawlogs of small dimensions&#x2014;a situation which will undoubtedly lead to an increased percentage of high quality construction timber.</p>

<p>The Bill before this House therefore makes provision for the establishment of a timber processing company with a processing capacity of approximately 113 000 cubic metres of timber per annum. It will be known as the Weza Timber Company Limited in which the State, through its Department of Forestry&#x2014;and the Hans Merensky Foundation, will have an equal share-holding.</p>

<p>The objectives and powers of the company to be established are comprehensively defined in clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill, and I do not think it will be taken amiss of me if I do not elaborate on those aspects. The only aspect to which I could perhaps draw attention here is that in clause 3(a) specific provision is being made for the supply of a certain percentage of the processed timber products, for State purposes. Hon. members are aware that the State sawmills act in the first place as suppliers to Government departments. The transfer of the Weza State Sawmill to the company will place a great burden on the remaining State sawmills to meet the State&#x2019;s requirements for sawn timber, and to protect the State&#x2019;s interests in this respect it is being deemed necessary for a portion of the production of the joint enterprise to be retained for State purposes.</p>

<p>The affairs of the company will, as hon. members will note from clauses 5 and 6, be managed and controlled by a board of directors, consisting of seven members, of whom three shall be officers of the Department of Forestry and three will be appointed by the Hans Merensky Foundation, while a further independent member, who shall not be associated with the Department of Forestry or the Hans Merensky Foundation, will act as chairman. It will be possible to ensure ability on the part of the board of directors of the company by means of the judicious selection of the members so that the necessity for a larger board of directors falls away. On the other hand, ability will probably be sacrificed if the board of directors has to consist of fewer than seven members.</p>

<p>Clauses 7 to 10 of the Bill refer exclusively to the term of office and remuneration of the members of the board of directors, the filling of vacancies on the board, the vacation of their office by members, meetings of the board and the procedure for meetings. These clauses are self-explanatory and in my opinion, therefore, require no further elucidation. A general manager, who need not necessarily be an individual, but may also be a juristic person if this would be to the advantage of the company, will be appointed in terms of clause <span class="col_2317-2318" refersTo="page_1175"/>11 by the board of directors and remunerated from the funds of the company for his services. This general manager shall be entrusted with the carrying out, management and control of the work of the company, as well as with the exercising of supervision over the company&#x2019;s employees, and will be directly responsible to the board of directors.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As I have mentioned earlier, the State and Hans Merensky Foundation will enjoy equal shareholding in the company. The divisible profits, which shall in terms of clause 18 be appropriated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, will consequently be divided equally between the two parties. Clause 12 of the Bill makes provision for the required share capital of the company, which has been calculated at R1,5 million and which shall, as ordinary shares, be subscribed at par equally by the two shareholders.</p>

<p>It is intended to transfer certain movable and immovable assets at the Weza State Sawmill and at the Clan Sawmills (Weza) to the company. The necessary provision in this regard appears in clause 21. The timber stocks at the two sawmills are, however, excluded and will be purchased by the company. The value&#x2014;as determined by a sworn appraiser&#x2014;of the assets which are transferred will be tendered as part payment for shares issued and the balance of the shares will be taken up and paid for in cash by the two parties. Shares held by the State shall, as hon. members will notice from clause 17, not be transferred except by legislation, and in such an event the shares shall in the first place be offered to the Hans Merensky Foundation. The Hans Merensky Foundation shall likewise first offer any shares it wishes to transfer, to the State. In order to provide the required working capital for the company, provision is made in clause 14 for the granting of loans to the company by the State and the Hans Meresky Foundation. Clause 16 authorizes the company to negotiate loans with the proviso that such loans shall not exceed 75% of the authorized share capital.</p>

<p>The amount for which the State will be liable in respect of cash payment for shares and the granting of a loan to the company will have to be defrayed out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The funds required for this purpose are appropriated by clause 15.</p>

<p>The intention is to establish the processing plant of the company on the site of the Weza State Sawmill. This site will after subdivision be purchased from the State by the company.</p>

<p>These, Mr. Speaker, are in broad outline the objects of the draft legislation before this House. The Bill contains a few other essential provisions which are customary, such as instructions in connection with the company&#x2019;s accounts and the auditing thereof, the furnishing of certain information, and so forth, but I do not consider it necessary to elaborate thereon at this stage.</p>

<p>Since publication of the Bill certain reservations were expressed by sections of the private sawmilling industry. My department had discussions with the parties concerned and I shall move certain amendments in the Committee State to satisfy the misgivings expressed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is the first Bill that the new Minister of Forestry has had to move in the House, and we welcome him to the post. This Department of Forestry is a considerably more important department than members of this House generally realize, and we welcome the hon. the Minister to the post. He is a person who has had considerable experience in his own constituency of timber and timber working, and we hope he will have a fruitful time as Minister of Forestry.</p>

<p>The question that has perturbed this side of the House more than anything else since the legislation was laid before us is the question as to whether in fact this was an extension of the principle of State intervention in the private sector, in this case the sawmilling industry of South Africa. We have taken the attitude on many occasions that we are against socialism and against State intervention in what we regard should be essentially the activities of the private sector. But when we went into the matter very carefully, we found that this was in fact an absolutely new kind of creature, a sort of hybrid creature, with the State on one side and private industry on the other, in this case the Merensky Interests at Weza and the State interests, and that it was limited only to the sawmilling interests and did not extend to the timber-growing side of their activities. We are reminded of the fact that this Department of Forestry in fact pioneered the timber industry in South Africa. They undertook tremendous expenditure and tremendous risks and a very long-term programme, and we feel that it is quite unwise and unreal to say that this activity, whereby a marriage is achieved <span class="col_2319-2320" refersTo="page_1176"/>between the State and the Merensky Interests, should be regarded as a socialistic step, when it is in fact moving a part of the State&#x2019;s interests out into the private sector and acquiring a new slice of direction and a new capitalistic interest in this particular company. The question in our mind was also whether this created a precedent and whether the hon. the Minister and his department were now going to move out into other areas and other sectors, and whether other and perhaps smaller sawmilling interests would now find themselves threatened in some way by the State coming in and making them an offer, the kind of offer that the Godfather made, which they cannot refuse. But the Minister is moving an amendment which limits the application of this Act specifically to Alfred County and to Weza itself. We are therefore prepared to support the Second Reading of the Bill. The limitation of this to the Alfred County sector is welcomed by us, because it gives a specific interest to two sawmills which are operating, as the hon. the Minister said, inefficiently, because there is not sufficient timber there for them to utilize their capacity fully.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of the board of directors and the chairman of the board, etc., all this kind of thing we regard as mere technicalities. Clause 13 deals with the issue of shares. As I understand the position, the sawmilling activities are going to be concentrated now at the State mill at Weza, which means that the Merensky mill will either have to close down, or it will have to close down certain of its sawmilling activities and certain machinery will have to be moved or utilized somewhere else. This will then create an imbalance between the contribution which the State is making and which Merensky is making, because their mill will now not figure so largely in the contribution they are making towards the joint company. As I see it&#x2014;and I hope the hon. the Minister will confirm this&#x2014;the Merensky Foundation in fact are going to make a much larger cash contribution than the State is going to make, because the activities will be centred in the State sawmill.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 14, the Minister is moving an amendment to limit the amount that can be lent or raised by means of loans and we have no problem in that regard. In terms of clause 17, the shares may not be transferred except by resolution of this House or by Act of Parliament. We find it difficult to visualize a situation where the department will be willing to dispose of its shares. After all, this is going to be an activity which will be centred on the department&#x2019;s mill and in the middle of the department&#x2019;s forests, etc., and I cannot see a situation arising where the department will want to dispose of their shares and bring in what can only be another element of private enterprise. I hope the Minister will make some comment in that regard. Obviously you must have some provision for it to be done. It may arise at some time that the department will want to dispose of its shares, but I find it very difficult to conceive of any circumstances under which that will happen.</p>

<p>Clause 20 deals with State land which has been set aside by the State for the purpose of its sawmill. There is a whole village at Weza where the people dealing with the timber in the Weza plantation are housed, and I should like to know whether any of the housing there which might be presumed to be specific to the sawmill will be transferred to the company, because obviously the company will want to house its employees. This obviously will then again make up a portion of what the State is now transferring into this company, and will minimize its cash contribution which it will have to make. Then there is the exclusion of the stock. It seems to me a little odd that sawn timer, which is the timber stock in each of the yards, should now be excluded by the Bill from being transferred into the company. You have timber sawn in the yards belonging to the State and you have timber sawn in the yard belonging to Merensky Foundation. In order to acquire that timber which is going to be their stock in trade, they will have to buy it in now from two existing institutions which are being married, as it were, but they will get the money to buy the stock from moneys provided by the State and provided by the Merensky Foundation. It seems to be a rather roundabout way to get where they are going. There must be a reason for it. Whether it is a bookkeeping or accounting reason, I do not know, but I hope the Minister will clear up the matter.</p>

<p>In clause 23 there is provision for laying reports on the Table of the House. We would like the assurance that this matter is one which can be debated under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, because this is the first occasion I can think of that the State has undertaken an operation of this sort in such close co-operation with private enterprise, and we will obviously <span class="col_2321-2322" refersTo="page_1177"/>watch this with very great interest. I hope that when these matters are tabled in the House, we will be able to raise them under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote.</p>

<p>There is a last matter I wish to ask the hon. the Minister about. I have discussed the matter with the department and it puzzled me. It is in regard to clause 25. Now I am not an accountant and I do not know what the reasons are. Most of us are &#x201C;plat boere&#x201D; and we do not understand anything about accountancy. But the Minister is taking power to exempt the company from certain of the provisions of the Companies Act. He is taking power to apply certain provisions of the Companies Act to this new company, and I want to ask him to tell us what he has in mind. Why was it necessary that the normal operation of the Companies Act should not apply in this particular case? He is now exempting himself from all those requirements by means of regulation or by notice in th<i>e Gazette.</i> Can he tell us what he contemplates and what he has in mind to apply to this particular company? I think those are fair questions. They are indicative of our interest in the Bill. We will watch the operations of this company with the very greatest interest, and we will support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Mooi River is pleased that there will be no further State intervention in the forestry industry. I think he is correct that this legislation will not take any further supplies of timber from the private sector and hand them over to the State. This has been the policy during the past number of years, that where the Government had certain sawmills under its control, it wanted to retain those sawmills so that it could exercise proper control over costs as well as the timber it needed for its own purposes. For that reason the Opposition need not be concerned that there is any deviation in policy. This concerns the rationalization in the timber industry. During the past number of years the tendency has been for smaller sawmills to amalgamate to form larger units. This leads to improved overall management and higher profits. But rationalization is required not only when one wants to make larger profits, but also when one wants improved utilization of the raw material one uses. This applies in this case. In the past softwood logs 12,5 cm (5 inches) in size were used for pulpwood and the larger logs for sawtimber. Sawmills were specifically designed to handle wood of that size. During the past number of years pulpwood became increasingly more important because particularly the paper industry is progressing. We find that 35% of all roundwood which is at present being exploited, is used for pulpwood as against only 34% in the sawmill industry. The demand for pulpwood increases at a rate of 6% per year, and the demand for saw wood at 2% per year.</p>

<p>In other words, we can expect a considerable shortage of pulpwood to arise in five or six years&#x2019; time. The logical solution for this problem would, of course, be to increase the minimum size of sawlogs used for sawtimber to, say, 18 cm (approximately 7 inches). Then more wood would be available for utilization as pulpwood. However, if this were done, the smaller sawmills would be deprived of a larger portion of their sawtimber. This would perhaps have been a good thing, because then the young excessively knotty logs which are not suitable for sawtimber, could be used for pulpwood. However, one cannot deprive the sawmills of the timber supplies they are used to and which have to be supplied to them in terms of contracts concluded with the State, and that reason rationalization would be a solution in this case, because if one combines two sawmills, it will lead to the better utilization of timber. During the past number of years yet another new trend manifested itself, i.e. the production of veneer&#x2014;cutwood&#x2014;and also this veneer-wood could also have an effect on the sawlogs and bring pressure to bear upon the sawmills which are used to receiving a certain quantity of sawtimber. For that reason rationalization will here mean the better utilization of raw materials and make available more pulpwood and veneer logs. At Weza, where there are two sawmills&#x2014;a State sawmill and a private mill&#x2014;which obtain timber from the same plantation, this rationalization will be best effected. A fixed minimum sized timber could then be sawn while the thinner logs could be used for veneer and pulp. This is the major advantage we would achieve here, because we would achieve better utilization of the raw materials and capital, because the largest and most modem sawmill would be retained to use sawlogs. Therefore, I am happy to support this Bill:</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is an extremely important Bill which we have before the House this afternoon. Obviously the Bill will have far-reaching effects. Timber is the commodity which is in great demand not only in South Africa, but throughout the world, and is becoming more and more expensive too. In economics we have been taught that consolidation under normal circumstances and conditions is always desirable, and this is one of the reasons why we on this side of the House support the Bill. The amalgamation of the two sawmills will of course assist them in drawing from two plantations, it will facilitate and solve the many problems. I am happy that the profits from this company shall be divided equally, but sooner or later we shall have to decide between State interference or private enterprise. I accept that the Government is doing a lot in respect of research at experimental stations in the Border area and in the Eastern Cape. We are very grateful that the Government is doing research in this regard. On the other hand, we have always supported private enterprise, and we believe that private enterprise should be maintained as far as possible in the future. We should therefore not overlook this aspect. I have no more to say, except that I am happy to support this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House appreciate the fact that this important piece of legislation, which is a particularly interesting piece of information, is supported by the Opposition. The hon. member for Mooi River described this as a &#x201C;hybrid creation&#x201D;, which it, in fact is. Half of it is company enterprise and half State enterprise&#x2014;a concoction, therefore&#x2014;and for that reason it is a very interesting enterprise on the part of the State. I, from my side, am looking forward to the results which are going to be achieved, bearing in mind that what is being done and created here, is indeed not a profit-making enterprise. What is being created here, is an enterprise which will be to the welfare and advantage of the industry and the country as a whole. On the one hand we have the State, which is indeed the largest grower of trees in the country and which therefore has a very real interest, not only because it is the State and is involved in the matter, but also in the interests of the development of the industry in South Africa. On the other hand we have the Merensky Foundation, which, in turn, is not a profitmaking enterprise in the true sense of the word either, but consists of an independent, selected group of people whose aim and ideal it is not so much to make a profit, but to devote their energies to research and the development of the industry. For that reason I believe it to be a very fine enterprise. We are gladly looking forward to the progress which will be made in future. The Bill is to my mind a fine and balanced one. Personally I have very little criticism to level at it. For that reason this side of the House supports the Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the outset I want to state that our party is in favour of this Bill and will be supporting it. However, we would like to draw attention to a few of the provisions in the Bill, and state our attitude in that connection.</p>

<p>Firstly, with regard to clause 3(a), we would like the hon. the Minister to give us certain assurances as to some of the activities of the organization. This is in line with the objections and the reservations raised by the hon. member for Mooi River. In general one feels that there should not be too much scope for interference with private enterprise. In terms of clause 3(a) the company is given a very wide scope, a very wide field of activities in which it can participate, activities which may, in some respects, interfere with the rights of private enterprise.</p>

<p>In clause 3(b) there is the further provision &#x201C;subject to the approval of the Minister, to undertake the manufacture of any product from any by-product arising in any of the company&#x2019;s undertakings under paragraph (a), and the processing of any such by-product &#x2026;&#x201D;. A valid question which can be asked in this connection is why the Minister should have the final approval in a matter of this nature, and why provision is not made for the Minister to act in terms of recommendations made to him by the board which is to be appointed. In our communications with the industry it was brought to our attention that the industry had certain reservations in regard to the Bill as it was originally drafted, but that the present Bill, however, generally meets with the approval of the members of industry.</p>

<p>In clause 8(2) the provision is that &#x201C;a member of the board appointed in terms of section 5(1)(a) or (b) may at any time be <span class="col_2325-2326" refersTo="page_1179"/>removed from office by the Minister if the Minister is of the opinion that there are good reasons for doing so.&#x201D; It would appear as if the hon. the Minister is being given rather extraordinary rights to remove members of the board from office. We believe that the provision should provide that the hon. the Minister will act in concert with a majority of the members of the board in the removal of members of that board, and that it should not be the responsibility of the Minister alone.</p>

<p>Clause 23(3) reads as follows: &#x201C;The board shall, as soon as practicable after the conclusion of every meeting of the board transmit to the Minister a copy of the minutes of the meeting.&#x201D; In this connection I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what provision is being made for either the board or himself to table an annual report in Parliament on the activities of the company concerned, in view of the fact that it is a company which is financially sponsored in part by the Government.</p>

<p>Next I want to refer to clause 25(1), which has also been referred to by the hon. member for Mooi River. In this clause provision is made that the Weza Timber Company shall not be subject to the provisions of the Companies Act. This appears to be strange. Why should a fully-fledged company, which is partly private enterprise and partly State-owned, a company which is formed by an Act of Parliament, be exempted from any restraints which are applied by the Companies Act? There may be very good reasons for this, and we would like to hear from the hon. the Minister what the motivation for that particular provision is.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister certain questions. It is not quite clear what the import is of clause 14, particularly if it is seen in relation to clause 18. In terms of this Bill the authorized capital of the company is going to be R1,5 million, supplied equally by the foundation and by the Government. The hon. the Minister presumably holds the shares on behalf of the State President, or on behalf of the Government. Clause 14 deals with the granting of loans to the company and reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to provide for the funds required by the company for the purpose of achieving its object&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">(a) the State shall, on such conditions as the Minister may in consultation with the Minister of Finance determine, grant to the company on the fixed date a loan the amount of which shall be likewise determined &#x2026;</block>

<p>It means that the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance determines the amount of the loan, and presumably also the terms and conditions which will apply to it.</p>

<p>Clause 14(b) says the same with regard to the foundation. What interests me is that one can read those two subsections as providing that the State can make a loan to the company of a certain amount and the foundation can make a loan to the company of a different amount. As I read it, I interpret the intention of clause 14 to be that loans should be made in equal amounts, on equal terms and on equal conditions to the company from both partners. However, that is not the wording as it now stands.</p>

<p>Clause 16 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board may with the approval of the Minister, given after consultation with the Minister of Finance, borrow money from any source: Provided that the total amount borrowed in terms of this section shall at no time exceed an amount equal to 75% of the authorized share capital of the company.</block>

<p>We know that the authorized share capital in full, as it is now determined, is R 1,5 million. I presume that, what the hon. the Minister and the department are doing here, is to try to give some flexibility for overdrafts and various other things. It is interesting though to note that clause 16 limits the total amount borrowed to 75% of the authorized share capital of the company at any particular point in time. However, no limit is placed on the amount of loans which can be made available to the company by the State and by the foundation, the two partners in terms of clause 14.</p>

<p>Clause 18 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of section 19, the divisible profits shall be divided <i>pro rata</i> between the holders of the shares.</block>

<p>Clause 19 goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2327-2328" refersTo="page_1180"/>The board may with the approval of the Minister and in accordance with such conditions as he may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> prescribe, establish and maintain any reserve fund which it may consider necessary in the interests of the company.</block>

<p>If one should leave out clause 19, there is no way in which the company can repay the capital amount of the loan, because it simply says &#x201C;the divisible profits shall be divided <i>pro rata</i> between the holders of the shares&#x2019;&#x2019;. Obviously, interest comes before the profit.</p>

<p>One can therefore pay the servicing costs. However, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether clause 19 simply provides for the establishment of a sinking fund as opposed to a reserve fund, so that the capital amount of any loan can also be repaid. If this is not so, the company will be incapable of repaying the principal amount of the loan.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, firstly I want to convey my appreciation to the hon. member for Mooi River for his words of congratulation. It makes one feel a little strange if a person congratulates you on a new position, and one is immediately confronted with legislation of this nature. Here I now have to start off with an entirely new task and a difficult problem. But I must say that hon. members did express their confidence in this legislation. I want to express my appreciation for their goodwill and understanding of the circumstances in our forestry industry. It was in fact a hundred years ago that the first forests were planted on a small scale by the State in this country. At present we realize the value of the forestry industry to the country, and here, through special legislation, the State and a private enterprise are now joining forces to be able to participate more effectively in the sawmilling industry. A few points have been raised in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>With reference to clause 13, the hon. member for Mooi River asked a question about the share capital. Both companies must of course make provision for the same amount, but valuations will be made&#x2014;as indicated here&#x2014;of the improvements and the equipment which is going to be used, and it is very clear that the Merensky Foundation will have to contribute considerably more in the form of cash than the Weza Sawmills will have to do. The precise amount will be determined by making a valuation of the utilizable improvements and the equipment of each of the two parties.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River also referred to housing. It will be possible to lease housing for the sawmills. The new company will have to lease most of its housing from the Department of Forestry. It is not possible to transfer a large area of land. I think that approximately 20 ha will be transferred, and the hon. member appreciates of course that it will not be possible to establish all the housing on that land. The State will consequently make housing available which the company will be able to lease.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the remaining timber on the sites. The timber stocks on each of the sites on the day of take-over will of course have to be taken over by the new company. Each of the old establishments will of course have to sell their stocks to the new company. I hope this is clear to the hon. member.</p>

<p>The other problem which the hon. member had, was in connection with clause 25. This clause provides that the Companies Act is not applicable, but that the Minister may make some or other provision in the Companies Act or another Act applicable. I must concede that if one wants to understand something with simple arithmetic, it can become a little complicated. We see, however, that this company can function equally well under the Companies Act. But an exposition of all the particulars and provisions of the Companies Act will make this legislation too long. It is therefore being provided that the Companies Act is not applicable. In this legislation mention is only being made of the deed of foundation and then the further particulars which may be necessary&#x2014;the constitution of the board of directors, the accounts, and so on. Everything which may be applicable is mentioned briefly and succinctly. However, if it should appear in the opinion of the Minister that there ought to be further provisions, the Minister may make other provisions of the Companies Act applicable. At present this is not being foreseen.</p>

<p>Yes, perhaps under the Vote as well. Then the Minister is present and it is possible to ask him specifically why certain things were permitted and others not. I think this is more or less the position in practice.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bryanston raised the question of the redemption of loans. He said there was no assurance in the legislation with regard to the redemption of loans. I do not think it is necessary to indicate in legislation that a company which has raised a loan has to pay back that loan. It is accepted as normal, as part of any company&#x2019;s activities, that if a loan is raised, certain financial obligations arise, and that such a loan will in due course have to be repaid. However it is not being stated specifically in this legislation that loans have to be repaid. I do not think I should elaborate any further on that. I think we could debate these particular points further during the Committee Stage, if hon. members feel they want greater certainty. The hon. member for Bryanston also asked for an assurance in regard to clause 3, but he is aware that I am going to substitute an amendment to the entire clause 3(a), in regard to which he has misgivings, during the Committee Stage and I think that with that, his problem will probably disappear. With reference to clause 23, the hon. member also discussed the statements. It is specifically mentioned here that the financial statements of the company will be made available.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North discussed the repayment of the loan, and had reservations concerning clause 16 and clause 18, which, according to him, allegedly contained contradictions. However, I think we could to greater effect debate the clauses on which hon. members still perhaps have reservations during the Committee Stage. I do not want to elaborate on them further at this stage. We should not, during the Second Reading, conduct a discussion of problems which could more suitably be discussed during the Committee Stage.</p>

However, I shall furnish the hon. member with information in this regard at a later stage.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to express my appreciation for the support I have received for this legislation. It is very important to the Department of Forestry, which also renders a very extensive service to the private entrepreneur, to be able, together with the private entrepreneur, to acquire knowledge of certain processing methods which they had nothing to do with in the past, and then to be able to convey that knowledge to new students. It is the Department of Forestry which is responsible for the training of professional officers, and it is consequently important that they should be able to acquire new skills in various spheres of the timber industry which would be of value to the private sector.</p>

<block name="quote">given with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance.</block>

<p><span class="col_2331-2332" refersTo="page_1182"/>When we brought this matter to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention during the Second Reading debate, we mentioned that the reason why we would be moving this amendment was simply the fact that the loan requirements, both domestic and foreign, of the public and semi-public corporations have reached a size in the aggregate which is well known and that, therefore, from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s point of view and, indeed, more particularly from the point of view of the hon. the Minister of Finance, the hon. the Minister would want to have a degree of co-ordination in regard to these loans. In reply, the hon. the Minister said that in terms of Treasury regulations it was already mandatory for Iscor, when raising money in terms of this provision, to have the approval of the hon. the Minister of Finance. If that is indeed so in respect of both domestic and foreign loans, obviously the necessity for this amendment will fall away and we shall withdraw it. While we understand that Iscor, like any other corporation, certainly has to get permission to raise money overseas, I believe that that is not the case as far as Iscor&#x2019;s domestic borrowings are concerned. At present Iscor is attempting to raise some R12 million under a highly complicated scheme underwritten by two of the merchant banks in Johannesburg. If the hon. the Minister agrees that Iscor has the right to raise money in the domestic South African capital market, and that the same applies to Escom and the other public and semi-public corporations, we would wish our amendment to stand. On the other hand, if it is indeed a fact that even in so far as the domestic scene is concerned Iscor has to get the approval of the Minister of Finance, we shall withdraw the amendment we have put forward.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have already indicated that I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Johannesburg North, for two reasons. The first reason is that the amendment contained in clause 2 basically concerns the facilitation of the procedure. Therefore it is suggested that &#x201C;approval of the State President&#x2019;&#x2019; be substituted by &#x201C;the approval of the Minister&#x201D;, being the Minister of Economic Affairs. Should we accept the amendment of the hon. member for Johannesburg North, it would merely mean that &#x201C;State President&#x201D; would be replaced by &#x201C;Minister of Finance&#x201D;, which would defeat the purpose of the clause, i.e. to facilitate the procedure. In the second instance the hon. member now accepts that permission must in any event be obtained from the Treasury as far as foreign loans which are raised in the foreign capital and money market. All he wants to know now is what the position is in connection with loans on the local market. He said that if I could satisfy him that the Treasury regulations also hold with respect to the power to raise loans on the local capital or money market, his amendment would fall away. This is how I understood it. It seems to me that, apart from the other considerations I have mentioned, if Iscor went to the local capital market with issues, it would have to obtain permission from the Treasury for this, in terms of exchange control regulation No. 16.1.A., made in terms of the Currency and Exchanges Act. Therefore I want to repeat that the motivation for this clause is precisely to facilitate procedure for the purposes which I have tried to outline. I have already given my assurance to the hon. member and to the House that apart from any legal stipulations in this particular respect, the greatest co-ordination takes place concerning the loans which are raised by different State departments, such as the Railways, the Post Office and the Treasury, and also with respect to the loans which are raised by the State corporations which fall under my department, for example. In other words, I want to maintain that, in any opinion, the safeguards which the hon. member wants to include by means of his amendment already exist in the regulations and are already built into the financial procedure and structure which is followed in the public sector with respect to loans raised at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 5, in lines 18 and 19, to omit &#x201C;three-fourths&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;a fourth&#x201D;.</block>

<p><span class="col_2333-2334" refersTo="page_1183"/>In the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech he said, in essence, that he did not want anything to stand in the way of Iscor as regards their flexibility and that he did not want Iscor to be prevented from having the same normal business practices that might be given to other corporations. We do not want to do that either. I gather from the hon. the Minister that this provision is partly aimed at giving the board the right to raise overdrafts for Iscor so that they can conduct their normal business. However, we have simply moved our amendment on the grounds that the hon. the Minister is asking in this clause that the board be given the right to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; whenever in its opinion it is for any urgent or other sufficient reason not expedient to raise loans in accordance with the said subsection, &#x2026; raise further loans or borrow moneys: Provided that the total amount owing at any time in respect of loans raised and moneys borrowed in terms of this section shall not exceed three-fourths of the issued share capital of the corporation at that time.</block>

<p>Previously the section that is being amended by this clause contained two provisions. Firstly, it was necessary to obtain the approval of the State President and, secondly, they were entitled to borrow up to the whole amount of the issued share capital. What the hon. the Minister is asking us to do here, is to give the board the right in its opinion&#x2014;do not forget that Iscor is using public money and is therefore responsible to the public&#x2014;to borrow up to three-quarters of R325 million which amounts to approximately R244 million.</p>

<p>We honestly do not see that any reason has up to now been put forward by the hon. the Minister as to why this very large sum of money should be placed under the discretion of the board. We would be happy to leave it, as previously stated, at the point where the board, with the approval of the hon. the Minister and with the concurrence of the hon. the Minister of Finance, should be entitled to raise that amount, or even more. However, simply to give this power to the board without the Minister&#x2019;s approval being required and without the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s and the State President&#x2019;s consent, does not meet with our approval. One must think in terms of R244 million. The hon. the Minister clearly would not have introduced this Bill if he did not intend increasing the issued capital of Iscor. In the end, if clause 1 is to be believed, the amount will be three-quarters of R994 million, i.e. R745 million.</p>

<p>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS. From what source do you get that figure?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>I simply added on to the present issued capital. There is R325 million and if one goes through clause 1, one sees that 497 million shares can be issued, and those shares will be issued, otherwise the hon. the Minister would not have used the figure of 497 million shares. If you take that and then take three-quarters of R994 million, you arrive at R775 million. The hon. the Minister comes with this Bill and he wants to raise the Government&#x2019;s ability to take shares up to 497 million. Clearly clause 1 covers this, because it will then be three-quarters of the issued share capital as and when the shares are ultimately issued. This has to be seen in proportion, because at the moment Iscor has had to reduce a loan debenture in its endeavours to raise money within South Africa. That debenture was reduced from R20 million to R12 million. The hon. the Minister, however, wants to give away the power of the State President, his power and that of the Minister of Finance to a certain extent, because subsection (2) comes into operation after the horse has been to the water, so to speak. The hon. the Minister wants to give those powers away and he wants to give to the board of Iscor the right to raise R244 million, as it now stands, and clearly an increased amount later on. In no circumstances can I see a business in South Africa at this point in time being allowed such wide power, and especially not a company which requires an overdraft of that nature and more particularly not when you take into account the ability to raise this money over and above the fixed-term loans of Iscor which are already outstanding. That is why we would say to the hon. the Minister that the board should be given the right to raise one-quarter&#x2014;approximately R80 million&#x2014;or three-quarters, provided that the sanction is put on the board to the extent that it has to get the approval which we have suggested.</p>

<from><span class="col_2335-2336" refersTo="page_1184"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Johannesburg North is making certain basic mistakes. In the first place he argues that by accepting clause 1, we would be increasing the share capital of Iscor by bringing it up to 350 million plus 497 million. This is not the position, however. The 497 million replaces the 350 million. Therefore, the total authorized capital of Iscor after the clause has been agreed to will amount to 500 million shares of R2 each. This will then be the total authorized share capital. Another aspect about which the hon. member argued incorrectly in my opinion, concerns the existing section 11 of the Act. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 11. This does not require Iscor to obtain the permission of the Minister of Economic Affairs. All that is being changed fundamentally in section 11 of the Act by means of the proposed new section 11 is the fact that Iscor may obtain bridging finance or overdraft facilities irrespective of whether Iscor is envisaging other issues.</p>

<p>I want to explain this. The hon. member will notice that the existing section 11 stipulates that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board may &#x2026; from time to time &#x2026; in anticipation of the issue of any shares or debentures authorized to be issued under this Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>go and borrow certain sums as bridging facilities depending on the issues or the completion thereof. It is this qualifying part of section 11 for which we now want to substitute a new provision.</p>

<p>I want to go further. The existing section stipulates that Iscor can borrow up to an amount which is equal to the paid-up share capital. A restriction is now being imposed here, namely that Iscor may raise loans up to an amount not exceeding three-fourths of the paid-up share capital of the company. This is what the position will be if an amendment is accepted which I intend to move. Under these circumstances I want to ask the hon. member to understand that what we are aiming at here is merely to remove the qualifying part of the existing section which deals with the ability to raise loans, so that the borrowing of bridging money is not dependent on an already approved issue of shares or debentures by the State President. I want to say in all fairness that the question of the amount which will be borrowed by Iscor in terms of this authorization must depend on its credit-worthiness, just as in the case of any other company. The credit facilities which are extended to it will have to be justified by it in terms of its normal credit-worthiness with its banker. Therefore I really do not think we should worry about this. However, I have already conceded that the existing section 11(1) refers to Iscor&#x2019;s &#x201C;Paid-up share capital&#x201D;. Clause 3, which seeks to amend section 11, contains a provision in terms of which the &#x201C;paid-up share capital&#x201D; will be replaced by &#x201C;issued share capital&#x201D;. I think that this is wrong and I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me try to clear up this confusion between the hon. the Minister and myself. He makes much of the fact that my calculations are based on what he considers to be erroneous figures. Now, clause 1, which he mentioned as the basis of the error, says simply that section 7 of the Iron and Steel Industry Act of 1928 is amended by the substitution in subsection (2) for the expression &#x201C;350 000 000&#x201D; of the expression &#x201C;497 000 000&#x201D;. Section 7(2) of the Act says that with the approval of the State President the board may increase the share capital of the corporation by the creation of additional ordinary B shares of R2 each not exceeding in number 350 million. This now becomes 497 million.</p>

<p>No, I am quite clear about that. It is no less than 497 million and to be issued at not less than par. Therefore, when those 497 million have all been issued there will be R994 million worth of equity capital in Iscor under this heading. I am not adding anything further on to that. Does the hon. the Minister agree with me that the present issued and paid-up capital of Iscor is R325 200 000 as given in the annual report? Those are the two figures on which I base the figure of three-quarters of that. It is either R244 million or R775 million, rounded off to the nearest million. The figures are on such a scale <span class="col_2337-2338" refersTo="page_1185"/>that I simply find it difficult to believe that the Minister can sit there with equanimity, while he says that what he is concerned with is the credit-worthiness of Iscor. As we already know, Iscor&#x2019;s fixed term loans are now R1 285 million. Now this Minister comes to the House and asks us to give Iscor this authority without the approval of the State President, the Minister of Economic Affairs or of the Minister of Finance. Yet under certain circumstances, as from now Iscor can raise another R244 million and in future could raise another R775 million. If they do that it would take Iscor&#x2019;s borrowings to over R2 000 million. That would, I agree, be in relation to the increased capital, but still in all normal prudence that would be going too far. This is a public corporation using public money and therefore we ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider whether he will not accept the amendment that approval be required before the board can raise money on this scale, because the total borrowings of Iscor is clearly something which is of public concern.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me say at once that wherever provision is made for borrowing powers in the articles of association of any company, that surely does not mean that loans to the maximum amount will be raised without further ado. Let us now consider what the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment means. In terms of the existing section 11, the Board of Iscor, subject to the conditions imposed, viz. that it must be in anticipation of the issue of shares or debentures, is empowered to raise a loan for bridging finance equal to its paid-up capital. In other words, if clause 1 is agreed to, then under the existing section 11 of its Act, Iscor would be entitled to borrow an amount equal to its paid-up capital. We now propose that section 11 be amended in two respects. Firstly that the borrowing power in section 11 not be linked to the envisaged issue of shares or debentures and that that part of the existing section 11 which applies to this proviso, should fall away. But then, in the second place, we propose that the amount which may be borrowed in terms of this borrowing power in the existing section 11, should not be equal to the paid-up capital, but to three-quarters of it. If we were to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, it would mean that the borrowing power in terms of amounts which Iscor could borrow would be smaller than its present borrowing capacity. Does the hon. member agree with me? The total paid-up capital of Iscor, if all the shares were to be taken up in terms of section 1 as now amended, would be R1 000 million. If the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is accepted, Iscor can borrow a quarter of that under section 11, viz. R250 million.</p>

<p>&#x2020;That is in terms of his amendment. But without amending section 11 at all Iscor can now borrow an amount equivalent to its paid-up capital. In other words, he wants to reduce Iscor&#x2019;s capacity to borrow in terms of the existing section.</p>

<p>*Surely, Sir, this is totally impractical. Besides being impractical, it is also a retrogressive step as far as Iscor&#x2019;s borrowing power are concerned. But with respect, Sir, I think that the hon. member is still arguing incorrectly. We introduced this legislation with the specific aim firstly, of enlarging the share capital so as to improve Iscor&#x2019;s asset/liability ratio. That is the whole basis of the legislation we are now considering. In the second place, our aim in regard to the clause now under discussion is, to increase Iscor&#x2019;s borrowing power by doing away with the condition linked to the issue of shares, and then to limit it by saying that it can no longer borrow an amount equal to its paid-up share capital, but only up to an amount equivalent to three-quarters of it. Lastly, the creditworthiness of any borrower of bridging or other facilities at a bank is determined, firstly, by his balance sheet, and secondly, of course, by his asset/liability ratio. Where the hon. member&#x2019;s precautionary measure ought to apply is where the State itself is involved in such a loan or where the State acts as guarantor. That specific proviso is contained in section 11(2). In other words, if I want to guarantee a loan, I must obtain the approval of the Minister of Finance, because in that case we are binding the State. Under these circumstances, Sir, I repeat that I am unable to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister says that in terms of section 11 Iscor has wider powers. I would dispute that, because previously the board&#x2019;s power to borrow in terms of this section were in anticipation of the issue of any shares or <span class="col_2339-2340" refersTo="page_1186"/>debentures authorized to be issued under the Act. It could borrow from any other person or bank moneys not exceeding the amount of such debentures and shares, and may further from time to time borrow with the approval of the State President. Sir, that is a fairly close restriction, to allow it to borrow in advance of raising any money by debentures and in advance of capital being injected through the budget or to borrow with the approval of the State President. Each one of these three things now falls away and the only restriction imposed is that it must not exceed three-fourths of the paid-up capital, which is the subject of the Minister&#x2019;s amendment, as opposed to the issued share capital, which in a numerical sense could be described as being larger and giving greater freedom. Against this background clearly a wider power is being given to the board even though it can only be three-quarters of the amount.</p>

<p>Quite frankly I do not understand the rationale behind the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment, because in the case of Iscor I cannot, to be quite truthful, see the difference between what is the paid-up and the issued capital, particularly when you look at the terms under which the capital shares may be issued. So we have no difficulty in accepting the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment, although I must say I was slightly curious to know why he put it in the sense of the difference between the paid-up share capital and the issued share capital.</p>

<p>But in so far as the prior argument is concerned, there is no doubt in our minds that the amendment of section 11(1) is giving much wider powers to the board of Iscor, and therefore our amendment must stand, because we would have thought that to give the board of Iscor the right to raise R244 million for the purposes which have been outlined, is more than sufficient, particularly when you look at it against the background of the normal rules of prudence in regard to public corporations, which demand their total borrowings should not exceed their paid-up capital plus reserves. In Iscor&#x2019;s case this is nearly R663 million. It is a lot of money. It is the public&#x2019;s money. However, against that Iscor has already borrowed R1 285 million and, therefore, we hold fast to not giving this power to the board of Iscor.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to react very briefly to what the hon. member said. The point is specifically that we are amending the Act in order to improve Iscor&#x2019;s asset/liability ratio. This means that fundamentally, we do not really have anything to argue about. That is why we all agreed that we should increase Iscor&#x2019;s share capital. As regards its second source of capital, viz. loans, there are various ways in which Iscor can borrow money. This is covered by section 10 and by section 10bis. In these sections, Iscor&#x2019;s borrowing power is defined. In terms of section 11 it is granted temporary borrowing power above and beyond the provisions of section 10. In terms of the existing section 11, there are two limiting factors with regard to its temporary borrowing power. The one is that a loan may not exceed the shares or debentures and it must take place in anticipation of such increase in shares or debentures. In other words, it must have already been approved. That is the first limitation.</p>

<p>There is a second measure relating to borrowing power, too. It is that the Board, with the State President&#x2019;s approval, may borrow an additional amount. What this amounts to is that, taking the restriction into account, a total amount of not more than its authorized or issued share capital may be borrowed under that provision.</p>

<p>What are we doing now? As far as the first restriction is concerned, we are no longer linking the borrowing power in this section to an issue of shares or of debentures; that falls away. Secondly, we say that the utilization of the other power, viz. that relating to loans, is now limited to three quarters of its paid-up share capital. The section of the limitations which is being deleted is that relating to the State President. That is what is stated here.</p>

<p>Section 11(1) concerns money which may be regarded as temporary finance and is borrowed as such. The State is not bound by these loans. The State is only bound when it guarantees. If and when the State is asked to give a guarantee, then the permission of the Minister of Finance must be obtained.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say that there is not one of us here who does not believe that for many reasons, and particularly with a view to sound business practice, Iscor&#x2019;s asset/Iiability ratio is wrong and that we should do everything in our power to improve it. We have taken the first step by increasing its authorized capital. I have also said, in all fairness, that the <span class="col_2341-2342" refersTo="page_1187"/>Pistorius committee of investigation is engaged in examining <i>inter alia</i> the other source of capital formation within Iscor itself, and the price policy followed in regard to steel, in order to determine whether there should not be changes allowing Iscor to form capital within its own set-up. This could then be an addition to the share capital which would result in an improvement in its asset/liability ratio.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are still not satisfied on this point. The hon. the Minister makes out that this is purely a procedural measure. However, I think the hon. the Minister is getting close to the point of accepting that section 11, in the main, was utilized to allow temporary finance to be obtained until permanent finance, in terms of section 10, could be raised.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>That is exactly what the hon. the Minister said. However, in terms of section 11 permanent loan finance will now be able to be raised. There is no reason why it should not be. We are now talking about a public corporation taking on debts in the region of R700 million. This would be possible under this provision, where it was never possible before. Previously loans could be raised in anticipation of the issue of shares. Now we are going to have the situation where an enormous debt can be built up. The hon. the Minister has said that this is not healthy from a business point of view, and we agree with the hon. the Minister. We welcome the fact that he has said that something should be done about this. However, until something is done about it, the permanent debt&#x2014;this is what it could be&#x2014;could increase tremendously as against the equity. Unless something is done about it, the situation will deteriorate from what is now accepted as unhealthy, to an even unhealthier situation. We believe that the hon. member for Johannesburg North&#x2019;s amendment is reasonable, and if the hon. the Minister wants Iscor to have this power to borrow up to three-quarters of its share capital we will go along with it provided it is done with the consent of the hon. the Minister so that, if things do go wrong, as they very well could, then the hon. the Minister, when he comes to the House, will have to explain why he gave his consent.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In terms of the provisions of the present Electricity Act, 1958 (Act 40 of 1958), the Electricity Supply Commission (Escom) is authorized to supply electricity in bulk at any point on the borders of the Republic, but not beyond the borders of the Republic.</p>

<p>However, Escom is already supplying electricity within the territories of certain homelands, such as the Transkei. The proposed political emancipation of the homelands and especially the attainment of independence by the Transkei later this year will mean that provision will have to be made for Escom to be able to supply electricity to a territory outside the borders of the Republic. Since it will probably be quite some time before independent homeland governments are in a position to undertake an electricity supply function within their homelands themselves, the Government has deemed fit to amend the Act as proposed in clause 1 in order to enable Escom to generate and distribute electricity within such area at the request of such homeland government or with the prior approval of the Minister of Economic Affairs and on the conditions which the Minister may determine.</p>

<p>For the information of hon. members I may mention that such a request has already been made to the Central Government by the Government of the Transkei, which is to receive full independence later this year, and <span class="col_2343-2344" refersTo="page_1188"/>that Escom at present owns assets amounting to more than R20 million in transmission lines and other equipment in the Transkei.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Escom has recorded its preparedness to render such services on request in territories outside the Republic provided that an indemnity against any losses it may incur consequent on any act or omission of the Government of such a territory is provided to Escom by the Government of the Republic.</p>

<p>Clause 1(4) provides for the issuing of such indemnities by the Minister of Economic Affairs with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance. In principle these indemnities can be compared with the existing statutory provision for the issuing of indemnities by the Government of the Republic in favour of industrialists who undertake the establishment of industries within the homelands.</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of the present Act, no undertaker may generate or distribute electricity without a licence by the Electricity Control Board. As a newly established Government such as the Transkei may not immediately be in a position to appoint an Electricity Control Board, clause 2 provides that the Electricity Control Board of the Republic may, at the request of the Government of such territory, assist the Government concerned to exercise control over the generation and the provision of electricity by an undertaker including Escom within its territory.</p>

<p>Clause 3 contains the short title.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in this particular regard, I wish to refer to the proposed amendment to clause 1 of the Bill, as printed in the name of the hon. member for Wonderboom. This proposed amendment improves the present wording of the proposed subsection 4A(1)(b) of the Act and I am prepared to accept it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to say immediately that we on this side of the House will support the Second Reading of this Bill. If we have any reservations at all about this Bill, they would perhaps relate to the fact that this Bill is not yet able to go as far as we might wish in respect of the distribution of electricity not only in the territories of South Africa and its immediate homeland neighbours, but far wider afield. We have spoken in this House before of a concept of interdependence throughout the Southern African sub-continent and we believe that there is a potential in the whole of this sub-continent for the development of energy which will work for the benefit of all members of a greater community of nations and for the future stability of the countries of the subcontinent. This is the direction in which we would like to see things move. The Bill which is before us does not deal with all these matters, but maybe the time will come, before too many years, when we shall be able to draw up legislation in order to facilitate the development of these great schemes. For the time being, however, we believe that the Bill is adequate for its immediate purpose. We believe that the amendment, as proposed by the hon. member for Wonderboom, expands that function and we also have no objection to the acceptance of that amendment. I merely rise at this stage to say that we shall give passage to the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, like the hon. member for Von Brandis, we in these benches have no objection to this Bill and shall support its Second Reading, primarily because we are in favour of the principle involved, which is a broadening of Escom&#x2019;s activities. We are a trifle disappointed in one sense, namely that it is only concerned with the homelands, which are now defined as not being part of South Africa, because we would certainly be in favour of the principle of increasing trade further afield than that, in the case of Escom and other South African corporations. We have an amendment to this Bill, simply because it is a matter of public interest when negotiations take place or an agreement is reached with the Transkei or indeed with countries further afield. The only other matter we would ask the hon. the Minister to make reference to when he replies, is in the new section 4A(4) where it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance indemnify the commission against any losses it may incur consequent on any act or omission of the Government or administration of any territory outside the Republic.</block>

<p>I would have thought that if, for instance, Escom enters into such an agreement, either with the Government of the Transkei or with the Government of another country without <span class="col_2345-2346" refersTo="page_1189"/>the borders of South Africa as now understood, the Minister should be prepared to give that indemnity on a much broader basis, simply on the grounds that it is not only the Government or the administration of any territory which may cause losses to Escom. I wonder if the hon. the Minister could, when he replies, explain why the grant of such an indemnity should be restricted to a Government or to an administration. Escom could in the future, in terms of this Bill, supply power to Mozambique, or to Angola or to various other countries, and there are certain circumstances where I think Escom would want an indemnity on a much broader scale than simply in respect of the Government or administration of that specific territory. As I have said, we will support this Bill at Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have simply risen to convey my thanks to hon. members on the Opposition side who support this legislation. When one is an engineer, one cannot help realizing, when one sees a power line, that it is loaded with energy and that where the power is going, there will be development and progress leading to prosperity. Where all these factors are available, peace and quiet are also assured. Looking at such a power line, one perceives that it is synonymous with the National Party, particularly if one looks at the prospects for the Transkei. There the National Party has furnished proof that over the 28 years of its r&#x00E9;gime it has created prosperity, development and peace through its legislation and policy.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I subscribe to what was said by the hon. member for Wonderboom, and I too should like to express my appreciation to the hon. Opposition for their support of the Bill. In clause 1, of course, the contentious words &#x201C;South West Africa&#x201D; occur, and I am surprised at the fact that no one has found anything strange about them, especially since South West Africa is becoming conspicuous in the international forum today. I hope that when other aspects of South West Africa&#x2019;s affairs are dealt with, the hon. Opposition will give similar support to them.</p>

<p>Over the years there has been a tremendous population increase in South West Africa, especially since contact was made with the White Western civilization. This applies to White as well as non-White, of course. Over the years the subsistence economy has become insufficient and a need has arisen for another form of economy. For that reason the Government decided at the time, in consequence of the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission, to take certain steps. At that time, mention had already been made of linking up the territory&#x2019;s electrical network with that of the Republic. A recommendation was also made in regard to the development of the Ruacana scheme.</p>

<p>I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you will not rule me out of order if I refer to a recent statement <span class="col_2347-2348" refersTo="page_1190"/>regarding the generation of electricity in South West Africa, in which the allegation was made that the generation of electricity at Ruacana would affect the development pattern of South West Africa. The statement was made that since the electricity was being generated in Angola, the mines of South West Africa would suffer if the scheme were not completed. But the mines of South West Africa are not dependent on the hydro-electric power of the Ruacana scheme, but on electricity supplied by thermal power stations in Windhoek. There is the Van Eck power station where 90 megawatt is generated for domestic consumption in South West Africa. To this must be added the power which is generated by municipal power stations, such as those in Windhoek and Walvis Bay. In addition, there are reserve power stations which are not generating any power at the moment because power for the whole network is at present provided by the 90 megawatt power station at Windhoek. There is not a very great need for power from Ruacana for the mining industry at the moment. The development of the Ruacana scheme arises from the needs of the non-White areas in South West Africa, especially Owambo. The supply of electricity to South West Africa is a bread and butter matter. The idea of linking up South West Africa with the power network of South Africa holds great possibilities.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank hon. members for their support of this Bill. The hon. member for Von Brandis has indicated that he thought we could go much further in future. Once this Bill has become law, it will be possible for Escom to provide and distribute power in just about every country and every territory outside the Republic of South Africa. I support the hon. member&#x2019;s line of thinking, because there are many common goals that South Africa and the other countries in southern Africa can attain and can achieve together. I think it is quite obvious and obligatory that we should accentuate those things that we have in common with countries and not always accentuate those things which we disagree on amongst ourselves.</p>

<p>*Let me emphasize that I do not have the slightest doubt that the Bill we are presently considering, in terms of the principles contained in it, very clearly sets us on the road of co-operation with other countries and other states in Southern Africa, in other fields than those obtaining today. It may be a good thing that the Transkei can be the motivating factor for enabling South Africa to provide electricity beyond the borders of our own country. I thank the hon. members for their support in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North asked me why the indemnity contained in subsection 4 of the clause was restricted to actions by the Governments or administrations concerned. In this particular regard I have to point out that this is the kind of risk against which Escom cannot insure itself. Allow me to give you a theoretical example. If Escom were to supply electricity to a particular country in terms of the powers conferred upon it by this legislation and the government of that country were to decide to nationalize Escom&#x2019;s assets there, this would not be a risk which Escom should take upon itself as an entrepreneur. For this reason we grant it the indemnity which is similar in content and in wording to the indemnity granted to other industries as well. I indicated this in my Second Reading speech.</p>

<p>The other ordinary business and operating risks Escom has to take upon itself, and I want to add at once that Escom is in fact prepared to do so.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I hope that in the light of this explanation the hon. member will accept the clause as it stands.</p>

<p>*I want to express my sincere thanks to the hon. member for Wonderboom for the contribution he made as well as for his amendment. I have already indicated that I shall accept it. The amendment improves the <span class="col_2349-2350" refersTo="page_1191"/>wording and the scope of the objects of the legislation. I thank the hon. member for this. To the hon. member for Etosha I want to say that I know that he is making an important contribution to the provision of electric power in South West Africa. I do not want to react in detail at this stage to the standpoint he adopted here. However, I just want to say that the responsibility for the provision of electricity in South West Africa is chiefly vested in the body which was created for this purpose, namely Swawec. The Industrial Development Corporation is the shareholder of Swawec and the work is done by Escom, which acts as an agent. I may just add that we have no intention of discontinuing our activities at the Ruacana scheme.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to say something more, something which I consider to be very important. Hon. members will know that Escom has had to undertake tremendous expansions in recent years. These expansions have involved extremely high capital and other costs. The said expansions were necessitated by the constantly increasing power consumption in the Republic. Because of various factors, such as the delayed supply of power from Cabora Bassa, and technical problems&#x2014;I should like to emphasize this&#x2014;which have been experienced with the highly sophisticated equipment there, and also because of a growth rate which is much higher than was originally predicted, the ability of Escom to meet the great demand during the coming winter will be tried to the utmost. If, because of the technical reasons I have referred to, the supply of power from Cabora Bassa should not be available during the forthcoming winter, and if we should have a cold winter, I want to warn even now that the electricity supply will have to be curtailed. In this connection I want to protest against the electricity which is wasted in our country every day. I want to allege in all seriousness that if there is one field in which each of us can make a contribution&#x2014;to the combating of inflation as well&#x2014;it is in the field of power conservation. Even if every individual contribution in this connection were to be modest, I believe that our collective contribution would assume proportions which we ourselves could not have believed possible.</p>

<p>Every member of every family, including the children. In order to prevent the curtailment of electricity, Escom and municipalities will have to make greater use of older and less economic power stations. This will inevitably involve higher costs. This is another reason for my appeal to be judicious and economical as far as power consumption is concerned.</p>

<p>It is quite clear to me that we waste electric power more than anything else. If we do not eliminate the wastage, Escom may be obliged to take radical steps, something which should rather be avoided. While making this appeal to individual consumers, I want to make the same appeal to municipalities, which are also large electricity consumers, to do everything in their power to avoid wasting electricity.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I should like to say something about the proposed amendment of the hon. member for Johannesburg North. The effect of his amendment is briefly that when Escom enters into an agreement with another country or another administration for the supply of electricity to the particular country or administration, the agreement between Escom and that particular country or administration is to be tabled in Parliament. I want to request the hon. member at once to give very serious consideration to withholding his amendment. I want to suggest to him that it may be in the national interest for agreements of this nature, as well as other agreements, not to be tabled. The hon. member for Johannesburg North and I were members of this House when provisions of which the wording was the same as that of the amendment which the hon. member is now moving were removed from other legislation because of the same considerations. For the same reasons I request him not to expect me to conduct any detailed argument on this matter. I want to draw his attention to the Customs and Excise Act, Act No. 91 of 1964. The hon. member need not write it down. I am only referring to it to illustrate my point. Section 52 of the Act&#x2014;this section was repealed in 1974&#x2014;provided for lateral and other trade agreements between South Africa and other countries to be tabled in Parliament. When this provision was repealed, I motivated this step in full to this hon. House. The reasons for the deletion of section 52 apply similarly to the non-insertion of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment into this legislation. I do not want to go into any greater detail, but I just want to <span class="col_2351-2352" refersTo="page_1192"/>request the hon. member not to move his amendment.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the amendment I want to move myself. It almost slipped my mind. This amendment is solely concerned with metrication. I intend moving that a new clause be inserted to follow clause 2, a clause which will read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Electricity Act of 1958 is amended by the substitution for the expressions &#x201C;unit&#x201D; and &#x201C;million units&#x201D;, wherever they occur, of the expressions &#x201C;kilowatt hour&#x201D; and &#x201C;Gigawatt hour&#x201D; respectively&#x2014;</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will not take long. I am sorry to say that I cannot accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s appeal and I see no likelihood of his accepting the amendment of which I have given notice. In the circumstances of this Bill and what has been mentioned, I find it extremely difficult to see why the hon. the Minister should not come to Parliament within 14 days and table a report on the negotiations. We are dealing here with the generation of an electricity supply. There is nothing very sinister about that. It is difficult to see how it can be of such importance, even with the present position in South Africa, where, when an agreement is entered into by a public corporation, using public money, the proceedings cannot be tabled in Parliament. I leave this for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s consideration and now move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Department of Industries at present have 52 posts for sea fisheries inspectors. The incumbents of the posts are responsible for carrying out of inspection services along the full length of the coast-line of the Republic and South West Africa, with a view to the application of the provisions and regulations of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1973 (Act 58 of 1973), which makes provision for the protection of and control over the exploitation of the marine resources of the Republic and South West Africa.</p>

<p>Hon. members will agree with me that this is a task of considerable magnitude to carry out with a limited number of inspectors, and my department has consequently investigated the possibilities of expanding the inspection services in question without employing additional staff.</p>

<p>It has been found that the nature conservation officers in the employ of the Administration of South West Africa, and possibly, too, those of the provinces of Natal and the Cape, will in the normal course of their duties be able to act to good effect as fisheries inspectors as well in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1973. In this way the present number of inspectors could therefore be augmented to a considerable extent. An agreement has already been reached with the Administration of South West Africa in this regard, and similarly, consultations with the other provinces concerned will take place as and when necessary.</p>

<p>In the ordinance they are described as &#x201C;officers&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x2020;The amendment in clause 2 of the Bill, as well as the consequential amendment in clause 1, will therefore enable the Minister of Economic Affairs to authorize the nature conservation officials I have referred to, to act as sea fisheries inspectors in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1973, and in so doing to strengthen the existing inspection service.</p>

<p>Furthermore, clause 2 will also enable the Secretary for Industries to delegate his powers with regard to the issuing of certificates of appointment, carried by sea fisheries inspectors for identification purposes, to officials designated by the Secretary.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to refer to the amendment to clause 1 of the Bill, as printed in my name on page 103 of the Order Paper. It was brought to the attention of my department that nature conservation and tourism officials in South West Africa are appointed in terms of the Administration Employers Ordinance, 1957, of South West Africa. As this ordinance <span class="col_2355-2356" refersTo="page_1194"/>deals with personnel matters and does not &#x201C;relate to nature conservation&#x201D;, as stipulated by the present wording of the definition in clause 1 of the Bill, an amendment thereof is necessary to make possible the appointment also of these officers as sea fisheries inspectors, as originally intended.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has explained very fully to the House what the underlying intentions of this Bill are. We on this side of the House supported the original Act in 1973. We believe that, with our tremendous coastline and our rich natural maritime resources, it is essential that we should at all times be conscious of the need to protect these resources from exploitation by persons who do not have the best interests of South Africa at heart. Therefore we have pleasure in supporting this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is an Arabian proverb which, I believe, may well be applied in dealing with the Bill now before the House. According to this proverb a fool may be known by three things. These are: Speech profit, change without progress, and putting trust in a stranger.</p>

<p>I believe that as far as sea fishing is concerned, there are certain strangers whom we cannot, and do not, trust. It is therefore necessary to provide for even more effective supervision of the sea around our coast and the exploitation thereof. Secondly, the proposed change, or amplification, of the present legislation is patently an improvement and therefore constitutes progress. Finally, as there does not seem to be any opposition to this measure, there is clearly no profit in further speech about it.</p>

<p>Sir, I gladly support this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, despite the comments of the hon. member for Mossel Bay, who feels that there may be no profit in any further talk about the matter, I intend stating the attitude of us in these benches. We welcome this Bill in that it is introducing into the Fisheries Act of 1973 the concept that a nature conservation officer is a person who should also interest himself in the conservation, regulation and control of our diminishing resources of fish, crayfish, mussel, oysters and other wealth of the sea. Any Bill that provides for an increase in the number of people who can put a stop to the numerous malpractices that occur around our shores, will have the support of the members on these benches.</p>

<p>Perhaps this Bill does not go far enough. Firstly, it appears that the hon. the Minister is introducing in this Bill the concept of a nature conservation officer without defining his powers. I can see nothing in the Bill that defines the powers of the nature conservation officer. The powers of other officers, such as the honorary fisheries officer, are defined, but those of the nature conservation officer are not defined. Surely there should be a consequential amendment to section 6 of the Act defining the powers also of such an officer. They should at least be given the powers of an honorary fisheries officer as defined in section 6(4). Possibly, they should be given even greater powers than that. This appears to have been an oversight on the part of the hon. the Minister. Perhaps he can explain in his reply exactly what the defined powers of the nature conservation officer are.</p>

<p>At this stage this Bill is especially welcome, because I do not believe we have enough officers at the present time to enforce regulations and restrictions designed to conserve our marine resources. There are not nearly enough officers to do a good job and as a result in certain areas along our coast there is very little control. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister just how many officers of the Department of Sea Fisheries operate in the False Bay area, for instance. Secondly, I would ask him how many officers are operating on the other side of Cape Point, i.e. on the Atlantic side. I ask these questions because I believe that the priorities as to the most important aspects of control are sometimes misdirected. There are officers who with a great deal of enthusiasm will report and act on crayfish poaching when some miserable offender has been caught with a few illegal crayfish. This is very necessary control, and must continue. It has done wonders for building up the crayfish population. However, I believe that many far greater evils exist, evils over which there is very little control indeed. We need more officers, because I believe that more must be done in certain areas. On the Simonstown side of False Bay I believe control is inadequate.</p>

<p>In what respect?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Just listen to what I am going to say. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can tell me how many trek licences have been issued for the area between Muizenberg and Macassar? From my own observations I would say that there are a great number. My information is that many of these netting operations are carried out with nets that are illegal. In fact, while walking along the beach the other day, I myself saw an illegal net being used. How many officers are in fact employed by the department in this area?</p>

<p>Another area which should receive attention by the department&#x2019;s officers is the Agulhas area, off Struisbaai. I believe there is only one office, stationed at Arnison, controlling this area. I should think that if a proper job is to be done in this area, something like ten officers are required. I have information that a certain commercial fisherman was given permits to net tunny on an experimental basis in an area to the west of the Agulhas lighthouse. In all the time he has had this permit, this fisherman has hardly landed a single tunny. I am told that he has used his tunny permit as an excuse to net vast numbers of yellowtail illegally within the demarcated area of the Agulhas Bank, off Struisbaai. So far he has not been caught. If the hon. the Minister is interested in pursuing this matter, I am quite prepared to give him the name of the man concerned. I think that the whole question of the issuing of an experimental tunny permit should be reviewed from time to time and that this gentleman should be asked how many tunny he has caught since he has been given that permit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I accept your ruling. The point I am making is that abuse of this nature cannot be allowed to continue and that one lone officer, stationed at Arniston, is not enough to do a proper job.</p>

<p>Many of the offenders, and especially commercial fishing boats, are not adequately controlled because there are not enough officers to do the work. Many of the commercial fishing boats have sophisticated radar equipment so that, when control vessels come into the area, they are detected straightaway and the boats have time to stop their illegal fishing. The point is, again, that there are not enough officers at the moment. I would go so far as to say that many of the problems that confront the people in the Arniston community are the result of illegal operations by boats netting in that area. There are just not enough officers to control it. I do not have to tell the hon. the Minister that these boats can bring in 40 tons of fish at a time and are; I believe, in fact doing so. It is sensible conservation policy to employ more law-enforcement officers in this area.</p>

<p>I should like to take this opportunity to suggest to the hon. the Minister that it would be a positive move on his part if he would appoint to the Fisheries Advisory Board independent conservation representatives to advise the council on matters of this nature. This would counter-balance vested interest, commercial fishing interests.</p>

<p>This is done in the United States of America. As a matter of fact, in that country the Fisheries Advisory Council also includes a representative of sport fishing, because they realize just what big business sport fishing is. I am certain that the hon. the Minister realizes just how important this aspect is to tourism. Fishing is an important attraction to tourists, but if there are no fish, there will also be no fishing tourists. Once again, more officers are needed to ensure that the tourist have something to catch.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am rising simply to express my thanks for the support for this <span class="col_2359-2360" refersTo="page_1196"/>legislation, even if the method of support is frequently incomprehensible. I just want to repeat that precisely because we have too few inspectors&#x2014;you will recall that I indicated that we had 52&#x2014;it is not physically possible for them to carry out a proper inspection service in all respects and exercise control properly, and that for this reason we want to make use of all the officers of the provinces whose work more or less corresponds to that of these inspectors in order to augment the inspection services. The hon. member for Mossel Bay referred very appropriately to an old saying in the Arab countries. I think that he as a lawyer, as I am, would best be able to appreciate the first part of that saying in particular, which is that one does not speak without payment. I appreciate the support.</p>

<p>I just want to reply to the hon. member for Orange Grove. Apart from designating specific inspectors to specific areas, we also designate additional inspectors when necessary and therefore I am not able to tell him how many inspectors have from time to time been allocated to the False Bay area or to the Atlantic portion around Cape Point. The inspectors are used where their services are required the most in terms of priority, and therefore they naturally move around. But I just want to indicate in this regard that a patrol boat is stationed at Gordons Bay. There is therefore an element of mobility with regard to the work of the inspectors. The second point to which I think I must reply is the hon. member&#x2019;s problem in regard to the fact that nature conservation officers are not defined. He asked what the powers of such officers would be. Now I want to say at once that nature conservation officers are appointed in terms of the ordinances of the provinces, except in South West Africa, where this is done under another ordinance. There is, therefore, a definition of what a &#x201C;nature conservation officer&#x2019;&#x2019; is in the ordinances of the provinces. In other words, we know whom we are appointing, to begin with, but as soon as we have appointed him, he is appointed in terms of our own Act and he becomes an officer in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act, and his powers are the same as those of the officers of Sea Fisheries, in terms of section 6 of that Act. Therefore, just to reassure the hon. member: As and when the officials are appointed, they are appointed in terms of this Sea Fisheries Act of 1973.</p>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>One of the methods relied on in the South African national economy to ensure a fair distribution of wealth and prosperity is sound competition in trade and industry. The main instrument available to the Government with which to maintain and promote such competition is the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act (Act No. 24 of 1955).</p>

<p>Last year I requested certain bodies, <i>inter alia</i> the Administration of South West Africa, to take steps relating to certain restrictive trade practices. However, the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act of 1955 was not applicable to the territory of South West Africa and in view of my request, the Executive Committee of South West Africa asked that this Act be suitably amended to allow me to exercise the powers granted to me in terms of the Bill in South West Africa as well.</p>

<p>Consequently, the Bill at present before the House only provides for the application of this Act in the territory of South West Africa in accordance with the request by the Executive Committee of the territory, so that they in their turn may comply with my request and take due action against restrictive trade practices.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p><span class="col_2363-2364" refersTo="page_1198"/>Last year the Sale of Land on Installments Act, No. 72 of 1971, was amended. During the debates in connection with the Bill before the House on that occasion, certain hon. members suggested that the Act should be further amended. At the time I promised that I would look at suggestions hon. members had made in this connection during the recess. However, it was not possible to find an acceptable solution in respect of all the suggestions concerned. In this connection I want to say that I intend repeatedly examining suggestions to which I was unable to find a solution for the purposes of the legislation under consideration at the moment. In future I shall not have the slightest hesitation in coming to the House with amendments of this legislation when it is deemed feasible for us to do so. Under the circumstances I deemed it advisable this year to move only a number of amendments which appear to be necessary as a result of the suggestions mentioned.</p>

<p>&#x2020;However, I must once again assure hon. members that, although it has not been possible to introduce legislation this year which caters for all the suggestions for amendments to the Act received last year, I shall always be prepared to consider suggestions for amendments to an Act of such a technical nature as the one which is now under consideration if these amendments are reasonable and should, to my mind, be accepted.</p>

<p>I now propose to deal shortly with the principles embodied in the Bill before the House. In clause 1 of the Bill an amendment to section 11(9) of the Act is proposed. Under the existing provisions of the said section any purchaser who, in order to obtain transfer of land, pays transfer duty and costs which are payable by an intermediary or any predecessor of an intermediary, may sign on behalf of such intermediary or such predecessor all the documents required in connection with the payment of transfer duty or in connection with the actual transfer of the land. It would appear that the section, as it is presently phrased, opens the way to fraudulent actions.</p>

<p>*Accordingly, I considered it advisable and desirable to move that the provision concerned should be deleted. I want to emphasize that the present provision could lead to much abuse. The purchaser who is not able to take transfer because certain necessary documents required for the transfer of land are not signed, will, however, find himself in a difficult position. Therefore, in clause 3 of the amendment Bill, it is now proposed that section 17 of the Act be amended to make provision for a procedure according to which such a purchaser, in the event of his being unable to obtain the documents concerned because someone has not signed them, can obtain a court order in terms of which a deputy sheriff of the Supreme Court or a messenger of the Court is empowered to sign on behalf of an intermediary or any predecessor of the intermediary. A magistrate within whose area of jurisdiction the land in question is situated, will also be empowered to grant such an order. Furthermore it is suggested in clause 2 of the Bill that a proviso should be added to section 13(1) of the Act. At present, section 13(1) of the Act requires the seller to give the buyer of the land on installments 30 days&#x2019; notice, if the buyer should fail to pay his installments, before the seller can take legal action. It is alleged that buyers, because of this provision, regularly fail to pay their installments when they are due. The proposed proviso will now state clearly that a seller only has to give notice as prescribed in section 13(1) twice in one calendar year to a seller who fails to pay the installments when they are due. This means that when notice has been given twice and a buyer then still fails to meet his obligations, the notice required in terms of section 13(1) is no longer necessary. Should the buyer, after twice receiving notice still fail to pay his installments when due, the seller may in the calendar year in question, demand that the purchaser meet his obligation within seven days.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise immediately to say that we are going to support the hon. the Minister in the Second Reading of the Bill. I think he will agree that when the original Act became law, the discussions that took place leading up to the passing of the Act indicated that there was a deep desire on all sides of the House that we should bring about accord in this somewhat difficult subject dealing with the sale of land on installments. It also became apparent that South Africans have their roots deep in the soil of South Africa and that every South African has a dream that, at some time or the other in his life, he will have the security which is represented by being a landowner, a shareholder <span class="col_2365-2366" refersTo="page_1199"/>in the land of South Africa. The Bill itself was a difficult one, and gave our legal fraternity considerable headaches. We appreciate the attitude of the hon. the Minister in having given an undertaking to the House that he would see what difficulties arose from the application of the Act and that he would come to this House with certain amendments, which were suggested by all parties in the House, including the Government itself. Therefore I have pleasure in supporting the Bill. Our legal experts will deal with the matter in greater detail in the Committee Stage.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. A. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to express my appreciation for the standpoint adopted by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens. This amendment Bill before the House contains two important amendments which are exceptional improvements. The present position in an intermediary transaction is that the last purchaser is entitled to sign the documents needed to obtain transfer, himself, on behalf of an absent or vanished seller. In this way registration of transfer will be greatly facilitated and expedited. However, an abuse could develop, in that a final purchaser could allege that the intermediary was away, while he, the final purchaser, could possibly still owe money to the so-called vanished intermediary party. Actually, this person is then refusing, on these grounds, to sign documents for the purpose of transfer duty and the passing of transfer.</p>

<p>The concession as regards signing on behalf of an intermediary, is now being withdrawn by clause 1 of this Bill, and in terms of clause 3 it is required of the final purchaser to apply to the magistrate&#x2019;s court in whose area of jurisdiction the land is situated, so as to appoint the deputy sheriff or the messenger of the court to sign the documents, subject to conditions in the court&#x2019;s discretion. This amendment results in a definite improvement, and particularly control. Such an application certainly will not cost a final purchaser much, especially if one considers, on the other hand, that a property only has real value for a person if it is registered in his name.</p>

<p>The second amendment contained in this amendment Bill, results&#x2014;I believe&#x2014;from last year&#x2019;s debate when this legislation was amended. At the moment a seller has to give 30 days&#x2019; written notice to a purchaser who fails to bring his obligations up to date, without limiting the number of times in a specific year that the buyer might fail to meet his obligations. In terms of the amendment the seller is now entitled, when the purchaser fails for a third time during a specific year to meet his payments or obligations, to recover such payments or obligations from the purchaser at seven days&#x2019; notice. This will prevent a troublesome person from postponing meeting his obligations time and again and putting the seller in an embarrassing position. In most transactions of purchase and sale the seller usually has a bond on his property at a building society or otherwise at a financial institution, and this action on the point of a purchaser could therefore cause great embarrassment and sometimes serious problems for a seller in that time and again he wilfully delays his payments, while still complying with the provisions of the law, by waiting to be given 30 days&#x2019; notice every time before bringing his obligations up to date. It is a pleasure to support the proposed legislation and I believe that it is a definite improvement.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. ARONSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this subject was thoroughly debated last year, as the hon. the Minister remembers and as he has mentioned. The Opposition assisted him very materially in amending this Bill, and he accepted several amendments from this side of the House. There seems to be no doubt that as we put the Bill into practice in the years to come, the hon. the Minister will come with further amendments. This is basically consumer legislation, and we try to protect buyers in good faith. It also assists in providing guidelines to sellers, most of whom are reputable, and whose continued operations are dependent on the goodwill and service they generate amongst their buyers. In clauses 1 and 3 we deal with the rights of purchasers and I believe we should apply our minds to the protection of these purchasers against unscrupulous sellers. It is best illustrated by giving an example. A company with limited liability and a few R1 shares is formed. The company then buys a certain number of plots and makes a minimum deposit.</p>

<p>The company gambles on property appreciation and then, as an intermediary, sells the plots on deed of sale at a profit and obtains a small deposit. The company does not, however, fare too well, because it is not making a profit and because of the reverse cash flow, <span class="col_2367-2368" refersTo="page_1200"/>allow their company to go into liquidation. As the shareholders in the company have only limited liability and as their loss is negligible, they have no compunction about allowing this sort of company to go into liquidation and, of course, the purchasers lose everything. Buyers deserve protection against such unscrupulous operators and the way to bring these sellers to book is to make the shareholders of the selling company personally liable whether they are private individuals or whether they are a holding or an associated company. In effect it will mean that the real owners of the property will be on risk if they use a company with limited liability to legitimately take buyers for a ride.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a specific instance where this happened, and I want to know from the hon. member for Johannesburg North whether he agrees with what I have said up to now. I am going to deal with a company in which I believe he has some say. I want to quote from the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 14 November 1975 where it is reported that a company called Vantage Property Trust (Pty.) Limited went into liquidation because, according to the managing director, it had a negative cash flow. If the hon. member for Johannesburg North will listen very carefully, he will find that this company is associated with the Anglo American Group of companies, and I hope that the hon. member for Johannesburg North will be able to tell us that this article in the <i>Financial Mail</i> is false or incorrect in some respect. According to the article, Vantage Property Trust (Pty.) Limited is owned by one other and by Vantage Holdings (Pty.) Limited, a subsidiary of Anglo-American. It goes on to say that the company bought 32 stands on deed of sale. Vantage then resold these stands, also on deed of sale. Vantage suffered from a sharp fall in sales and was not able to continue its payments in respect of the land. The sellers of the land to Vantage therefore cancelled the deed of sale and Vantage forfeited its deposit on the installments. Some of the innocent and unsuspecting buyers who bought from Vantage also lost their money when Vantage went into liquidation. The original sellers to Vantage are now prepared to assist these people who bought from Vantage, subject to certain conditions of course.</p>

<p>If these facts are accurate I think it is a shocking state of affairs that a reputable company, like Anglo-American, can hide behind the skirts of a private limited liability company and let it go into liquidation merely because of a negative cash flow. A buyer dealing with Anglo-American is entitled to believe that they are dealing with a company that will accept responsibility in respect of all its obligations and that there is some substance in any company which is linked to Anglo-American. Surely, it cannot be expected of a buyer of land to go to the Registrar of Companies or check the financial accounts of Vantage or Anglo-American to make sure that the obligations will be met by those companies. If the hon. the Minister accepts my suggestion that liability should extend to the shareholders, then in this particular case Anglo-American will have a liability to the buyers of those properties. The hon. member for Johannesburg North is a supposed campaigner for civil rights. I hope he will also become a campaigner for the financial rights of the small man and that he will ensure that all these buyers who lost money, will be reimbursed for their losses. I see that this amendment encourages people to invest their hard-earned savings in land. I think therefore that it will be a pity for a company like Anglo-American to allow this sort of thing to happen, because people will lose confidence in investing in land.</p>

<p>Order! I think the hon. member must speak to the principles of the Bill. I do not think he ought to raise all the various examples of where things have gone wrong. The hon. member must limit himself to the principles of the Bill as far as possible and give illustrations only within those limits.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#aronson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. ARONSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I accept your ruling. I have made my point. I was dealing specifically with intermediaries as referred to in this Bill and I have said what I wanted to say. We can have all the legislation we like and we can have all the blueprints&#x2014;it is of course good that we have those blueprints&#x2014;but unless the buyer of property knows what he is doing, he is not going to do well. It is essential that a buyer of property, particularly under this Act, must know what he is doing, otherwise he is going to bum his fingers. To those buyers who are circumspect and have done their homework, there is a very good investment in property and there is a lot of money to be made in property, more <span class="col_2369-2370" refersTo="page_1201"/>especially now. I am afraid that many of these buyers do not understand this particular Act and they do not understand the ramifications of the Act. That is why they often lose money through lack of knowledge. I would like the hon. the Minister to consider whether it is not time to come out with a blueprint of guidelines for buyers who buy property under this Act. If the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department coordinates with the S.A. Property Association and with the law society and with the S.A. Institute of Estate Agents and that they thereafter come with guide-lines and with a blueprint, this would be distributed in commerce and industry and will assist buyers tremendously. Buying property is a most sophisticated industry and a small buyer is often at a loss through lack of understanding.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I first of all deal with the issues relevant to the Second Reading of this Bill. Another issue has been introduced and I would like to deal with that a little later. We are very grateful that the hon. the Minister has suggested certain amendments&#x2014;which are necessary and arose in debate previously. I think it is perhaps even more important that he has said that other amendments are also under consideration, that he regards this as a non-political measure and that he will deal with this on its merits and perhaps suggest further amendments to this legislation. I appreciate that, and I think there are a great many people in South Africa who also appreciate it, because this Act requires certain further amendments. One does not however want to put him or his department under pressure in respect of those amendments, but look forward to having another debate on further amendments in this regard. If that is the spirit in which this type of legislation is approached, the consumer in South Africa can only benefit.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the consumer, because there is quite a lot of exploitation when it comes to the sale of land, of stands particularly. In particular I want to refer to the provision which relates to the forfeiture which we are now amending by reasons of the amendments of which notice have been given. One of the things which happens in South Africa at the moment is that there are people, and some of them tend to throw stones at other people, who actually make a living out of forfeitures which they employ in order to take back property. One of the things which we ought to look at, is whether people after having paid substantial amounts out of their savings for houses and stands, they may have to forfeit what they have paid by cancellation of those agreements without going to court or without even getting their written consent to it. Very often we have a situation that the poor man in times of a depression and hardship befalling his family, finds himself in a situation that he cannot pay although he has already paid a substantial amount of his savings on this. In these circumstances there is very real prejudice to the consumer. One of the things which I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider is whether in respect of the forfeiture and the cancellation of deeds of sale, or even in the case of mortgages, where a very substantial sum of money has already been paid, this type of forfeiture should be allowed without the matter coming before a court. In other words, in every case where he stands to forfeit substantial payments, the consumer should be protected in that at least a judicial officer looks at the matter. We have an example of this in the conventional penalties legislation where a discretion can be exercised. Some of the people who wax rich on this, are people who perhaps should look into their own hearts and their own consciences when they throw stones at other people.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say here that I look upon the issue of property and on the issue of people investing, exactly in the same way as does the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens. I believe that it is important for a stable society that people should be allowed to invest in land and in their homes. Equally so, people who have put their savings into this kind of thing, should be protected in the manner in which I suggested.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, may I deal with the hon. member for Walmer? There is, I believe, a code of ethics that applies to members of Parliament, a code in terms of which they when they intend to throw stones at people, should warn those people so that they can prepare themselves in respect of the matters about which stones are going to be thrown.</p>

<p>Not in all cases, but in cases where it is appropriate, and where that jurisdiction is exercised. Part of the difficulty that exists, is whether a special procedure should not be introduced in respect of this type of provision, in terms of which one can reduce the costs involved in order to get this signature. In other words, should it be necessary to get a court order, or should it not in these circumstances be possible, on the filing of an affidavit, to obtain the signature of the sheriff in order to effect this transfer?</p>

<p>I think the difficulty is that the procedure may not allow this to be done on motion proceedings. This, I think, is part of the problem in regard to the increase in costs. What I am particularly interested in, is to ensure that the costs are kept to a minimum in order to avoid any increased burden on the parties involved.</p>

<p>The second amendment that I briefly want to deal with is the question in respect of notices, in terms of which one may end up having a multiplicity of notices. Here again I think we have to look at this provision to see whether it could not be short-circuited any further. Here again, I come back to the point I made earlier, that where there is to be a forfeiture, there should be no forfeiture outside the courts when certain limits have been exceeded. This is a provision which I particularly want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider.</p>
