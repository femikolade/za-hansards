<block name="quote"><span class="col_715-716" refersTo="page_0374"/>That this House requests the Government to have an inquiry instituted into the long-term economic objectives and priorities for the Republic.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the motion is not intended to criticize that what is continually being done by the Government to develop South Africa into an economic giant. On the contrary, it could rather be regarded as evidence of great confidence in the most stable Government in the whole of the modem world. The motion also implies that the mover expects the present Government to remain in power for at least another 25 years.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>I have great appreciation for the Government&#x2019;s planning of South Africa&#x2019;s economic objectives by means of the economic development programme as drawn up by the Economic Advisory Council of the office of the hon. the Prime Minister and the physical development programme. The national physical development programme determines the growth points in the Republic of South Africa. It stimulates industrial settlement, economic progress and economic growth in the designated areas. The national physical development programme takes into consideration all the factors necessary for growth in particular areas and is a very well-considered and well drawn up programme. My motion really concerns long-term planning for the Republic of South Africa. From the nature of the case long-term planning cannot contain all the details. It should merely lay down the broad framework, and development should take place within that pattern. That does not mean to say that the Government does not have a fine record in the sphere of long-term economic development over the past 25 years and longer. We have outstanding examples in our economic history which are indispensable to the Republic of South Africa today. If it had not been for the far-sightedness of the National Party Government in the 1920&#x2019;s and the present National Party Government during the post-war period, we would not have had such fine names in our vocabulary today as Iscor, Sasol, and so on; names which have become household words in South Africa and serve as monuments to a Government which has planned very thoroughly over a very long period.</p>

<p>It can be expected of a government to allow its country to grow to its full economic potential. With the establishment of an economic policy the country&#x2019;s natural resources, which have to be utilized to the full, have to be taken into consideration. I should like to say something more about Iscor. Iscor fulfils a very important function in South Africa. If Iscor had not existed South Africa would not have been in a position to make the best use of its mineral ores and we would still have been importing steel products today.</p>

<p>In this regard Sasol is equally important and not mainly because of the fuel it produces. Sasol is also a very important milestone in the economic history of South Africa in respect of the establishment of a petro-chemical industry. It can be expected of a government to provide its people with employment opportunities and, through the determination of the economic policy, to ensure that a high standard of living will be maintained in the long term. I think the Government also has a proud record in this sphere. In the planning of a long-term economic policy attention should also be given to the country&#x2019;s strategic position in the world, and attention should be given to those sectors in respect of which the country may probably be vulnerable regarding strategic material, for example, fuel, in respect of which we are still vulnerable. The Government should also take into consideration the country&#x2019;s position in the world in other spheres.</p>

<p>Although it does not always concern the economic profitability of a project, it is essential for a country such as South Africa&#x2014;in fact, it is essential for any country&#x2014;that thorough and advance planning be undertaken for those sectors in respect of which a country may probably be vulnerable so that it would not find itself in a difficult position when a time of crisis arises. When I consider, in this regard, the phosphor industry and other industries which have been launched by the Government, it is quite clear that the Government has also given thorough consideration to South Africa&#x2019;s real position in the world.</p>

<p>As we all know, South Africa has for many years been dependent upon gold. There is still confidence in gold. But gold is also an asset that will disappear in course of time. After all, there is only as much gold beneath the earth as has been placed there by the Creator. When <span class="col_717-718" refersTo="page_0375"/>that amount of gold is exhausted one day, it will have to be replaced by something else as export commodity in order to compensate for the loss of revenue from gold. I cannot tell you for how long mining will still exist, or for how long the supply of gold will last before it has all been exploited. I have heard people say it will take 20 or 25 years depending on the prevailing price. When this happens, a substitute for gold will have to be found. This cannot be done overnight. It will take quite a long time to find a substitute for gold, and for that reason it is essential for planning to be undertaken long before the time. What I have in mind is to encourage planning in that direction by means of this motion of mine.</p>

<p>One also thinks of sources of energy other than fuel. Energy is the life-blood of any economy in any part of the world. In this respect one learns with gratitude of the process of the enrichment of uranium which is being developed in South Africa. In this sphere, too, the Government has a proud record.</p>

<p>There is also another sphere in respect of which long-term planning has taken place, and that is in the sphere of decentralization. The modem world decentralizes for various reasons. There is, <i>inter alia,</i> the problem of overpopulation in the larger industrial cities with its attendant disadvantages of pollution, transport problems, housing problems and even social problems. It is a fact that the world is moving towards decentralization to combat these evils. Thanks to this Government South Africa also has a policy of decentralization. Decentralization in South Africa is taking place as a result of the industrial settlement in intensively industrialized areas around and near the homelands, as they are known. Although the reasons for decentralization in other countries are of a purely economic nature, it is a fact that decentralization is also taking place in South Africa for constitutional and political reasons. Therefore, we have two reasons for our having to decentralize. In the decentralization of our industries, the moving thereof to border areas as far as is possible, and also the establishment of industries in our homelands, we are taking the labour to the labourers. It is being made possible for these people, in their own traditional residential areas, to work under far easier and more favourable circumstances, to become economically active and to develop into an asset to South Africa. However, I do not want to deal with the policy of separate development at this stage. I am merely mentioning it in passing. Therefore the Government should be given recognition for the long-term planning which has taken place in the past and which is still taking place at present.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the second leg of my motion. When considering the estimates of demographers of the size of the South African population towards the end of the century, one finds that the population is going to double itself during the next 20 to 25 years. Many things have been achieved in South Africa since the year 1652, when Jan van Riebeeck landed here. One can only consider what has been achieved during the three and a half centuries since the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck when this country, which is known today as South Africa, was a barren and untilled country and Cape Town only consisted of Table Mountain and the sea. All this took more than 300 years to achieve. When one considers all the industries which have been established in South Africa, the progress that has been made in the sphere of agriculture and all other spheres, one has to appreciate that all the existing facilities will have to be doubled during the following two decades to provide for South Africa&#x2019;s population in 20 to 25 years&#x2019; time. In other words, we do not have much time to double the benefits and facilities. If one considers the fact that the population will double itself, one thinks, in the first place, of food, and in passing I want to pay tribute to the farmers of South Africa who have seen to it that food is still plentiful in South Africa today. As a matter of fact, when considering my own weight, I can probably say that there is too much food available. One is very grateful that a small group of people, altogether fewer than 100 000, succeed in feeding a population of more than 20 million, while still leaving a surplus for export. But the agricultural sector will have to double its production during the next 25 years. As you know, agricultural land is limited, and improved management abilities will therefore have to be applied to ensure greater utilization of the available land. When one considers the housing of the population and that as many houses and residential units will have to be built during the coming 25 years as have been erected since the time Van Riebeeck landed here, one appreciates how much remains to be done. Also in the sphere of education there is a <span class="col_719-720" refersTo="page_0376"/>need for the existing facilities to be doubled as a result of the progress that has been made by the other population groups in South Africa who, although I do not want to anticipate anything, will be enjoying the best educational facilities in South Africa&#x2014;if not in the world&#x2014;in the foreseeable future. In the sphere of transport a great deal will have to be done. In the sphere of communications a great deal will have to be done in order to meet the needs of a far bigger population. Mr. Speaker, I also hope that, during the following decades, there will not only be the demand, but also the need for twice the amount of existing church facilities.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the doubling of existing economic means over the short term is going to make heavy demands on economic planning. One is grateful that South Africa has outstanding people in the sphere of planning as well. I am not only referring to people in the Government benches now, but also to advisers, academics in the private sector and in education, who apply their minds to these problems and are of great value to the Government. Mr. Speaker, it is also essential that we should get our priorities right. With that I do not mean that there is anything wrong with our priorities at the moment, but as far as the future is concerned and in view of all the demands which are going to be placed upon South Africa, it is essential that we do the important things first. In this respect one thinks of defence because we know that the economic growth means nothing whatsoever to a country if the country is not safe and if the pillars of the country are not protected. Therefore, defence is probably going to place far heavier capital demands upon us. In the sphere of the provision of powers, telecommunications, steel, housing and agriculture&#x2014;all these sectors have to compete with one another for the available capital in order to provide these services. As a matter of fact, thousands of millions of rands will be required. Last week the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs stated in reply to a question that the cost of the development of the factory at Saldanha Bay is estimated at R1 300 million. This is only a minor portion of all that has to be done. The capital requirements of South Africa will increase astronomically during the following quarter of a century, and the capital resources are not unlimited. Capital is expensive and we shall not be able to be too extravagant, because there are also other countries which have to compete.</p>

<p>The more important economic objectives have to enjoy preference to those of lesser importance. If I may put it this way, I want to say that the indispensable objectives should enjoy preference to the essential objectives. This is really the crux of my motion, i.e. that there should be overall planning, that there should be experts who are able to determine which projects should enjoy priority to others. In competing for the available capital it should be borne in mind that local as well as provincial authorities have capital requirements. Furthermore, capital is required for the national economy and also the State corporations, which entail major benefits for South Africa in their respective fields and in their respective industries, have their own capital requirements.</p>

<p>There is also the indispensable private sector with its own and indispensable capital requirements. I want to tell the hon. member for Constantia that I had prepared my speech before I learned of his proposed amendment. I just repeat that we have the indispensable private sector with its own, equally indispensable capital requirements. That is all I want to say about this matter. In addition, there is also agriculture which has to provide us with food.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the State will also have to determine the proper sequence of its priorities. I now come to the last priority, and that is that of John Citizen. John Citizen will also have to get his priorities right. The anti-inflation measures which have been introduced by the authorities in order to combat inflation in the interests of John Citizen, i.e. the public, the consumer, can be regarded as a tablet one takes for one&#x2019;s temperature. Once the tablet has had its effect, the temperature is still there. Therefore, one has to get rid of the temperature, i.e. the cause. What I am asking now is whether it is not time for all of us to realize that no economy can exist when more money is spent than what is earned. If everyone would decide to contribute more to the economy than he took out of it, we would get our priorities right. Everyone of us in South Africa has a share in this long-term planning. If we cut our coat according to our cloth&#x2014;and this applied to everyone: the State, provincial authorities, local authorities, the private sector and the ordinary citizens&#x2014;I foresee an excellent <span class="col_721-722" refersTo="page_0377"/>economic future for South Africa over the long term.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Replying to the motion of the hon. member for Germiston District, I must say I do not find myself in the position in which he finds himself in having to give praise to the Government, because I find very little justification for doing so.</p>

<p>When this motion was first put on the Order Paper, I studied it carefully and I had misgivings about its necessity and about its desirability. I had misgivings about the necessity for the type of inquiry that was called for, or the desirability of such an inquiry. Now that I have listened to the hon. proposer of this motion my misgivings are reinforced. They are reinforced because it is clear that he places a very high priority on Government participation in the economy, and that he places a very high priority on the Government&#x2019;s responsibility for bending the economy to carry out its own ideological policy. Now, in saying that I question the desirability or the necessity for an inquiry of this nature, that does not mean to say that we shut our eyes to the need for long-term projections in certain directions. We do need long-term population projections. We do need long-term projections of the needs of our growing population, the needs of our growing population for housing, food, transport, jobs, education, training and the need to train skilled people to do skilled work. We need a long-term picture, in so far as it is possible to get a long-term picture, of the resources that are going to be available in the long term to be developed and to be exploited. Generally speaking, we need a long-term picture painted in the broadest relief of the essential features of the economy, so that corrective action can be taken where weaknesses exist and positive action can be taken where openings exist. But I would suggest to this House, Sir, that we already have a wealth of information in this regard available to us.</p>

<p>We have the reports of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council and of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s economic adviser. We have reports by the Department of Planning. We have projections for the medium term in the Economic Development Programme. We have had the report of the Reynders Commission on exports which did extensive research into the relative merits of different types of economic activities, including agriculture, mining and industry. We have had the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s report, which examined the financial and fiscal objectives of the country. We have also had much valuable research done into these various subjects by private institutions like the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch and by private people such as Prof. Sadie. I would suggest therefore that any further research or inquiry of this nature would be quite superfluous. But that is not the main reason why I regard this inquiry as being unnecessary and undesirable. I think if you ask the State to set long-term objectives and priorities, there is only one thing that that can lead to and that is to more State intervention in the economy. I say that because if the State were to undertake an investigation of this nature, if it were to set objectives and priorities, it would only be logical that it would also want to see that those objectives and priorities were in fact achieved, otherwise the exercise would be purposeless.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Relate that to the EDP, and argue on that basis.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will argue on that basis. I would like to say to this House that the fact that the State is actually impotent in seeing that the objectives and the priorities set, as they have been in the EDP, are achieved, is really irrelevant to this motion. It is a fact that the latest EDP projected a rate of growth of 6,4% compounded over a five-year period to 1979. The first year produced a growth rate of about 2%. The current year, which is the second year, is likely to produce a growth rate of a similar order, so that if we are going to get, over the five-year period, a compounded growth rate of 6,4%, we will need in the next three years, from next year onwards, a compounded growth rate of about 9,1%, which I believe is not on the cards. Therefore, to introduce a further investigation into long-term objectives when your medium-term projections are not working and are not being achieved, to me seems to serve very little purpose indeed.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to go on to a rather different tack now, and I would like to say that there was a time when all parties in this House stood for the philosophy of a free, competitive private enterprise economy. I do not think that that position exists any longer.</p>

<p><span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0378"/>The National Party, as a result of the example which it has shown of increasing State participation in the economy, is clearly leading this country, clearly and inexorably leading this country, down the path to socialism. This is proven by the fact that since the Nationalists came to power in 1948 State expenditure has risen by something like 15 times, whereas private expenditure has risen by only something like eight times. Investment by the public sector has been rising at a much faster rate than investment by the private sector, with the result that the assets of the country are coming more and more into the ownership of the State rather than of the private sector, which is another way of saying we are moving down the path to socialism. This party on my left, the Progressive Party, is also moving away from private enterprise even though it is a capitalist backed party, because if its constitutional ideas were to be implemented, which would result in Black majority rule, it would be handing the South African economy over to the African brand of socialism which is so evident in African States throughout this continent. [Interjections.] Sir, it seems to me that we in the United Party are the only party that is faithfully adhering to the policy of free enterprise. We do not need any inquiry to establish what our long-term economic objectives are. Our long-term economic target is to maximize the gross national product. It is to maximize productivity. It is to maximize the national product with the aim of achieving as large as possible a real <i>per capita</i> income for the population. Put in other words, our target is to achieve maximum living standards on a stable basis. Our priorities are clear too. We have three priorities, and one does not need any inquiry to establish them.</p>

<p>Our first priority is that we believe in maximum freedom to entrepreneurs and individuals in the making of decisions. In the last instance, the population is an aggregation of individuals. It is individuals who make the economy tick, and it is the profit motive which spurs the individual on to greater and more efficient efforts and greater productivity. To make the individual subservient to the State, and to remove the profit motive, is to move inexorably towards socialism, in fact the worst kind of socialism. Our idea of freedom of decision for the individual does not, however, mean unbridled freedom such as that which we had under <i>laissez-faire</i> in the last century. It means disciplined freedom.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Who must do the disciplining?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>It means freedom subject to the discipline of sound monetary and fiscal policies so that we have a stable and strong rand. It does not mean overspending, allowing the supply of money to get out of hand and allowing the value of the rand, internally and externally, to depreciate as this Government has allowed it to do. It means freedom subject to the discipline of sensible and sound policies of industrial protection to encourage the most economic industries. It means discipline to enforce civilized standards of employment and remuneration. It means freedom subject to discipline to protect the environment and it means freedom subject to all the other disciplines that are or may become necessary to protect other people. However, freedom subject to the disciplines I have mentioned does also mean freedom to employ and train labour, irrespective of colour, and to use that labour in jobs which it is capable of doing. It means freedom to establish businesses in localities where those businesses are most productive, whether those localities are in existing metropolitan areas or in the border areas. It means freedom to put capital to the most productive use without the distortion of the interference we have in interest rates. It means freedom from the kind of red tape we are subjected to, for example, under the Companies Act, or under the administration of controls such as import control.</p>

<p>The second priority that we on this side of the House believe in, is competitive conditions. It is competition which keeps entrepreneurs and individuals on their toes. It is competition which makes them efficient and enterprising and which induces them to innovate and improve all the time. It is competition which protects the public from exploitation as far as prices are concerned, and it is competition which keeps profits down to a reasonable level.</p>

<p>The third priority in which we believe is that there must be maximum scope for private enterprise as opposed to State enterprise. We believe that the role of the State in managing the economy must be very clearly defined and <span class="col_725-726" refersTo="page_0379"/>that its participation in the economy must be strictly limited. The State does have a duty in regard to managing the economy. It has a duty to promote circumstances in which there can be stability, including the stability of prices. It has a duty to assist by promoting conditions in which real growth can flourish and it has a duty to ensure that there is participation by the maximum number of people in the economic activity of the country and a maximum sharing in the prosperity of the country. It also has a duty to iron out the fluctuations which are caused by trade cycles. It has available to it the tools with which to do so. It can use fiscal and monetary policy, but it should do so circumspectly and lightly and not on a stop-start basis, to accelerate or put a brake on the economy. It can use its own level of spending to flatten out trade cycles and to encourage activity when private activity is at a low ebb, and <i>vice versa.</i> However, it also has the responsibility to see to it that its own policies do not conflict with the economic principles which are to the good of the country, and it should not try to bend the economy in the way it has frequently done.</p>

<p>As far as the State&#x2019;s active participation in the economy is concerned, its responsibilities and limitations should be clearly demarcated by guide-lines. We on this side of the House believe that Government participation in the economy is warranted for limited purposes. It is warranted for strategic and security reasons, as for example in the case of Armscor and Sasol. It is warranted when private enterprise has been or is unable to undertake an enterprise, as for example in the case of Iscor. It is warranted where the enterprise requires Government authority, as in the case of Escom, the Railways and the Post Office. It is also warranted where co-operative effort is best channelled through a Government agency, as is the case with the Tourist Corporation. We believe, however, that these guide-lines must be established and adhered to, and that they must be adhered to very much more rigidly than has been the case in the past.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude by saying that the motion before the House would have been of far more practical value had it been a motion asking for an inquiry into the objectives and priorities as far as the State&#x2019;s own participation in the economy is concerned. This is the nub of the question. This is what is going to decide whether we, as a country, remain a private enterprise country or whether we move down the hill towards socialism. Therefore, in the belief that we are hereby doing the country a service, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House reiterates its faith in private enterprise as the mainspring of economic growth, which is the key to the realization of the long-term economic objectives of the Republic.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This amendment draws attention to the fact that the future prosperity and the standards of living of our people are dependent, not on the type of inquiry that is called for in the motion of the hon. member for Germiston District, but on the encouragement of private enterprise and all that that entails.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Constantia reminded me of a dog who has been given a hiding and who has taken to biting everyone around him instead of going off on his own to find himself again and to work out a new line of action for himself. The hon. member quarrels with us on this side who have moved the motion, and in the process he takes a swipe at the party on his left which has not said a word in the debate up to now. [Interjections.] If one&#x2019;s party is deteriorating as rapidly as that hon. member&#x2019;s party, one should be looking for friends and not for enemies.</p>

<p>We agree to a large extent with the hon. member for Constantia, because we believe just as strongly in private initiative as he does. Just as he does, we believe, not in unlimited, but in wide powers for private initiative. However, there are two extremes in the economy today. On the one hand we find the communist authoritarian state, in which economic planning enjoys absolute priority and in which economic planning determines the whole pattern of life of the people. On the other hand we find the absolutely free economy under the capitalist system, in which only the free economic activities determine the future of the national economy. However, this condition, the so-called <i>laissez faire,</i> no longer exists in the world today. What does exist in the capitalist systems of the world is free enterprise to a very large extent, but controlled by sensible planning for the future. What the <span class="col_727-728" refersTo="page_0380"/>motion asks for is nothing more or less than that the State should investigate this. I take it that my hon. friend who moved the motion was thinking of a commission of inquiry to be appointed by the Minister and to consist of persons from the private as well as the public sector. The commission should then be charged with planning the relationship between the private and the public sectors.</p>

<p>It is nonsensical to say that only free enterprise should determine the economic condition of a country, because the State must, after all, provide the infrastructure. A free enterprise cannot be established just anywhere, just as it cannot produce just anything. If a free enterprise wants to produce something which it cannot produce economically, it means that the State has to keep on subsidizing that enterprise indefinitely by means of import tariffs. The State cannot subsidize the free enterprise indefinitely by means of protective import tariffs if it is producing something which it cannot produce economically. For this reason the State definitely has a say in the matter. Likewise the State has a say in the matter when it comes to the place where that free enterprise is to be established. After all, the State is expected to provide the infrastructure, and if the State does not plan ahead in consultation with free enterprise, people could establish an enterprise at a place where it cannot be successfully operated. This is why the motion requests today that the Minister should have an inquiry instituted into the long-term economic objectives and priorities for the Republic.</p>

<p>I have every confidence that the hon. the Minister, who has already proved that he can take dynamic action, will make a success of this as well. I am referring, amongst other things, to the action programme against inflation which he initiated and for which he brought the public and private sectors together round a table and succeeded in inducing the private sector to co-operate in combating this very great economic problem of the Western world, excessive inflation. Just as he succeeded in obtaining the co-operation of the private sector in combating inflation, just as he succeeded in bringing the private and public sectors together round a table and in achieving agreement between them about the priorities in the economic sphere, in the same way I believe that if he were to concentrate his dynamic approach on determining priorities, he would have very great success in this as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia made it very clear that one of his priorities was maximum freedom for private enterprise. I agree with that. There must be the maximum freedom&#x2014;not complete freedom&#x2014;under control of the State. He also spoke of &#x201C;maximum scope for private enterprise <i>versus</i> State enterprise&#x201D;. This, of course, brings me to the question of State corporations. In a developing economy such as the one in our country, where the powerful, established enterprise is lacking as yet, it may happen that for very good reasons private initiative may not be prepared to move in a certain direction in the economy. I do not want to rake up old stories again by referring to the establishment of Iscor, when the hon. member&#x2019;s political fathers made such a blunder, but the fact remains that in a developing economy, private initiative cannot always supply the necessary capital and does not always want to take the necessary risks, because the market is limited. For this reason it is essential, in a developing economy such as the one we have, for State corporations to be founded in certain spheres. They are established only when private initiative has not been prepared to undertake the development itself. If we had not been given an Iscor in 1928, where would our economic development have been today? We had similar situations with the establishment of Escom, Sasol, Phoscor, etc. Private initiative was not prepared to undertake those developments, and I do not blame them; they had very good reasons for their approach to matters. At the same time, however, I want to allege that if private initiative is not willing to take those risks, and it is in the interests of the country as a whole for that sphere of the economy to be entered into, we have no option and State corporations have to be established. That is exactly what was done here.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that I do not blame private initiative for not having entered those spheres, for with a market as limited as ours it is a very hazardous undertaking to enter those spheres where the economy of large enterprises is involved. For this reason it was essential for State corporations to be established. For the very reason that State corporations in our country control such a large part of our economy, it is essential for the State corporations and private enterprises to get <span class="col_729-730" refersTo="page_0381"/>together around a table and to map out where everyone&#x2019;s sphere lies. This is exactly what we are asking for in this motion, namely that these bodies should meet and define their respective spheres so that they will be able to plan on a long-term basis what each one&#x2019;s sphere for the future is. I shall say something about priorities at a later stage.</p>

<p>The State corporations may have entered spheres which they should not have entered. I do not know whether this is what the hon. member for Constantia referred to; I suspect that it is. However, the fact is that when a private enterprise controls a powerful conglomerate&#x2014;I am thinking, for example, of the production of steel&#x2014;it can easily ensure markets for the product it produces, excluding a State corporation from such markets. After all, it testifies to good economic insight for the State corporation, too, to enter spheres in order to safeguard its markets. It is inevitable. For this reason I want to repeat that the time has come for these powers in the economy, the State, the State corporations and the private sector, to gather round a table to consider their long-term planning and to analyse their long-term projections.</p>

<p>Because we believe in private enterprise, we also believe that the time has come for this whole aspect of the sphere of the State corporation as against that of the private enterprise to be reconsidered and for the area of each to be defined as far as possible. However, this is not the most important point in this motion. The most important point is that we should determine our priorities. The West has seldom seen an inflation rate as high as the present one. This high inflation rate has caused capital to become scarce and expensive. Because capital is scarce and expensive, and because we have such an enormous capital expansion programme before us, as was indicated by my friend, the hon. member for Germiston District, surely it is essential for us to determine our priorities very clearly. If we do not do that, we shall have great difficulties. We shall have to pay more and more for capital, and if this becomes so expensive, we shall hardly be able to produce economically. This is why it is so very essential for all sectors in the economy, particularly for the producers, to come together and to determine what at this stage are essentials nos. 1, 2, 3, etc., for our economic development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is another factor which enters the picture in this whole economic problem, namely political interference. It is true, unfortunately, that the economy is not quite free. Just like the hon. member for Constantia, we too should like it to be free, but the economy is not quite free. Under a completely free economy, a country should produce only those products which it can produce on the most economical basis. What it cannot produce economically it will have to obtain from other nations. Our economy is not quite free, because there is such a thing as political boycotting. We have to give attention to this. We are concerned here not with ideological considerations, to which the hon. member for Constantia referred so disparagingly, but with economic necessities, for if political influences effectively prevent one from buying or selling on certain markets, it is sound economy, after all, to look for other ways of providing the most essential requirements.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these political factors in the economy are being pushed into the background more and more. For this we have to thank our very great leader, the hon. the Prime Minister, who is breaking down those political factors with his d&#x00E9;tente efforts, so that every country can produce what it is able to produce most economically with its raw materials, its people and its circumstances, and so that it will be able to trade freely with the outside world for its other requirements. I want to pay tribute to a very great leader, someone who is succeeding in breaking down these political factors which hinder our economy. I also have the greatest confidence in the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, who has proved, by the steps he has taken up to now, by his action programme against inflation and by his appointment of a commission of inquiry into monopolistic conditions, the members of which he recruited from the private as well as from the public sector, that in this regard, too, he will succeed in appointing a commission consisting of members from the private and the public sectors who will be able to plan and to determine the right priorities. What I am asking here is that he should gather these people around a table, as he has done in the past in other spheres, in order to plan the future of our economy on the long term and to determine our priorities, for then I shall be very optimistic about the economic future of this young country of ours.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from><span class="col_731-732" refersTo="page_0382"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, both the hon. member for Germiston District and the hon. member for Constantia referred to the fact that planning must take into account the natural resources we have in this country and the importance of rising living standards for all the people who live in South Africa. We are in full agreement with that, and I should like to come back to it at a later stage. The hon. member for Paarl mentioned that he hoped that the members of the commission of inquiry would be drawn from both the public and the private sectors. We also support him in that and, furthermore, we hope to put forward some potential names to the hon. the Minister in the course of this debate. The motion of the hon. member for Germiston District reads:</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to have an inquiry instituted into the long-term economic objectives and priorities for the Republic.</block>

<p>Let me say at once that we have absolutely no problem with that and that we will support the spirit of it. It is an overt and explicit&#x2014;there is nothing tacit about it&#x2014;admission of defeat and failure on the part of this Government and the National Party. Their only justification for this inquiry is that they say they want to set up priorities. We have no problem with the desirability of determining priorities for this country. However, this Government has for the past 27 years had the right to set priorities. For the past 27 years this Government has acted in relation to our economy in a role analogous to that of a doctor to his patient. They have had the power both to diagnose whether the patient, South Africa, was ill or healthy and to prescribe the medicine to be administered. That is, of course, a matter that is of direct personal concern to all South Africans&#x2014;White, Black and Brown&#x2014;as we are all cast in the role of patient. I have no doubt that the Government speakers are going to draw comparisons between the economic performance of our country and that of other African countries and, indeed, of countries elsewhere in the world. Great stress will be laid on the present state of the recession in the free world. However, let no one be fooled. Of course we have had progress since 1948. No country is an island and that is equally true for all the other countries with which it is reasonable and sensible to draw parallels in relation to ourselves. Whatever the hon. the Minister may say, all is not well with the state of our economic well-being. For proof of that, we need to look no further than to the devaluation of last September and to read the writing on the wall in regard to the budget that will be proposed in April. We will have a more appropriate opportunity to come back to those matters on Wednesday next week. There is, moreover, another dimension which the Government has consistently and quite deliberately chosen to ignore, and that is the full economic potential which is available to us here in South Africa. To put it bluntly, the Government&#x2019;s medicine has been consistently aimed solely at preserving the health of the White part of the South African body. In the main it has ignored and indeed deliberately prevented the growth and development of the rest of the body, which happens to be Black and Brown. They have produced a situation where we have an extremely well developed White heart set within a stunted body. We are an economic dwarf compared to what we should and could have been by now, and the sole blame for that is the policies of this Government.</p>

<p>Now, as if that was not enough, this Government wants to split the economic body of South Africa into nine parts. Does anyone on those benches really think that we can afford that, or indeed, that the economic health of all the eight embryonic bodies together with that of the White body will be other than seriously and, indeed, fatally impaired compared to the adoption of a balanced r&#x00E9;gime to train, to develop and to bring all the parts of the body as it now stands to where it would constitute the well co-ordinated and growing economic giant that South Africa can and should be? I take it that the mere fact that we have this motion and that it is being debated at all means that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is going to accept it. Well and good. As I have said, we are pleased that after 27 years this Government has come and said <i>mea culpa,</i> and we are going to give it our support, subject to an amendment which I will propose shortly. However, since the Government has admitted its failure by putting this motion, then they should accept that in constituting the inquiry as envisaged, they should go outside and invite those, to put it no higher, of proven competence in a variety of spheres to serve in that inquiry. The Government no longer has a right to sit alone in judgment on our economic future. I am sure the hon. the Minister will <span class="col_733-734" refersTo="page_0383"/>agree with me when I say that I am no believer&#x2014;and neither obviously is the Government&#x2014;that for instance the Minister of Finance in any country should be the top available accountant, economist or banker. Therefore, the names that we will now propose are those of men of breadth of vision and of experience. That is how it should be, because there is no more important issue than the long-term objectives and priorities for our economy, because in time, if our economic aims differ from the political ones, then neither will be achieved, with all the implications of the utmost gravity that that holds for the 25 million of us.</p>

<p>As I have said, it is difficult to put too great an emphasis on the acceptance of this motion, since if it is approached with an open mind, with no preconceived set of values such as those held by those who sit on the Government benches, or for that matter, those who sit on these benches, it can be a watershed in the lives of all who now live here, and, more particularly, for the children who will be born in the future. As of now, we as a country stand alone. We have no friend and no ally who is prepared to stand in the sun with us&#x2014;whatever may be hinted at transpiring in the shadows. The simple question is: Why? Here we stand as a country endowed with riches given to few, if to any others. More important, we have within our land food, metals and minerals in abundance, which are manifestly desired and needed by the industrial countries of the free world. I would be the first to say that it is true that people and other countries are still prepared to trade with us and, I will even go further, that the Government has proved exemplary in its dealings with foreign investors who come to our country.</p>

<p>However, this Government has brought us to the point where all of us are filled with foreboding when we look into the immediate economic future&#x2014;at least if this Government remains in charge. Indeed, it goes further. It brings into question&#x2014;and make no mistake, it will be more and more the object of concern to an increasing number of people&#x2014;the competence, no more and no less, of this Government. In the past people have been lulled by the false concept that to have a strong Government is essential for economic growth. But if that is so, the track record of this Government needs to be examined. I would like to name five or six facts which people should bear in mind when they consider the track record of this Government:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) This Government has simply lived beyond the means available to it.</li>

<li>(2) Worse than that, it has deliberately restricted the growth in wealth which could otherwise have been available to it.</li>

<li>(3) It has therefore been forced to devalue the rand, not once, but three times&#x2014;and I know all about the Minister of Economic Affairs speaking about minor adjustments.</li>

<li>(4) It has caused all of us, but more particularly the pensioners and Black and Brown South Africans, to suffer as best we may, a much higher rate of inflation than need otherwise prevail.</li>

<li>(5) It has, as I have said, left us without an explicit and overt friend in the world.</li>

<li>(6) It has caused increasing frustration and discontent with their economic lot amongst the majority of the people within our land; and in that connection there is a vast majority of South Africans who happen to live at or near the subsistence level as measured by the poverty datum line.</li>

</ol>

<p>If that is the record of this Government after 27 years, and it considers itself strong, then we need change not only of our Government, but throughout the whole fabric of our society. One is left with a situation as we now stand where this Government, unless helped by factors beyond its control&#x2014;that is fortuitous events such as the price of gold or the climate&#x2014;has got itself into the position where the only economic flexibility left to it for 1976 is either growth at a rate below the safety margin and increased taxation, or the two-headed monster of inflation and devaluation. To be quite honest, they have forfeited the right to minister to their patient and the people of South Africa should be allowed to take a second opinion.</p>

<p>In this connection we would, therefore, like to propose that the following people be considered and asked to serve on the inquiry: Dr. Anton Rupert, Professor Van der Ross, Mr. Reddy, Mr. S. Motsuane, Professor Ntanwisi, the ex-Chief Justice, Mr. Ogilvie Thompson, Mr. Grobbelaar of Tucsa, Mr. C. S. Barlow, Dr. Albert Wessels, Mr. C. S. <span class="col_735-736" refersTo="page_0384"/>Corder and, to the surprise of the hon. the Minister, Mr. H. F. Oppenheimer.</p>

<p>In order for such an inquiry to serve the purpose that it can and should perform, it is essential that its terms of reference be such that it is not confined within the ideological straitjacket which this Government has imposed on our economy increasingly over the past 27 years. The objective of the inquiry on which I think there would be a general consensus&#x2014;and I hope the hon. the Minister will support us in this&#x2014;both within and without this House should be: &#x201C;To optimize over time the real living standards of all South Africans.&#x201D; I would, therefore, like to move the following amendment to the motion of the hon. member for Germiston District&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;inquiry&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;to determine how best to optimize in the future the real living standards of all South Africans and in relation to that objective to consider&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the present and future distribution of wealth within our land;</li>

<li>(b) the definitions section and sections 76 and 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, 1956;</li>

<li>(c) the level and priorities of Government expenditure and the interface with the provinces, <i>inter alia</i> in regard to housing, education and pensions;</li>

<li>(d) the present exchange control regulations;</li>

<li>(e) free and compulsory education for all children and expenditure on training for industrial skill for Black and Brown South Africans and in addition for Whites to increase their ability to take responsibility;</li>

<li>(f) the role of the public and semipublic corporations <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> both Parliament and the private sector;</li>

<li>(g) the repeal of all legislation which impedes productivity both in regard to mobility and at the place of work;</li>

<li>(h) the creation of an appropriate social infrastructure throughout our land; and</li>

<li>(i) the development of one economy for our land&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>When this board of inquiry or commission of inquiry sits, it must not be bound by the present policies of this Government, otherwise we will simply remain in the <i>cul de sac</i> where we now find ourselves. Furthermore, it will serve a limited, if any, useful purpose. The one thing this inquiry should be is colour blind. It must draw no distinctions on the basis of the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin, because that is the arbitrary self-imposed handicap which has in the past and still does shackle our economic performance.</p>

<p>If such an inquiry is conducted objectively by individuals such as we have suggested, without the constraint of any outworn and outmoded political philosophies, it can point the road down which we can travel and enjoy an economic miracle which will be the envy of all. Those 10 or 12 names we have suggested constitute a team not necessarily of experts in the particular field of economics, but the people whose names have been put forward&#x2014;it is not a comprehensive list and the hon. the Minister can add further names&#x2014;would serve two purposes. They would engender public confidence and their recommendations would be accepted in a way that is not available to this Government. It is no coincidence that if we go down this road, it will bring us back into the comity of nations. Let us be clear: We are too small a nation of even 25 million people to have sovereignty in the full sense, standing alone, and to realize both the economic potential open to us and a stable democratic society based on consent, we have no alternative but to have such far-reaching changes within. Economics have been described as the dismal science, but in our case it is the key which can unite us in an increasingly prosperous land. Nor can it be separated from politics. As such the economic policies of this Government must be framed to take into account the long-term interest of the majority of the population, because, if they do not, they will sooner or later have to be changed as indeed will the politics on which they are based. The choice is quite simple. We can either build the economic house of South Africa on the sands of apartheid or we can build the economic powerhouse of South Africa on the rock of equal opportunity.</p>

<speech by="#du_toit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. DU TOIT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon.<span class="col_737-738" refersTo="page_0385"/>member for Johannesburg North has moved an amendment which deviates completely from the point. We requested an economic investigation in the motion. To me it seems as though the hon. member now wants to have an investigation into our whole way of life and everything in South Africa. This was not the object of this motion at all. The hon. member went on to speak of the 27 years of Government failure, and to this I want to tell him that the stable Government has made of South Africa a much sought-after field of investment throughout the world. A further point which the hon. member made, was that this Government allegedly looked after the Whites only. However, the Government has done the greatest humanitarian deed in the world as regards the under-privileged people. The hon. member cannot mention any other Government to me that has done more for its under-privileged people than what South Africa has done.</p>

<p>The amendment of the hon. member for Constantia strongly reminds one of the olden days when the U.P. Government allowed everything to take its own course and followed a policy of <i>laissez faire</i> completely. This was the U.P. Government&#x2019;s economic policy in the past and it seems to me as though this amendment has been formulated on the same basis. There is nobody under the sun who is as deaf as he who does not want to listen. This side of the House has stated its view on free competition, private initiative and private enterprise in South Africa time and time again. Nobody can put this better than our hon. the Prime Minister did when he addressed the Federation of South African Steel and Engineering Industries on 23 October 1973, and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe in free enterprise. I believe there is a place for initiative. I believe that in the economy there must of necessity be a place for the profit-motive.</block>

<block name="quote">I want to say immediately that this does not mean&#x2014;as we say in Afrikaans &#x201C;Dat daar roofbou toegepas moet word nie,&#x201D; there must be over-cropping and that there must be wasteful exploitation. I think hand-in-hand with that profit-motive must of necessity go the service-motive and over-all that does apply as far as South Africa is concerned. As far as the Government is concerned the Government must at all times take the necessary steps and guard against the fact not to slide into a welfare State, and as far as industry, commerce and business are concerned, it must at all times take care that free enterprise is not brought into disrepute by exploitation and over profit-making. As far as we are all concerned, we must take care that we do not live beyond our means.</block>

<p>This Government&#x2019;s attitude towards free enterprise cannot be put more clearly.</p>

<p>On several occasions the idea of the establishment of a confederation of countries in Southern Africa has been expressed by our hon. the Prime Minister as well as several members of the Cabinet. An inquiry into long-term economic planning must of necessity keep these prospects in mind as well. The first homeland of South Africa is to become independent as soon as 1976 and there will be others. With the ties of friendship with other countries in Southern Africa the prospects of a future economic confederation is becoming ever brighter. Time will have to tell what countries will participate in this confederation. All countries south of the equator may derive benefit from co-operating in common economic objectives. When speaking of Southern Africa, I mean the countries south of the equator.</p>

<p>A large measure of economic interdependence exists today between these countries and it will continue to grow in future. Consequently I should like to outline a few points in connection with the inter-dependence of these countries in the economic sphere. Modem transport and communications have bridged the distances between countries and increasing contact between countries in the political and economic sphere is being experienced. In the same way ethnologic development, too, has brought nations closer together. We are experiencing this closer co-operation in Southern Africa to a larger extent, to the mutual benefit of the countries concerned. The states of Southern Africa have abundant natural resources, but as yet they have not been developed to the extent that they may be regarded as fully exploited. The urge to develop does exist, however, and it is present amongst all the nations. The obstructions to economic progress in these countries are mainly shortages of trained manpower and <span class="col_739-740" refersTo="page_0386"/>this is continually being given higher priority in these countries.</p>

<p>If the countries in Southern Africa were to stand together and succeed in having peaceful co-existence and make this their objective, they could transform this part of the world into a new growth point of progress and prosperity. South Africa is endeavouring at all times to find a common acceptable formula for the peaceful co-existence of these nations without interference in another&#x2019;s domestic affairs. Only in this manner will the states of this region be able to make real progress and utilize their natural resources most effectively. Less emphasis should be placed on our differences and more emphasis on our common interests, because by doing so we can bring about major benefits for each of these States.</p>

<p>In considering the inter-dependence of the peoples of Southern Africa in the economic sphere, we find that the various economies are in different stages of development. In general they are less developed countries, less developed as the industrial countries and mainly dependent on agriculture. However, they are trying to move from the mainly agricultural and primary production stage to increased industrialization. The per capita income and consequently their standards of living as well, still are far behind those of industrial countries. Consequently they rely heavily on foreign markets for the marketing of their surplus products. This makes their economies vulnerable at times because of fluctuating prices. On the other hand the countries of Southern Africa have the potential to produce substantially more than they are producing at the moment, and their products are required to an increasing extent in a world which is continually yearning for more food. South Africa is the leading agricultural and mining country in this Southern Africa concept and the country also has a high degree of technical skill to offer assistance to these countries. It is also prepared to offer assistance so that these countries may effect a higher growth. When we look at the export markets of these countries, we see that problems have already developed. In the first place, because of the long distances from the markets the cost of bringing these products to the markets is very high. In the second place we find that the traditional export markets of these areas are mainly in Europe and the countries in Europe are trying more and more to meet their own requirements by growing their own products. The result is that the yield from exports may be seriously prejudiced in future.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the countries in Southern Africa must take a very careful look at the possibility of increased trade amongst one another. In future these countries will have to move towards increased industrial development as time goes by. Many problems are being experienced in this field. Problems which may develop, are capital requirements and trained manpower. Even in a developed country such as South Africa, a major shortage is continuously being experienced in this field. There is also the creation of new infrastructures which may create problems. Through co-operation, these problems may be bridged in due course, with South Africa as the economic generator of Southern Africa. Another area of mutual interest is the exploitation of international tourism which remains a profitable source of revenue. Tourism will always be much sought after, especially in Africa because Africa always offers the tourist something new. Some mutual co-operation already exists amongst the countries of Southern Africa so as to promote tourism mutually. This co-operation still has to be extended to a large degree and this can only be done by much closer co-operation amongst the countries of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>A few points have been indicated as regards the economic interdependence of the countries of Southern Africa. Many more speeches may be made on this subject, but I want to stress that when there is a long-term inquiry into the economy of South Africa, this interdependence of countries in Southern Africa will have to be borne in mind. I also want to repeat what was said by the hon. member who introduced this motion, viz. that long-term planning should merely indicate the direction and that the detail should not be stipulated. Consequently I take great pleasure in supporting this motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, from the outset I should like to admit candidly that I credited the hon. member for Germiston District with far more wisdom and intellect with the motion he introduced than he actually displayed. The two of us accompanied the hon. member for Vryburg on a visit to Iran during the recess. When I saw the motion on the Order Paper, I assumed that he would <span class="col_741-742" refersTo="page_0387"/>probably say something with regard to the steps that country is taking to plan its entire economy and to move in a socialistic direction in order to distribute the income of that country, which is tremendous today, among the ordinary people. I must say that I am very disappointed with the motion. The hon. member is simply asking something from the Government which, in my opinion, is happening all the time, i.e. the laying down of guide-lines and attempts to determine what will happen in the economy until the turn of the century. I agree with the hon. member for Constantia that we have sufficient information today, and all that is necessary is to consolidate a few matters so that we can go ahead with the plan. I should like to associate myself with the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia, and as text I should like to quote from a speech made by the hon. member for Von Brandis in which he referred to socialism.</p>

<p>&#x2020;My text comes out of a speech made by the hon. member for Von Brandis on 4 May 1973 (Hansard, 1973, Vol. 43, col. 5765). He was speaking on the attitude of the Prime Minister towards socialism, something to which the hon. member for Vryburg referred. The other day was not the first time that the Prime Minister spoke about socialism. The hon. member for Von Brandis said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Prime Minister has referred to the question of redistribution of wealth in South Africa. Sir, the redistribution of wealth is concerned not so much with an evening out of salaries between one sector of the population and the other. It has to do with the redistribution of wealth away from private holding and private enterprise towards the State.</block>

<p>I want to draw very serious attention to what he has said about the redistribution of wealth away from private holding and private enterprise towards the State. This is what socialism is. Mr. Speaker, however one tends to look at the economy of South Africa, one is drawn increasingly to the conclusion that private enterprise is on the wane in South Africa. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he agrees with me, that private enterprise is on the wane in South Africa. I can bring some very convincing proof. Mouths other than mine have said this same thing, including the person appointed by the hon. the Minister to heat up his anti-inflation campaign, Dr. McCrystal. He is on record as having said that private enterprise is on the wane in South Africa. Anybody over there who says this is nonsense, must not come and hold a conversation with me about it, he must go and talk to the man who is advising the entire public of South Africa, and appointed by the Minister, on how to beat inflation.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I hope it will not cause him trouble. The point I want to make, for the benefit of the hon. member for Germiston District and others, is that it is a common saying that the State must do this and the State must do that, the State must give direction. But Sir, the State is nothing else but taxation. That is the significance of the State. The State has nothing of its own which generates wealth; the State is taxation, the milking of profit. I think we should get our ideas very clearly on that particular point because. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, the hon. member must try to have a little bit of sense. I am not saying that we must do without taxation. My concern is to support the amendment for the hon. member for Constantia that the participation of the State must be limited, severely limited, and that the contribution of private enterprise and the generation of profit must be accorded the greatest and highest priority, for reasons which I shall mention.</p>

<p>Last year, in the budget debate, I raised the question with the hon. the Minister about State corporations, corporations which I suggested to him&#x2014;we never had the time to take the discussion any further&#x2014;should spin off into the private sector operations which they have founded, which they have seeded, which they have started and which are today generating profits. I suggested they should be spun off into the private sector with a recoupment of capital which should come back into the hands of the State. Again I found support for my ideas from Dr. Fred Sollner, who supported precisely the idea that I had enunciated here in the House, namely that those sorts of economic activities undertaken by the State could be spun off from State control into the hands of private people, with great profit to <span class="col_743-744" refersTo="page_0388"/>both the State and the private sector. I want to draw the attention of the House to this idea, this theory that the State can do everything, that the State can give all the directions, that the State can control, that the State can inspire, because I think it is vitally important that we should understand one thing. That is that the economy, which funds every single thing that we do, really and truly has its heart, its essence in the private sector.</p>

<p>The State levies taxation, but excessive taxation for the purposes of the State in contradiction of private enterprise is socialism. I want to say, and I support the hon. member for Constantia, that we are today in the gravest danger of drifting towards socialism. The Prime Minister said that he was against it, but we want to see action taken&#x2014;just, for instance, in respect of the matter I have raised with the hon. the Minister now&#x2014;to stop the slide towards socialism which is slowly enveloping the economy of this country. It is absolutely vital to realize that this country of ours is a young country, a developing country. We are at square one as a far as economic development is concerned. The hon. member for Vryburg said that we could involve the other countries that are being created around us, that we should serve as the spark of development in other countries. We have to realize that this is a small country developing today with economic help from outside. Our capital comes from outside and we do not have enough capital of our own today to help develop the countries that are being spun off from the heart of South Africa by this present Government.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we saw there an economy which was in a state of being planned, which the Prime Minister of Iran said to us was a mixed economy. In Iran there is the situation, as we have it in our own country, of a vast mass of people who are making a tremendous leap in this present generation from backwardness into the most modem economic society. We saw there a deliberate plan, which is being enunciated by their Prime Minister and by the planners, in terms of which at the end of this century the gap between the lowest paid and the highest paid person in the country of Iran will be a factor of 8:1. There will be no more of a gap than that.</p>

<p>Now, whatever is happening at the present moment with the economy of Iran&#x2014;and everybody knows that they have overspent rather severely&#x2014;if we think of the amount of money pouring into that country every year, money which is going to be distributed among the people, the factor of one is going to be a considerable amount of money, while the factor of eight&#x2014;the highest paid&#x2014;will be a lot more than that.</p>

<p>They have embarked upon a deliberate plan of industrialization and of spreading this enormous funnel of wealth coming into the country, among the people. But the Prime Minister was absolutely insistent and said that although the State was the receiving agency of the wealth coming into that country, the State was taking all steps to see that private enterprise was the vehicle which was going to build prosperity for the people of that country. I think we must understand the position of our country. If a socialist economy comes into being you have to have a tightly controlled society. The society must be tightly controlled because only certain things can be undertaken and only certain directions can be followed. In a country such as ours, which is so vitally concerned with growth&#x2014;and it is impossible to overstress the importance of economic growth in this country when you consider the millions of people and the coming millions who have to be catered for&#x2014;the private enterprise sector of the economy is absolutely all-important. My concern is that the Nationalist Party today is becoming&#x2014;and I hope the hon. the Minister will deny it and that he will say something about it&#x2014;a big State, big tax, big corporation socialist party. Sir, this country today cannot afford that kind of Government in the state in which we are where growth is so important. Let me say that growth comes from the efforts of the individual, the <span class="col_745-746" refersTo="page_0389"/>man who goes out to direct his business and who sleeps and dreams his business for 24 hours of the day, because he wants to make a profit and he wants to get ahead and he wants to grow. If one draws a contrast between a man who is producing and a person who, with all the virtues civil servants may have, cannot be expected to have the same dedication to profit and to making a success of a business, this becomes evident. I think it is important that it should be realized that personal incentive is the key to all real progress; and the one thing the Government has to do above everything else, no matter how many planning commissions they may have, is to recognize and entrench personal incentive in this country, and that means taking a serious look at taxation; because everybody knows people, as I know people, who sit around saying that they will work two or three days a week only because it does not pay them to work more. And those are the most productive people in the economy. We talk about the productivity of the workers, but what about the productivity of the people who are the inspiration of the economy, the people at the top, the people who have formed empires, the people who have built great businesses but who find today that it is not worth their while to work more than a couple of days in the week, because our friend over there is a permanent partner. [Interjections.] Yes, not only is he a sleeping partner; he is a guzzling partner, and I do not think we can afford that. I think we should have a serious look at taxation in this country.</p>

<p>I want to take it a step further, Sir. Here my friends of the Progressive Party must forgive me, but I think we must understand the experience of those of us who served on a certain commission. We saw organizations which deliberately allied themselves with the aspirations of Black people, and every one of those organizations was driven to espouse the cause of Black socialism. However much the Progressive Party may be a party of capitalists, if you are going to ally yourself with or put yourself forward as the spokesman for the have-nots in this country, there is only one way that you can go, as happened to those organizations. [Interjections.] When you come into contact with the Black militants you are forced to espouse the cause of Black socialism as a means of doing what the hon. member for Von Brandis said, for the redistribution of wealth.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is that however one may think of the Black population in relation to the distribution of wealth and social justice, what social justice actually boils down to is cash. Social justice means being able to provide all kinds of facilities. Though social justice may mean many things, in essence it boils down to cash. Let me now ask how we are to involve millions of Black people in a process which is going to bring them the real liberation that Africa is looking for. We must understand what Africa is looking for. It is looking for real liberation, freedom from the age-old plagues of Africa, be it lack of education, the absence of health services, squalor, disease or poverty&#x2014;all those things that have kept Africa what it has been in the past.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>They can get it in our country because of the system we follow which is a system of private enterprise, of economic growth, and I want to make the point that by bringing the Black man into the private economic sector one is creating the one revolution that is absolutely vital in this country. We need to engage the mind of the Black man to back us up in the system we follow, which is one of private enterprise and initiative upon the individual. Capitalism is a system in which a man is involved with his own money doing his own things for himself and his family and thereby making a contribution to the whole of the society. I think we have to be very clear about this. I believe that the conservative in politics is the real liberator. I think it is important to realize that the people on the left, the revolutionaries and the radicals, the people who cause revolutions, are not liberators. They break down structures, but it is the conservative who takes those structures and puts them back together again in a form that will work and give stability to the people. That is the man who is the liberator. I want to draw this to the attention of this House with all the earnestness at my command. Conservatism means private enterprise. It means the man himself working for himself. It means a man divorced from this idea of the State or group which is supposed to be able to do everything today! We have got so far away from the idea of the individual in our society that I think we stand in very great danger of losing what is the <span class="col_747-748" refersTo="page_0390"/>absolute spark and inspiration of the whole of our Western system. On the last day man will stand adjudged as an individual, and I think that we must understand very clearly that South Africa today has undergone a tremendous revolution. A tremendous economic change and a tremendous change in the thinking of the people has taken place. We now stand at a point where the State is heavily engaged in the process of production. I believe, however, that the State is becoming too involved. That is the point I wish to make in what I am saying to the hon. the Minister. Whether the hon. member for Germiston District had that in mind when he proposed his motion, I do not know. I do not think so. If someone were to propose a commission to investigate State involvement, it would have my absolute support and everything I could back it up with. The hon. member for Johannesburg North was engaged in picking teams. He would like a team to investigate this and that. Anybody can pick teams.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Walmer asked me a number of questions this morning which I misinterpreted. I should like to apologize to him. I have since given him the information.</p>

<p>I find it strange that the hon. member for Constantia should have discerned a sinister attempt to move towards socialism in the motion which was introduced. I do not think that any of the hon. members on my side, those who spoke in support of the motion, indicated in any way that this was the purpose of the motion. It is interesting that the hon. member for Johannesburg North sees something quite different in this motion. He sees in it an admission of failure on the part of the Government.</p>

<p>I appreciate the contribution of hon. members to this debate, and I do so for important reasons. I think there is one aspect on which we cannot disagree, for no matter what our political solutions to the problems of the country, whether they be mine or those of the hon. members directly opposite me, or those of the hon. members of the PP there is one basic prerequisite for success, namely that we must have economic growth and stability in the country. With great respect, I do not believe that an occasion such as this one should be used by hon. members to score political points such as the hon. member for Constantia attempted to score against the hon. member for Johannesburg North. I think it is unnecessary. In my opinion, the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia says nothing more than what is in fact the policy of this side of the House.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Mooi River made a very important point, but I submit that that point is not at issue. The Government&#x2019;s basic policy in this regard has been enunciated many times before.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it has not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh yes, it has, but I shall repeat it for the benefit of the hon. member. We have said that our basic policy in this regard is that the economy is best served by the profit motive as it is embodied in the private sector. I subscribe fully to this principle. Naturally the Government&#x2019;s machinery is not geared to the utilization of the development opportunities which offer themselves from day to day. It is not geared to the maintenance of a buoyant national economy by participation to the extent that certain hon. members suggest. However, I do believe that the Government has a responsibility to build up the broad infrastructure within which private enterprise can progress. In order to ensure the necessary infrastructure, I believe that the resources of the country can best be used and utilized by the private sector. The policy to give the private sector a free hand in its promotion of self-interests as far as it is reconcilable with public interest has, I submit, never been changed or diverted. It still remains <span class="col_749-750" refersTo="page_0391"/>a basic consideration for the determination of Government action. I should, however, like to stress that it does not exclude the Government&#x2019;s right, duty and prerogative to do what the hon. member for Paarl said, viz. to manufacture products of a specific strategic importance where these are required and to move into a sphere into which the private sector does not want to move.</p>

<p>*Having said this, I want to emphasize that hon. members are free to disagree with me if they want to. They can say that there has been too much of it, and for the purposes of my argument I could concede that, but insinuations to effect that the Government has deviated from the basic principle of a free economy are not substantiated by the facts.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I should like to revert to the hon. member for Johannesburg North for a moment. He knows that group forming and amalgamations which give rise to the establishing of very big enterprises are an increasing phenomenon in our economic life. In fact, I think he has read very well indeed the speech of one of the people who control these big enterprises. He will also admit that he is an apologist of certain of these institutions which have become so big that they have become institutions of national importance. Their duties extend beyond the normal realms of private enterprise. I would advise the hon. member to examine his conscience as to whether they fulfilled their social obligations which are required from institutions of that size. He also knows that management and ownership have become completely divorced in recent developments. I would suggest to him that he read the graduation day speech of the Chancellor of the University of Cape Town and test himself and his motives against those norms.</p>

<p>*I believe that we cannot in all fairness accept that there is no planning or inquiry in the economic sphere. However, I want to thank the hon. member for Germiston for the opportunity he has created for us to reflect on the long-term economic objectives of our country in this House, in contrast to what often happens in another connection. I think that no hon. member will disagree with me when I say that the desirable development of South Africa is the one which is aimed at achieving specific long-term objectives, which&#x2014;I emphasize this&#x2014;are able, according to investigation and experience, to produce the greatest socioeconomic benefits for our whole country and all its people. If we have to try and identify these objectives to ourselves, I believe that no one could disagree with me when I say that one of the requirements is a high level of employment&#x2014;i.e. jobs for a growing population. Nor do I believe that people will disagree with me when I allege that a high priority should be given to a high economic growth rate, a growth rate which will be able to satisfy the increasing expectations and to raise standards of living. Similarly, no one could disagree with me when I say that we have to pursue stable development. By that I mean development in the economic sphere that will be as little subject to interruptions as possible. In the times in which we live, everyone will agree, too, that we must aim at a low inflation rate or a low rate of price increases. This means that we must have price adjustments which do not always incline upwards only, but may incline downwards as well. I think the hon. members on the other side have missed an opportunity, for in their search for ulterior motives they have completely missed the purpose of the motion. Of course an acceptable distribution of income in an objective in this country as in any other. Of course one wants to use it as a means for alleviating or avoiding, in so far as it is possible under our system, the hardships of people, of particular groups. Let me say in passing that I believe that the hon. member for Johannesburg, and the people with whom he works and with whom he is associated, employ many people. So he will be able to say for himself whether he pays them an income which in every respect is above the poverty datum line, as he calls it.</p>

<p>A long-term objective on which he will not disagree with me is that we must protect and conserve the country&#x2019;s resources, as well as the environment in general, in a suitable manner. I concede that many other objectives could be added to those I have already mentioned, but if we all accept that those I have mentioned should be our primary or principal objectives, most others could be regarded as secondary or tertiary objectives because they limit or supplement the principal objectives I have mentioned. If hon. members agree with me on this point, I believe that they will also agree with me that we should <span class="col_751-752" refersTo="page_0392"/>consider at once to what extent these objectives and their achievement are limited and if they are limited, what the limitations are that are imposed on them. If there had been no bounds to our development possibilities, we could all have lived like kings, or at least like the hon. member for Johannesburg North. The fact that man has to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow implies that there are limits to the goods and services and the income which he has available to him. I want us to look just for a moment at the limitations on the achievement of the objectives I have referred to. It is true that these objectives are not always fully reconcilable in the first place. A high level of employment and a high growth rate, for example, will not always necessarily bring about an acceptable distribution of income. The most common limitation upon the pursuit of these objectives is the one which is imposed by our balance of payments, mostly in the form of the lowest limit of our gold and currency reserves, and sometimes even these limits can be stretched by means of devaluation or loans from outside. The achievement of our objectives is also limited by our natural resources or our labour force with its available&#x2014;or limited, if you like&#x2014;skills. It imposes limitations, not only upon the setting of the objectives, but also upon their achievement, because the country possesses only a specific number of economically active people at any given moment, and it is usually not possible to bring about any substantial increase in this number, except at a very high cost. Apart from the conservation of our resources, the depletion of particular resources, such as coal, can impose a limitation upon the development of a particular industry, and if cost increases have to be introduced, this may have the same effect. The availability of capital often has a limiting effect on savings for purposes of investment, of course, or it is a factor in the development and in the achievement of the objectives which we set ourselves.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was suspended, I was dealing with the restricting factors in respect of our proposed economic objectives. It is obviously true that apart from the quality of labour and the number of labour units, human resources have a further facet which is extremely important for achieving our industrial development in particular, and this is the spirit of enterprise which is essential. I want to emphasize that the spiritual element in respect of our human resources is an important factor in imposing a restriction or in pushing our development beyond existing bounds. I think its crucial importance was best illustrated by Lord Chesterfield when he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That silly sanguine notion that one Englishman can beat three Frenchmen encourages and sometimes has led to one Englishman beating two Frenchmen.</block>

<p>This illustrates an important facet and I think that the hon. member for Johannesburg North could contribute more towards propagating this spiritual requirement among our people rather than to keep talking about South Africa and its possibilities in defeatist terms. In my opinion it is essential, when we look at the objectives and when we look at the restrictions upon them, that we should also consider at once the particular demands and requirements of the time within which we are operating.</p>

<p>It is a fact that since the last world war the requirements of this rapidly changing world have made increasing and great demands, not only on our economy, but in fact on our whole socio-political structure as it exists at the moment. This necessitates the reconsideration of long-term objectives from time to time which the hon. member advocated. It also necessitates the reconsideration from time to time of the factors which have a limiting or restricting effect. The first factor to which I referred, the reconciliation between conflicting objectives, specifically requires this. I believe that such a continuous revaluation or reconsideration of priorities and of the changing requirements of our times should take place continually. There must then be a process of rearrangement according to the demands of the times. Allow me to refer briefly to what these circumstances are or can be in terms of South Africa and to place the country in perspective in respect of its economic objectives which we want to pursue. I think that it is important to us in South Africa, as the hon. member for Vryburg said, that practically all neighbouring <span class="col_753-754" refersTo="page_0393"/>African states have been politically emancipated. In the opinion of some this has created problems for us, to others it has opened up new prospects. I believe that it contains an element of both. I think the problems consist in the fact that we are faced with new situations in respect of the safeguarding of our country&#x2019;s borders. I think the prospects consist in the fact that it opens up to us new possibilities of trade relations and negotiations with other states. It offers us the possibilities of economic aid, which will make possible the alliance of states with common objectives.</p>

<p>A second factor which is important to us is that in the outside world, seen as a whole, the danger of boycotts has developed and still exists, particularly because of the rising influence of the Third World after the war. This kind of danger, the boycott danger, is particularly significant when we look at the fuel situation in general, where countries of the oil-producing world and of the Third World are combining in an attempt to enforce boycotts against South Africa. Let us make no mistake. This affects the Republic in many fields. It affects the country in the field of armaments provision. But it forces us to do what the hon. member is asking us to do, and that is to keep subjecting our objectives and priorities to critical consideration and to rearrange them in accordance with the circumstances within which we operate. Similarly it is true that for the achievement of these objectives, the state of our balance of payments attains a specific new strategic significance for us. We cannot get away from this. I want to allege that the following facets of this are important. It has strategic significance because of the important role of products and raw materials as earners of foreign currency and the danger which this holds for us as a result of the overseas markets which have now been afflicted by recessions for two years, for example. Another aspect which makes it strategically important is the particularly difficult technical problems which are arising today concerning the marketing of gold, which my colleague can discuss much more authoritatively than I can. It is also strategic because of the Republic&#x2019;s dependence on the influx of foreign capital, which, as we all know, has an important part to play if we are to achieve our objectives even on the medium term. It is strategic because of the high tendency to import that we have in the Republic regarding capital goods, but also, and in particular, regarding consumer goods as far as our markets are concerned. And what is important is the need for us in South Africa to seek an alliance with other states in Southern Africa in the economic field, particularly with the states south of the Sahara. This need is increasing. In my opinion it is increasing for three main reasons. The first reason is naturally to strengthen our trade position, especially since protectionism has been built up in the old traditional markets against Southern Africa and its exports. The second reason is to strengthen its international economic and political bargaining power. The third reason is that we all know that economically independent states have very little enthusiasm for military adventures and terrorist excursions.</p>

<p>The final point I want to mention in this connection is that it is also essential for us in the Republic to operate with strength in relation to the outside world, to be able to hold our own in the military field and to be able to hold our own in the international conference halls of the world and of organizations. Seen in this way, I do not think hon. members can find fault with the motion we are considering. Seen in this way, I do not think that the hon. members can find fault with the standpoints I am submitting to you. If we are to do this, then in my opinion it becomes essential for us to incorporate the concept of planning&#x2014;not, as the hon. member for Constantia alleged, in the direction of socialism, but, on the contrary, to create possibilities in this way for the private sector to play its rightful part in our economy.</p>

<p>The hon. member can make his own choice of words, as long as we are agreed about what we want to achieve. In order to determine objectives and to draw up priorities there must be investigations, continuous investigations. If we can concede this, we must ask in what way we can ensure that we achieve the objectives to which the hon. member referred, and if we do not make the desired progress with these objectives, or if the priorities we all accept are not observed, what collective steps we can take. After all, it is the function of the State to ensure this.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Speaker, the Government has accepted that the answers lie in planning. <span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0394"/>Allow me to make it clear now on behalf of the Government that in determining objectives for a private, capitalist type of economic system, the planning must be adapted to the system and planning must not destroy the system, as the hon. member for Constantia fears that it will. The way I see it, it means that our planning must be founded on the preservation of the market system, and that this in turn, the way we see it in the Government, will be adjusted and will mean that consumers will be entitled to obtain goods and services according to their own choice; secondly, that the instruments of production that we have should be made available chiefly for utilization by the private sector and to private owners, and thirdly that the production factors such as labour and capital should be channelled in that direction if we are to achieve the objectives. I hope I have made myself clear in this regard.</p>

<p>The last question deals with how we should apply planning to enable it to work efficiently in a system of private economy. The hon. member for Constantia explained the essence of the way in which it works, namely that we see it in the EDP, the Economic Development Programme, as medium-term planning. We see it to a lesser extent on the short term in the State&#x2019;s budget from year to year. We also see it in the other activities of the public sector, where planning is conducted and has to be conducted far in advance to create productive assets so that the private system may function. Finally, we must begin by distinguishing between short, medium and long-term planning, and we know that in our system, which I support, the tendency always exists, naturally, to base all planning on the expected results of the functioning of the market. I think that this is the essence of short-term planning. The characteristic feature of medium-term planning, as embodied in the EDP, is that the demand, which is once again expressed on the market, is predicted independently, while attempts are made to adapt the supply to it and to take collective action. The long-term planning, which I believe the hon. members on this side advocated effectively, is to ensure that the maximum production instruments, the maximum production factors are made available to provide for the growing requirements of our population and also to achieve the objects we set ourselves. Here we naturally assume that by making available the instruments, the factors, we shall ensure that the necessary goods and services are available. It is clear that the hon. members on the other side will not be able to find fault with this approach. Where we are dealing now with long-term objectives and priorities, we all agree that we must bear in mind the change in the social, political and cultural nature of our society in so far as we can see this on the horizon and in so far as we can move and push back the limits of what can be attained. You will understand that we must keep in mind in this connection that the achievement of specific economic objectives has an effect on the non-economic sphere as well, while the latter in turn will have an effect on our economic system and its structure. For that reason I think the hon. member is right, not in the sense that we need to have a commission of inquiry, but in the sense that we shall emphasize the principle that we shall keep taking a critical look at objectives, limitations and planning in order to achieve this.</p>

Just to prove this: In August 1973, at the request of the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister, the economic adviser of the Prime Minister inquired into the long-term prospects <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0395"/>of the South African economy up to the year 2000, an inquiry which I believe gives a useful indication of the development possibilities of the economy on the long term. I believe that it would serve a good purpose for this study to be expanded, and I believe that it would serve a good purpose if an adjustment could be made every two or three years to adapt the results to the expectations. Seen from this point of view, we shall all achieve what we want to, even if we follow different methods to achieve it, and that is the economic strength of South Africa, a prerequisite for progress and stability in every other field that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, stable growth on a continuous basis probably is the objective and aim of every civilized Government, especially in the times in which we are living. When one starts talking of long-term growth and long-term planning, one must look at the various aspects of planning which a Government can apply so as to make its contribution towards the realization of particular economic objectives. In the first place the Government employs, over the short term, the annual budget so as to achieve certain objectives. In the second place there is over the medium term an economic development programme which is drawn up by the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister. In terms of this programme it was decided as far back as 1964 that a growth rate of 5&#x00BD;% per annum would be maintained. When a decision is taken that an economy should grow at a particular rate, the classic and historic spending patterns are taken into consideration in order to determine how the gross domestic product is to be spent in future. If one exceeds it and spends too much, the economy grows too fast, and <i>vice versa.</i> It is extremely important, when one accepts a particular growth rate, for the necessary measures to be taken so as to ensure the maintenance of growth rate without bottlenecks arising in the sphere of labour and in the sphere of money. Care must also be taken that balance of payment problems do not develop.</p>

<p>As far as the long term is concerned, the Government can take certain measures to create the necessary climate so as to take long-term planning in a particular direction. In South Africa long-term planning has to contend with a very special problem, and that is the special geography of the country, the location of our Bantu homelands, the decentralization of industries, and so on. Time and again it strikes one as very interesting to see how there are members in this House who come up against, as the hon. member for Johannesburg North has just done, one particular aspect&#x2014;in this case the socio-political set-up in South Africa. In considering the factors which determine growth over the long term, one must certainly have regard to that aspect of society.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North has all the sources at his disposal on the basis of which he could have made a positive contribution today as regards planning, long-term objectives, etc. But instead of doing so he turned this fine motion which was elucidated in a very efficient manner by the Government side, into a political platform.</p>

<p>It is when you come to think of it, a pity because somebody occupying a position such as he does in society, can certainly make a better contribution on many things in this House, than merely talking politics when he is given the opportunity to contribute towards a meaningful and platonic conversation and an exchange of ideas on matters such as the economy and long-term planning in our country.</p>

<p>The Government definitely has objectives in regard to its long-term planning, objectives pursuing for 27 years. The hon. member and his associates feed on them. As far as the long-term objectives are concerned, the Government is giving very close attention to its short-term planning facilities, its medium-term facilities, as well as its long-term facilities, such as the provision of basic research facilities and the establishment of strategic industries where necessary. In so far as the Government has stimulated the establishment of State corporations, this certainly does not amount to interference to the extent to which they want to suggest here today. In this regard we must differ very seriously from the hon. the Opposition. There are many sound, rational and economic reasons for State corporations, but the hon. members on the opposite side are obsessed with other things.</p>

<p>There is also another very important aspect which the hon. member for Germiston District <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0396"/>elucidated here today, and that is the role of the private sector in the long-term planning in the country. When one starts speaking of the long term, the Government is not the only one who plans. In this regard it is the private sector, as well, that has to see to its own long-term requirements, for instance with regard to managerial potential&#x2014;managerial development within big corporations in which members on the Opposition side have a very large share. As an example I want to mention the extent to which these people are investing money and manpower in, for instance, the development and stimulation of econometrical modelling in South Africa. There are the big corporations&#x2014;multi-national corporations&#x2014;of which I have knowledge, that have an econometrical model on a quarterly basis of that sector of the country&#x2019;s economy in which that particular corporation finds itself. It then makes advance estimates with regard to the development of that sector of the economy and of the gross domestic product which it may expect within a particular period of time. Because that company itself puts its hand deep into its research pocket, it is able to determine in its advance estimate of the gross domestic product, what the share of its sector in the economy is going to be in that gross domestic product. Because it is also doing sound market research, it also knows what its share is&#x2014;its share as company&#x2014;in the gross domestic product generated by that particular industry. Consequently, on the basis of these things, this company is able to plan, and it feeds the information which it obtains from its econometrical model, into the econometrical model of its own company. In this way it gets to know what its requirements are with regard to manpower, raw materials, financing, etc.</p>

<p>This multi-national company does not look to the Government to do these things for it. It does it itself. We expected a contribution today from that fantastic source of knowledge and of managerial ingenuity and ability which could have assisted us as laymen in this field, as people who do not even understand everything about these things, to gain a perspective which we could have employed usefully in this hon. House in discussions on the economy, on long-term planning and on the matter of arranging priorities. Instead of this we had political tirades, and yet another opportunity to contribute something constructive was lost.</p>

<p>Another extremely important aspect is the question why the hon. member and the Opposition did not speak positively about substitution exports for South Africa. The hon. member for Germiston district spoke about the declining role of gold this morning. Why did we not hear a positive and advisory sound from that direction? Since the question of export has been raised here, I should like to bring something to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I have often spoken to people who import things, process them and then export them again. In terms of the present regulations such an importer&#x2014;and subsequent exporter&#x2014;has to pay excise duty and similar taxes immediately on these articles which he imports and subsequently exports. This means that this particular manufacturer has to meet an enormous requirement in financing to tide him over. Is it not perhaps possible for this to be done on a basis of advance estimates, so that that importer will not have to pay tax on that part of his imports which, after all, he is going to export subsequently? In the end the State will get that money without that importer having had to pay at such an early stage, which forces him to shoulder huge financing costs. This could be effected in a way which would oblige him to pay interest at a particular rate of interest, or even a fine, if he is more than, say, 10% out with his payment. In this way it would be possible to eliminate any cheating in the process.</p>

<p>I think that if we had heard more positive contributions of this nature we on this side of the House would have been able to conduct a much more fruitful debate.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the steps required to remove all forms of statutory discrimination based on race or colour, the</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_761-762" refersTo="page_0397"/>Committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this motion speaks for itself, and consequently I am not going to elaborate on the contents. Instead I am going to use my time to motivate this motion. I think it is very clear that we are dealing here with a subject which is of the utmost importance to this House, to the future of our country and its people, and to the cause of ethnic relations in South Africa. It is also very clear that, when we speak of discrimination, we are dealing with a phenomenon which is very old. Consequently I want to devote a part of my speech to some aspects of the background to and the history of discrimination. In the first place I want to emphasize that my colleagues and I on this side of the House earnestly hope that this House will be prepared to accept this motion. In view of this I want to make it very clear that we shall not use the discussion of this motion as a platform, as an opportunity, to attack the Government, or anyone else for that matter, but as a positive contribution on our part to get away from the sterile debates, the accusations and counter-accusations which have become so characteristic of our discussions here on colour and race discrimination.</p>

<p>Discrimination between one individual and another, between one group and another, is probably as old as mankind itself. Very frequently it has its origin in fear and prejudice, often as a result of unfamiliarity, of otherness, of perceptible and other differences, of supposed or real threats on the part of one group to the survival, the security or the identity of another group. Indeed, there are many cases in the world where discrimination is the result, for example, of religious, cultural or ethnic differences in which colour or race plays no part.</p>

<p>The South African pattern of colour or race discrimination dates back to an early period in our history. However, it would appear that our forefathers, when they settled here at the Cape in 1652, were often free of any colour or race prejudice. The distinguishing criteria in society were in the first place those between freeman and slave, and between Christian and barbarian or heathen. In any society in which slavery is found, it is in general unnecessary to adopt discriminatory measures against the slave population. The slave, because he is indeed a slave and therefore occupies, as a matter of course, a completely subservient position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> his lord and master, need not be kept in his appointed place by means of legislation or other measures taken by the authorities. Thus it was in the Cape and in other countries in which slavery occurred as an institution. In the initial decades here in this country the difference between Christian and barbarian was the important distinguishing element, and hence the view which was current here for many years that the child of a slave who accepted the Christian religion after instruction and who was baptized in the church, automatically became entitled to emancipation. This view was based on the biblical principle or concept that one Christian may not keep another in slavery. Another consequence of this was the relatively large number of marriages which took place between White colonists and freed Christian slaves. But it must be borne in mind that only church marriages were possible at the time, and that the church was a State church. With the abolition of slavery and the consequent disappearance of the automatic relationship of superiority on the one hand and subordination on the other, it naturally became necessary for the group who were slave owners to continue to maintain that relationship of superiority and subordination in other ways. They did this by creating a socio-economic and political structure by means of which and in which the privileged position of the ruling group would be protected and entrenched, and the rights and status of the subordinate group would be defined and limited. In this way it then happened that when the ruling group felt that the ordinary differences of status in society were no longer sufficient to protect them against the demands and the encroachment of the subordinate group, they turned to legislation to obtain in this way the authority of the law and the authority of the State as well to protect them against that encroachment and threat.</p>

<p>We see this process very clearly in the history of race relations in the southern states of the USA. After the civil war and the emancipation of the slaves, the southern states, when they became self-governing again after a period of reconstruction, deemed it necessary to maintain the relative position of superiority and subordination between Whites and Negroes by means of comprehensive systems of statutory discrimination and compulsory separation. <span class="col_763-764" refersTo="page_0398"/>This lasted until 1954, when the American Supreme Court ruled that statutory discrimination and segregation was in conflict with the American Constitution, and therefore inadmissible. Even now, after 20 years, all such forms of discrimination have not yet disappeared in the USA. But it is very clear that what has in fact been achieved in this regard in the course of the past 20 years may in many respects be regarded as phenomenal.</p>

<p>This phenomenon made itself felt in South Africa as well. The development here was, however, overshadowed by the struggle which developed from a very early stage between the Whites and the indigenous population groups, first the Hottentots here in the Peninsula and in the Western Cape, and then the Bushmen, and afterwards the Bantu. This was a struggle not only for <i>Lebensraum</i> and material security, but subsequently became a struggle for physical self-assertion and survival. The fact that the Whites emerged as victors from this struggle obviously led to a socio-economic and political order in which the non-Whites occupied a position of subordination. Contributing to this were the obvious difference in religion, culture, civilization and mode of existence, and of course the externally perceptible differences in appearance in respect of colour and race. Under these circumstances it is entirely understandable that colour and race prejudice would emerge, and that a pattern of colour and race discrimination would develop. In this country as well, as happened elsewhere in the world, that pattern of compulsory separation and discrimination had to rely on a comprehensive system of statutory and administrative measures. This pattern was accepted as normal and self-evident in the White Western world, and has in fact been seen as an outgrowth of the fact that the White nations emerged as colonial rulers of the non-White peoples of the world on a global scale.</p>

<p>In this situation the 20th century brought fundamental changes. The struggle waged during Second World War against the Nazi philosophy of race superiority, the end of the colonial era, the liberation of the non-White peoples of the world and their growing influence and importance on the world scene, the opposition to the philosophy of colour or race discrimination, the application of concepts such as fundamental human rights, as embodied for example in the UN charter on human rights, the importance of the struggle between the capitalist countries of the West and communism, coupled with the tremendous expansion of education, literacy and the means of communication at the disposal of mankind, through which, indeed, the world has become smaller and it has become impossible for any community to continue to live in isolation and to arrange its affairs as though it were not associated with a world-wide comity of nations, all led to it no longer being possible for the old relationship between Whites and non-Whites to continue, nor for the old pattern of discrimination on the basis of race and colour to continue to be maintained in its traditional form. In fact it may be said that most of the 20th century has been dominated by two world streams&#x2014;the struggle between capitalism and communism on the one hand, and the struggle of the non-White peoples of the world for recognition and equal treatment on the other.</p>

<p>How do these things affect us in South Africa? Naturally we are most closely affected by these changes which have taken place on the world scene. With a preponderance of non-Whites in our own country, who are all seeking self-recognition, self-assertion, equal treatment, and who are, in common with us, established here on a continent which is predominantly Black, it is, after all, clear that we cannot continue to apply a system which is based on colour and race discrimination. And now it is clear that, although there may be considerable differences of opinion between us as to what measures or practices may in fact be labelled discriminatory and how to get rid of these, all thinking people in our country&#x2014;and I make bold to say everyone in this House&#x2014;have reached a consensus that we must move away from discrimination. If we do not do so the consequences for everyone in this country will be unpredictably ghastly. It is in this sense that Mr. Pik Botha stated in the Security Council that it was the firm policy of this Government to get rid of discrimination. Here in this House as well those words of Mr. Botha were confirmed by the hon. the Prime Minister and by other Government spokesmen. The Opposition, too, has on numerous occasions advocated the abolition in principle of statutory discrimination based on race and colour.</p>

<p>I began my speech by pointing out how we had lapsed into sterile debates as far as this matter was concerned. Our discussions in this <span class="col_765-766" refersTo="page_0399"/>House, and outside this House as well, from public platforms, in the Press and elsewhere, have degenerated into an unfruitful polemic of accusation and counter-accusation, of indictment and rebuttal, of reproach and exculpation, of allegations and denials in an endless stream of words and concepts which are aggravated and made infinitely more difficult by party-politics. Surely it can no longer go on like this. It has become imperative for us to establish the conviction among our non-White South Africans in every possible way that we are in earnest about moving away from discrimination.</p>

<p>No one has who has had any contact at all with the non-Whites in South Africa, no one who has ever taken the trouble, even if only for 10 minutes, to talk to one of those thinking persons, has any doubt at all about how emotional and deep their involvement is in the discriminatory pattern which exists in South Africa, and how totally unacceptable this pattern of discrimination is to them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I began by saying that I wanted to try to make a positive contribution, and I want to tell the hon. member opposite that he would be well advised to read the speech I made last year in which I furnished a definition of discrimination. However, I do not want to debate this point, for what I want to emphasize is the need for us to move. We can no longer continue to maintain the old pattern, and everyone in this House, the Government included, has said this, and has repeatedly stated that their policy and conviction is to move away from discrimination.</p>

<p>The normalization of our relations with the Black States of Africa will only be possible when they no longer have any doubt that it is our firm desire and intention to get rid of discrimination. We know that this matter is of paramount importance in our relations with other countries of the world as well.</p>

<p>The secure survival of all of us in South Africa is at stake. The alternatives are clear. I want to state with the utmost seriousness at my command that the alternatives are clear. They are either peace, security and co-operation on the one hand, or never-ending conflict, strife and unrest on the other. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is probable that members on the Government side will say that the Government&#x2019;s policy of multi-nationalism and Bantu homeland development is in fact a method of getting away from discrimination. However, this is not the occasion to argue that point. But even if one were to accept that statement, an infinitely vast field still remains in which this motion could be made applicable.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear that all of us accept that discrimination cannot immediately be abolished in all its forms, nor will it disappear.</p>

<p>I am convinced that we will not be able to make any progress by confronting one another across the floor of this House. I am saying this with all due respect for our colleagues on the opposite side of the House who apparently do not want to give me the opportunity to approach these matters in a positive way. I am convinced that we will not be able to make any progress by confronting one another on this matter here across the floor of this House. It has become essential for us to remove the discussion of this matter to another forum where we can reflect on the entire matter calmly and in a responsible way. Hence my motion for a Select Committee, so that we can get away from the public temptation of deriving party-political advantage from a matter which is of such vital importance to all of us in South Africa.</p>

<p>In spite of what I see here before me on the Order Paper, I want to make an earnest appeal, a plea from the bottom of my heart, to the Government and this House to find it possible to accept this motion. It could indeed usher in a new era, both in White politics as well as in the relations between Whites and non-Whites in our country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Edenvale wants us to appoint a Select Committee to eliminate, as he put it, all forms of statutory discrimination based on race and colour. Long ago Nicodemus was asked: &#x201C;Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?&#x201D; At some time or other these words are probably applicable to all of us, but I think that they are especially applicable to the hon. member for Edenvale today. With his knowledge of and background with regard to the history of the <span class="col_767-768" refersTo="page_0400"/>contact and the convergence of the diversity of peoples in South Africa, the hon. member ought to know that if he wishes to succeed with this motion of his, he should go about it in a different way, and start elsewhere. The first thing I want to tell the hon. member is that he should free himself from the United Party. The hon. member must bear in mind that we as political parties have representation in this House, each with a policy which is historically grounded. I think it is useless for the hon. member to expect us to hold an academic symposium on these matters while he is sitting here as a member of the United Party. The hon. member cannot free himself from the political philosophy to which he has committed himself. The philosophy of the United Party, as well as its policy, contains a contradiction which will in fact lead to discrimination. The point of departure of Rhodes, an imperialist and one of these spiritual forefathers of the United Party, was the superiority and inferiority of people. [Interjections.] I should very much like to refer you to the book<i> Apartheid and Discrimination</i> by K. L. Roskam, according to which Rhodes had, <i>inter alia,</i> the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I will lay down my policy on this Native question. Either you have to receive them on an equal footing as citizens or to call them a subject race. I have made up my mind that there must be class legislation, that there must be pass laws and peace preservation Acts. We have to treat Natives, where they are in a state of barbarism, in a different way to ourselves.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I have quoted this as an example of the statements of the spiritual and political forefather of the United Party. This idea of Rhodes, which is implicitly incorporated in the United Party&#x2019;s policy, was the cause of Rhodes not wanting to recognize the ethnic diversity in Southern Africa, and consequently he did not care about their right and will to maintain the preservation of their own identity. The dilemma in which the hon. member and his party find themselves is that they emulate the political ideology of Rhodes, for the reality of the diversity of peoples and their will to continue to exist separately, is in conflict with the imperialistic will of the United Party to control and to govern. On these grounds I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House expresses its thanks to the Government for the progress already made in acknowledging and promoting the human dignity of all members of the population groups of our country and for the steps envisaged in this regard for the future&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I am just as eager as the hon. member for Edenvale to debate these delicate and sensitive matters, which are of deep concern to all of us, on a scientific and elevated level. Before we can proceed to participate in a meaningful debate and a meaningful discussion on the motion of the hon. member, however, I must point out that the hon. member&#x2019;s knowledge of history and his version of the factual situation in Southern Africa was entirely one-sided. He was so one-sided that even a person such as I. D. McCrone, and various other people, would not accept it. It was very vague and unreal. There are, moreover, a number of fair questions to which the hon. members must reply. Firstly, if the concepts of &#x201C;race&#x201D; and &#x201C;colour&#x2019;&#x2019; are such a problem to them, why are the statements of policy and the promises of the United Party teeming with those very terms? In other words, my question is why do they use the term race, which is a physical-biological concept, and the resulting concepts? I can quote many examples, but unfortunately I do not have the time to do so. In their statement of policy on their race federation hon. members do in fact make use of those concepts from which the hon. member now wishes to flee. There is a second question: If the word &#x201C;statutory&#x201D; has any meaning, how is the United Party going to govern and differentiate, as it has promised the White voters of South Africa? As recently as the 1970 election the hon. members on that side of the House promised the White voters&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">White leadership over an undivided South Africa; communal boards for every non-White group.</block>

<p>I could also quote the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the book <i>South African</i> <span class="col_769-770" refersTo="page_0401"/><i>Dialogue</i> of Nic Rhoodie in which his entire argumentation on his policy for the solution to the race problem of South Africa is in fact based on the concepts of &#x201C;race&#x201D; and &#x201C;colour&#x201D;. There is another question which I want to put to the hon. member: What does discrimination actually entail? The hon. member delivered an entire dissertation around the concept of &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D;, but what is it? Apparently the hon. member only recently became a member of the United Party, because he does not know the history of the party very well. In 1955 the United Party, during a congress in Bloemfontein, adopted a certain standpoint which Roskam also quotes, but prefaces with these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The UP in opposition since 1948 could but very weakly oppose the discrimination policy of the NP by stating that &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is followed by the standpoint of the UP&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; discrimination or differentiation in itself is not necessarily an evil. The all-important question is the basis on which it is done and the motive behind it.</block>

<p>I want to go further and tell the hon. member for Edenvale that if he is so eager to get away from discrimination, he must realize that the United Party issued another pamphlet during the last election in which, <i>inter alia,</i> the following was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Constitutional change cannot, however, stand on its own&#x2014;it must be accompanied or even preceded by &#x2026;</block>

<p>and then this very interesting formulation follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Steps to remove unfair discrimination.</block>

<p>In other words, the hon. member wants us to get rid of discrimination. The hon. member himself did not tell us what discrimination is, but in their official documents that party speaks of &#x201C;unfair discrimination&#x201D;. In other words, I must deduce from that that the United Party does in fact advocate &#x201C;fair discrimination&#x201D;. That is what the hon. member should tell us. When we put these questions to them, it is not for the purpose of playing politics; we want to hold a discussion with the hon. members. We cannot&#x2014;and this is what I said at the outset&#x2014;understand the contradiction in the policy of the United Party, i.e. that they maintain in their political philosophy, on the one hand, that there is in reality a diversity in South Africa, but that, on the other hand, they want to introduce an over-all policy which is in fact based on race and colour. Before we can hold a meaningful discussion with them, the United Party must first perceive these things. On the other hand the National Party is in fact the party&#x2014;and the hon. the Prime Minister said this&#x2014;which wants to get away from discrimination precisely by means of its policy, but then from discrimination which is not merely based on race and colour, but from all the forms of discrimination which exist. One is also discriminating against a people when one wants to do something that will impair their continued existence and when one does not want to grant them the right to continue to exist.</p>

<p>Therefore it is only by having as a basic principle the recognition of the diversity of peoples in South Africa that one can arrange the points of contact in such a way that one will respect not only the individual but also the individual in his ethnic context, and will refrain from discriminating against him, and nobody is disputing that we in South Africa have many points of contact.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to approach this discussion this afternoon, not with the thoughts of Cecil Rhodes, but rather with the contemporary thoughts of an official spokesman for this country, speaking on behalf of the Government, and I take it also on behalf of the hon. member for Rissik at the UNO in October 1974. He said: &#x201C;We do have discriminatory practices and we do have discriminatory laws.&#x201D; So why does the hon. member ask us what we mean by discrimination? I have just quoted the official statement by Ambassador Pik Botha, speaking on behalf of the Government of this country, and I would have thought that the hon. member for Rissik would have approached this matter, as I shall attempt to do, by saying: Thank God, at last in this country we have got to the stage that we are not going to say who is right in regard to race relations, but rather, what is right for this country in regard to race relations. If I fully understand the text of the speech of our ambassador, what we in this <span class="col_771-772" refersTo="page_0402"/>House are agreed about, is the elimination of discrimination on the grounds of race and colour, as and where it exists in this country. We are therefore indebted to the hon. member for Edenvale this afternoon for the lucid way he has dealt with the historical aspects of the discriminatory laws to which our ambassador referred at the United Nations. The Government&#x2019;s attitude is clear, according to the statement of our ambassador. He does deal with that historical aspect, and then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those laws and practices are part of the historical evolution of our country. They were introduced to avoid friction and to promote and protect the interests and the development of every group, not only those of the Whites.</block>

<p>That is a correct historical statement. But then he goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But I want to state here today, clearly and categorically: My Government does not condone discrimination purely on the grounds of race or colour. Discrimination based solely on the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin cannot be defended, and we shall do everything in our power to move away from discrimination based on race or colour.</block>

<p>He then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would mislead members if I implied that this would happen overnight. There are schools of thought, traditions and practices, which cannot be changed overnight. But we are moving in that direction and shall continue to do so.</block>

<p>Perhaps that will satisfy the hon. member who asked why we could not remove discrimination immediately. I recommend to the hon. member that he should read the text of the ambassador&#x2019;s speech to the United Nations. In effect, what has been said is that discrimination cannot be condoned, it is indefensible, and we must employ our utmost powers to move away from that discrimination. I believe there is a new and appropriate dimension in our political discussions, because the three elements: the rejection of the indefensible, the refusal to condone and the determination to move away, form a common denominator in our discussions and our approach to the problem of race relations. To make our common resolve meaningful, and to show our <i>bona fides,</i> the first thing we as legislators have to do is to identify the objectionable discriminatory laws that have to be amended or done away with. In this respect there is scope for discussion and differences of opinion, but for heaven&#x2019;s sake, surely the time has arrived for us to go out and identify the discrimination and not to protract it or to stand by and allow discrimination any longer. The second step is to determine the method, as legislators, for removing that discrimination, and the third is a time-table&#x2014;and I am saying this explicitly&#x2014;for its implementation. Probably the most difficult is the identification of what is discriminatory in our legislation. On 5 August 1974 in this House I gave what I regarded to be a chronological list of the discriminatory laws that have been passed by this Government since it came into power. Time does not permit me to go through them.</p>

<p>However, I believe we should look at each of those to see to what extent they offend the undertakings given by our ambassador to the world, more than 12 months ago, on behalf of the Government and this Parliament. The other problem is that the question of this identification is not confined to one portfolio. It is not confined to one aspect of our life, be it economic, social, sporting or recreational, and it is not responsibility for one section of our community either. It embraces all sections of our community. It is because I believe that this investigation could be done effectively and speedily by a Select Committee that I support the motion of the hon. member for Edenvale. On such a Select Committee one can sit and receive evidence, consult, deal with the people who complain of laws which they say discriminate against them because of their colour, and find ways in which we can eliminate those aspects that are disadvantageous to our country. This is essentially a matter for a Select Committee. We must accept that one cannot, with a sweep of the hand, say that every discriminatory practice will stop here and now, within 24 hours, because we must ensure the continuance of economic stability as we move into a different phase of race relations, and we must maintain peaceful race relations. We must not disrupt the peaceful race relations that exist. We also have to take cognizance of <span class="col_773-774" refersTo="page_0403"/>the necessary adjustments and many of the social customs and habits of the people of this country. There must be a careful development also of a political dispensation to replace the present system. A unitary system cannot continue in the Government&#x2019;s own policy. The very idea of separate development, the very idea of separate Bantu States, accepts that a unitary system cannot apply to the territorial area of the Republic of South Africa. If we agree that that cannot apply, then surely we are adult enough to make the necessary approaches and work out a scheme which can accommodate the development which must take place, and take place rapidly, in race relations in this country. Where better can that be discussed than in a committee room?</p>

<p>The next is the determination of the timetable. I was interested to see a statement by the hon. member for Pretoria Central recently in connection with the Lusaka manifesto. I agree with him wholeheartedly where he says that he believes the Government had the desire and the will to cut our discrimination on all levels; separation, however, not necessarily being discrimination. I agree. There are certain circumstances where separation is not necessarily discrimination. I now particularly want to quote what the hon. member for Pretoria Central then went on to say. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was important to note that the Lusaka Manifesto accepted the principle of a transitional period when these principles could not be carried out for reasons of good government.</block>

<p>I accept that. We must have a transitional period.</p>

<p>I now come to the one question I do want to urge upon the House this afternoon. We cannot go on having these long discussions without achieving any tangible result in regard to race relations in this country. It is a long time since our ambassador spoke in the United Nations. He spoke in October 1974 and it is now already February 1976. Exactly a year ago, on 4 February 1975, I said here in the no-confidence debate (Hansard, 4 February 1975, col. 172)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot believe that this Government is capable of making adaptations fast enough and effective enough in South Africa to give truth and import and substance to the words of our ambassador at the United Nations.</block>

<p>In the same debate the hon. the Prime Minister replied that he was taking various steps and intimated that one of the steps he was taking was to compile a list of boards and various Government organs on which he felt the non-White people might have representation. He mentioned the Economic Advisory Council, the Wage Board, the Apprenticeship Board, the Unemployment Insurance Board, and others. What has happened in that direction? Twelve months have passed. I hope this House realizes the urgency of this matter and the urgency and wisdom of appointing the Select Committee being suggested by the hon. member for Edenvale. We must be seen to be doing something about this situation. Cases where tension has been created come to me over and over again, especially cases involving the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act and the Immorality Act. The churches are now saying that these measures must be done away with, but we on our part just go right on applying them.</p>

<p>We have to realize that, in the promotion of human dignity among the non-White persons, we cannot go ahead and pass resolutions such as the amendment of the hon. member for Rissik. We cannot have a resolution to the effect that we are doing everything to promote human dignity when there are measures such as those I have referred to still being applied. I want to mention a particular case in the House. When I wanted to have lunch with the principal of the University of the Western Cape, Dr. van der Ross, before he was to address a meeting in the centre of <span class="col_775-776" refersTo="page_0404"/>this city, a meeting at which I was to preside, I had to get a permit to take him to a restaurant.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear the hon. the Minister say that that requirement has been withdrawn probably from today. I hope the hon. the Minister will announce that that is so. Then, at least, we are doing something. That is the point I have been trying to make: We must do something.</p>

<p>There are so many similar cases I could mention, cases that are discriminatory. For that we do not have to get down to the fine borderline cases at this stage. I am sure the hon. member for Rissik, for example, could stand up and spell out half a dozen purely discriminatory pieces of legislation on our Statute Book which should be removed from the Statute Book immediately. I am sure he could do it. However, he will not. Instead he fixes his attention on those about which we can argue whether they are discriminatory or not. Let us deal with those at some later stage when we have done away with those measures which we know to be discriminatory. Let us remove those from the Statute Book first. To the extent that the hon. the Minister of Justice will deal with these matters this afternoon, we shall appreciate it. As I have said earlier, I do not believe that this is a matter that rests with one portfolio alone. It could not possibly be so. This is not the sort of subject matter that could be dealt with under one portfolio. It is a matter that affects every facet of our life. It affects it as regards the running of health services, how doctors can or cannot associate with one another, or whether there must be separate Black and White nursing associations with separate control. Similarly, as the hon. member for Sea Point indicated, must scientific societies be kept separate? We cannot go on with this practice in our country, and we cannot say we are going to stop it unless actual steps are taken to put an end to this discrimination. I do hope that within the next few weeks of this session we are going to see that the undertakings of our ambassador, that we are moving in that direction and that we will continue to do so, will become a reality to be seen by the whole world.</p>

<speech by="#herman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, every political party has a policy which it pursues and advocates by virtue of which it comes to this House. The National Party, for example, has its policy of multi-national development, a policy which aims to give every race in this country the opportunity to develop itself to the utmost, like every other population group, so that the human dignity of every member of every population group in this country will be recognized at all times and the identity of every population group will remain intact. It is against this background that Mr. Pik Botha spoke at the UNO. He spoke against the background of the policy of the National Party. There was nothing strange about it, because it was the policy of the National Party which he stated there. If there are hon. members who find this amusing, I would like to refer them to opinions of former leaders and of the present leader of our party. I do not want to go back very far. I want to refer to what Dr. Verwoerd said in this House in 1961 (Hansard, Vol. 107. col. 4617) namely that South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; tries to find a policy whereby, whatever might happen in the transition period (and therefore just as in the case of the other countries), it is the object and the motive to evolve a method as a result of which eventually there need not be discrimination or domination.</block>

<p>Dr. Verwoerd went on to say that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We arrived at this clear standpoint that discrimination must be eliminated by carrying separation far enough.</block>

<p>We need not go so far back. I want to refer to what the present hon. Prime Minister said. In 1974 he referred to this&#x2014;I believe that it is very important&#x2014;and said that he had made it his object to keep moving away from discrimination. Ever since he became Prime Minister, he has pursued this object and said that this would remain his goal. He proceeded to say&#x2014;(translation)</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_777-778" refersTo="page_0405"/>Who has warned against this more often in public than myself? In fact, I have reproached the Bantu leaders, saying that I speak very frankly to my people and that they should also speak frankly to their people because it cannot only come from one side.</block>

<p>This is very important. This whole moving away from discrimination and the recognition of human dignity cannot come from one side only, because there are different population groups in this country. This is why I find it strange that the hon. member for Green Point should want to create the impression here that Pik Botha&#x2019;s speech dropped upon us from the skies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#herman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make it very clear that this side of the House does not subscribe to the motion as formulated by the hon. member for Edenvale. He told us that he wanted to keep this matter out of politics, that we should not drag politics into this debate and a whole lot of other stories. I want to say in the same vein and with tears in my eyes as well that we should accept the amendment of the hon. member for Rissik in its totality. I believe that it is important for this House to express itself in favour of that amendment today.</p>

<p>Unlike the hon. member for Edenvale, I wish to confine myself to the content of the motion. The hon. member said that he did not want to confine himself to the content of the motion, but I want to confine myself to it specifically and to tell him why we do not subscribe to his motion. In the first place, this whole question of relations politics is a political matter which has repeatedly been discussed across the floor of this House by different political parties. Now the hon. member wants a Select Committee to be appointed on which, in the first place, members of the National Party should serve, a party which follows a policy of multi-national co-existence in this country. Besides them he wants members of the United Party to serve, a party which does not pursue multinationalism, but multi-racialism. With their policy of multi-racialism they are already practising the most serious form of discrimination which exists. If they want to be honest in their intentions concerning multi-racialism they must break down all the barriers between races in this country, otherwise they are not being honest in their intentions and they discriminate. In the third place there will also have to be members of the other party serving on such a Select Committee. This is a party that says there must be integration in the country. On the other hand, it is a party which says that it stands for qualified franchise for all people in this country, based on educational levels and all this type of thing. This means out and out discrimination. We have already discussed several of these matters across the floor of this House. We fight about this every year, so I find it strange that they should now want a Select Committee to discuss these matters on which we have held very different opinions through all the years up to the present day. In the second place the hon. member for Edenvale said that he did not want to drag politics into this. What could be a greater dig at the National Party than the one contained in this motion? He wants to imply that the National Party is not qualified to carry out its policy, but that the United Party should be summoned to help the National Party carry out its own policy. It is very clear that they actually want to move a motion of no confidence in the National Party by means of this motion. The National Party came into power in 1948 with this policy. It has won election after election with this policy It has survived motion after motion of no confidence in this House as a result of this policy through which it has repeatedly emphasized that it wishes to get rid of all forms of discrimination. What is more, this Select Committee which is supposedly requested by the hon. member for Edenvale would have to be a permanent Select Committee. It would not be a Select Committee which would be able to conclude all its activities within a year. There are different people who see matters from different points of view. What one person regards as differentiation appears to be discrimination to another. The opposite is also true. By next year things may have changed once again. Moreover, the policy of the National Party is carried out by the National Party itself with the aim of eliminating points of friction. Now, if we study this motion carefully it seems as if the Opposition wants to try and force the Government to proceed rapidly so that it will be over-hasty and perhaps make mistakes. This is <span class="col_779-780" refersTo="page_0406"/>the practical outcome of this motion which is being moved. The movement away from discrimination, our relations politics, is a matter which must be handled with circumspection. Precisely because it is such a delicate matter, points of friction must be eliminated at all times. Also, discrimination must not be implied when there is in fact no discrimination. It is an integral part of the policy of the National Party that friction must be eliminated as soon as possible and that discrimination, if such a thing exists, must be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>That is the duty, not only of the White section of the population of this country, but also of the non-White section. They too must further this aim. What I find a great pity this afternoon is that both the previous speakers on the Opposition side spoke in such general terms. They do not specifically indicate what discrimination is and is not. They cannot define it. They are taking a wild shot and hoping to hit something. One cannot speak in such general terms about such a delicate matter. One must at least say to what one is referring. There is a difference of opinion about this important matter. What is also very important to me in this motion is that statutory discrimination is mentioned. Now the question immediately arises: What is statutory discrimination? What about discrimination which is not statutory discrimination? What will happen to this? This is very important to me. Discrimination which is not statutory discrimination must be discrimination which is found in the minds of people. This could be much worse than statutory discrimination. This is where elementary courtesy between individuals must be taken into consideration. Is this not perhaps more important than statutory discrimination? This is where each White and non-White member of the population of this country can contribute towards observing those elementary principles of courtesy in their dealings with one another.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that the Opposition wants to make a purely political issue of this motion this afternoon. Then they say that they do not want to play politics. Should this amendment be accepted, they would have us just where they want us. I think that this is a subtle way of trying to win the favour of various groups of people in this country. Let us understand one another quite clearly. To some people the principle of non-discrimination or of the elimination of discrimination means nothing less than integration. The reason for this is that discrimination is, after all, a form of differentiation, if one were to briefly define it. Discrimination is a form of differentiation, good or bad. It is a generally accepted practice. One finds it in nature. One finds it amongst nations, amongst the people themselves&#x2014;this form of differentiation. To eliminate all forms of discrimination&#x2014;I emphasize the word &#x201C;all&#x201D;, the word which appears in the motion&#x2014;is therefore contrary to natural law. It is incompatible with Biblical law. To get rid of all forms of distinction seems ridiculous to me. If Acts such as the Immorality Act, the Mixed Marriages Act, the Group Areas Act and the Race Classification Act are considered to be statutory discrimination &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; then the abolition of these would mean the abolition of the policy of multi-national development. It would mean that multi-national development is the highest form of discrimination, derogatory discrimination. [Interjections.] Then, according to those members who are becoming so rowdy, we should integrate immediately. This is exactly what they want. There are even liberals&#x2014;and I think the hon. member for Rissik quoted from their pronouncements&#x2014;who say that each race group has a desire to retain its own identity at all times. Therefore I want to say that no one on this side of the House and in the National Party is in favour of any form of discrimination merely on grounds of race or colour. This is a delicate matter. It is especially delicate in our relations politics in South Africa. Since it is a political matter which has historically been made a political matter by this House, I believe that we cannot appoint such a Select Committee. I therefore agree wholeheartedly with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Rissik.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have a feeling that the hon. member for Potgietersrus, without really being aware of it, let the cat out of the bag. When he maintains that multi-national development is the highest form of discrimination, he is dead right. That is exactly what it is. He has now come closer to giving us a sort of definition of discrimination <span class="col_781-782" refersTo="page_0407"/>than has ever been done before. But he is still very far from it. In another respect he is quite correct when he says we should not stop at statutory discrimination, but that we should abolish all kinds of discrimination. This is quite correct. But, Mr. Speaker, where are we going to start if we do not even know what discrimination is? We have not even heard what discrimination is this afternoon. I support the motion of the hon. member for Edenvale. Unfortunately I am quite unable to support the amendment of the hon. member for Rissik, because this so-called progress&#x2014;he refers to progress&#x2014;has been extremely meagre, to say the least&#x2014;to use a down-to-earth expression, it has been &#x201C;hopeless&#x201D;. If the Government, or anyone else&#x2014;I do not mind who&#x2014;honestly thinks, as the people on my left and the people on that side do, that these petty changes which have been made during the past few years in this connection, impress or interest the vast majority, approximately 99%, of the people of colour in this country, Black and Brown, or that they have brought about any meaningful change in their standard of living, then they are grievously mistaken, Sir. The policy of these benches has always been that we should abolish all forms of discrimination, from the start. There is one very good reason for this, Mr. Speaker, and that is that if we do not abolish discrimination in all its forms, then our entire future is endangered, the entire future of this country and therefore of all of you. I fully agree with the hon. member for Edenvale, and I wish our friends on the other side of the House would pay some attention to this, that the entire security and peace of South Africa and all its people as well as the acceptance and the credibility of this country in the outside world, depends on whether we are going to succeed in this aim. I am not going to refer again to ambassador Pik Botha&#x2019;s speech, which was mentioned by the hon. member for Green Point. We all heard it and we know why he spoke as he did. There is one thing we do not know, and that is what exactly he means by statutory discrimination. If we do not get rid of that, Mr. Speaker, then our safety and the future of all of us are in danger.</p>

<p>There is still one other point I must make, one which has not been faced at all this afternoon, and this is that we must realize that the successful elimination of discrimination would have to mean a radical reconstruction of our whole society. There is nothing superficial that we can do in this regard. The reason&#x2014;actually it is obvious&#x2014;is that our whole South African society in essence rests upon race and colour and we must accept that this is so. If we say that we are going to effect superficial changes to it, we can eliminate a degree of discrimination, but as long as that far-reaching reconstruction to which I have just referred is lacking, the fundamental and critical categories of discrimination will remain unchanged and then our society will remain essentially an unjust and unequal society.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I put a question to the hon. member?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I only have 15 minutes in which to speak. The hon. member can put the question tomorrow. Like the clergyman who is opposed to all sin, suddenly all of us are now against discrimination&#x2014;the whole lot of us. We now want to abolish all discrimination. But nobody can tell us what it is, and I think this is absolutely essential. I should like to give the House a definition which I came across and which satisfies me, but not, of course, the other side of the House. I am referring to an academic who is highly regarded in some sections of the Nationalist Party, namely Prof. Alfred Hoernl&#x00E9;. Here is his definition of discrimination&#x2014;unfortunately it is in English but I think we shall all understand it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Racial discrimination is an instrument of domination. It retains the segregated in the same social and political structure with a dominant White group, but subjects them to the denial of important rights and keeps them at a social distance implying inferiority. It presupposes a common society of sorts, but a fundamentally unequal one so that a category of second-class citizen results.</block>

<p>That is my definition. I am now waiting for your definition. I am now waiting for a definition from the Nationalist Party. No, Mr. Speaker, they have already tried, and here it is. I do not know whether the hon. member for Pretoria Central, who is becoming so excited now, has read the pamphlet yet. It is entitled &#x201C;Discrimination&#x201D;. Here it is&#x2014;no fewer than 19 pages in this very attractive booklet. I hope everybody will read it. Mr. Speaker, I have <span class="col_783-784" refersTo="page_0408"/>read it five times and now I know even less about what discrimination means. It is a masterpiece in the art of evasion. It gives one absolutely no idea of what discrimination means. All kinds of pleasant things are said about separation, identity, separate development, but nowhere are we told what it means. Like other speakers, I accept that there is in fact a difference between discrimination an differentiation, but I think we should realize that as soon as differentiation depends on statutory implementation for its continued existence then the two concepts become practically the same. To talk about moving away from the one and not from the other is then completely senseless. We should go further and ask ourselves who is going to decide when discrimination is discrimination and when it is differentiation. I can say that ultimately a final answer must come from one group of people only, viz. those who day and night experience what discrimination really is, who know what it means always to be discriminated against on the grounds of skin colour. If they, the vast majority of the population, cannot agree with what we mean by discrimination, the whole effort to get away from it is largely in vain and a waste of time. For that reason I say that the Select Committee which is requested in the motion proposed by the hon. member for Edenvale should decide at an early stage how it is going to define discrimination, and state exactly what constitutes statutory discrimination. We have not even touched the surface this afternoon. Unfortunately the hon. the Minister of the Interior is not present now. He said the other day that if discrimination was necessary to protect the identity of different nations, to maintain law and order and to prevent friction between various groups, then it would be retained. In that case we have a very wide statutory field here which the Select Committee will have to leave out of its reckoning completely. This would be a pity; this would be a great pity, Mr. Speaker, <i>inter alia</i> because any nation which tries to preserve his identity by discriminating against others, is on its way to causing its own eventual downfall. This is a truth of which our friends opposite should take note. I repeat that it is essential for the Government to state without delay precisely which discriminatory measures they deem necessary for the maintenance of &#x201C;discrimination, White identity, law and order and the prevention of friction between groups&#x2019;&#x2019;, then we, and the Select Committee, will know whether there is any discrimination left for us to move away from. But I think that if we maintain all the discrimination and differentiation they wish to preserve, then very little will remain. Only when we are able to realize this can we start to think about things such as unequal pensions and salaries, the so-called &#x201C;equal pay for equal work&#x201D;, about employment opportunities, about educational facilities and about housing, things which intimately affect the quality of life of the ordinary person every day and here discrimination is more severe. We find it everywhere, sometimes in the most extreme degree, discrimination which emphasizes the White man&#x2019;s position of dominance. What are we going to do about it? Are we going to admit it?</p>

<p>In this connection let us take a brief look at the throwing open of public amenities. This party believes that it is the responsibility of the local authorities, backed in some cases by the efforts of the provincial authorities or of the central government, to see to it that there are sufficient public amenities for everyone and that they are situated where they can best serve the needs of the community. We shall strive to create an open society in South Africa in which all citizens will have the right to associate with whom they wish, and to use the existing public amenities. We shall do this, because we believe that this is the only way to recognize the dignity of the individual and to fulfil South Africa&#x2019;s solemn undertaking to move away from discrimination based upon race and colour. This is the only way. There is no other way to do it. We realize, of course, that the judicious throwing open of public amenities could play an important role in the building up of a feeling of human dignity among people of a different colour, but we should undertake this in a very sober and responsible manner.</p>

<p>This now brings me to what is possibly the harshest and in one respect the most important of the statutory discriminations based upon colour, and one which has not yet been mentioned here this afternoon. If we do not mention this, we are playing with words. I am of course referring to the statutory discrimination in the field of politics. Black and Brown people&#x2014;Indians included&#x2014;today have no political rights in the only place where it is and <span class="col_785-786" refersTo="page_0409"/>can be of real importance to them, namely in this Parliament.</p>

<p>Is qualified franchise discrimination?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>This political discrimination has an effect on virtually every facet of the individual&#x2019;s life and if we do not do something positive to rectify that situation, any other efforts to move away from discrimination based on race or colour will be relatively unimportant. It is no use not wanting to face these things. Here we have the essence of the political problem in South Africa&#x2014;the division of political power&#x2014;and we must face it. This is not the time to enlarge on this. The committee which the hon. member for Eden-vale requests will therefore also have to investigate the entire constitutional set-up in South Africa&#x2014;a set-up with its separate legislative body, with a racial basis. The committee will have to pay special attention to the laws such as the prohibition of political interference, because this is an outright discriminatory factor. There are, of course, innumerable other statutory provisions which must be removed and revised. I am merely mentioning a few of them in passing. There are the Population Registration Act and the Group Areas Act, the two pillars of separate development. These should of course be taken into consideration. Then there is the Apprenticeship Act, the Industrial Conciliation Act, the Bantu Taxation Act, the Pass laws&#x2014;these piquantly enough, are referred to as the &#x201C;Abolition of Passes&#x201D; laws: only South Africans could have thought of that. Then there is still the Act relating to the training of Bantu labourers and besides these, a host of other similar laws.</p>

<p>With reference to the question of separate amenities, one can simply say that the dictum of &#x201C;separate but equal&#x201D;, to which the hon. members on the other side of the House like to refer, is only justifiable and defensible if it represents the outcome of a joint decision between White and non-White on an equal basis, a decision arrived at voluntarily. Otherwise there is no justification for it. Even here one can ask whether it does not constitute a violation of the rights of those individuals who do not agree with the majority. This House will know that the American Supreme Court has come to the conclusion that separate amenities are inherently unequal. However, let us leave it at that.</p>

<p>In conclusion, however, I want to stress something we should all realize. This is that the elimination of discrimination based upon race and colour should be attacked on all fronts. Here I agree with the hon. member for Potgietersrus&#x2014;on the statutory, the political, the economic, the social and whichever other areas there may be. This should be done without delay. We have precious little time. I admit that it is basically a political problem, but at the same time it is a problem to which every individual, irrespective of the political party he belongs to, can make a valuable contribution by his behaviour and his approach. I want to say in all seriousness, and here I associate myself with what the hon. member for Edenvale said, that we should all take this seriously, because eventually the future of each of us&#x2014;White, Black, Brown or otherwise&#x2014;depends on the success we achieve as regards the removal of discrimination based upon race or colour. There is no problem confronting us in this country that is more real, more urgent, than the removal of this kind of discrimination.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to start by referring briefly to the amendment. The hon. member for Rissik will forgive me for saying that the amendment was somewhat negative. If he would read the motion which was moved, he would discover that this is really something positive. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of his amendment. I also want to refer you to the speech made by the hon. member for Potgietersrus, and I say that these two members were actually trying to tell us that we should forget that the Government has been in power for 28 years, for as soon as we remember that we realize that, after 28 years, we are still dealing with a situation in which discrimination actually exists. If the theory of the policy were so correct, surely there would not still have been discrimination after such a long time.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think we must all agree that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s d&#x00E9;tente efforts have had a certain degree of success, limited as it may be. This success, however, can in the first instance be attributed to the fact that during the latter half of 1974, the world and Africa in particular <span class="col_787-788" refersTo="page_0410"/>were led to believe that the political debate in South Africa was no longer on whether or not to end or to eliminate discrimination, but in fact on the when and how it was to be done. I have listened to the speeches of the hon. members on the other side of the House and I must warn them, that if they carried on in that vein, as if there were still a debate about this issue&#x2014;whether to eliminate discrimination or not&#x2014;they would in fact be doing a great disservice to South Africa. Irreparable harm would flow from that, because the impression would be created that what had been said in all earnestness 15 months ago, was merely part of a carefully planned lip-service campaign.</p>

<p>It is a historical fact, and I think we have seen it again today, that ever since the South African Ambassador at the United Nations made his statement concerning the elimination of discrimination&#x2014;and I make no apologies for mentioning it again&#x2014;there has been a difference of interpretation, especially within the ranks of the hon. members of the other side of the House. We have those who maintain&#x2014;we have had it again today&#x2014;that it has always been the intention of the Government to do away with discrimination, that in fact the whole policy of separate development is designed to that effect. Here I have in mind the speeches of the hon. member for Johannesburg West from time to time, and also what he had said outside the House. At the other extreme we also have members such as the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, who is in the habit of theorizing about this and speaking about positive and negative discrimination. He comes to the unbelievable conclusion that as part of positive discrimination &#x201C; &#x2019;n volk&#x201D; has the inalienable right to discriminate against the citizens of another &#x201C;volk&#x201D;. This is, let me say, a na&#x00EF;ve attitude, but between those two extremes we have a third group, those who say we do not discriminate but only differentiate. Now, strange as it may seem, I do not blame hon. members for being confused. I realize that there are extenuating circumstances, that when we as White people debate such a cardinal issue, we are at a decided disadvantage. We have not had any first-hand experience of racial discrimination. What is to us abstract and theoretical, is to 80% of the population of South Africa something positive, something very real and concrete. They do not have to theorize about what is or is not discrimination. They know from their daily experience exactly what this means.</p>

<p>The motion before us must therefore be seen in its true perspective. If it is accepted it will be a tremendous forward leap for South Africa. This all-White and all-powerful Parliament would have its own members&#x2014;the representatives of all political parties&#x2014;serving on a select committee, and those representatives would then be able to investigate the problem without being hamstrung by the unreal political atmosphere we have in this House from time to time. If one reads the motion of the hon. member for Edenvale, one sees that it will be a committee empowered to hear evidence, and from what I have said earlier, obviously some of the most important, worthwhile and valid evidence will, in fact, come from the Blacks and the Coloureds themselves, from a group of people with whom this House does not consult collectively. Now I know that we as a party do consult with Black, Coloured and Indian leaders, as does the Progressive Party, but the Opposition parties are, after all, only Opposition parties. There is unfortunately a limit to what they can achieve. Of necessity, the members of the Government also have such contact, and I do not deny this. They have contact with Blacks and consult with them. However, what worries me is the effectiveness of that type of consultation. It represents consultation in isolation. I think speakers on this side of the House have already indicated that what we need is a mutual effort such that all of us can learn from one another. I want to give an example. The United Party, for instance, is completely and utterly convinced that the statutory provisions concerning job reservation must be removed. We base our arguments on sound economic and moral grounds. As I said before, however, as an Opposition party we cannot make this a reality. It is only the Government that can do this. It is clear to us&#x2014;and it must be clear to everyone in South Africa&#x2014;that the Government is reluctant and unwilling to do so. Government members and Ministers have even, on occasion, advanced reasons for not doing so. I do not accept these reasons as valid and legitimate. What I do want to say, however&#x2014;and I do not think this should be a point of argument today&#x2014;is that we cannot continue along these lines, with the one side shouting &#x201C;it is&#x201D; and the other side shouting &#x201C;it is not&#x201D;. It is like children <span class="col_789-790" refersTo="page_0411"/>arguing: &#x201C;It is discrimination&#x201D;, &#x201C;it is not&#x201D;.</p>

<p>May I put a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not now. It could be that a select committee, after having gone into the fears of Government members&#x2014;and I can concede that there must be some reason why they are afraid; there must be legitimate fears&#x2014;and also having assessed the legitimate desires on the part of the Blacks, will be able to report to this House on a <i>modus operandi</i> which will make it possible for the Government to put a complete stop to this particular form of discrimination. I, like everyone in this House, am extremely concerned about the time we have left in South Africa to make the necessary adjustments to safeguard our future.</p>

<p>However, I believe we will never run out of time as long as we are prepared to move forward at the correct moment. I think South Africa has learnt its lesson the hard way in the realm of sport where, for a certain period&#x2014;quite some time, in fact&#x2014;we stood still at the Loskop Dam situation, and in the process actually first moved backwards for a few years before we moved forward. People must decide today on the correct time to do something positive about statutory discrimination.</p>

<p>I believe that the correct time to investigate the elimination of statutory discrimination is now. If we do not, we will place hon. members opposite in the invidious position where they must actually justify the existence of these discriminatory practices. It is humiliating to expect members opposite to get up and defend certain things, such as job reservation, in the day and age in which we live. I would like to spare them that. I think the hon. member for Springs, for instance, would find it humiliating. After all, he is a member of Parliament, and we must not place him in the humiliating situation of having to defend these discriminatory practices, of having to get up year after year to say (translation): &#x201C;Please do not open the sluice-gates. If you vote for the policy of the United Party, the Whites will be ploughed under.&#x201D;</p>

<p>*What is even more important, is the fact that the longer we defend our statutory discrimination, the more difficult we make it for the Government or for South Africa&#x2014;it does not matter which Government is in power&#x2014;ultimately to move away from it. We know, and frequently hon. members on the opposite side also know, that they are wrong when they defend certain discriminatory measures in this House. But they do it, and the misfortune is that there are many thousands of completely innocent Government supporters outside who believe that what their representatives say here, is correct and valid. Consequently the Government is saddled with the problem that, when they do want to get rid of it one day, they will have a tremendous amount of educating to do among their own people, because by justifying and proclaiming these things too effectively, the Government is muzzling itself. If it is necessary, for all our sakes, to move forward, it is they who have to do so. I think that the fact that there is a permanent minority party such as the HNP in our political life today, is largely attributable to the fact that hon. members on the other side did their homework too well at one stage. They succeeded in convincing their own supporters to such an extent of the necessity for and the justification of certain forms of discrimination that when they did decide to break away from it, they found that their most loyal supporters had lost the ability to adjust. Today those people are in the HNP and they are disseminating poison in the country. This is why I say I do not want an hon. member on the opposite side to be placed in the humiliating position of having to rise to his feet in this House and act as a person who indirectly proclaims the progress of the HNP&#x2014;and that which they represent. Therefore, the choice before South Africa is clear: We must move forward. But there is no advantage to be gained by, for example, digging ourselves into trenches saying that this is once and for all the policy of the Nationalist Party. We cannot agree that, as this amendment tells us, we must not be concerned and that all is well. My hon. friend, the member for Rissik, is probably the only unconcerned person in South Africa, judging by his amendment. No, we must move forward, but I accept that we cannot do so blindly.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg wants to know why not. Particularly when one is dealing with the present Government which has been conditioning its own supporters into a certain pattern of life for <span class="col_791-792" refersTo="page_0412"/>years, one cannot move forward blindly, for the problem is that one must take the people with one. The Government must educate and this is where the tremendous value of a Select Committee will come into play. The hon. members on the opposite side of the House did not mention any reasons as to why we cannot appoint a Select Committee. Not one of them can give a definition of discrimination, or really say what discrimination is. Some of them say that their policy has always been a form of discrimination, and others say that the policy has never discriminated. However, they have not yet given a single reason for not wanting to appoint a Select Committee.</p>

<p>I am advancing definite reasons why we must have a Select Committee. I believe that if we were to have such a Select Committee and if we actually accepted the recommendations after it had heard evidence and after it had ascertained how other people felt, it would be possible to make suggestions to ensure that South Africa as a whole would move forward. This would be the result the acceptance of the motion by the hon. member for Edenvale would have.</p>

<speech by="#louw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, members of both opposition parties have spoken before me. I should like to begin with the hon. member for Parktown. I am amazed that the hon. member has the audacity to come to this House and talk about the removal of statutory discrimination. I am amazed that the hon. member has the courage to come and say in this House that the progress which the National Party has made in race relations as regards the provision of facilities has been &#x201C;hopeless&#x201D;. I should like to ask: &#x201C;Do you practise what you preach?&#x201D; If anyone wants to remove statutory discrimination, then this must certainly be done consistently in practice too. If the hon. member for Pinelands wants to put a stop to Bantu walking through Pinelands, is that not discrimination? If the hon. member for Houghton underpays the non-White staff attached to the Union Hotel, is that not discrimination? If the hon. the leader of the Progressive Party does not want Black people to swim in the swimming pool in Sea Point, is that not discrimination? If the hon. leader of the Progressive Party conducts secret discussions with the City Council to limit the number of Black people in Sea Point, is that not discrimination? If facilities are provided for dogs in Sea Point before they are provided for non-White people, is that not discrimination? I want to tell that party that if ever it wants to discuss discrimination and its removal, it must first take the lead itself and implement the removal of discrimination in everyday life.</p>

<p>The Opposition has come along with a motion, and if one considers the wording of the motion, it is very clear that it implies that that which is to be removed is something harmful. I may well ask why the Opposition proposes such a motion. Is there discord and unrest here &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Is there, then, unrest here in South Africa? Is there discord and anger in <span class="col_793-794" refersTo="page_0413"/>South Africa, so that the Opposition has reason to introduce this motion? If that is the case, then surely South Africa must be faring badly. If South Africa is faring badly, how do we explain the fact that there was a record number of immigrants to South Africa in 1975? Is that an example of unrest within the borders of this country? How, then, does one explain the fact that the economy of South Africa is stronger than that of any other country in Africa? How, then, does one explain the fact that South Africa is the twelfth biggest trading country in the world&#x2014;and there are more than 150 trading countries&#x2014;if there is discord and unrest within the borders of South Africa? How, then, does one explain the fact that the per capita income of the inhabitants of KwaZulu and the Transkei is higher than that of more than half of the states of Africa? How does one explain the fact that the contribution made by UNO to the so-called 38 poor countries of the world over a period of ten years up to and including 1972 is only equal to half of the amount spent during the same period by the South African Government on the developing homelands in this country? How, then, does one explain the fact that over a period of ten years the Coloured Development Corporation has pumped more than R18 million into Coloured business enterprise? Then there is the amount of more than R60 million for the Xhosa Development Corporation. And what about all the other bodies of this kind which have made an exceptional contribution in this connection?</p>

<p>And if that is alleged, how, then, does one explain the fact that a higher percentage of the Coloured population, viz. 24%, and a still higher percentage of the Indian population in this country, viz. 27%, are undergoing schooling in South Africa, as against the Whites, among whom the percentage is only 22%? How, then, does one explain the fact that in this country the opportunity exists for any student, White, Brown or Black, to study for any diploma or degree course at a university and, if at this stage the facilities are not yet available at the non-White&#x2019;s own university, he can gain access to another university as in the case of the 200 non-White students at the University of Cape Town. What Government discriminates against its people and among the population groups in its country when in fact it creates the largest number of opportunities for maximum education?</p>

<p>In this country employment opportunities for persons of all colours are virtually unlimited. Let us dwell for a moment on the Coloured population. It is general knowledge that it is the policy of this side of the House that as regards professional people who render service to their own people and in their own communities, preference is given to people of that particular group to render that service. How does one explain the fact that if more than 100 non-White public prosecutors could be employed to render service in their own community, only two suitable candidates come forward? How does one explain the fact that only 30% of the posts for social workers are filled by Coloureds? How does one explain the tremendous gap in the medical and legal professions? How can the hon. member for Parktown say that no contribution has been made by this side of the House towards making it possible for the non-Whites to play a role at Government level? What about the delegation of powers to the CRC over the past few years by the Administrator and the Minister concerned, not to mention the establishment of that body. There has also been delegation to Coloured local managements. What about the establishment of representation on statutory bodies or even on the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council? What about the offer of a Cabinet Council in which Coloureds and people of other races may serve in this country?</p>

<p>I do not want to elaborate further on what the hon. member for Potgietersrus said in his explanation as to why it is unnecessary to establish a Select Committee to investigate this matter further. While I am dealing with this I just want to dwell on the fact that three years ago this Government appointed a comprehensive commission, the Theron Commission, to investigate all aspects of the Coloured community in its entirety, comprehensively and in full detail. Under the guidance of experts among whom there are a number of professors, an investigation is being carried out into housing, the political side, the social <span class="col_795-796" refersTo="page_0414"/>side, the income spending pattern and the income earning pattern. Hundreds, thousands of letters and questionnaires have been sent to and received back from leaders of the community and interviews have also been granted them. In view of this it may be accepted that if there was anything which could be termed troublesome, it would necessarily have to appear in these reports. If this should be the case, then surely it is now in the form of a report and can be taken cognizance of.</p>

<p>Probably I must apologize for the actions of the hon. member of Edenvale. The hon. member is a former professor of mine and he is a person for whom I have the greatest respect. I obtained reasonably good marks under him, and I always thought that this was owing to both my intelligence and his, but I must say after the motion he introduced today that there is some doubt in my mind as to how well-informed he is. Are people really being deprived of human rights here at this time? Once again, the whole intention of this motion amounts to that side of the House pretending to be the guardians of so-called civil and human rights in South Africa. That is absolute nonsense, because in the nature of the matter, to what does one link civil rights in a country? Probably each country has its own definition. The UNO says &#x201C;One man, one vote&#x201D;. Russia links it to the furtherance of Communism. In this country&#x2014;I say this with reference to what the hon. member for Durban Central said&#x2014;our civil rights can be linked to the repeated verdict of the voters over the past 28 years. Time and again it has been very clearly stated that this country recognizes a principle of self-determination for peoples and the preservation of their own identity, particularly the preservation and protection of the identity of the minority group. Any reference to the deprivation of fundamental human rights in South Africa is stifled at birth by this very policy of separate development recognized by this side of the House.</p>

<p>If there were to be no separate ethnic national development, then one would necessarily have enforced integration. It seems that at all times there are only two options, viz. parallel development opportunity for all the nations of South Africa with statutory provisions where and when necessary and for so long as it may be necessary to ensure harmony and to regulate society, or, on the other hand, integration with its necessary correlates, the continually explosive possibilities of friction, clashes and confrontation. Where in the world is a multi-national or multi-ethnic population to be found which does not have deep-seated differences as regards culture, religion, descent, way of life, tradition and political aspirations? There are more than 50 such countries in the world and in most of them, with the exception of South Africa, there is revolution after revolution. After all, in South Africa we have detente, peace and stability. It goes without saying that the world will watch us like a hawk, just as it watches the other countries, because it would like to link us to so-called race discrimination. After all, we know that the world is looking at South Africa because we have certain natural assets and are of a certain strategic value and because we are engaged in a steadfast campaign against communism. Our actions are aimed at the furtherance of peace and stabilities in this country and that is why we are the object of such careful and detailed scrutiny. After all, we must be fair when considering the analysis of our own society here in South Africa. We have 22 million people belonging to 12 major language groups and belonging to 2 000 different religious denominations or sects. Surely that constitutes a highly explosive situation in which harmony cannot be achieved other than by way of rules and regulations. This Government has on numerous occasions, through the hon. the Prime Minister and other hon. Ministers, clearly stated the standpoint that unnecessary discrimination should be steered away from as often as possible. And after all, that is just what is being done. At the same time we who form part of this plural society may not abandon the principle that peace cannot be maintained without statutory provisions which recognize and respect differences between peoples and wish to protect them peacefully in order to allow each section of the people to develop to its full potential. That is why we have had the privilege over the past 16 months of seeing that we have been able to project abroad this spirit of d&#x00E9;tente from within South Africa. It is not a question of there being d&#x00E9;tente outside South Africa and not within South Africa. It is precisely because there is stability within South Africa that we were able to project it beyond the borders of South Africa. It is possible because we have a policy of separate <span class="col_797-798" refersTo="page_0415"/>development, a policy which is designed, not to be injurious to people, but to afford status to people of whatever colour and to find a solution in advance to the necessary potential for conflict which may exist. That is why I think the time has come for the Opposition to take cognizance of South Africa, too, to evaluate and appraise it in terms of inherent value, power and objectives. That is why I have no option but to express myself in favour of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Rissik, viz. that thanks be given for the progress made in acknowledging and promoting the human dignity of all members of the population groups of our country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in all fairness and honesty one must say that the reply we have had this afternoon from the Government side has been disappointing in the extreme. The motion introduced by the hon. member for Edenvale was intended, in all honesty and in all sincerity, to raise a matter of general interest in the House and to discuss it. We explained in advance to the Government side that it was by no means our intention to launch a party political polemic. This motion was compiled in a very constructive way. Its aim was explained, but nevertheless we have had to endure the replies which came from that side of the House this afternoon. I say that this is extremely disappointing, because this debate could have contributed significantly to the improvement of race relations and of the entire relations problem in this country.</p>

<p>Let us take another look at the motion. In no way does it represent a general attack on the policy of the Government of the day. It simply stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the steps required to remove all forms of statutory discrimination based on race or colour &#x2026;</block>

<p>What person in his right mind could really object to a request of that nature? This is not an attack on the Government. We can all admit that we are guilty of some form of discrimination. The hon. member for Rissik also pointed out to us that our forefathers, too, were guilty of this. We admit and accept this.</p>

<p>Nor was he ours. The hon. member for Rissik comes and makes a political attack and maintains that Rhodes is my forefather or my friend&#x2019;s, but I simply cannot admit this. However, I shall not become angry about it because we are not here to exchange party political viewpoints. Let us discuss the motion. The motion concerns statutory discrimination in South Africa, and who is there in this House who will deny that statutory discrimination does exist? Of course it exists. We all know it. We cannot understand why there should be such unwillingness and tardiness on the part of the Government to discuss it. We hear all the political arguments, but let us now deal with the facts of the matter. Let us consider whether there is not in fact statutory discrimination which should be removed. As I have said, we are dealing here with statutory discrimination. We admit, of course, that there are many kinds of discrimination, and this is the case not only in South Africa, but in many other countries as well. However this motion concerns statutory discrimination, and as sure as we are sitting here we know that our Statute Book is larded with statutory discrimination of one kind or another. Many of the Acts are old Acts which still appear in the Statute Book. It would indeed be beneficial to go through the old Acts, all the old regulations and the old ordinances to see what could in fact be removed. It would be instructive for us, too, and could improve our legislation substantially. It would be beneficial in many other respects, too, not only for us who are sitting in this House, but also for many other people who are involved in this matter, both here in South Africa and abroad.</p>

<p>Let us take a brief look at what occurred in the previous debate. I shall not refer to it unnecessarily but I just want to make one or two points. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs admitted <i>inter alia</i> that we have a need, as far as economic affairs are concerned, for regular investigation in order to subject our economic aims and practices to a continual critical inspection. If this is necessary in regard to economic affairs, who will say that it is unnecessary to subject our relations policy, too, to a constant, careful and critical inspection. If it is necessary for the one, it must surely be necessary for the other, too. However, the moment we propose in this House that measures effecting statutory discrimination <span class="col_799-800" refersTo="page_0416"/>be subjected to a critical inspection, we get a tremendous reaction from the other side. Why? Surely this is not an unreasonable request. For example, we get a reaction like that of the hon. member for Potgietersrus. He states that he is unable to understand why, specifically, there should be a Select Committee. Whereas on the one hand he states that there are not many discriminatory measures, on the other hand he states that the subject is so broad and so extensive that such a Select Committee would have to be a permanent committee. I ask myself what is wrong with that. After all, we have permanent committees for irrigation affairs, railways and public accounts. Those committees sit every year in this Parliament. Who is going to say that those subjects are less important for South Africa, for the peace and happiness of its inhabitants and the security of its future, than the relations policy in South Africa? If it is justified to establish permanent Select Committees in regard to those matters, which are practical matters, why, then, is it so unacceptable that a Select Committee in connection with a matter of the greatest importance for our continued survival in South Africa&#x2014;and no one will deny that&#x2014;is justified? It is entirely illogical to reason that way. I now wish to consider specifically the international aspects involved here. We know that there is an extremely hostile attitude towards South Africa abroad and we find this among many people. Others, too, have an aversion to South Africa. In its worst form this hostile attitude is very intense. This applies to a whole series of countries of the Third World in Africa and elsewhere. Furthermore&#x2014;and we must admit this&#x2014;even among our Western friends, those countries which we would welcome as allies, there is a degree of aversion to South Africa, and it is pointless to deny it. It is a fact. What, fundamentally, is that aversion or hostility ascribable to? The fact is that owing to its history and its background, South Africa is an unequal community. We all admit this; we know it is so, and it will take a long time before it really becomes an equal community. However, there is another aspect. To a degree&#x2014;and I emphasize &#x201C;to a degree&#x201D;&#x2014;that inequality is maintained by means of statutory discrimination on the basis of race and colour. I challenge any hon. member to deny that. That is what lies at the root of the trouble. If one analyses the matter, one sees that there are many other countries in which inequality is also prevalent. There are many other communities and societies in the world in which there are also many inequalities, things which one cannot condone, things which are inconsistent with the civilized ideals of the modem world. These things occur everywhere in the world, but those countries are not condemned as we are condemned. The reason is that there are very few countries in which statutory measures are employed to maintain racial discrimination.</p>

<p>Must we do the same as those countries?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>No. This motion concerns a single aspect of the matter. Everyone admits that there are various kinds of discrimination, not only in South Africa but in many other countries as well. But we can deal with that on another occasion. This motion concerns statutory discrimination. I am proving that in this context statutory discrimination is particularly important specifically because South Africa is seen as an exception in that we try to maintain discrimination by means of statutory measures. That is the aspect which we must look at and it is just that which is the aim of this motion. The motion asks that we consider that specific aspect. We maintain that there are many statutory measures in South Africa which are unnecessary. They are unnecessary because they are out of date and because errors of judgment have been made. We must consider whether a statutory measure is in fact necessary&#x2014;as hon. members opposite say&#x2014;to preserve our identity, or whether it is simply based on a long-standing aversion or rejection. One of the major advantages of a Select Committee of this nature is that it can take a close look at all these statutory measures and will be able to decide whether these old statutory measures, these old ordinances, are really aimed at the preservation of identity and the development of a multinational solution in South Africa, or whether they are not perhaps based on a long-standing and indefensible aversion to or rejection of people of a different colour or race. We must consider that and we must be honest with ourselves. There are a number of such acts, and if we had a Select Committee of this Parliament which was prepared to spend time <span class="col_801-802" refersTo="page_0417"/>on this task and look honestly at these Acts, we should have to admit that an investigation of this kind would be at least as important as that relating to irrigation affairs. If we were to admit that, then we should very soon find that there are in fact a number of Acts which are entirely unnecessary and which could easily be abolished. We should then begin to have a clearer understanding of what is really meant by one&#x2019;s own identity. We should begin to realize that many of the things which we associate with our own identity and which we are inclined to consider to be essential for the preservation of our own identity, in fact have nothing to do with it, but are only based on a long-standing aversion or rejection. Once we had accepted that, then, logically speaking, we could begin to make progress; we could then see what was wrong with South Africa, with its special outlook as regards race relations; we should be in a position to scrap many customs which are entirely unnecessary. We ask in this motion that a start be made with this. There are various points of view in this House. There are a number of members in this House who maintain that there are sound reasons for most of these discriminatory measures. To be specific, they maintain that the measures were brought into being for the preservation of a separate identity. They maintain that the measures are justified because they are bound up with an overall policy of separate development. Well, that is their attitude. There are other members, the members on this side, who state that this is not necessarily the case, that many of these measures are unnecessary and that they can be taken out of our political life by South Africans without much trouble or difficulty and that we shall not suffer much as a result. Let us consider it. Let us investigate and analyse this. Let us consider what is really involved here. There will be a reaction; that is certain. If we were to go over the old ordinances in our Statute Books, and some of the new ones too, with a fine toothcomb, if we were to comb out the thorns and snags, thus enabling us to see what the wool really looks like, who would be hardest hit by that? Who would be adversely affected if we were to carry out that cleansing operation? In the first instance I have in mind one party which, fortunately, is not present in this House, for whom it would in fact be prejudicial. This is a party which is at the moment causing trouble in South West Africa, for example. I know that is a matter which must still be investigated, but according to all the reports I have seen, the problems there have a single source. That party is exploiting an extremely sensitive situation there, and this is something which we cannot afford. If the Acts which are superfluous and need not be in the Statute Book are removed and if the Government states the matter clearly so that everyone concerned with the implementation and administration of those Acts, down to the most junior official, knows exactly what the Government envisages, we should be in a position to carry on far more safely and simply with a policy of race relations which did not contain all these thorns and snags. I believe that the matter should be clarified so that everyone may know what is and what is not in the Statute Book. This should be the task of the proposed Select Committee.</p>

<p>I have referred to the people who would be adversely affected. Personally, I cannot think of any disadvantages which such action would involve. The disadvantages mentioned today in this debate by hon. members opposite are not disadvantages. They defended things which we had not attacked them about. The hon. member for Durbanville reacted as excitably as if he had been attacked by a swarm of bees. We did not attack him; we did not loose that swarm of bees. We discussed a simple motion with a single aim. What, then, are the advantages of the action we are advocating? Many advantages are entailed. One of them is that we ourselves would form a clear picture concerning where we really stand with regard to our race relations and particularly with regard to the statutory measures which still appear in the Statute Book. This is a cleansing operation which, in my opinion, should have been carried out a long time ago. A second advantage applies to our non-Whites in particular. They experience tremendous difficulties in regard to the Acts and the officials who have to implement them. And they themselves do not know just why they should be affected time and again in such a painful way by these measures. If they knew that a Select Committee was sitting in this Parliament with the specific aim of removing unnecessary discrimination from our legislation and facilitating matters, then this would be an enormous encouragement to them too. Thirdly, it entails advantages as regards the outside world. If we were to take the steps <span class="col_803-804" refersTo="page_0418"/>which we are advocating, then I predict that in many countries abroad which want to be well disposed towards us, this would be accepted as a mark of our good intentions to really fulfil our promises and eliminate discrimination. It would undoubtedly entail advantages with regard to the outside world if we in this House were to proceed actively to abolish discrimination based on colour. If an example is to be set, it must be the Government that sets it. Much has already been done in the private sector to eliminate discrimination, but unless it comes from the side of this House and particularly from the Government which must set the example, I do not believe that we shall make the progress that we should. This motion is aimed at the establishment of a Select Committee with the specific aim of removing statutory discrimination passed by Parliament and the Government, wherever it may occur. Consequently I willing support this motion.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must say that at least the hon. member for Von Brandis confined himself to the subject. One appreciates that. He advocated that we should, as it were, undergo a kind of cure. We are almost like people attending a church service. We were conceived and born in sin, and now we must go to church to find out what is wrong with us. We must now scrutinize all these statutes, and scrap some of them; we must discard them left and right. Afterwards we will feel good because we have scrapped half of these things; in any event the Government did not know why all those statutes were there. That is what the hon. member said. I want to make it very clear that the Government is completely aware of the statutes which it no longer needs. The Government has a firm policy, and all the laws on the Statute Book are there to emphasize or to complete certain aspects of that policy. When a specific law has served its purpose, it is removed from the Statute Book and discarded. I just want to tell the hon. member for Von Brandis that I do not think it is necessary to carry on to such an extent and allege that we have all erred as far as the making of laws is concerned. I take it he was referring to the days when the old United Party was in office; they also made laws which were perhaps of a discriminatory nature and which are now giving him a guilty conscience.</p>

We know precisely why all the laws are standing on the Statute Book. One may examine them and ascertain what those laws have to do with policy, administration, etc. Therefore it is not necessary for us to get together, as the hon. member had in mind. The hon. member said that it would be a good thing to remove these laws from the Statute Book, for many other countries that are well-acquainted with discrimination but have not incorporated it in legislation, are consequently not as unpopular as we are. I do not want to imply now that the hon. member was suggesting that we should remove them from the Statute Book for that purpose. The hon. member was implying that, if we were to eliminate the legislation in question from the Statute Book and were nevertheless to discriminate a little on the quiet, we would be less unpopular than we are at present.</p>

<p>That we cannot of course accept. However, I want to thank the hon. member for Edenvale for having introduced this motion. In spite of the fact that virtually all he gave us was the history of discrimination in South Africa, he did so in a very positive spirit. I appreciate it. This is an important motion. In the historical context in which we find ourselves today, this is also a very timely motion. The word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; is used indiscriminately against us by members of the UNO, and particularly by people whose own countries are so burdened by discrimination and injustice that those countries would not be able to bear scrutiny. This is a very important motion for us because we here at the southernmost point of Africa find ourselves in very difficult times. We are not running away from those facts, and because we have, and will have, possible friends in Africa, and particularly because we ourselves have non-Whites <span class="col_805-806" refersTo="page_0419"/>in our country, it is essential to indicate to them that discrimination as such is considered important enough by the highest council chamber in the country to warrant a parliamentary debate. That is why I am pleased this motion was introduced. Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat a few basic statements on behalf of this side of the House, statements which have been made before, which have been distorted, misinterpreted, and so on. However, these are statements which may be made over and over again, particularly for the sake of the outside world. I want to admit very candidly to hon. members that I am not a person who does things for world consumption only. I believe that we should do things for South Africa and in South Africa&#x2019;s best interests, but I also concede that we are not able to ignore the outside world entirely. That is why I say that, even if we were only to say this so that people abroad should hear it from us again, it is something we have to say. The first point is that this side of the House recognizes the human dignity of people. This is the first statement I should like to make. I believe personally that the recognition of human dignity is important. We do not adopt a paternalistic attitude towards our non-White people in South Africa. We evaluate each individual according to his own intrinsic value. This is my view, and also the view of all the members of my party.</p>

<p>It is true, Mr. Speaker. I can tell that hon. member something else. She is merely trying to distract my attention now. I want to make it very clear, and I am using the mode of expression of the UNO: &#x201C;We do believe in the dignity of man.&#x201D; This applies to this entire party. The hon. member need only go to the trouble of visiting a farm to see how a farmer treats his labourers. If she did so she would see to what an extent that farmer respects his labourers. If she did so she would see that we attach far more value to the personality of those people than many of the members of her party. Sir, we also endorse, unequivocally, the words of our ambassador at the UNO when he said the following there&#x2014;and I want to quote his words again, for they are being misinterpreted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My Government does not condone discrimination purely on the grounds of race or colour. Discrimination based solely on the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin cannot be defended, and we shall do everything in our power to move away from discrimination based on race and colour.</block>

<p>It is not being said in that statement that there is no discrimination in South Africa, and when one discusses discrimination, I want to say that there is a great deal of discrimination in the rest of the world as well. I do not want to say that discrimination in South Africa is the only discrimination; there is more than enough discrimination elsewhere too. In fact, we are in very good company as far as discrimination is concerned. This statement by our ambassador does not in any way say that there is no discrimination here, but states as an ideal that we should move away from that kind of discrimination which is based solely on the colour of a person&#x2019;s skin. Sir, I want to tell you now that it is by no means as easy as people think it is. How long has America not been struggling to get away from the colour of their people&#x2019;s skin? These are things which date back to the old colonial days. We are only a century away from colonialism in its raw forms. These things date back to those days, and now hon. members expect us to rectify them with a stroke of the pen.</p>

<p>The United Party members did not say so, but that hon. member is. Even the OAU said the following in the Lusaka Charter, from which passages have already been quoted this afternoon&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We recognize that for the sake of order in human affairs there may be transitional arrangements while a transformation from group inequality to individual equality is being effected.</block>

<p>These are practical people who themselves admitted that merely to cherish ideals is not the same as to convert ideals into fact. They themselves admit that it takes time to rectify these matters. It is not for other people to tell us that time is running out. What is time? How are we able to determine the time now? These are not things which can simply happen overnight. Sir, we accept Adv. Botha&#x2019;s statement, and we have always done so. As long <span class="col_807-808" refersTo="page_0420"/>ago as 1948 Paul Sauer said the following in the Sauer Report on the colour question (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any form of suppression is therefore rejected as being wrong and harmful to the national interests of Whites as well as non-Whites.</block>

<block name="quote">I see it as my constant task to move away from discrimination.</block>

<p>In view of these consistent statements we are therefore opposed to discrimination. Consequently it will probably not come as a surprise to the hon. members when I now announce here that the Prime Minister&#x2014;the hon. member for Green Point asked me this last year&#x2014;appointed a Cabinet Committee under the chairmanship of the former Minister of Labour, the Hon. Marais Viljoen,&#x2014;at present under the chairmanship of the hon. Minister M. C. Botha&#x2014;to investigate possible discriminatory measures with a view to their elimination within the framework of separate development. This task has not been disposed of yet, and the Prime Minister himself will, at an opportune time, again have something to say about this matter. I do not want to go into this matter any further because the committee has not completed its business yet. It so happens that I am also a member of the committee.

After all, we cannot simply remove discrimination completely. We are not a homogeneous society. We have here a heterogeneous situation. If we were simply to proceed to abolish all measures, surely there would definitely be racial friction. To prevent racial friction it is sometimes necessary to adopt certain measures. Regulatory measures, based on colour as such, are not necessarily discriminatory. Our Appeal Court found this to be the case as long ago as the thirties. I am referring now to that well-known court case of the <i>Minister of Posts and Telegraphs</i> v. <i>Rasool</i> in which the Appeal Court gave a judgement to the effect that where separate entrances and counters had been designated in a post office, this did not necessarily amount to discrimination.</p>

<p>I come now to that hon. member. To him, everything that is White is discrimination.</p>

<p>To him everything that is done by the Whites is discrimination. [Interjections.] After all this was very clearly apparent from your speech. You need only read your Hansard again to realize that you paid no heed to anything else. When we eliminate discrimination we must always remain practical. We must take historical developments into consideration, and we must bear economic factors in mind. After all, it is in all our interests&#x2014;White, Black and Brown&#x2014;that we do not disrupt the economy of our country through the over-hasty elimination of all kinds of measures. We must take these things into consideration. We must move within our financial means. Surely it is clear that we must do so. Surely one must also bear ethnic and cultural differences in mind. One cannot simply ignore these, as the Progressive Party is doing. If one does not bear these things in mind, one would be breaking down more than one would be building up. To remove discrimination successfully it is necessary to convince the non-Whites of all the factors which I have enumerated when one considers so-called discriminatory measures. One must take the non-Whites with you, and try to convince them of your good faith. However, it is also very necessary that the Whites in the other parties should accept our good faith, and not constantly try to disparage it and try to arouse suspicion against us, particularly among the Black people.</p>

<p>I make so bold as to say that the hon. member for Parktown clearly intimated in his speech that our good faith is not being accepted in this connection. According to him we are simply discriminating and oppressing people all the time. They are allegedly the only people with a different policy. But what is their policy? Surely they also discriminate. After all, they had to appoint a commission to inquire into qualified franchise, and it still has not completed its task. This is discrimination against the Black people. Let me tell them why it is discrimination against the Black people. Their party&#x2019;s policy is a great bluff against the Black people, and I shall tell them why. They have realized that there are more than 20 million Black people, and that the White people in their party are very few in number. Now they have to try out all kinds of dodges against the Black people to eliminate the numerical superiority of the latter, so that there will also be a little niche for them in the Government they are envisaging. It is a transparent bluff, and I want to tell them that the Black people are going to rip the mask from their faces. There is one thing the Black people in South Africa have already accepted, and that is that the National Party is not trying to bluff them. They know where they stand with us, precisely because we place measures on the Statute Book; if we must have them on a Statute Book, then that is where we place them, and we make it clear to the Blacks what their position is.</p>

<p>I am in favour, and the Government is in favour, of our expediting certain matters. I am in favour of our affording the Black people chances and opportunities. My entire party is in favour of that. There are already many opportunities for Brown and Black people. If hon. members opposite would cease to be obsessed with discrimination they would discover that there are tremendous opportunities for these people. As I have already said, when I asked for 100 Coloured prosecutors, they were only able to give me two. Therefore there is an opportunity for them to provide me with an additional 98 officials. There is a university waiting for professors; all that these people have to do is to come forward. There are opportunities which may be utilized under the policy of this Government.</p>

<p>The same applies to the Black people. The hon. member makes me sceptical, for everything that is White is discriminatory. But does he know that the Black people in South Africa, on an average, earn higher wages than the Spanish workers? Does the hon. member know that the Black people in South Africa own more motor-cars than the Russians? Our Black people have far more motor-cars than they do.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to ask Parliament to make provision for the financing of Government expenditure from 1 April 1976 until such time as the Appropriation Act for the 1976-&#x2019;77 financial year is passed. As stipulated in the Bill, the amounts required are in fact advances on the main estimates for 1976-&#x2019;77. Of the amount of R2 343 million required, R2 300 million is chargeable to the State Revenue Account and R43 million to the South West Africa Account. These amounts reflect the expected expenditure of departments for the period of four months from April to July 1976.</p>

<p>Once again I wish to point out to hon. members that Government expenditure shows considerable fluctuations from month to month and that these figures should not be used for making deductions as regards the possible total expenditure for the financial year 1976-&#x2019;77. In terms of section 4(2) of the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1975, the money may only be used for services in respect of which expenditure was authorized by the 1975-&#x2019;76 Appropriation Act or in respect of which other authorization by Act of Parliament exists.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as is customary, I intend giving the House a review of our economic situation when I present my budget on 31 March. I should like to take this opportunity, however, to comment on certain aspects of our economy which are of particular interest at the present time.</p>

<p>I shall start with gold, which still plays such an important part in the South African economy. It is easy to lose one&#x2019;s perspective about gold. We tend to be despondent about the present gold price, and to forget that, thanks mainly to the September devaluation, in terms of rand it is even now higher than the average price on the London gold market in 1974 and more than 50% higher than the price in 1973. We tend to focus our attention on the persistent propaganda about the so-called &#x201C;demonetization&#x201D; of gold and to forget that the recent IMF agreement reached at Jamaica&#x2014;as did last August&#x2019;s agreement at Washington&#x2014;in reality reaffirms and entrenches the monetary role of gold.</p>

<p>To put the situation in perspective we should contrast the new position of gold with that which has prevailed in recent years. During recent years the official price has been kept at a completely unrealistic level&#x2014;first 35 dollars, then 38 dollars and later 42,22 dollars per fine ounce, while the price on the private market rose to much higher levels. Monetary authorities were prohibited from buying gold on the private market and even from buying and selling gold amongst themselves at a price higher than the official price. The effect was to immobilize official gold reserves so that they were practically never used.</p>

<p>For some years there was considerable support for maintaining this situation indefinitely as a deliberate means of demonetizing gold. In the IMF it was seriously proposed that the Fund should be empowered to sell all its gold in the private market over a period of time. There were also proposals to encourage or even compel monetary authorities to sell their gold to the Fund in exchange for Special Drawing Rights, thus giving the Fund even more gold to sell in the private market.</p>

<p>All these extreme proposals have been effectively scotched. The understanding on gold reached in the IMF in Washington in August 1975 and confirmed in Jamaica last <span class="col_815-816" refersTo="page_0424"/>month, contains four basic elements: (1) the old and unrealistic official gold price is abolished; (2) monetary authorities are permitted to buy gold on the market and to deal in gold amongst themselves at market-related prices; (3) the use of gold in transactions between member countries and the Fund is substantially eliminated; and (4) one-sixth of the Fund&#x2019;s gold is to be sold for the benefit of developing countries, and a further one-sixth is to be restituted to member countries. There is also a subsidiary agreement, outside the Fund, among the Group of Ten most important industrial countries&#x2014;(1) that the total stock of gold now in the hands of the Fund and of the monetary authorities of the Group of Ten will not be increased, and (2) that there be no action to peg the price of gold. This subsidiary agreement is subject to review after two years.</p>

<p>Although the agreements contain phrases such as &#x201C;ensuring that the role of gold in the international monetary system will be gradually reduced&#x201D;, it is clear that the effect will be to make gold, which for several years has been virtually a frozen asset, again usable in official international transactions. Moreover, if official gold reserves&#x2014;as would be logical&#x2014;are now revalued at about the present market price, they will constitute over 40% of all official reserves, as compared with 3% for Special Drawing Rights. Clearly, gold is still very far from being &#x201C;phased out&#x201D; as a monetary asset.</p>

<p>The portion of the agreement which has caused most uncertainty in the gold market and has been the major factor in the fall in the gold price since last August, is the provision for the sale of one-sixth of the Fund&#x2019;s gold, which is about 25 million ounces. We are told that the sale is to be made by public auctions over a four-year period, and the Bank of International Settlements will be able to buy at these auctions on behalf of central banks. Though the amount to be sold is substantial, amounting to about one year&#x2019;s South African production over the four-year period, I do not think it is unmanageable, especially with the possibility of central bank purchases as a steadying factor. Moreover, the Fund and particularly the developing countries clearly have no interest in depressing the gold price, since this would reduce the amount of assistance that these countries will receive. Nevertheless, the uncertainty still prevailing regarding the method and conditions of sale by the Fund and the possible effects on the market has undoubtedly tended to depress the price.</p>

<p>There have been other depressing factors, notably substantial Russian gold sales and the possibility of further sales by Russia and Portugal, the strength of the U.S. dollar and relative exchange stability and comparatively high interest rates. These factors may well continue to exert their effect for some weeks or even months to come. But eventually, and particularly when the uncertainty regarding IMF sales has been removed, I believe that more favourable factors will begin to assert themselves in the gold market. We have already seen a fall in interest rates and some signs of increasing exchange instability, and the possibility of renewed inflationary pressures resulting from easier monetary policies overseas is very real. Industrial demand for gold may also provide a useful support for the market. In the longer-run future, and given the political and economic uncertainties which seem almost certain to prevail, I see every reason to be optimistic about gold.</p>

<p>I should like to turn to our balance of payments. The devaluation of the rand last September was discussed at some length in the no-confidence debate, and I do not want to traverse all the ground again, but I should like to repeat that devaluation was no panic measure, but a considered and realistic response to factors which were not foreseen, namely, the prolongation and deepening of the world depression and the sharp decline in the gold price. These factors were not foreseen anywhere by any substantial body of economic opinion in the earlier part of 1975. If the Government had decided at that time to be supercautious, we could have imposed a much stricter fiscal and monetary policy&#x2014;higher taxes and severe credit restrictions&#x2014;and just possibly avoided the need for devaluation, though I doubt it. But if our caution had proved to be excessive, we would have slowed down an already declining rate of economic growth, and all to no purpose.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that devaluation was the only practical and realistic way to meet the unexpected situation which confronted us last September, and I have not yet heard any positive and constructive ideas regarding any alternative measures which we could have applied.</p>

<p>To argue that devaluation will reduce our standard of living is to miss the point entirely. The deterioration of our terms of trade <span class="col_817-818" refersTo="page_0425"/>resulting from the depression overseas, and the decline in the gold price, naturally and inevitably had an adverse effect on the economy. But the devaluation of the rand was the best way open to us to counter these adverse external forces and to establish a foundation for renewed economic growth, as and when external conditions improve, and thus safeguard our living standards.</p>

<p>Incidentally, there seems to be some misunderstanding about the movements in the exchange rate of the rand in recent years. The hon. member for Von Brandis, for example, referred in a recent debate, if I understood him correctly, to a total devaluation of 35%, which he apparently calculated by adding the devaluations of 12% in 1971, 5% last June and 18% last September. But he overlooks the fact that during this period there were also many appreciations of the rand. Since June 1974 there have in fact been seven appreciations as against six depreciations of the rand against the U.S. dollar. Between October 1972 and January 1974 the effective weighted average exchange rate of the rand against all currencies actually appreciated by about 18%. In June 1975 the rand&#x2019;s effective exchange rate was higher than in the first half of 1972. Since 1970 the depreciation against the dollar has in fact been 17&#x00BD;% which is exactly half the figure mentioned by the hon. member. As a matter of interest, the German mark depreciated by no less than 15% against the dollar between February and September of last year, that is, in a period of seven months. The hon. member also mentioned a figure of R2 000 million as the deficit on the current account of our balance of payments for 1975. The actual figure is likely to be under R1 800 million, and possibly lower. I am also glad to say that the current deficit, seasonally corrected, showed a significant decline during the fourth quarter of 1975; at an annual rate, it fell from about R1 900 million in the second and third quarters to something like R1 700 million in the fourth quarter, and this despite the decline in the dollar price of gold after August.</p>

<p>Some confusion seems to arise from the injudicious use of the monthly figures of imports and exports published by the Department of Customs and Excise. These figures require adjustment for a number of factors, and it is therefore dangerous to draw from them any conclusions regarding the course of our balance of payments. I think we also have reason to be satisfied with the performance of the capital account of the balance of payments. Total net capital inflow in 1975 amounted to about R1 900 million according to preliminary estimates. This included more than R500 million in long-term private capital during the first three quarters alone. The trend is encouraging, and I think we can look forward to a substantial improvement in our balance of payments during 1976. Much will depend on the speed of economic recovery in our export markets and on the gold price, but there is every reason to expect that our current deficit will be considerably lower than the 1975 figure, and will be covered by the inflow of capital.</p>

<p>I should like to say a word here about foreign loans. In my budget speech last March I referred to the allegation sometimes made that South Africa was borrowing abroad excessively, and one still hears this point being made from time to time. It is true that the State enterprises, corporations, and to a lesser extent the Government, have raised substantial loans overseas. But I do not think they have been excessive in relation to our balance of payments and our economic strength. Only last week one of the State corporations raised a loan of no less than $200 million overseas, which surely shows that our credit standing remains of the first order. It is relevant to note that, as a percentage of our total receipts on the current account of our balance of payment, i.e. our visible and invisible export items, total payments abroad in respect of interest, dividends and branch profits have actually declined, from 10,5% in 1965 and 13,1% in 1970 to an estimated 9,7% in 1975. Interest payments have indeed increased over this period, but this increase is more than counterbalanced by a decrease in the percentage attributable to dividends and branch profits. Our foreign borrowing is therefore well within the limits of prudence.</p>

<p>I hope that the new arrangements for the transferability of the new securities rand, which came into force at the beginning of this month, will make South Africa an even more attractive field for the foreign investor. I understand that the new arrangements have started well and that the Stock Exchange is doing good business in this field.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I should like to refer briefly to our state of inflation. My colleague, the <span class="col_819-820" refersTo="page_0426"/>Minister of Economic Affairs, dealt with several aspects of this matter in the No-confidence Debate, but there are a number of aspects to which I too should like to refer.</p>

<p>In the first place, I am glad to say that our rate of inflation has already come down considerably. If one takes the increase at an annual rate of the seasonally adjusted consumer price index from one quarter to the next, our inflation rate dropped from 18,2% in the third quarter of 1974 to 10,4% in the fourth quarter of 1975&#x2014;a remarkable decline. However, we are not satisfied yet and consequently we shall continue our attempts to bring the rate down even further.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the effect of devaluation on our inflation rate is often exaggerated. The office of the economic adviser to the Prime Minister calculated that the direct effect of devaluation on the prices of all consumer goods would be approximately 1,4% and that it would be 2,9% and 2,0% on capital goods and supplies respectively.</p>

<p>However, the effects of devaluation, as well as of other recent price increases such as that of petrol, may not have made themselves fully felt as yet, so it is possible that there may be a slight increase in the inflation rate during the next month or two. If we co-operate and if the collective anti-inflation campaign is continued, as I hope it will be, the downward trend should, however, be resumed before long.</p>

<p>The Government has given certain undertakings in the light of the collective anti-inflation campaign, and I should like to report to the House on how we are implementing several financial undertakings. I shall confine myself to the financial undertakings.</p>

<p>The most important undertakings in my field concern the curtailing of Government expenditure and its financing in a non-inflationary manner as far as possible. In this regard I should like to begin by pointing out a few statistical shares which have caused more than one financial commentator to trip up badly in the past few months.</p>

<p>The first one is the exaggerated importance which was attached to the exceptionally high issue from the Treasury account during the first few months of the present financial year. These figures gave rise to all kinds of sensational deductions, for example that Government expenditure would be much higher during this financial year than the amount which the Appropriation Act provided for. Mr. Speaker, we still have financial discipline in this country, and no department may spend a cent without the authorization of Parliament. Of course I shall shortly introduce an Additional Appropriation Bill, as is customary, but I can give the House the assurance even at this stage that the additional expenditure over the amount which was originally budgeted for will not be excessive. It is dangerous, therefore, to project the Treasury issues for a few months over the whole financial year.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a great deal of misunderstanding about the use of the word &#x201C;deficit&#x201D; (tekort) in regard to the budget. Traditionally we have used the word to indicate a deficit on Revenue Account, i.e. in broad outline a surplus of current expenditure over current revenue. In the financial and economic analyses, however, &#x201C;deficit&#x201D; is mostly used in the sense of &#x2018;&#x2018;deficit, excepting loans&#x201D;, i.e. the total revenue of the Treasury, except for loans, is deducted from the total expenditure on Revenue as well as on Loan Account. The quarterly magazine of the Reserve Bank uses the word in this sense. In my budget speech last March I gave this &#x201C;deficit&#x201D; as being R1 125 million. The final figure will be somewhat higher. But we have no particular problem in covering the deficit, as some commentators seem to fear. It is simply the amount we are going to cover from loans, and we shall obtain the necessary loans, as I shall indicate later.</p>

<p>The third statistical snare I want to warn against is the misinterpretation which is sometimes given to the concept of &#x201C;net claims of the banking sector against the Government sector&#x201D;, as it appears in the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s financial analyses in its quarterly magazine. Some commentators interpret any increase in these claims as being automatically inflationary. However, this is not so. In the first place, an increase in these claims may arise from bank credit to the National Supplies Procurement Fund, which is used mainly for storing strategic imported goods. This money leaves the Republic and consequently has no direct influence on our monetary supply, although such build-up of strategic supplies costs us foreign exchange, of course.</p>

<p>Even if the Government sector&#x2014;which includes bodies from outside the central Government&#x2014;were to spend the money within the country, one cannot accept that the effect <span class="col_821-822" refersTo="page_0427"/>would necessarily and immediately be inflationary. There are many factors which may influence it. During a period of slump, such as the present one, the banks may not use the additional liquid assets they receive from the Government sector as the basis for further credit expansion. Even if they were to use it in this manner, it would not necessarily be inflationary while there is still unused capacity&#x2014;labour and capital. The bank credit need not even take the form of the purchasing of liquid assets by the banks. The recent four-year securities offered in December are an example of this, although the securities will become liquid assets in a year&#x2019;s time. The stipulations in respect of additional liquid assets required may also limit any subsequent credit expansion. For these and many other reasons one should be very careful in interpreting the implications of any increase in bank credit to the Government sector.</p>

<p>I hope the House will forgive me for this short lecture on economic statistics, but the misconceptions to which I have referred may give rise to serious misunderstanding and false conclusions.</p>

<p>I now want to return to the collective anti-inflation campaign and to the Government&#x2019;s undertakings in respect of the curtailing of Government expenditure and its non-inflationary financing.</p>

<p>The House will not expect me to anticipate the additional and main appropriations by furnishing particulars of State expenditure at this stage. However, I want to assure the House that expenditure has been curtailed drastically and substantially. For the present financial year, additional funds have been allowed only in cases of urgent necessity, and for 1976-&#x2019;77, reductions amounting to more than R800 million in all were effected in the amounts requested by the various departments. It is not easy to retrench on this scale, and I want to express my thanks to my colleagues, as well as to our Administrators, for their co-operation in this difficult task.</p>

<p>As far as the financing is concerned, our revenue has been adversely affected by the drop in the gold price, of course, so that the deficit&#x2014;excepting loans&#x2014;will be slightly larger than the amount we budgeted for. We have taken energetic steps to cover the deficit. In September last year we offered Government loans at favourable rates, which produced a net amount, after repayment of the loans which had expired, of approximately R300 million. These loans, the medium and long-term loans, were made available to the public again in October because there was a renewed demand for them, and in that way we collected a further R43 million. We withdrew the approval which had previously been granted to building societies to invest in negotiable deposit certificates and appealed to these societies to invest the money thus made available in the Government sector. I further appealed to insurance companies and pension funds to invest an additional 2% of their assets or liabilities&#x2014;as the case might be&#x2014;in Government securities before the end of 1976, as a temporary measure. In December we made available a special issue of four-year securities&#x2014;intended chiefly for banks&#x2014;and this produced R90 million.</p>

<p>Our latest step was to issue two Government loans&#x2014;a long-term and a short-term loan&#x2014;on attractive terms at the end of January. I am glad to inform the House that these issues were a huge success. Total subscriptions&#x2014;excepting the Public Debt Commissioners&#x2014;for the three-year loan at 7&#x215E;% amounted to R376 million and those for the sixteen-year loan at 10% amounted to R117 million. After deduction of the amount repaid on those loans which expired on 1 January and 1 February, the net amount received by the State was R285 million.</p>

<p>By means of these measures we shall balance our Government accounts for the current financial year. What is equally important, we shall also draw a substantial amount of our loan money from the non-banking sector.</p>

<p>The Government gave various other financial undertakings with a view to the collective campaign, and all these undertakings are being implemented. Some are technical and detailed, and I need not deal with all of them here. However, I wish to refer specifically to three.</p>

<p>The first is that the Government undertook to ensure that the monetary supply did not increase excessively in relation to the real or expected increase in the gross domestic product, and to apply the relevant interest rate mechanism effectively. The authorities are ever mindful of this undertaking. Even before the beginning of the collective campaign, the Reserve Bank increased its bank rate in August 1975 and increased the minimum requirements in respect of liquid assets of <span class="col_823-824" refersTo="page_0428"/>banks. The latter were increased again in September. Of course, the various measures for financing the Treasury which I have already mentioned will also help to limit the increase in the monetary supply. These measures have been successful and the seasonally adjusted annual rate of increase in money and quasi-money over the period January to November 1975 was 15%, compared to 23% in each of the years 1973 and 1974.</p>

<p>The second undertaking concerns the introduction of building norms for public buildings. Last year a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Webb of the National Building Research Institute submitted a report of great value for the Treasury and for the country as a whole. Consequently I decided towards the end of last year to appoint a further committee to apply the recommended norms in respect of hospitals and to determine and apply norms for various other public buildings.</p>

<p>Attention is being given in the first place to norms for university buildings and other buildings for higher education. The chairman of the committee is Mr. A. J. Pretorius, Secretary to the Treasury. I am sure that in this way we shall save the State many millions of rands.</p>

<p>The third aspect of Government action against inflation to which I wish to refer is control over the finances of local authorities. I felt&#x2014;in consequence, amongst other things, of representations made to me by the Administrators&#x2014;that the time had come for the whole question of municipal finances to be thoroughly reviewed. Consequently I appointed an interdepartmental committee last year, with the Secretary for Finance as chairman, to investigate the whole set-up of municipal finances, expenditure as well as revenue. The committee has just begun its activities.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, South Africa is faced with difficult problems in financial as well as other fields, but we have great reason to be thankful. Unlike so many other countries, we have a positive growth rate, while unemployment is no serious problem to us. Our balance of payments has improved, our inflation rate has dropped, and we are able to balance our budget. Our standing in international finance remains high. The rand is one of only 16 currencies which is used in determining the value of the IMF&#x2019;s Special Drawing Right. In the increase in IMF quotas decided upon in Jamaica, South Africa, by virtue of its economic power, receives a considerably higher percentage increase than many other countries, including countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Problems we do have, but I do not doubt for a moment that in the financial field we can face the future with confidence.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House welcome the fact that on this occasion the hon. the Minister of Finance has given rather more details and has also provided a more extensive historical survey of certain aspects of the economy than has been normal in the past in Second Reading speeches on the Part Appropriation Bill. This is something that we welcome.</p>

<p>What the hon. the Minister was doing, was to reply to a large extent to certain of the matters that we raised in this House during the no-confidence debate, in particular the burning questions of inflation and devaluation. This is not the last that we shall hear of those two subjects. We welcome the confidence which the hon. the Minister expressed in regard to the future of gold. To me it seems rather contradictory, however, to hear those words of confidence, which are words that we on this side of the House share when the rand had to be devalued recently in order to raise the rand price of gold.</p>

<p>Although we had discussions on economic matters in the no-confidence debate, this is the first occasion this session when this House is able to get to grips with the economic situation as a whole. We therefore hope that when the hon. the Minister replies to this debate, he will give this House further details of how the Government proposes to deal with the challenging and difficult economic situation which is facing the country. We on this side of the House appreciate the fact that the economic position is difficult&#x2014;in fact, I would describe it as seriously difficult&#x2014;and for that reason the attitude that we shall take in this debate will be one of while criticizing the Government for the mistakes they have made&#x2014;serious mistakes&#x2014;we shall also indicate the way we consider should be followed in order to deal with the position which is confronting the country at present.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at this state of the Bill there is no purpose in repeating the arguments discussed during the Committee Stage and the Second Reading. There are, however, two major changes which were brought about in this measure during the Committee Stage, and it is important that the significance of these two changes should be made very clear. There has been a great deal of misrepresentation outside South Africa and even inside South Africa in the Press as to the meaning of these two changes. I want to deal firstly with the removal of the territorial restriction on the service of troops. This has been presented in some newspapers and outside the country as meaning that we now intend to fight anywhere in the world and that this discloses our aggressive intentions. It has furthermore been suggested that Parliament is now authorizing our military forces to embark on hostile adventures wherever they like. This is of course not true and is, in some cases, I regret to say even in South Africa, a deliberate misrepresentation of what the amendment provides. The amendment provides that our troops may serve outside the borders of South Africa where South Africa is threatened. In the case of both the fighting of an armed conflict and the suppression of terrorism, there must be a threat against South Africa. Therefore, to present this as though it were a blank cheque to embark on wild adventures anywhere in the world, is totally incorrect. Secondly, we have removed the possibility of misrepresentation which could have existed had we retained the original definition as it first appeared in the Bill describing South Africa as south of the equator. Then we would have pinpointed a zone of the world which could have been misrepresented as being a target. What we have done instead was to bring our Defence Act into line with the legislation of any other country in the world. No other country that I know of has a territorial limitation and we have done exactly the same now. What this amendment therefore has done, was to bring us into line with other countries. I make this point particularly because of what has been written and said and because it was originally my proposal at the Second Reading which has led to the agreement we have reached.</p>

<p>Then there is a second fundamental change which was made during the Committee Stage, namely the incorporation of the provision that if our forces serve beyond our borders for more than one month, the provisions of section 91 of the Act will apply and this will be reported to Parliament within 30 days. This, I believe, was an important amendment which showed the responsibility with which we approach these matters in this House, because it has retained the spirit of the original Act which was that at a time of mobilization, that is in time of war, Parliament would be informed. We have retained that spirit and have incorporated it into the new circumstances which have arisen. This recognition of Parliament&#x2019;s place in South Africa as the mouthpiece and the representative of the people who are entitled to be informed, is important. We are satisfied, Mr. Speaker, that these two amendments carry the general support of South Africa, inside and outside this House, even in editorial opinion. It is interesting to note that a newspaper which has written some very different tilings in the past states in its leading article today&#x2014;I refer to <i>The Cape Times</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Defence Amendment Bill, extending the power to conscript for service anywhere in the world, is drawing heavy flak from abroad, but at least it does not specify, in such contentious fashion as the Bill did originally, the area of Africa south of the equator, and Parliament has to hear of any expeditions within two months.</block>

<p>It is very pleasing when we hear that people who were taking a very different line, now start to recognize the correctness of what Parliament has done. In referring to the matter of Parliament being informed, Mr. Speaker, there have been some very disturbing reports in the Press recently. You will not permit me to deal with them in detail, but if you will permit me, I shall refer to two of them. The first is the campaign in the United States to try <span class="col_827-828" refersTo="page_0430"/>to get America to recognize the MPLA and to pressurize America into an agreement with this movement and to co-operate in Cabinda. Another report stated that a South African firm, a firm controlled in South Africa, is in fact co-operating with and paying money to the MPLA in Angola. I do not know whether this is true but this refers to a well-known South African company with diamond interests in Angola. It is reported that that firm is paying royalties, not to a legal Government, but to the MPLA. Then there are also disturbing military reports. We on this side of the House believe that Parliament is entitled to know much more than it knows at present. I hope the hon. the Minister will at the earliest opportunity give Parliament the fullest possible picture of what is happening. In regard to the question of a firm paying royalties to the MPLA, perhaps there are other members in this House who are better qualified to tell us whether this is in fact true. I hope that we perhaps will hear a denial. As America has denied that it has paid oil royalties in respect of Cabinda, so I hope that those who are better qualified than I or the Government to speak about the payment of diamond royalties, will either tell this House that it is untrue, or if it is true, will tell the House why.</p>

<p>I hope, generally, that we will have an opportunity for a fuller debate than this Third Reading makes possible. I hope the Minister will take that first opportunity. With those remarks, Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support the Third Reading of this Bill which we believe is in the interests and to the betterment of South Africa&#x2019;s defence.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one is of course very grateful to take note of the responsible spirit in which the official Opposition acted in connection with this legislation. One is very grateful for the support which we received from them in a matter of such importance to the security of South Africa. One can only express the hope that if, later in the session, more legislation is introduced which is intimately bound up with the security of South Africa, they will support it with the same degree of dedication and enthusiasm as that with which they supported this legislation.</p>

<p>I share the concern of the hon. member for Durban Point about the matter to which he referred, namely the alleged contribution of certain firms to the funds of the MPLA. Like him, I am aware of the fact that there are members present in this House who maintain close ties with those firms. I trust that the hon. members concerned will make use of the opportunity to inform us and will not further arouse our suspicions</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this legislation represents a very important milestone in the military history of the Republic of South Africa because we are now removing any border restriction from the Defence Act. The hon. member for Durban Point referred to two misunderstandings or misrepresentations in connection with this legislation, but to my mind there is also a third which we must bear in mind. It has been suggested that under this legislation, no voluntary services would be allowed in the future, because this legislation makes the discharge of duties in any place in the world compulsory. I think it would be taking an erroneous view of military strategy to make this misrepresentation because the voluntary element is a very important element in any military operation and one which most certainly cannot merely be thrown overboard. I believe that the military advisers and leaders are fully aware of this principle and that they will not abuse the principle which has been introduced, namely that duties may be discharged at any place in the world. The whole issue of the removal of borders from the Defence Act is of course laden with emotion. Many emotional arguments have been advanced as to exactly why it is wrong. It has been an emotion-laden subject throughout our political history. One calls to mind what the attitude of this side of the House was in 1939. At that time this side of the House felt that troops from South Africa should not be employed beyond our borders. However, circumstances have changed drastically since that attitude was adopted. During the past decade or so the whole structure of attack and warfare has changed throughout the world and it has become necessary for us to streamline our Defence Act in such a way as to adapt it to these circumstances. For example, in the past decade or two we have entered the age of terrorism. There has been vast development on the technological level, especially with regard to certain armaments. We were faced with the <span class="col_829-830" refersTo="page_0431"/>decolonization of Africa. This had a very strong influence on our security. New states came into being on our borders almost overnight, states which are very poorly equipped militarily and which do not have the means to make themselves militarily prepared. As has now occurred in Angola, the task which will undoubtedly fall to our lot in the future will be to hasten to the aid of those people when they need it. The rapid unfolding of the Russian policy of world domination has been a particularly important factor making it necessary for us to overhaul our defence legislation, a threat which has now indeed become reality to us. Under such circumstances one simply cannot afford to restrict one&#x2019;s military advisers and strategists by means of border provisions. Where troops are employed, what they must do and how they must do it must in the first instance be left in the hands of one&#x2019;s military leaders. The malicious people who try to suck venom from these developments and who infer from this that we have aggressive aims, would do well to bear in mind that it is totally in conflict with the predisposition of this nation to be expansionistic or aggressive. In years past, there have been opportunities when we could have used our military preponderance if we had had aggressive or imperialist aims, but we did not make use of those opportunities and there is no reason to assume that South Africa will abuse this legislation in order to give vent to any expansionist or imperialistic urge.</p>

<p>This legislation is the finest testimonial we could have given our Defence Force, in view of their activities over the past six months. Our Defence Force, its officers, its leaders and its advisers have acted responsibly and shown that under the given circumstances they are able to utilize responsibly these powers which they have been granted. The old Defence Act had indeed authorized our military leaders to cross our borders. We have not introduced this amendment in order to quell doubts in our own minds, but only to quell doubts in the minds of the public. Hon. members will remember that there were those who stated that the powers granted by the Defence Act, had probably been exceeded. In our own minds we were certain that these powers had not been exceeded, but this amendment was incorporated in our legislation to remove all doubt. By means of this amendment we express our confidence in our Defence Force and in their powers of judgment to defend the Republic of South Africa with arms. I say this because the Act now provides, by implication, that it will be our military leaders, in the first place, who will be responsible for determining when, where and how South African troops will be employed. The Parliament of the Republic of South Africa has given them this power and we have the fullest trust that it will be applied with great responsibility and circumspection. By means of this legislation we are expressing our confidence in the Defence Force.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, both the previous speakers mentioned that this Bill could intentionally be interpreted incorrectly by ill-disposed people outside South Africa, and that this has in fact already happened. They pointed out that this very weekend it was reported that a man like Nyerere had already made certain remarks in this connection, to the effect that South Africa supposedly viewed the states in its immediate vicinity as colonies. We warned against this very thing. During the Second Reading, and during the Committee Stage, too, we consistently warned against this because we believe that in spite of the good intentions mentioned by the hon. member, it should be clearly stated in the legislation that the measures adopted are related to the good intentions one supposedly has. There is no point in pretending that we on these benches are questioning the responsibility, the acumen, the dedication of the Defence Force as such in any way. We have said this so consistently, that we have a Defence Force of which we can be proud. When one has said that, it does not mean that one can merely give politicians a blank cheque to take decisions and act as they wish, nor that politicians can hide behind the responsible behaviour of the Defence Force when they, the politicians, have to answer for political decisions which concerned the Defence Force. We feel very strongly about that.</p>

<p>We have mentioned various reasons why we believed it essential and desirable that this Bill should first be referred to a Select Committee before the Second Reading. The one point we made, was that different and competing principles are embodied in this legislation, and that these principles are important for the safety and the security of South Africa. For example, there is the principle of service in the defence of the Republic and also the principle <span class="col_831-832" refersTo="page_0432"/>of non-intervention in another country&#x2019;s internal affairs. These are two cardinal principles, Mr. Speaker, which are intimately bound up with the safety and the preparedness of South Africa. We were of the opinion, and we still are of the opinion, that this Bill does not make these two principles entirely clear. Under the circumstances which prevail in a Select Committee one would be able to consider more clearly, under more peaceful circumstances, how one would be able to implement both these principles, and at the same time we should be able to succeed in ensuring the preparedness and the streamlining of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>The second reason is that this Bill includes good as well as controversial proposals and that one would be able to determine in a Select Committee whether there was sense in some of the proposals and whether problems would arise in connection with other proposals. We have said that we have no objection against or any difficulties with the Moratorium Act which is being extended. There is also the question of compensation, the principle of a compensation court on the basis of which people in the Defence Force may be granted indemnity, etc. These are matters concerning which we have not experienced difficulties, but about which we felt that there were certain aspects which could have been discussed more thoroughly and meaningfully in the atmosphere of a Select Committee.</p>

<p>The third reason why we felt such a Select Committee was essential, was that we thought it would have been possible for us to have set the debate on defence, on this Bill, apart from the passion and pettiness of party politics which one sometimes comes across in the House.</p>

<p>After all, it is clear from the commentary we have had from that side of the House, as well as from the official Opposition, that that commentary was uninformed commentary. It was simply in terms of their own prejudices. They tried to make propaganda and they are still trying. In fact, if one looks at certain utterances made over the weekend, they are still trying to make a little party-political propaganda about defence matters in South Africa. This is what happened. We wanted to prevent this intentionally by saying that we should discuss defence matters in a Select Committee with a cool head because defence concerns us all. If things go wrong with defence, then we all know it is not asked who is Progref, who is UP and who is NP; then we must all stand together. It is solely for this reason that we asked that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee. However, this was rejected, and now we have an amended Bill before us, before it goes to the Other Place. There are certain amendments which we can support&#x2014;and we welcome them&#x2014;but there are others which we cannot support. We cannot understand them and we feel they are still not going to assist us in our problems in the light of certain important principles which are intimately bound up with the security and the defence of the Republic. We gladly accept the amendments which were effected regarding indemnity and compensation when dealing with the combating of terrorism. I should like to remind the hon. the Minister that he promised to look at some of the other amendments which came from these benches concerning the overall functioning of the compensation board. I am convinced that should the hon. the Minister look at those amendments, he would see that their basic motivation is solely concerned with making the Compensation Board function more effectively. Another amendment which we welcome and accept, is the one which the hon. member for Durban Point has already referred to. This concerns the fact that the Government should report when it acts in terms of section 95, 90 and 91. A report should then be presented to Parliament within 30 days. I nevertheless find this a little confusing. If one looks at clause 11 of the Bill, one notes that it is retrospective to 9 August of last year. If one then reads this in conjunction with clause 6 one realizes that in effect it means that had there been an involvement to such an extent in, say, Angola during the past six months that the retrospective provision could also be made <span class="col_833-834" refersTo="page_0433"/>applicable to it to such an extent that the Government should have to account for it to Parliament, the question arises as to why, then, they did not do this. Then, too, I find it even more surprising that when the PRP requested last year, before Christmas, that the Government should report in regard to the matters in Angola, the official Opposition said that it was absolutely unnecessary, that Parliament need not be convened. [Interjections.] Now, however, it is said with great ostentation that they are satisfied that this amendment be accepted so that there can be a report made to Parliament. Two to three months ago, however, they said that this was completely unnecessary. [Interjections.] What is stranger still, is the fact that the hon. the Minister himself accepts the amendment and says it is a good thing. However, it has also been said that it was not essential to convene Parliament after 9 August. In terms of the amendment this means that Parliament should in fact have been convened on 9 September 1975, if I am not mistaken. No explanation was given in this regard, but the official Opposition now states that what we asked for in these benches, was the best thing and that it should have happened.</p>

<p>A third amendment which is relevant, is the issue of compulsory military service during mobilization, as well as any territorial limitations in this regard. Both the official Opposition and the Government believe there should be no limitations in this regard, not even the limitations which existed before and which were rather ambiguous. I am referring to the limitations which appear in the Defence Act of 1957. We in these benches believed and argued on the basis that there should be compulsory military service under certain circumstances and that such circumstances should be clearly defined. This, in essence, was the spirit which motivated the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville. He tried to introduce the idea into the Defence Act that compulsory military service is essential, but should be defined clearly on a territorial basis. The hon. member for Durban Point said it was not necessary, because it was no longer done by any country in the world. Which countries did he have in mind? Perhaps he will say it was America, Britain or a Western European country. We should however bear in mind that we here at the southern point of Africa are experiencing extraordinary circumstances. In fact, we are the last, the only country of which it can be said with absolute conviction that the Whites who live here have no other home whatsoever to go to. We find ourselves in a situation where this is the case. At the same time we are in a situation in which radical changes are taking place near our borders.</p>

<p>The difference between us and the Government as well as the official Opposition as regards voluntary or compulsory military service, is bound up with deeper-seated differences on our side with regard to a policy for the defence of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says we mounted our high horse about the no-confidence motion. However that has nothing whatsoever to do with this debate we are now engaged in. What is invalid here is the security of South Africa and the ability of South Africa to defend itself in the most effective manner under the difficult circumstances we are experiencing. I want to illustrate this to him. The first point I want to mention, is that we on these benches believe that everything should be done to increase the preparedness of the Republic, and here the emphasis is on defence. That is why we proposed that for military purposes South Africa be clearly defined, and that compulsory military service within that area was essential for the combating of terrorism and for warfare. This was the basic policy standpoint in terms of which we opposed this Bill.</p>

<p>In the second place we believe that our policy should be formulated in such a way that it should be quite evident, from word and deed, that we have no aggressive interventionistic aims. As far as our international position is concerned, as well as our position in Africa, it is vital that no lack of clarity should develop as regards the military policy of the Republic in respect of the question of interference in the internal affairs of other <span class="col_835-836" refersTo="page_0434"/>countries. I am not saying this lightly, because if we look at the position in the international sphere, then it is clear to me that, in the balance of power between the USA and Russia, which the hon. member for Bloemfontein West referred to in the no-confidence debate, South Africa is a negotiable commodity&#x2014;to both sides. South Africa is a negotiable commodity in the balance of power between the USA and Russia. And either of the two, if it suited them, would snatch at anything in terms of which they would be able to improve their position on the continent of Africa. I have no doubt about that. If it was in the interests of either of the two great powers, either Russia or the USA, and they were convinced that they could extend their sphere of influence in Africa, and South Africa was an obstacle to them in this regard&#x2014;be it as a result of its internal policy, or be it as a result of its military policy&#x2014;then they would use it to obtain a foothold. This we must accept as a political fact.</p>

<p>As regards Africa, too, it is clear that Africa has become a new field in the struggle for the balance of power between the USA and Russia. We had evidence of this over the weekend in the Press, in which reference was made to the fact that the USA was being pressurized by its Congress to start negotiating with the MPLA to see whether they could not obtain a better foothold in the Angolan debate by doing so. We have also had examples of this from the President of Tanzania who said in Quelimane that different groups and countries in Southern Africa should unite to take military action against South Africa.</p>

<p>That is one of the most irresponsible things that hon. member has ever said in this House. The simple reason is that we made this point consistently, since the Second Reading debate, and now that this point is being proved to be true and the hon. member is realizing he has made a mistake, he says we put the words in his mouth. It is this kind of prejudice and mockery which is in no way in the interests of South Africa when we have to discuss defence matters.</p>

<p>The simple fact is that we have an extremely fluid situation in Africa. The man who is one&#x2019;s ally today, is one&#x2019;s enemy tomorrow, and <i>vice versa.</i> If one does not spell out clearly by means of treaties and negotiations what one&#x2019;s military relationships are with other African states, one is going to find oneself in trouble. It is as clear as daylight. This is precisely what is going to happen in many of the African states situated in our immediate vicinity. Which of us can say with certainty what the position will be in Rhodesia, Zambia, Mozambique or Tanzania in six or seven months time? If one does not state clearly in one&#x2019;s military legislation that one will only become involved in those areas if there is a clear treaty or agreement, any one of the clashing factions in that society can advance such arguments as, for example that it is stated in the Bill that South Africa has aggressive intentions. Whether this is the case or not, the question is whether it can be read like that. They could use this as an excuse to obtain and to mobilize the support of large powers and to make Africa even more of a battlefield in the struggle between the great powers.</p>

<p>I shall give the hon. member a chance presently. This is also related to a further point we should like to make here, namely that if South Africa has done everything to make itself defensible and has clearly stated what its military responsibilities are&#x2014;as we believe it should do here at the southern point of Africa&#x2014;then we believe that there is no African state which, in the absence of intervention from outside, represent a real threat to us. We want to add to this, however, that if the great powers were to decide that they wished to enter Africa in force and if we had no allies, we should not be able to compete militarily with the great powers. This is the simple truth; it is a political fact that we cannot compete with the USA or with Russia in the military sphere. We should realize and state this very clearly. Allow me to mention an example. We are at present engaged protecting the irrigation schemes at Ruacana and Calueque, due to circumstances and because we consider it to be vital, so that <span class="col_837-838" refersTo="page_0435"/>the schemes can be completed and become useful to Owamboland and South Africa.</p>

The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs admitted this by implication during the weekend when he said we should try to persuade the UNO to assist in defending those areas. The point is that we should defend those areas as long as is practically possible. If, however, those areas are attacked by a major power and we have no support from anyone, then it is a cold, hard fact that we shall not be able to defend those areas if we have to compete in the military field. Politically and diplomatically we shall have to use all our contacts and exercise pressure to see to it that it is preserved. However, on military grounds we cannot do this. [Interjections.]</p>

There it is stated clearly that such an impression was created. [Interjections.] I am replying to a question by the hon. the Minister. It is our policy that we believe that South Africa should be prepared and secure and that it should not create an impression of interventionism and of an urge for expansion and that we should do everything in our power to increase our ability to defend ourselves in this regard. This is one of the fundamental reasons&#x2014;these arguments which I mentioned now&#x2014;why we cannot support this Third Reading, because this Bill does not face up to these problems satisfactorily at the Third Reading. There is another reason&#x2014;which has been referred to on a number of occasions&#x2014;and this is clause 11, specifically in so far as it relates to clause 6, the retrospective clause which makes the position retrospective to 9 August 1975. One of our objections throughout, since the Second Reading, has been that this legislation was also, <i>inter alia,</i> an effort to condone the behaviour of the Government, not that of the Defence Force, in Angola. We are quite prepared to do this if we can judge in the light of the available facts and of what really happened there. Then we shall be prepared to do that. In fact, we are even prepared to go so far as to say that we can forgive mistakes if mistakes were made. But we are not prepared to say without further ado, when we are insulted when we ask for information, and when we make reasonable requests and they are rejected, that we condone everything the Government has done, because the simple fact is that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself said at the end of the no-confidence debate that the answers to the questions which were asked still fail to satisfy; questions still exist. It seems to me that there is a considerable lack of clarity in that party as to precisely how much satisfaction there is, because the hon. member for Newton Park came forward over the weekend and said that as a result of the United Party&#x2019;s behaviour, there is now practically unanimous support for what has been done in Angola up to now, except for the Progressive Reform Party, which is apparently hoping for a communist victory. [Interjections.] This is absolutely slanderous because we have stated repeatedly that if we do not take care, the behaviour of South Africa and the <span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0436"/>behaviour of politicians, might in fact contribute towards increasing and intensifying the communist danger in Angola, and this is one of the central questions concerning our involvement in Angola which has not yet been replied to. Are we in a better position now in terms of the threat of Russian imperialism or not? In my humble opinion the answer is: &#x201C;No.&#x201D; But the hon. member for Newton Park says here that in fact we wanted it this way, but this is exactly what we fought against. The other point he made was that he condoned everything. He condones everything the Government has done. He condones it 100%. But this is not what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in the No-confidence Debate. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I have the quotation here, from this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times.</i> We are still going to tackle each other on this matter. Here the hon. member states (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Owing to the United Party&#x2019;s behaviour there is practically unanimous support for what has been done in Angola up to now.</block>

<p>Except for us, of course. In other words, they agree. They condone this. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout specifically made the point that this could not happen. I quote from Hansard col. 119, where the hon. member for Bezuidenhout states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the first time in years the Government is out of touch with what is going on amongst the people outside. A war is not something which can be waged in secret or behind the backs of a people. It is becoming more and more clear to me that the true reason for the Government&#x2019;s secrecy about events in Angola, is that the Government is unsure of the reaction and of the judgment of the people; because everything points to the fact that the Government has made a miscalculation somewhere.</block>

<p>But the hon. member for Newton Park says: &#x201C;No, everything is in order and the Government did not make a &#x2018;miscalculation&#x2019;.&#x201D; Everything is condoned. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout goes on to say (col. 122)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would be a serious neglect of duty on the part of the Opposition if, with an eye on the future and in view of the Opposition&#x2019;s responsibilities towards the public of South Africa, it were to fail to demand from the Government to give an account of the political decisions which it has taken or which it will have to take in the future.</block>

<p>From the start we have consistently stated that it is not our policy to condone political decisions without satisfactory information, and this was one of the reasons why we opposed this Bill. The official Opposition has now admitted that they condone all the actions which have taken place since this Bill was introduced. I now want to repeat very clearly that we on these benches believe that a South Africa which is capable of defending itself, is essential, for self-evident, simple and obvious reasons, and we shall co-operate and assist in spite of any innuendo, attacks and slander directed at us. But we believe, too, that when we discuss these matters precisely because it concerns all of us, we should do so in such a way that there is no possibility of our becoming involved in irrational pettiness or scoring political points off each other, but rather that we do this in a responsible manner. <span class="col_841-842" refersTo="page_0437"/>I want to go on to say that we made suggestions by means of amendments. We explained them reasonably well, but on every occasion we were insulted or our questions were eluded, were not answered. On these grounds, and because we object that this legislation does not comply satisfactorily with the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, and because the whole issue of military service was not, in our opinion, dealt with satisfactorily, we are unable to support this Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. G. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having listened to the hon. member for Rondebosch, I cannot but come to the conclusion that what the Progrefs really want us to do, is to raise the white flag and throw in the towel. A great deal of suspicion was sown during this debate&#x2014;during the Committee Stage and earlier. Doubts have continually been raised about the actions of the Government. I found it amusing when the hon. member for Rondebosch referred to the Whites who think that South Africa is their only home. I just want to ask him whether Jan van Eck, the editor of <i>Deurbraak,</i> thinks so too. Does Jan van Eck, who gave up his South African citizenship when he was called up for military service, also hold the opinion that the Whites have no home other than South Africa? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The Progrefs are actually compelled to take the stand they took during the discussion of this Bill, because they are committed by their previous standpoints and statements. I can imagine that when the news about Angola and South Africa&#x2019;s involvement in Angola became known, some or the majority of the members of that Party rubbed their hands together and thought that this was possibly an opportunity to catch the National Party unawares and to make political capital out of the matter. There is no other conclusion one can come to and, of course, they were fervently supported by certain of their newspapers in this process. All kinds of questions were asked which, for military and diplomatic reasons, would have been imprudent of the National Party Government to answer. All kinds of doubts and reservations were created in the minds of the people concerning South Africa&#x2019;s intervention in Angola. This finally resulted in the blatant statement that the National Party Government had made an error of judgment. However, that party did not allow for public opinion; it did not allow for the fact that there would be general support on the part of the public for the Government&#x2019;s action, support which would exceed the bounds of party affiliation. Therefore that party had to be very careful. On the one hand it had to co-operate with some of its newspaper friends and, on the other hand, it had to keep its options open to make sure it did not close its doors to the general public.</p>

<p>This, then, is the background of their approach to this Bill. They do not really quarrel too much with us about this Bill. There is no great quarrel about this. That is why some of the amendments, and the arguments they advanced in connection with those amendments, are very na&#x00EF;ve. The hon. member for Rondebosch has suggested again that this Bill supposedly implies that South Africa has all kinds of hostile intentions towards other parts of the world. Their own amendment, which suggests military service in adjacent areas will definitely invite unfavourable reaction too. The amendments they moved, were actually &#x201C;yes, but&#x201D; amendments. On the one hand they support the principles contained in this Bill, but on the other hand they object. I therefore believe that their opposition to this Bill is not based upon principle; it is based on playing politics. This is the only reason why, on the one hand, they object to the principle of the Bill while, on the other hand, they are keeping the door open so that it cannot be said that they voted with the National Party Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch mentioned condonation a moment ago. In this respect he once again failed to come forward with something positive to indicate what was preventing him from spelling out his actual objections. Since the no-confidence debate we have had much egg-dancing on the part of the Progressive Reform Party. Let us ask them a few questions. The hon. member for Rondebosch and his colleagues asked a great many questions. The amendment moved by the hon. the Prime Minister, especially points out Russian and Cuban intervention and the armed conflict forced upon unwilling citizens. This is the purport of one portion of the amendment. The hon. members of the Progressive Reform Party did not vote in favour of it. We still want to know why they did not. The hon. members for Rondebosch and for Yeoville said it was because they were annoyed at the time. This is <span class="col_843-844" refersTo="page_0438"/>the only conclusion which can be drawn. During the discussion of the Angolan affair in the debate on this Bill, not one of the members of that party explained their attitude concerning Russian and Cuban presence in Angola. Now and again they approved of certain steps taken by the South African Defence Force. Now I want to ask them a question: What are they afraid of condoning, and to which actions in respect of our presence in Angola, which has been explained by the hon. the Minister of Defence, the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the hon. the Prime Minister are they opposed? Are they opposed to the fact that we took action against terrorists and pursued them? Do they perhaps have any doubts because the South African Defence Force could have pursued the terrorists too far? The problem with these hon. members is that they make statements which hang in mid-air. Every time they say that they are satisfied with the action taken by the South African Defence Force, but at the same time they ask the question: What happened that we do not know of? Do they really have confidence in the actions of the South African Defence Force, or have they not? What is their present attitude to the posting of our Defence Force on our borders? They always want to keep the door open by not adopting an attitude on this matter so that they will be able to discuss it again at a later stage. They want to keep their options open. During the Committee Stage the hon. member for Rondebosch referred to the fact that &#x201C;our amendment makes it clear that South Africa has no aggressive attentions&#x201D;. However, I want to ask him a question: His amendment boils down to the fact that our forces may be compelled to take action in adjacent areas. Do they believe that this provision will escape criticism? Do they think that this is the solution, that this indicates that South Africa has had no aggressive intentions? All the arguments advanced by the members of the Progressive Reform Party only mean that they want to cause a fuss, that they want to record a general objection which is not based on any facts, but only on petty points. Under the circumstances we cannot but reject this with contempt:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at this the Third Reading stage, the emphasis of this legislation has shifted from the question as to where South African forces can be used to the purpose for which those forces can be used in future&#x2014;in other words, from the territorial limitation to the purpose for which the forces can be used. When we come to consider the question whether we can support the measure or not, I think it is important for us to examine the purpose for which the forces can now be used. The predominant and deciding factor is the purpose for which they can be used. Let us firstly examine the position of South Africa being at war, war declared by this country against another country. Secondly&#x2014;and I am sure this will interest the hon. member for Rondebosch, who waxes so eloquent about the fact that we have no allies&#x2014;we should be able to use our forces for the purpose of supporting our allies in fulfilment of treaty obligations. If we do not have this in the Bill, one wonders how one can seek allies.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member can ask questions later.</p>

<p>There is also a third aspect. The Bill, as it reads now, provides for the suppression of armed conflict outside the Republic which is or may be a threat to the security of the Republic. The fourth aspect is that it contains provisions for the suppression of terrorism as defined in the Bill. This is the effect of the Bill on the law as it stands at present, but the PRP has decided to vote against the Third Reading of the Bill. They want to oppose this measure and the effects it will have on the Defence Act as it now stands.</p>

<p>I say in all sincerity to the hon. member for Rondebosch that I believe for various reasons he has made an unfortunate speech this afternoon. He has attempted to suggest that the passing of this measure will mean that we in South Africa are declaring that we have thrown overboard the policy of nonintervention in the domestic affairs of other countries. That is an unfortunate thing to come from a member of this House at this time, i.e. that that is what the effect of this Bill is, because nothing is further from the truth. This Bill merely means that we can certainly intervene in an armed conflict where it is a threat to the security of South Africa. This is entirely different to what has been suggested as intervention in the domestic affairs of <span class="col_845-846" refersTo="page_0439"/>another country. The second point which the hon. member laboured, and which I can understand, is the desire of his party that this matter should have gone to a Select Committee. One understands that because even their best friends are talking now about the deeper differences within their caucus in regard to this matter. [Interjections.] There are divisions in that party on the matter of defence. It is interesting to note that as we meet this afternoon, neither the hon. member for Yeoville nor the majority of the Reformist members of that party are here. Even their friends have found it necessary to comment on the difficulties which are taking place and which exist to the left of me. There has been a suggestion about the inevitable strains and tensions attendant upon any marriage. Those strains and tensions are apparently disturbing the hon. members next to me. There is also a suggestion that the party must develop its professional sinews. These are comments, not from their enemies, but from one of the friends of that party, who has given many columns of writing to that party on what it should and should not be. The hon. member for Rondebosch made a third point, viz. that there had been a change of attitude on this side of the House in regard to the calling together of Parliament to deal with decisions or actions which had been taken in terms of the Act, and to consider a report to Parliament. When the PRP called for a special session, Parliament was about to convene in any case on 23 January this year. That date was about a month away when they asked for the summoning of Parliament. The Bill now before us provides that hostilities can continue for 60 days before the date on which Parliament gets together; i.e. after 30 days there must be a calling together of Parliament within 30 days. There again one wonders why there has been an attempt to use this point as a reason why there should be opposition to the Bill as it is before us.</p>

<p>What I regard as more serious, are two further comments made by the hon. member for Rondebosch. The first was that our presence in southern Angola at the present moment in the defence of the dam, the irrigation scheme and hydro-electric works is controversial. I hope that he is not suggesting that it is controversial within the ranks of South Africans. I hope that he is not suggesting that there are South Africans who feel that we should not be there. [Interjections.] It would appear that that is what he intends because he said that it is controversial because the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs thought it necessary to suggest that UNO assume a responsibility. I want to say that I believe that was a wise suggestion to be made because we are in fact over the borders of the countries for which we are responsible. I think for the hon. the Minister to make that suggestion is not to admit that this is a controversial matter, but is in keeping, I hope, with the attitude of this country of nonintervention in the affairs of neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>The last of his remarks to which I should like to refer is his emphasis on the necessity of &#x201C;weerbaarheid&#x201D; in so far as we in South Africa are concerned. I mentioned at an earlier stage of the debate that this is basic in the training of our armed forces. I think it is a matter which is given the right and proper attention in our armed forces and I believe also that it is equally important that the people of this country should have a similar attitude of preparedness to meet the challenges which come to us in this country. However, we have the hon. member for Rondebosch virtually saying, as has been suggested by the hon. member for Eshowe, that we must just surrender if there is any attack upon us; that we cannot withstand these attacks. I am too much of a realist not to know that there are certain attacks which we will have considerable difficulty in withstanding, but there is a time when one realizes that to say to our people that what they are facing in the immediate future is the inevitability of defeat, is something which should not be said in this House because it is unnecessary to say things of that nature.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch has indicated from the benches on my left the unfortunate divisions which exist in that party. It is unfortunate that the hon. member for Yeoville is not here this afternoon because I am prepared to accept that he is a man who would realize that the speech of the hon. member for Rondebosch was a most unfortunate speech. As has been said by the hon. member for Durban Point, we shall support the Third Reading without any hesitation.</p>

<p>This Bill brings us in line with other nations of the modem world to meet new concepts of terrorism and warfare in the defence and security of South Africa. As has been pointed out, this does not exclude the use of volunteers; they can still be used, but when a man is now called up for service in the Defence Force he knows that he is liable to serve anywhere in the defence of South Africa. I look upon this as a proud day for South Africa. Enlisted men will now know that they are liable to serve anywhere without geographic or legal limitations. Service so undertaken in the defence of South Africa will mean the prevention or suppression of terrorism or of armed conflict outside the Republic which is or may be a threat to our country. The Bill has made this quite clear and there should be no quibbling about it whatsoever. Furthermore, henceforth the call-up of men can be approached on a scientific and businesslike basis with an eye to manpower distribution and control. This will mean that essential services will be easier to maintain and organize. We know what happened during the last war and what bitterness resulted. Now everybody will know where he stands and where his duty lies. The Progressive Party has made very disparaging remarks about conscripts.</p>

<p>I withdraw them, Sir. I was in the British forces. I joined them as a one-pipper. It so happened that the regiment I joined was a professional regiment, made up largely of professional soldiers and territorials who are the equivalent <span class="col_849-850" refersTo="page_0441"/>of our Citizen Force. Their morale, their discipline and their whole attitude was an eye-opener. While we were in the thick of things, our casualti&#x00E9;s were replaced by conscripts from Birmingham, &#x201C;The Gorbels&#x201D; of Glasgow and other cities. I can say that those men fought with &#x00E9;lan. They had guts. They fought with a ferocity that was hard to equal. I also had the experience of fighting against the Germans, Austrians, Czechs and other people. They were not all volunteers; they were conscripted men. No one in this. House can tell me that the conscripted men, whether those of the Allied Forces or those of the Axis Forces, did not know how to fight All this talk of conscripts being useless is a lot of hog wash. [Interjections.] What is more, I Can testify to the fact that these soldiers, whether they were Allied or Axis soldiers, fought cleanly. There was chivalry among the soldiers. One does not want to talk about these things and one is inclined only to remember the funny parts, but I can assure those members who were not in the thick of things, that when you are in the thick of things and bullets are flying, you will fight because you know it is your life or the other man&#x2019;s life. Therefore I want to ask the hon. members not to decry conscripts. Our present method of national service is not conscription. This is just another way the Progrefs have of pouring scorn on our men.

They have tried all along to show up South Africa in a bad light as if we were the oppressor and the invader. They have tried to link up the folly of this Government, as shown in the No-confidence Debate, with this Defence Amendment Bill which is vital for the security of this country. However, we need not worry: The dogs bark but the caravan moves on.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to convey my sincere thanks to the hon. members who support the Third Reading. I want to thank the hon. members for Durban Point and Green Point in particular for their positive speeches. The hon. member for Green Point, in particular, sounded a very positive note today, on which this House should, in my opinion, congratulate him. He helped to eliminate a few of the wrong impressions which were created in regard to this legislation. What is the position now? In the first place it has always been stated in the present Defence Act, which is now being amended, that the Republic of South Africa may be defended anywhere in South Africa when it is threatened. All the legal advice which was obtained was in agreement that the term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; was a far wider term than &#x201C;the Republic of South Africa and South West Africa&#x201D;. For the express purpose of preventing misconceptions, we have introduced this Bill in which we provide that <span class="col_851-852" refersTo="page_0442"/>&#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; has a specific meaning. We have tried to give &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; a meaning in military language. It was our aim to describe our military theatre, our theatre of interest, from which a threat may arise. Any country thinking in military terms regards a certain theatre as an area, greater than itself, from which it may be threatened. Of course this depends on the size and the strength of a country. America&#x2019;s military theatre is quite probably far greater than ours. However, the fact remains that any country which prepared itself in the military sphere must think in greater terms than its own borders for its protection. I do not think that what I am saying is something new. The hon. member for Durban Point then made the suggestion&#x2014;with which we were in agreement&#x2014;that we should rather omit the term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;, which created confusion in the past, as well the term &#x201C;south of the equator&#x201D;, which could also create confusion, entirely and leave it to the military in cases where they have to advise the State President on a possible threat to the country which is building up somewhere.</p>

<p>It is now stated in section 1 of the Defence Act, in the definitions, &#x201C;service in defence of the Republic&#x201D;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) in time of war; or</li>

<li>(b) in connection with the discharge of the obligations of the Republic arising from any agreement between the Republic and any other state; &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>Therefore the question of an agreement is already contained in the existing Act.</p>

<p>Moreover, the following is stated in section 3 of the Act:</p>

<block name="quote">(2) The South African Defence Force or any portion or member thereof may at all times be employed&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) on service in defence of the Republic;</li>

<li>(b) on service in the prevention or suppression of internal disorder in the Republic;</li>

<li>(c) on service in the preservation of life, health or property or the maintenance of essential services &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>&#x201C;Republic&#x201D; here is more than just the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>In addition it is stated in section 3(3) that a member of the South African Defence Force may, subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be prescribed, be required to serve in any portion of that Force, and any such member serving in any armed service, arm, formation, corps or unit or performing any duty in respect of which a special allowance is prescribed, shall not be entitled to such allowance while serving in any other armed service, arm, formation, corps or unit or performing any other duty. The point I want to bring home is that in section 91 of the Act, as well as in the sections to which I have just referred, we are already imposing an obligation on persons who have to render national service in defence of the Republic of South Africa. The allegations which are being made are emanating not only from hon. members of the Progressive Party, but also from some English-language newspapers in the country, and also from another political party which is not represented here, but which is holding protest meetings in the country that are being attended by very few people. Among the charges which are being made from these quarters are allegations that this Government illegally called up minors to render national military service, or made use of them without consulting their parents in advance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what I am trying to clarify here is that what we have done up to now, according to the legal opinions at our disposal, was in accordance with the provisions of the Act. There was no illegal action. There are certain people who are casting doubt on our actions. Among these are the hon. members of the Progressive Party. Doubt is also being cast on our actions from the ranks of a political party which is not represented here. There are also people from certain newspapers who are casting doubts on what was done. Yet legal opinion states that what we have done so far, was in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>

<p>The Bill then goes further and describes terrorism and terroristic activities in another form. The Bill leaves it wide open, as I have already explained here. However, it also goes further with the provisions in clause 1(a), which read:</p>

<block name="quote">By the substitution, in subsection (1), <span class="col_853-854" refersTo="page_0443"/>paragraph (c) of the definition of &#x201C;service in defence of the Republic&#x201D; of the following paragraph:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;(c) for the prevention or suppression of any armed conflict outside the Republic which, in the opinion of the State President, is or may be a threat to the security of the Republic.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The reference here is not merely to any armed conflict, but to an armed conflict which threatens the security of the Republic. In addition the Bill states in clause 1(b):</p>

<block name="quote">By the insertion in that subsection after the definition of &#x201C;service in the merchant fleet&#x201D; of the following definition:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2018;terrorism&#x2019; means terroristic activities in the Republic or directed against the Republic or any authority in or inhabitants of the Republic.</block>

<p>In other words, the Bill now makes it clearer than ever before. In whichever case action has to be taken, it will only be done when a threat to the Republic or to its interests exists. And that is why I am pleased that the hon. members for Durban Point and Green Point made it clear that this misuse, this absolutely flagrant and dishonest representation of what we were achieving here, was not only harmful to South Africa, but was also a crime against the soldiers of this country. What effect must it have? It can only have one effect, namely to sow confusion in the ranks of our Defence Force. Because we have a national defence force, which consists of the Permanent Force, the Citizen Force and the Commandos, there must inevitably be some of them on whom these stories make an impression. What is the object or effect of this? Is it not solely calculated to weaken and to divide our Defence Force on a matter over which there should not be any division?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point expressed the hope that we shall have a further debate on the Angolan issue. I think there will still be many other opportunities to do so. But there is one thing hon. members must simply not expect of me. I am not prepared to say things which cannot, for diplomatic reasons, be said. Nor am I prepared&#x2014;whatever newspapers outside may say&#x2014;to furnish information which could be detrimental to the South African Defence Force as such. I agree with the hon. member for Durban Point when he says that parliamentary control is also clearly written into this Bill, and that the public need not fear that Parliament will not ultimately exercise its control and its say properly. Because I have never disputed this, I accepted the amendment. I do not want to disregard Parliament, but Parliament cannot always be in session. Nor is Parliament always able to act quickly and rapidly in times such as those we are now experiencing, in which forces may be unleashed which we sometimes have to deal with in the utmost haste.</p>

<p>This brings me to the peculiar argument raised by the hon. member for Rondebosch. It was indeed a very peculiar argument. He said that we would not have had all this politicking if we had referred the Bill to a Select Committee. How would a Select Committee have eliminated the fundamental difference between us? After all, the fundamental standpoint of the hon. member for Rondebosch is the same as that of the Hertzogites. [Interjections.] But of course, the hon. member for Rondebosch and his spiritual compatriots say that this Bill is now calculated to allow us to fight anywhere in the world. That is also what the Hertzogites say. The Hertzogites and he are now outbidding one another in an attempt to determine how irresponsible they can be. What a change would a Select Committee be able to bring about in such an irresponsible standpoint?</p>

<p>I asked the hon. member where in the Bill he gets this impression from, namely that South Africa will now have the right to practise intervention anywhere in the world. He did not give me a reply. He did not quote from the Bill, but from <i>Rapport.</i> Since when is <i>Rapport</i> the authority for the hon. member? The hon. member read someone&#x2019;s opinion that was probably reported in <i>Rapport.</i> I asked him where it was stated in this Bill that the South African Defence Force had the right to practise intervention wherever it pleased. Where is that stated? Surely this is not true. After all, the hon. member is not an ignorant person.</p>

<p>He is merely pretending to be, for surely he knows that it is stated in the Bill that in a time of war the State President shall summon Parliament within a certain period. He knows, in the second place, that the State President may declare a state of emergency. And then certain requirements have to be conformed to. This has nothing to do with intervention. He knows, in the third place, that the State President may declare an armed conflict which in his opinion is detrimental to the Republic to be a threat to the Republic. Where, now, is the so-called intervention which we may freely practise. The hon. member must understand that we in this House are not a lot of children. We are by no means &#x2026; Do you want to ask me a question? Ask your question, perhaps I can help you.</p>

<p>Is it not true that this question of an armed conflict, as I have already said in the Second Reading and Committee Stage, which has to be suppressed or prevented, offers the possibility of misinterpretation, as has already become apparent from the weekend Press?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, must I explain to the hon. member again how an armed conflict may arise? If the hon. member can think of a third way which he can insert in this Act for me, I should like to hear it. The Act already provides that South Africa must be able to discharge certain obligations in terms of agreements which it has with other countries. An armed conflict may arise in that way. Now is that intervention? The Act states further, as he has now pointed out and also said this morning, that when a person is dealing with terrorism, one has to combat it in all its forms. All we are now doing is to say that such a terroristic attack may develop into an armed conflict. Is that intervention?</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to Angola, and I therefore want to define it with reference to Angola. Surely we did not practise intervention in Angola. After all, South Africa would not have intervened in Angola if there had been an authority with whom it could have negotiated on its interests. After all, South Africa had obligations in regard to the lives of people who asked for its protection. Is the hon. member not aware of that? How many times more must I spell it out for him? There are >people who will suffer hunger and thirst if we do not protect those interests. Because there was no authority there, South Africa intervened. What did it do then, immediately? It notified the former authority of what it had done. We did not act self-righteously. We told them that if they would maintain order, we would withdraw immediately. Did they come? No, and then we had to discharge our obligations. What happened then? We then found that a threat was building up against us as a result of the intervention of another country. I now want to ask the hon. member why I have never heard him saying in these debates, or outside in the front lines, that Russia is committing a crime in Southern Africa. [Interjections.] Why is he attacking me because I am resisting a crime which is being committed? He conveniently forgets about the person who is committing the crime, and then says that we are insulting him. The hon. member must not do what the parrot did that joined the crows and, when they began to peck at him, said that he was in bad company. The fact of the matter is that the hon. member could not prove to me where we would be able to practise intervention. The areas in which we may take action in time of war, in a state of emergency, in the combating of terrorism and in the combating of an armed conflict, are all defined in this Bill. The Republic has to be threatened. I am now asking him where the intervention is. Why is he creating that wrong impression outside? What does the hon. member wish to achieve by creating the impression in Africa that South Africa now has a law which entitles it to practise intervention anywhere? What impression does he wish to create in this way? What purpose does he have in trying to give African states the impression, African States that are threatened by communism just as we are, that they are now being threatened from another quarter as well? He must not cry when we mete out punishment to him, or say that we are insulting him.</p>

<p>There we now have the wisdom from the East! I want to sum up. This Bill is a Bill which deals with threats to the Republic of South Africa which may arise. It is a Bill which adapts the provision of the Act in such a way that we are able, under modern circumstances, to deal with a situation which lies between war and peace, and may sometimes constitute a threat. It is, in the third place, a Bill which affords South Africa&#x2019;s soldiers greater protection. It is, in the fourth place, a Bill which creates greater flexibility, and which affords our military leaders an opportunity to take action, so that they cannot be accused of not having leaped into the breach when they as military leaders, had to do so. I thank the hon. members for their support of this measure, and I have no doubt that the general public also supports us in regard to this Bill. As far as this Bill is concerned, the vast majority of South Africans think as we do, and any attempt to mislead them, will ultimately rebound very heavily, like a boomerang, against the heads of those who want to derive temporary party-political advantage from it.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would just like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention once again to the fact that a great deal of the Natal Code needs amending, and I hope that at the earliest opportunity he will look at the report which was submitted by the Select Committee to the KwaZulu Assembly to see whether any of these suggestions or recommendations should not be incorporated into the law. I know he has, said that until he is requested to do so by the KwaZulu Assembly, it is not his intention to do so. However, I think a little preliminary study in the meantime would be advisable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the discussion of this Bill, I associated myself with the appeal which was made for the hon. the Minister and the Department to give attention to an investigation into the operation of the Natal code of Bantu law. For obvious reasons I should like to repeat this request. I tried to indicate that, in many respects, the Code does no longer comply to the demands of the time in which we are living. I do not want to elaborate on this any further.</p>

<p>I should just like to reply to the argument which has been used, i.e. that nothing can be done about this matter before a request has <span class="col_859-860" refersTo="page_0446"/>been made on the part of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. Obviously, all of us appreciate the necessity for a homeland legislative assembly to be consulted in matters which intimately affect such homeland. This goes without saying, but this is not at issue. However, I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that the Code contains provisions which go much further than merely the area of Natal, and much further than merely the matters falling within the jurisdiction of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. For example, the mere fact that the powers of the State President as paramount chief are defined in the Code, is an indication that it is not an adequate reply to say that only the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly has a say in this matter. I mention this only as one example, but there are numerous other cases which go beyond and further than the powers of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly.</p>

<p>In addition, it is quite clear that the Legislative Assembly is not fully representative. All elements of the Zulu population are not represented in the Legislative Assembly, and therefore their voice is not directly heard there. It is also clear that, although theoretically provision exists for the legislation of a legislative assembly to be made applicable to its citizens outside the homeland, there are people outside the KwaZulu homeland at this stage who are most intimately affected by this legislation, people over whom the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly has no authority, but over whom this Parliament&#x2014;and, therefore, indirectly also the department&#x2014;has authority. It is in the light of these considerations that I make a friendly request that the department and the hon. the Minister should consider investigating the applicability, under the present circumstances, of all the provisions of the Natal Code of Bantu Law. If we use the argument that we are unable to do anything before the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly has expressed an opinion on the matter, I can quite rightly ask&#x2014;it would be a debating point and therefore of no importance&#x2014;whether this particular provision in the Bill, i.e. clauses 1 and 3, have been submitted to the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly beforehand. This is a fair question, but apparently this has not been done. I do not take it amiss of the hon. the Minister for not having done so either. However, I want to say that that argument has limitations. In all modesty, I also want to tell the hon. member for Vereeniging, who used the same argument when we were discussing this matter, that as far as I know these provisions have not been submitted to the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. Therefore there is a limitation on the use of this argument in regard to the request for the reconsideration or re-investigation of the applicability of the Natal Code of Bantu law. I want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Houghton, and I want to make an earnest request to the hon. the Minister to have the desirability of retaining the Natal Code of Bantu law in its present form investigated.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in regard to the final argument advanced by the hon. member and his question as to whether the matter had been submitted to the Legislative Assembly, I want to tell him that this Bill, as it stands, has been submitted to the executive council of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. However, the position in respect of the Natal Code of Bantu law does not change. All that is happening now, is that while the Code was enacted as Bantu law by the 1891 Act, it is now being done by a different Act. Therefore, there has been no change in respect of the position of the Code. The hon. member said the Code did not only deal with Bantu in KwaZulu, and during the Second Reading I did not try to imply that this was the case. However, what is important, is the fact that the Code deals with matters, some of which fall under the authority of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. There is no need for them to approach this Government to effect a change, because they can do it themselves. There are other matters in respect of which they have to approach the Government should they want to effect a change. Therefore, I want to confirm what I said during the Second Reading. We think it is a good thing that the Select Committee of that Legislative Assembly, which instituted an investigation and, according to my information, is still dealing with this matter, should first approach the Legislative Assembly and that requests should subsequently be submitted for consideration. I want to tell the hon. member for Houghton that such requests, when they are made on behalf of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly, will receive the necessary attention.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p><span class="col_861-862" refersTo="page_0447"/>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as it has apparently been stated in the Explanatory Memorandum, the procedure for the submission of proclamations issued in terms of section 25, is being brought into line with the requirements of the Interpretation Act. It seems to me as if this is, in a certain sense, an inevitable consequence, but there are, after all, fundamental differences between the kind of proclamations we find in section 25 of the Bantu Administration Act and the kind of regulations and <i>Government Notices</i> to which reference is made in section 17 of the Interpretation Act. Section 17 of the Interpretation Act reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the State President or a Minister is by any law authorized to make rules or regulations for any purpose in such laws stated &#x2026;</block>

<p>copies of such rules and regulations shall be laid upon the Table of both Houses of Parliament within 14 days, and so on.</p>

<p>Section 17 obviously refers to rules and regulations in terms of powers granted to the State President to issue regulations. The powers granted to the State President in terms of section 25 of the Bantu Administration Act are much wider. Section 25 of Act No. 38 of 1927 grants unlimited legislative powers to the State President over the Bantu homelands even to the extent that, in terms of the power to issue proclamations, he is able to amend and repeal any Act this Parliament may make in so far as the application of such measure on the Bantu Homelands is concerned. My contention is now that the kind of proclamation issued in terms of section 25 is, in fact, something quite different and really goes much further than the rules and regulations for which provision is made in section 17 of the Interpretation Act. I do not want to move any amendment on behalf of the Opposition, but I just want to point out that this proclamation is, therefore, of far greater significance and importance than what is referred to in section 17 of the Interpretation Act. It seems to me after all as if an ordinary list is inadequate. All I want to ask, is whether we could be given the assurance that when this list&#x2014;we do not want to make matters difficult for the department&#x2014; is submitted to the House, it should at least contain sufficient details about the contents of such proclamations and that it will not merely be a list of the numbers of the relevant proclamations. I should very much like to hear from the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when these proclamations are laid upon the Table, they comprise all the proclamations containing rules and regulations. In other words, no proclamation which contains a rule or regulation may be omitted. This is one important point the hon. member should not forget. In the second place, the only difference is that while the proclamation itself was laid upon the Table in the past, only a list is now laid upon the Table. In other words, in this list the hon. member will be given an indication of the <i>Government Gazette</i> in which the proclamation or Government Notice appeared. The hon. member may then go into it himself. Apart from this list, the department also tables an Explanatory Memorandum. This ought to furnish the hon. member with additional information so that it will be easier for him to find it in the relevant <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, obviously I am not going to oppose this clause and, incidentally, I am not going to move an amendment. This, together with clause 6 is, as we have said in the Second Reading, the kernel of the Bill. We are quite prepared to support any effort by this Government to fulfil its promises under the 1936 Act and even after any of the homelands may become independent. We simply want to go on record for having said that.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause, as it is printed here, is not acceptable to this side of the House. We believe that the powers for making regulations in terms of section 38 of the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act are so wide and drastic that <span class="col_863-864" refersTo="page_0448"/>they cannot be left in the hands of the hon. the Minister. This is no reflection upon the hon. the Minister, but is due to the contentious nature of some of those regulations. What I have in mind, is for example paragraph (f) of section 38(1) of the Act which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The conditions under which and the procedure whereby a Bantu who is not permitted to reside or to be employed in a prescribed area may be removed from such area under this Act.</block>

<p>In addition there is paragraph (k), the manner of adducing proof under subsection (1) of section 10. As far as these two matters are concerned, it is very clear that in both cases the privacy of people and the rights of people, in this case more particularly those of the Black people are dealt with in a very drastic manner. Paragraph (f) speaks for itself. As far as (k) is concerned, you will remember, Sir, that in terms of section 10 of the Bantu Urban Areas Act, certain categories of Bantu are exempted from permit control. Now section 10 places the onus of proof on that Bantu to prove that he has been exempted. This in itself is already an element in our legislation, in our administration of justice, which can certainly not be considered as normal. Normally the principle is that the State must prove that a person is guilty. The only exception is normally when that person only has the particular knowledge which will enable him to furnish such proof. In this particular case the deviation is once again of such a nature that we feel that we would rather not have these particular powers of section 38 removed from the hands of the State President and placed in the hands of the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree in principle with the arguments of the hon. member for Edenvale in regard to this clause. Personally I do not think it will make an awful lot of difference in practice whether it is the State President or the Minister. The State President means the Cabinet and, although it has never been my privilege&#x2014;and heaven help me that it never should be&#x2014;to be a member of the National Party Cabinet, I doubt whether the Cabinet imposes many restrictions on a Minister in this regard. But in principle the hon. member is right and we will therefore support him.</p>

<p>I just want to point out once again to the hon. member and to the hon. member for Houghton that since my coming to this House&#x2014;that is approximately six years ago, and I have no reason to believe that it was any different in the time since Union&#x2014;they have never approved of a delegation of any power from the State President, previously from the Governor-General, to a Minister, or from the Minister to the officials of the department. In other words, if they had had their way, the State President would still be governing South Africa on his own.</p>

<p>No, you have not approved of a single delegation. With which one did you agree? This has not happened since I have been in this House and I do not believe that you have approved any before that time. Consequently I want to tell the hon. members that this is a clause which is being introduced from the point of view of efficiency of government, <i>inter alia,</i> to make this simpler. Surely the hon. member knows that the Minister remains responsible, even if the power of the State President is delegated to him. Moreover, that legislative power, as I said before, must be laid on the Table. This also comes before the Select Committee and as you yourself know, in the case of this department it also comes before the Bantu Affairs Commission. In other words, ample provision has been made for these matters to receive attention, matters in respect of which the Minister takes action. Provision has been made to bring these to the attention of this House and the House can then decide whether it is satisfied with the steps the Minister has taken. In this the twentieth century, this is the correct thing to do from the point of view of efficiency.</p>

<p>I did not know that the hon. the Deputy Minister would come forward with this statement. I recollect that last year we did indeed approve of delegations of powers on several occasions. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. the Deputy Minister that for the purpose of efficient administration, delegation is necessary. We have nothing against delegation, but I think <span class="col_865-866" refersTo="page_0449"/>that the hon. the Deputy Minister is aware of the fact that although it may not make any difference in practice, there is nevertheless a great difference in law whether the power is exercised by the State President or by the Minister.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it seems to me as though the hon. member for Edenvale is viewing the term &#x201C;delegation&#x201D; in too absolute terms. Delegation does not impose any obligation on the person to whom the power is delegated to exercise the delegated power on his own. He feels that the concept &#x201C;State President&#x201D;, which in practice means &#x2018;&#x2018;the Cabinet&#x2019;&#x2019; is safer; he feels that it is safer for the Cabinet to take an important decision than for the Minister to take such a decision on his own. But there is nothing to stop the Minister, when he decides that a decision is one which may have far-reaching effects, from approaching the Cabinet in that regard, and in practice it certainly happens in this way, in terms of the principle of co-responsibility. But when administrative matters are concerned, which do not have far-reaching effects, and when decisions have already been taken on the principle, then for the sake of efficiency it would be better if he could exercise those delegated powers himself. You may therefore, I think, rest assured, Sir, that co-responsibility will still be accepted by the Cabinet for all decisions on important matters.</p>

<p>I readily accept this, but I want to object to the use of the term &#x201C;administrative matters&#x201D;. I have no objection to these being transferred to the Minister. But I read out two provisions from section 38 which do not concern administrative matters but essentially human rights. This is why I feel that in this particular case the power should be exercised by the State President himself, that is, by the full Cabinet.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we would appreciate an explanation from the hon. the Deputy Minister with regard to this clause. I am referring to three matters in this clause. It mentions &#x201C;packaged Bantu beer&#x201D;, but apparently a holder of an eating-house licence will be able to acquire that Bantu beer only from the bodies mentioned in the clause. It seems, therefore, that it would be impossible for the holder of an eating-house licence to make use of beer powder in order to provide his clients with his own beer. We are actually only asking for an explanation of that. The second point has a bearing on the question of the hours. The question arises whether the hours which have been stipulated here will indeed be sufficient to satisfy the needs of the Bantu public. Reference is made to the opening hour, which is 10h00, as well as to the closing hour at 20h00. This seems to be quite acceptable, because Bantu beer is normally not regarded as an alcoholic beverage. As hon. members know, Bantu beer has a low alcohol content. It seems to me that the argument that the hours for the serving of Bantu beer should be in accordance with the hours for the provision of liquor to Whites, does not necessarily have to be applicable. In the light of the absence of recreational facilities, a need for the provision of Bantu beer with a meal may arise in the evenings. Thirdly, we are also asking for an explanation. May we be told why certain specified days are excluded? I know that the common principle in the White liquor trade is that on religious days there are limited hours only for the provision of liquor to people. Especially because Bantu beer falls under a different category from alcoholic beverages, and because many Bantu do not work on the specified holidays, we should like to know whether it is indeed necessary to apply the provisions regarding the consumption of White liquor to the consumption of Bantu beer as well.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the supplying of packaged Bantu beer in eating houses. I think the time has come for us to do something about the litter that is strewn about pavements, streets, shop doorways and open spaces as the result of empty Bantu beer containers being discarded. If we are going to supply the Bantu with Bantu beer in an eating house, I do not think it is proper to supply the beer in packages. He should be served with beer in exactly the same way as when we go to a restaurant and receive a drink from the waiter. There is one danger, of course. It may mean that we shall have to employ inspectors, since it is possible that when you open a package container of beer, the beer may quite easily be adulterated. For that reason I think it may be necessary to have inspectors to test the beer to make sure it is not adulterated. I think we cannot possibly go on and have the Bantu sitting on pavements outside eating-houses as is happening at the moment, or on fields, under trees and in parks, littering the place with these empty containers. I ask the hon. the Minister to go into these matters to see if he cannot at least in eating-houses make sure that the Bantu are served with Bantu beer in containers which can be cleaned and washed and put into service again.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chariman, in respect of Bantu beer powder I should like to inform the hon. member for Edenvale that at the time when the municipalities started to manufacture Bantu beer&#x2014;a function which has now been taken over by the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards&#x2014;the assurance was given that there would be no competition. I believe this is a sound policy to have from the point of view of rationalization, because the Bantu Affairs Administration Board, just like the municipalities at that time, is a non-profit-making body. For this reason it was desirable to leave the manufacture of Bantu beer to them. When it was decided that those bodies would undertake the manufacture of Bantu beer, the fact was kept in mind that they had to be put in a position to erect the necessary installations and other equipment. If the manufacture of Bantu beer should now be thrown open so that competition could come from elsewhere, it might happen that the existing capacity would not be fully utilized and that the price would then go down to a less economic level. Something like that would of <span class="col_869-870" refersTo="page_0451"/>course not be in anybody&#x2019;s interest. The same principle would also apply if permission were given for Bantu beer powder to be used at the eating-houses, because the position of the manufacturer, the Bantu Affairs Administration Board, would be implicated. That, however, is not all. There is a wide range of Bantu beer powders and it would certainly be necessary to have inspection in order to investigate the quality and to ensure that hygienic requirements are complied with. That, of course, would cause further administration and larger costs. I believe, therefore, that only Bantu beer should be allowed in the eating-houses. That could keep the cost low, something which is in the interest of everybody.</p>

<p>As far as the question of hours is concerned, it is true that the hours do not quite agree with those of restaurants. The hours start at 10h00. Beer and liquor are available from 10h00. Bantu beer may then also be provided. On an ordinary workday it may be provided until 20h00. That is about the time when most Bantu leave the White area and return to their own residential areas. Therefore I do not believe it is necessary to provide Bantu beer after that. There is, of course, a further difference in the sense that while restaurants are not allowed to provide liquor between certain hours every day, Bantu beer may be provided throughout the day. The underlying idea is that Bantu beer should be served to the Bantu during meals, so that they can enjoy it with their food.</p>

<p>In this respect I believe that this measure will have precisely the effect which the hon. member for Rosettenville advocated. Because the beer can be enjoyed in the eating-houses with meals, it will in fact cause the number of beer containers in the streets to diminish. In that respect the measure should have the required effect.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, are holders of eating-house licences only allowed to provide meals until 20h00? After all, there are quite a number of Bantu who are legally entitled to remain within White urban areas. The argument which was used, that all of them have left the urban area and gone to their own residential area by that time, does not apply to all Bantu, does it?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is true that not all of them have to be out of the White area by that time.

The eating-houses are subject to restrictions, just as other bodies are. They are not allowed to remain open throughout the night.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 9, in line 30, to omit &#x201C;section&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;sections 20A and&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I want to apologize to the hon. the Minister and Deputy Minister for the fact that the &#x201C;A&#x201D; after &#x201C;20&#x201D; was omitted in the copy of the amendment which I sent to them. I also want to apologize if any discomfort was caused to them because of this. The amendment is concerned with section 20A of the Bantu Labour Act. As the clause shows, the expression &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; means the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and, except with respect to section 28, includes any officer of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development acting under the authority of the Minister. Section 28 is thus excluded, that is the article in terms of which the Minister is empowered to make certain regulations. So it boils down to the fact that only the Minister can make regulations because he cannot delegate his powers in this connection. Section 20A really contains far-reaching powers. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law &#x2026;</block>

<p>So this predominates over any other legal provision&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Minister may, after he has given at least one month&#x2019;s prior notice of his intention in the <i>Gazette,</i> and after he has consulted the Minister of Labour, by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> as from a date specified in such notice, prohibit the performance of work by or the employment or continued employment of a Bantu&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_871-872" refersTo="page_0452"/>(a) in a specified area;</li>

<li>(b) in a specified class of employment;</li>

<li>(c) in a specified trade; or</li>

<li>(d) in the service of a specified employer or class of employers.</li>

</ol>

<p>There is no doubt that these powers are indeed far-reaching. For this reason I want to appeal to the Deputy Minister to accept my amendment. It will not detract from the status of the department. All I am really asking is that since the powers are so far-reaching, the Minister himself must exercise the powers which were entrusted to him, and must not delegate them to anybody else.</p>

<p>The power which the Minister has in terms of section 28 and which the provisions of the clause prevent him from delegating is his power to make regulations. The Minister must make regulations himself, about such relatively unimportant things as the way and the form in which applications for a licence or a permit should be made in terms of the Act. Basically this is nothing but an administrative matter which involves no points of procedure and does not affect the rights of anybody, but it is still a power which the Minister cannot delegate. Section 20A, on the other hand, is concerned with the powers which the Minister can exercise to intervene fundamentally in the lives of people. This side has always resisted things such as job reservation, and section 20A is a further provision in the application of job reservation. However, we are not concerned with the principle here and consequently I shall not argue about the principle of job reservation. Because of the importance of section 20A and the powers which may be exercised in terms of it, and seen against the background of the trifles about which the Minister himself must decide in terms of section 28 because he cannot delegate his powers in this connection to officials, I really want to appeal seriously to the hon. the Deputy Minister please to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. member was halfway through his argument, I felt like getting up and telling him that he did not have to go any further because we would accept his amendment. I just want to point out to the hon. member that, in a case where the Minister has the power to delegate, the Bill provides that he may delegate. It does not say that he must delegate. It was not the intention with regard to this particular matter to delegate the Minister&#x2019;s powers. The powers involved would have stayed with the Minister.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister could perhaps give us further details about the provision which is contained in this clause.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the condition to which the hon. member is referring is the condition which provides that the corporation may borrow money on such conditions as may be determined by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the Minister of Finance. With a view to good financial management, currency control, etc., such a provision is necessary. There are similar provisions with regard to other semi-State institutions which also have the right to obtain funds. If all the bodies in South Africa were to enter the international markets, they would have to compete with one another. For this reason there must be control to ensure that the borrowing of funds abroad is channelled and that an indication can be given to a body that another body is already operating on the same market. On the other hand, a corporation may produce a source in which nobody is operating. That body can then get permission to operate in it. This measure is therefore aimed at ensuring good financial management. The object is to exercise control over the inflow of money into the country and to see that it does not happen arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with regard to clause 20 I want to repeat, for the sake of the record, the problem which I mentioned in the discussion on clause 3, because here we have a similar case. I feel that the powers of proclamation under this clause&#x2014;I am not referring to clause 28 now&#x2014;are just as far-reaching as those under clause 3.

<p>Clause 29:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate we discussed the problem of the elimination of the representatives of urban local authorities on the Bantu Administration Boards. I just want to reaffirm our objections about this, because owing to the fact that we do not want to make these bodies too large, we are in danger of losing the co-operation of the people who may have an intimate knowledge of matters and who could indeed also take the public with them in regard to the concrete situations which might exist in the environs of a local authority&#x2019;s area. From the White Paper, and also from the explanation which was given, it is obvious that there is something to be said for not making the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards too large in certain cases. The hon. the Deputy Minister also pointed out that, when it came to areas such as the West Rand and the East Rand, the Minister appointed the maximum of two instead of the one which he could have appointed. We do want to stress that we consider it to be very important that especially where the consideration of a vast area which occupies a large number of magisterial districts is not applicable, there is indeed no reason for the application of this provision. So we are not opposing this clause; we are only asking for the assurance of the hon. the Deputy Minister that he will take into account this consideration which we have stated.</p>

<p>As far as paragraph (b) of this clause is concerned, we are again faced with the problem that this matter has two sides to it. It would be possible to keep on the board a person who has already lost his membership of an urban local authority, just because such a person might be the blue-eyed boy of the Minister, or something like that. I am casting no reflection by saying this. It is now possible for people who have been defeated in a municipal election and who would therefore not normally be entitled to remain a member of a Bantu Affairs Administration Board to be retained on the board till the expiry of the term for which they were appointed by the Minister. That limitation is there. On the other hand it is also very clear that it may in fact happen that a man who has rendered good services to the Bantu Affairs Administration Board and the Bantu population may be missed by the Administration Board concerned, because he has resigned as a member of the municipal council or has perhaps been defeated in the municipal election. A case can therefore be made out for both sides, and consequently we ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us the assurance that this matter will be handled with the greatest circumspection in order to make the functioning of the Bantu Affairs Administration Board as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to say to the hon. member that it is indeed the intention to act responsibly. The people to whom the hon. member referred are precisely the people who represent the municipalities. If such a person should lose his membership of the municipal council, but remain a member of the Bantu Administration Board, he would at most be able to complete his term. The hon. member himself said that it might be a member who has a thorough knowledge of matters and who does very good work on the Bantu Affairs Administration Board. In that case it might not be desirable to end that member&#x2019;s term of office at that stage and to appoint somebody else in his place. In such a case we shall act responsibly because we want to retain the co-operation of municipalities.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">On page 13, in line 50, after &#x201C;faith&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and without negligence&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport will remember that, during the Second Reading of the Bill, I suggested to him that we did not entirely agree with the blanket indemnity, conferred in the proposed section 304A(7) in regard to stranded ships, in that the hon. Minister could do with them as he liked. We felt that this should be brought within the ambit of the courts. I suggested at that stage the addition of the word &#x201C;reasonably&#x201D; to be inserted before &#x201C;in good faith&#x201D;. I felt that this would serve the point I was making. However, the hon. the Minister told me in his reply that, had I consulted a lawyer, I would have realized that, in fact, it would make no difference.</p>

<p>I want to inform the hon. Minister that I have consulted several legal advisers on this point, and they were in agreement with my original suggestion. If the hon. the Minister, however, does not like that, I suggest that the words &#x201C;and without negligence&#x201D; would bring an operation of this nature within the ambit of the courts. A situation could very well arise in which the hon. the Minister is given very bad advice indeed from any of his officials, this resulting in possible serious repercussions because a ship, valued at several million rand, could be erroneously scuttled. It is our feeling that the courts should be allowed to decide a matter of this nature if there is any negligence at all. I think this is an honourable thing for the State to take responsibility for. In principle I do not think it is a good idea for things to go outside the compass of the courts, and I believe a blanket indemnity of this nature is not a fair thing to do to anyone at all. I therefore request the hon. the Minister to reconsider the answer he gave me during the Second Reading debate, and also to consider accepting this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, my answer to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Orange Grove is more or less the same as the one I gave him on a previous occasion. That is, when the actions of the department result in a difference of opinion, a court will have to rule on the matter. Whether the amendment moved by the hon. member for Orange Grove is introduced or not is neither here nor there. At present the department does enjoy protection with respect to all acts performed in good faith. This does not, however, mean that acts performed in good faith may include negligence for which the department will not be responsible. This is the way it is embodied in the Act in any way. It is obvious. If negligence should occur&#x2014;and this is also the case in the previous amendment which the hon. member moved&#x2014;which could give rise to a lawsuit in which it was found that a third party suffered damage due to the negligent action of the department, the department would have to answer for such damage. In my opinion this is obvious. This is enbodied in the Act and it is senseless to add something like this to the clause. Therefore I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I realize that this particular section of the clause is not under revision at the moment, but I would like to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister, in any future amendment to this particular clause that may be considered by his department, to take into consideration, and to consult his legal draftsmen on, the possible omission of the term &#x201C;antiscorbutics&#x201D; in line 22. I submit that Act 65 of 1974, the Drugs Control Amendment Act, gives a very adequate definition of the term &#x201C;medicines&#x201D;, which would include reference to the term &#x201C;antiscorbutics&#x201D;. Will the hon. the Minister bear this in mind with a view to possible future legislation? My learned friend, the hon. member for Rosettenville, who is a medical man, suggests that this term could even include lemons and oranges.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate we expressed strong objection to the amendment incorporated in clause 3 and I regret to say that the reply of the hon. the Minister was in our opinion totally unsatisfactory. He accused me specifically of misstating facts without quoting one single fact which I was alleged to have misstated. Now that he has had the opportunity of studying my speech as reported in Hansard I hope he will tell me which facts I misstated. The hon. the Minister tried to pretend that I had said that the Railways were taking all the traffic whereas, in fact, the private carriers would still retain some 56% of the traffic. That was exactly what I did say, and exactly what my uncorrected Hansard will reflect me as having said. What I said, Mr. Chairman, was that this amendment skimmed the cream off the traffic, the easy traffic, the full-container loads which could be picked up in one operation and conveyed straight through to destination, and that this was the cream of the traffic, whilst the conventional traffic, the traffic which gives rise to all the problems in the harbour, would be left very generously and very kindly to private enterprise. The LCLs, the less than container loads, would be put into a stacking area by the Railways where it could be opened and distributed by private enterprise. He did not touch at all on the other matters I raised, such as the question of the effective monopoly which a combine, backed by Government money, was likely to obtain in handling the breaking bulk, because if one shipping firm conveys the goods it is likely that their subsidiary is going to handle the clearing and therefore will handle the goods in the bulk breaking area. All in all, he did not reply to the points we raised. He tried to play it low key and he tried to evade the issues we had raised by laying a smokescreen by saying that what we had allegedly said was incorrect. We ask the hon. the Minister to give us specific answers. He cannot deny that he has had objections from the harbour carriers themselves.</p>

<p>In fact, he had another objection only last week, on 4 February. On that date he had urgent representations from the Harbour Carriers&#x2019; Association and those representations contained the essence of the case I had already at that stage made in this House. He has not replied at all to the question of the investment of R5,1 million on trailers and mechanical horses in order to take over traffic from private enterprise which claims that an investment of only another R250 000 is required by them. This is at a time when the Government is supposed to be curbing its expenditure, when it is supposed to be fighting inflation by not spending unnecessary money. He did not reply to the suggestion that the Railways should convey from the ships to the stacking area and that private enterprise should then be allowed to collect the full-container loads from the stacking are where they are not in the way of the ship or the clearing thereof or of the transportation of the goods to the clearing area. I can think of no possible reasons why satisfactory co-ordination cannot be achieved in order to make it possible for both parties to participate. The hon. the Minister did not reply regarding the legal dispute and here perhaps I did say something which was not totally correct. I said the Railways knew that they had acted illegally. What I meant to say was that the Railways knew that it was alleged that they <span class="col_879-880" refersTo="page_0456"/>had acted illegally and that the matter was being taken to court. I cannot visualize what the Railways were thinking but I assume that they did not believe that they were acting illegally. They believed that they were acting perfectly legally and that is why they are coming to Parliament to ask us to change the law to make sure that what they were doing was in fact legal! But they are not doing it because they had any doubts at all; they are doing it simply because they thought they would like to have this provision in the Act. Or am I perhaps being unfair to the hon. the Minister? Did they think that there was a doubt? Did they expect that there was a doubt?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>In proceeding with the notice to take over the total full-container traffic in Durban harbour. Section 55(1) of the Act provides that the Administration shall not undertake the business of cartage, etc., until two years from the date they advertise. It does not authorize them, in fact it prohibits them, from undertaking cartage in the harbour area and the notice simply means that they will not be prevented from undertaking cartage work. In other words, the notice then allows them to compete in the harbour area but not to exclude other carriers. They could participate; it simply removes the prohibition on the Railways to operate. The giving of notice, the notice which is required in terms of section 55(1), does not entitle them to a monopoly. The original 1913 grant also created entrenched rights for the private carriers. The hon. the Minister will say, as he has said, that the Railways did not act illegally. If they were not wrong in that, and if they did not fear it being tested in court, why come to Parliament to ask Parliament to amend the law? Why waste the time of Parliament if in fact there is no need for this clause because they were acting within the law in any event? The very fact that the Minister has come to Parliament to ask for this power, indicates that he has some doubt and we are not satisfied at all with the answers he has given us. He has not dealt with the question of door to door deliveries which will become possible and which again will exclude the private clearing and forwarding agents from the work for which they are equipped and which they have always done over the years.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I reiterate that we are totally opposed to this clause. We will oppose it as I indicated during the Second Reading, and will vote for its deletion.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are some points raised by the hon. member for Durban Point which require a reply. He suggested that the carriers should be permitted to deliver from the stacking areas and therefore his point is that these private carriers should in fact be able to skim the cream for themselves. What should be remembered, however, is that this whole containerization business in the harbours is a highly capital intensive undertaking. The handling of containers from the stacking areas is especially a capital intensive undertaking. At the moment the situation is that in the Durban area there are 42 main harbour carriers with 835 vehicles. Apart from that, I am told that there are another 200 ancillary carriers with 743 vehicles. If containers in the stacking area are to be handled efficiently then it must be done on a well-programmed basis, because it is almost impossible for numerous different firms to enter this stacking area with each one wanting a particular set of containers to be delivered to them. The straddle carriers which will be available to handle these huge containers will have to work to a programmed method. If this carrier association, the Harbour Carriers&#x2019; Association, had been prepared to form a consortium, so that the whole business could be undertaken by the consortium in a computerized and planned manner, then it might have been possible to continue on the basis which existed before. I understand that the 42 harbour carriers were not interested in forming a consortium to handle this on a single basis. Because of that decision it is almost impossible to give this portion of the work to the Harbour Carriers&#x2019; Association if there is to be efficiency in handling this in any way.</p>

<p>*Today, Mr. Chairman, it is necessary to display greater efficiency. The hon. member for Durban Point and hon. members of the Opposition will be aware of the fact that, through the new methods they are using, the Railways organization is developing a more intensive and efficient organization than existed in the past. Therefore I am convinced that, for the sake of efficiency, economic handling and the saving of money and time, it <span class="col_881-882" refersTo="page_0457"/>is desirable and necessary that the Railways organization should undertake that part of the handling themselves. The position is that special stacking areas are being built at present. From the container ships the sealed containers will be placed in the stacking areas and taken from there to container depots if they have to be handled and the container opened.</p>

<p>However, when one is dealing with sealed containers which can be delivered directly from the stacking area, whether it be to other cities or in Durban itself, it is desirable that one organization, which can handle the matter with efficient advance planning, should handle the matter. In the case of the container depot where the containers will be opened and debulked, and also in the case of the general cargo which is handled in other depots and not specially in the container depots, the private carrier will still have the right to handle it. It is therefore in the interests of efficient handling, advance planning and the saving of labour and time that it is necessary for this part of the work to be handled by the Railways. In particular I want to point out that, with a view to the rapid clearing of the container quay, it must be possible to deliver and remove 1500 containers every three days. Because it is necessary for this to be done as efficiently as possible according to a computer programme, it is desirable that there should be a central authority over the truck drivers who will have to handle the matter. If there are 42 carriers and a further 200 carriers, with a total of 1 500 vehicles, chaos will result if there is no centralized control and handling of this matter. The hon. member for Durban Point will know that we are not concerned with door-to-door delivery here. I am convinced that it is out of the question that the Railway carriers will find it necessary to deliver a whole series of containers with whatever they may contain to the home of the hon. member for Durban Point on the other side of the Umgeni bridge, as he indicated the other day.</p>

<p>If these are sealed containers which have to be delivered in bulk, the Railways will be in a far more favourable position to deliver it from the container quay directly to the factories. But where we are concerned with containers in the container depot which have to be opened, as I have already indicated, private carriers will have the right to deliver these. Therefore I am convinced that this legislation does not mean an injustice to the private carriers; it is necessary in the interest of efficient, economic handling and to enable the Railways to do this work in the interests of the fight against inflation in as efficient a manner as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Klip River will excuse me if at this stage I do not mention anything which he has specifically mentioned in his speech, but during the course of my speech I hope to refer to many of the matters that he raised. I listened with considerable interest to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech during the Second Reading, the reply by the hon. member for Durban Point and again to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply, and I must say that we in these benches are not satisfied with the presentation of the case by the hon. the Minister at all. I consequently move as printed on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To negative this clause.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Durban Harbour Carriers&#x2019; Association has been operating in Durban harbour since the harbour started. Entrenched in legislation, as mentioned by the hon. member for Durban Point, has been their right to carry on business in that harbour. From early days, 1913 in fact, the Railways were given the right to come in as competitors, not exclusively, but as competitors, as has been mentioned earlier, if they gave two years&#x2019; notice. Now we are faced with the situation where the hon. the Minister proposes that these people who have had entrenched rights to operate and who have been making a living and doing a job within the area of Durban harbour are being legislated out of a considerable part of their business. I am not saying all their business; only a part of it. In his presentation the hon. the Minister said that they would retain a certain part.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<p>Why do you say &#x201C;entrenched rights&#x201D;?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Because it was entrenched in legislation. Section 55(1) states:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_883-884" refersTo="page_0458"/>The Administration shall not undertake the business of cartage contractors, or cartage agents &#x2026;</block>

<p>This presupposes that somebody has to do this work and that there is a right for private enterprise to carry on doing business there. Now the hon. the Minister is trying to take that right of private enterprise away. He is trying to be exclusive and to create a monopoly in a certain area. He says that this will not, in fact, affect the rights of private enterprise because they will still have something to do. My advice, from the harbour carriers themselves, is that they do not believe they will have enough. However fine the words of the hon. the Minister are in saying they will have plenty to do, this is no guarantee to them that they will. They know how that harbour operates because they have operated there for a number of years, and they say they will lose most of their business. One carrier, to whom I spoke, said he expected to lose between 50% and 60% of his total business, and the hon. the Minister did not say that he would be compensated if that were to happen. The harbour carriers have put a lot of capital into buying new vehicles. I may say that they were encouraged by the Administration, because whatever the hon. the Minister may say, the letter from the Administration in 1970 specifically said the carriers should prepare themselves for containerization. The first they knew of any action other than this from the Railways was in 1974 when they were advised that it was the intention of the Railways Administration to take over this aspect exclusively, by which time they had already spent quite a lot of money in preparation for containerization.</p>

<p>Just to back this up I would like to ask the hon. the Minister by whom the containers are being handled at the moment. I am informed that something like 600 containers a week are already being handled, quite adequately and quite happily, by private enterprise. Admittedly this is mostly coastwise traffic, and a very small percentage as yet is coming from overseas. What about this coastwise traffic? The carriers are quite capable of coping with this at the present time and they are very happy that they will be able to cope with containerization when it comes to the fore in a couple of years time. In fact, they say that the total additional capital expenditure they will have to put forward is only R&#x00BC;million. The hon. the Minister, according to a letter from the Railways Administration, is suggesting that he spent R5,1 million&#x2014;and this at a time of inflation, when the government is cutting its expenditure.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>He has, but I am expressing the opinions of people in my benches, and perhaps I could say this a good deal better than he. The question of the spending of R5,1 million cannot, I believe, go unanswered by the hon. the Minister. He must explain how, in the inflationary situation in which we find ourselves, he is still prepared to go ahead and lash out and spend this money when he already has the service that is required&#x2014;advantageously, as far as we are concerned, it is private enterprise that has established it. Now the hon. the Minister wants to push private enterprise into the background. He wants to take over containerization and run it himself. It is interesting to note that, in his reply in the Second Reading debate, the hon. the Minister talked about how efficient the Railways Administration could be. He also said, and possibly quite rightly, that he was absolutely certain that the Railway Administration could do it as efficiently as, or more efficiently than, anybody else. I do not believe that this is the point. I believe that the point of this exercise is that he should not be operating on a monopolistic basis. He should rather come in as a competitor. Then he can prove the efficiency of the Railways Administration&#x2019;s operation in competition. If it is going to be so efficient, let it compete. The whole principle, the whole operation of our society as a free-enterprise society in this country, is that there should be competition. Frankly, I do not believe that the efficiency of the whole container operation is going to be put into jeopardy because the hon. the Minister lets private enterprise operate in this field. I think that it can, in fact, be as well handled by private enterprise as in any other way.</p>

<p>There are numerous problems. It has been said to me by many people in commerce in Durban that they are not going to enjoy having to work through the Railways for full container loads and through their particular transport carriers when it comes to other matters. They are going to have to deal with <span class="col_885-886" refersTo="page_0459"/>two separate people. At the moment they can go to one of the hauliers and ask him to pick up their containers or loose loads of this and that. However, now they will have to go to the Railways to do one operation and to their road carrier, whom they employ in a private capacity, to do other operations.</p>

<p>I would like a specific answer from the hon. the Minister on the question of the 600 containers that are being dealt with satisfactorily by private enterprise at the present time. The hon. member for Kliprivier asked whether I would like to see more hauliers, but I am not suggesting that at all. I think there could be a great deal of rationalization in private enterprise operations. I think there are possibly too many. However, this does not excuse the basic principle of pushing private enterprise into the background and giving the State the monopoly, and I am specifically using the word &#x201C;monopoly&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister became quite angry during the Second Reading debate about the question of monopoly. It is, however, a monopoly in a certain area. I believe that this can be handled, without any great additional expenditure, by private enterprise, and I think the hon. the Minister should ensure that private enterprise is allowed to compete in this. They are not asking for an exclusive operation. They are just saying that they are prepared to enter into operations in competition with the Railways and believe they should be given the opportunity to do so.</p>

I do not approve of closed shops. I am not saying that the Harbour Carriers Association is a magnificent organization. In fact, I believe that there should be no closed shop. Why create a closed shop on the other hand? By giving total operation to the Railways Administration one is doing something worse. In the Harbour Carriers Association one at least has a number of people operating in competition with each other. However, if you were to give it all to the Railway Administration, there would be no competition at all. I do not believe that this is conducive to efficiency. I believe competition is healthy and that there should be competition. If the Railways feels it can do a better job, then let it prove that. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the very outset I want to say that it is absolutely essential, for the purposes of efficiency, that one body&#x2014;and the one convenient body is the S.A. Railways&#x2014;should handle the full containers in these stacking areas. What is more: It is essential that there should be efficiency because of the enormous sums of money invested in containerization The hon. member for Klip River often referred to various reasons why it is essential. I should like to add a few.</p>

<p>In Durban alone the Railways will have spent R85 million on containerization by the end of 1979. In the whole of South Africa R375 million will be spent on containerization up to and including 1979. Hundreds of millions of rands are being invested in ships and containers. The hon. member for Durban Point said that I accused him falsely yesterday by saying that he had said that all the containers are now being handled by the Railways and that we were acting illegally and <i>ultra vires.</i> This is not correct. Firstly: The hon. member said that he never said the Railways would handle all the containers. I shall read to the hon. member from his speech at the bottom of page 2 of his Hansard manuscript, dated 4 February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That was five years ago &#x2026;</block>

<p>Surely &#x201C;all container transport&#x201D; means only one thing, and that is &#x201C;all container transport&#x201D;. That is all I said to the hon. member. I pointed out to him that his statement was not correct. Substantial part of the containerization, the 600 containers to which the hon. member for Orange Grove is now referring, the containers that will be conveyed by conventional freighters, as well as the half-full containers on their way to depots, will still be handled by these carriers. That is what I want to explain to the hon. member. The hon. member then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now that they find that it has probably been illegal to have given this notice &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is why I accused the hon. member, for what is illegal about that? I shall prove in a few minutes how I can find nothing illegal in what has been done by the Railways. The hon. member went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there it is; the hon. members can read it. The meaning of this is clearly that only the Railways will handle full containers in the stacking areas, as we clearly stated. Allow me now to start from the point in 1913 where the Opposition wanted to start, because both the hon. members for Durban Point and Orange Grove yesterday referred to 1913. In 1913 there was a Select Committee here in Parliament and in paragraph 2072 of this Select Committee&#x2019;s report the following question, put by the chairman to a person who came to give evidence before the Select Committee, appears&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not propose to eliminate you, you will have a perfect right to continue your business with anybody who likes to employ you. All this Bill says is that the Railways Administration shall have the right to work for anybody who wishes to employ them.</block>

<p>To this the reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That would be a very dangerous power to give to the Government.</block>

<p>As a result of this report&#x2014;and I am only reading this because this is apparently the paragraph to which hon. members referred yesterday&#x2014;an Act was placed on the Statute Book in 1916 in which this paragraph was incorporated and which was later included in the 1957 Act in the same form and with the same wording. I should like to read paragraph 55 for the sake of the record&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cartage business at Durban Harbour not to be undertaken by Administration save after notice.</block>

<p>That is the heading of the paragraph. Now the contents of the paragraph follow&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Administration shall not undertake the business of cartage contractors, or cartage agents to or from Durban Harbour, until after the expiration of two years from the date of a notice given by the Administration and published in the <i>Gazette</i> &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; stating the intention of the Administration to undertake such a business.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Such a business.&#x201D; This is not simply any business in competition, but specific business it intends undertaking and provision is specifically made for this in paragraph 55. If the Administration then wants to undertake business, the Administration has to give two years&#x2019; notice that it wants to undertake such a <span class="col_889-890" refersTo="page_0461"/>business. Surely these are words that mean something. On 17 January 1975 the following notice was published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and once again I read it for the sake of the record&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State President has been pleased in terms of section 55 of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act, 1957, to approve of the publication of the following notice: In terms of section 55 of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act, 1957, notice is hereby given of the Administration&#x2019;s intention to undertake the business of cartage contractors or cartage agents in respect of the cartage of all cargo containers to and from the stacking areas at the container terminal in Durban harbour after the expiration of two years from the date of the <i>Gazette</i> in which this notice is published.</block>

<p>This was done in pursuance of that clause which provides that we have to give two years&#x2019; notice. The hon. member went on to say that we should indicate what type of work we are going to do after two years. We are saying that after two years we shall begin, with the work we specified here, i.e. conveyance to and from the stacking areas. That is what we shall undertake.</p>

<p>Yes, the conveyance of the containers to and from the stacking areas, in other words, the full containers that are stacked there. That is all we want to do, and now the hon. member resents it if I take exception to the fact that he alleged that we had acted illegally and <i>ultra vires.</i> Surely, this is not so.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has just read out the notice stipulating that the Administration will take over all containers, but a while ago he took exception because we said that they will take over all containers.</p>

<p>I shall read it again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Administration&#x2019;s intention to undertake the business of cartage contractors or cartage agents in respect of the cartage of all cargo containers to and from the stacking areas &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the important words. In other words, the Administration has no intention of conveying the containers which are not full and are going to the depot. The Administration will handle only those placed in the stacking areas and which have to be taken from there to various destinations. If the hon. member is satisfied now, I shall resume my seat, but if he is still not satisfied, I shall continue talking because I still have quite a lot to say.</p>

<p>Could I ask the hon. the Minister whether this means that even full container loads coming in on coast-wise traffic, as they do at the moment, will be available for the Carriers&#x2019; Association or private enterprise to pick up, or are the full container loads which are now going to private enterprise, going to be directed to the depot to be handled by the Railways Administration?</p>

<p>All full containers go to the stacking area and are handled there by the Railways.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Are those the ones that are presently handled by the private carriers?</p>

<p>Yes, they are partly being handled by them at the present moment.</p>

<p>*It goes without saying that we should keep up with the times. This morning someone said such an interesting thing to me when we discussed this same subject. He said: Well, the world changes. Containerization is an enormous change, almost a revolutionary change in shipping. An enormous amount of capital has been invested in containerization to enable goods to be transported speedily. We are simply compelled to adjust ourselves to these circumstances and make the best of it in the interests of our country and its economy. Perhaps there will be people who are dissatisfied. This morning someone said to me that when we changed over from sailing ships to steamships many years ago, there must have been people who were dissatisfied because the sail-makers and the yarn-spinners were not able to sell as much of their commodities <span class="col_891-892" refersTo="page_0462"/>as before. However, we could not stick to sailing ships when a more efficient form of transport was created. The same applies here. We have to adapt our transport system to containerization and make the best of it. The hon. member for Klip River mentioned a point which is very important. They do not want to form a consortium, but we find it absolutely essential that there should be one controlling body in the stacking area. One can imagine what would happen if the 44 cartage contractors had to swoop down on the stacking area. One can imagine the chaos that would be caused if the one cartage contractor wants one container and another cartage contractor another.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Are you not able to organize that?</p>

<p>That is why we say it is absolutely essential that the Railways should remain in control of that matter and that the Railways itself should look after the matter. Hon. members should understand that when a container ship comes in, it has to off-load anything between 1 000 and 2 000 containers. Let us say there are 1 500. Those 1 500 containers have to be off-loaded within 48 hours. Within three days 1 500 containers have to be loaded on to that ship again. Those containers then have to be returned. If this does not happen, the next ship is delayed. Enormous costs are involved in such a delay if the necessary efficiency is not displayed to utilize this great capital investment fully and properly. Hence the need for proper order. It will therefore be the task of the Railways to remove the containers from the stacking area to their destinations with the machinery at its disposal. The same vehicle taking the containers to their destination will pick up other containers on the way and bring them back so that they can be loaded on to the ship again. It is a question of speeding up the whole process.</p>

<p>I do not think there is much more that I can say at this stage. I think we have always acted within the framework of the Act. However, there is something I should like to explain to the hon. member. He has asked why we are introducing this legislation. I explained last Wednesday, during the Second Reading debate, that we are introducing this legislation to put this matter beyond all doubt. The hon. member spoke of lawsuits. Other people are also talking about lawsuits. We want control over the stacking areas and we want legal protection to exercise control there. Therefore we are coming to Parliament to receive that protection.</p>
