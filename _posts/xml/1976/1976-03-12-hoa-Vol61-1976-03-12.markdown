<p>Mr. Speaker, after disposing of the Third Reading of the Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill today, we shall follow the Order Paper, except in the case of Order of the Day No. 7, which will have to stand over until next week because the hon. the Minister will not be here. If we make such good progress that we dispose of Orders of the Day Nos. 9 and 10 as well, preference will then be given to Order of the Day No. 21 because it deals with Social Welfare and Pensions.</p>

<p>On Monday and Tuesday preference will be given to Orders of the Day Nos. 11, 12, 13, and 14.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, after the Post Office Budget has been introduced, the Minister of Transport will introduce a Bill in the place of the one he withdrew this morning. I hope it will be possible to dispose of all the stages of this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now come to the Third Reading of the Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill, a Bill in which the hon. the Minister requests an amount of R2 211 million on the Revenue Account, and an amount of R862 million on the Capital Account. Since we have now reached this stage of the Bill it is perhaps a good thing to dwell for a moment on the attitude of the official Opposition as far as the Railways in general is concerned. Voices were raised on the opposite side of the House indicating that the United Party allegedly had no real concern for the interests of the Railways, and also that we sometimes express destructive criticism on this matter. I want to rectify the matter immediately by telling this House that as far as the organization of the South African Railways is concerned, the United Party is proud of this organization and that, as far as its management is concerned, we have the highest praise for the officials who, in our opinion, are doing very good work.</p>

<p>However, there is another side to this matter as well. The Management as well as the hon. the Minister would be the first to admit that the House of Assembly of South Africa, this Parliament, has a key role to play as far as the control of the Railways is concerned. Since this is the case &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Since this is the case, I believe that the officials and the Management of the Railways would be the most frustrated people in South Africa if the House of Assembly and Parliament as a whole were simply to approve the Budget&#x2014;asking for a station here, a bridge there&#x2014;without taking a constructive and critical look at the Budget before us. That is precisely what we as an Opposition have tried to do. Not only have we enjoyed the debate very much indeed, we have also found it extremely instructive.</p>

<p>The first lesson we learned was that the Nationalist Party, the hon. members on the opposite side, simply cannot succeed in dissasociating themselves from their party ties, and that they cannot realize &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They cannot realize that we are dealing here with a large business organization and that it is not at all necessary to approach this matter on a party-political basis. That is the first lesson we learned.</p>

<p><span class="col_3039-3040" refersTo="page_0202"/>I should now like to give attention to the contributions to the debate which were made from the opposite side of this House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that he had won the debate. I take it that he counted the number of hon. members on the opposite side of this House, and not the amount of facts, for if he had done that he would have realized that he had lost the debate.</p>

<p>There is also a second very important lesson which we learned, i.e. that the hon. the Minister came to this House and simply closed his ears in his determination to increase the rates, even though this would send the cost of living soaring, even though this would be in conflict with the anti-inflation campaign, and even though it could have been entirely or perhaps partially possible to have avoided this. The hon. the Minister simply closed his ears to those facts. The hon. the Minister gave us the impression that he was acting in a vacuum. If he increased the rates and the cost of living went up as a result, it was no concern of his. He said it was someone else&#x2019;s problem, not his. He said:&#x201C;If devaluation is the cause of increased costs on the Railways, do not blame me for it; it is not my fault. &#x201D; It is true that he is a member of the Cabinet, but according to him devaluation is not his problem. When we tell the hon. the Minister that we think it is time the State helped the Railways to alleviate the socio-economic freight burden, the hon. the Minister throws up his hands and says: &#x201C;But that is not my difficulty either; the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and the hon. the Minister of Finance must help; I have nothing to do with it. &#x2019; &#x2019;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport cannot flee from his responsibilities. He knows that the Railways is, as the largest transportation medium in South Africa, an integral part of the entire production process in the country. Because transportation affords the product time and place utility, and underpins the entire process of mass production, he simply cannot get away from the fact that if he pumps R200 million into the production channel, it must inevitably have an effect on the cost structure in South Africa. To tell us that our argument is erroneous, is really to come into conflict with the truth. I want to read out to the hon. the Minister a telegram which we received while the debate was in progress. It came from an agricultural organization and I want to read it to this House precisely because so much was said here about agricultural produce. It came from the Nottingham Road Farmers&#x2019; Association, an organization which has a turnover of R1 million per annum, and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This association views with dissatisfaction and disfavour the enormous increase in railage tariffs especially on livestock which will have to be absorbed by the producer and requests serious reconsideration.</block>

<p>Not only is the farmer paying increased rates on his livestock; he is also paying all the other increased rates. If he is a cattle farmer he has to recover all the other increases from his cattle farming enterprise. He has no option but to rely on his being able to receive a higher price for his product. That is how simple it is. The hon. the Minister can turn whichever way he pleases, and his hon. friends on that side of the House can support him if they like, but this must inevitably have an effect on the cost structure in South Africa.</p>

<p>I listened to all the speeches. Some hon. members argued with great bitterness, and their words literally dripped frustration because they were not in a position to express their displeasure as well at these increases. The attack was so transparent that we were able to see this.</p>

<p>Time alone will tell who was right, the United Party or the hon. the Minister and the persons supporting him. If the lesson is a costly one, there is only one place where the fault should be sought: With the Government in general and the hon. the Minister in particular. We on this side have no doubt about the effect of the increases, for we know that they will be a factor in the cost spiral and that we simply cannot get away from that.</p>

<p>What is even worse&#x2014;and this is what worries me&#x2014;is that the hon. the Minister was determined to raise the tariffs and did not demonstrate in the least that he had attempted to cut down on his costs or to find other means of avoiding an increase in the rates completely, or at least of reducing it. The United Party, in spite of the denials from the opposite side, tried in the most constructive way to make a contribution in regard to what we thought should have been done. We told the hon. the Minister that he had R20 million in the Rates Equalization Fund and asked why he was not using it. We told the hon. gentleman that if he depleted this Fund and did so in the knowledge <span class="col_3041-3042" refersTo="page_0203"/>that such depletion of the Fund would weigh up against the detrimental effects which were otherwise going to be caused, we would tell him each time he depleted the Fund that he was not the first Minister to do so. His predecessor depleted the Fund with great economic effect, and I think that at one stage there was only R2 million left. And he needed the money in economic circumstances which were far less pressing than they are at the moment. Therefore, he could have obtained R20 million from that source. We told him that he should budget for a deficit of R30 million. Such a step is not unknown in the history of the Railways. It is acceptable, and if the hon. members had had any confidence in the economic upswing which will follow, this is in fact the step which should have been taken.</p>

<p>We pointed out to the hon. the Minister that his depreciation amount was R167 million. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor reduced his Depreciation fund by R17 million, precisely for the purpose of obtaining additional funds. We told this hon. Minister that he should also have done so and that he should use a little more. The Renewal Fund, into which the depreciation is paid, has a balance of R150 million. Why could he not have taken R30 million from that&#x003F; This would have given him an aggregate of R80 million. We told the hon. gentleman that he should look at overtime and Sunday Time. He pushed it up by 32%, and we asked him to reduce it a little, for he could perhaps save R20 million there. That would have given him R100 million. We have not even come to the staff yet, and I am telling the hon. the Minister now that he was in a position to cut down on his rates increases by 50% or more. But the hon. gentleman does not want to argue this point. That is what I am so concerned about. The hon. gentleman did not even consider our proposals, but what he does in fact allow &#x2026;</p>

<p>Listen to what the hon. gentleman is saying. He knows the accounts of the Railways far better than I do. He knows that he has a balance of R150 million in his Renewal Fund. I am not asking him to borrow extra money, but to use a little of the reserve fat.</p>

<p>When is the hon. gentleman going to use it&#x003F; He has not used it in the last five or six years. When last was the balance on that account below R100 million&#x003F; That is my argument. I am not asking the hon. gentleman to borrow overseas. The hon. member for Amanzimtoti is in fact going to discuss the Capital Account and it may very easily appear that he is able to save R20 million on his capital expenditure in view of the economic position in which we find ourselves. The hon. gentleman cannot get away with that. We have given him the positive steps with which he could have reduced his rates increases by more than R100 million, and I have not even come to the staff aspect yet. The hon. gentleman said that he was going to deal with me and I want to concede that when the hon. the Minister deals with a person, at least he does so in a civilized manner. Has the hon. the Minister now dealt with me in regard to the staff position&#x003F; After the accounts were closed, I found that I owed nothing, but that the hon. the Minister still owes me a reply. He must still tell this House&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;what amount of money he included as a charge in the Estimates for 1976-&#x2019;77 in respect of wages. According to my calculation the amount is R931 million. The hon. gentleman said that that was merely information. I am now telling him that if that is merely information, there must be a correct figure somewhere. I think it is the duty of this hon. House to insist that we obtain of the correct figures somewhere. If I am correct, and the figure is in fact R931 million, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that if he were to keep his staff constant, if he were to keep his staff at a figure of 252 000 instead of 266 000, he would find that he would be able to save approximately R50 million. He need only make a calculation. I used the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own figures. He himself stated that the average annual income of the Railway worker amounts to R3 500. Multiply this by 14 000&#x2014;that is what he will save on officials&#x2014;and you have a further R50 million. To my mind it is as simple as that.</p>

<p>No, it is not. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. the Minister has made this matter so complicated that it has eventually become almost impossible to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>However, I have not finished with the hon. the Minister yet. He made an attack on me because of my standpoint on rationalization. In my simplicity I tried to tell the hon. the Minister what I understood rationalization of staff to mean. I tried to put it to him that, if he were to keep his staff constant at 252 000, and if he were to reorganize that staff in order to enhance their efficiency and their productivity, he would still be able to pay his workers as much more as he is now doing. It would still have been possible to increase the salaries of some officials by 20%.</p>

<p>Yes, but my &#x201C;computer&#x201D; can, and it is far better than the hon. member. The computer&#x2019;s battery is still fresh. Is yours&#x003F; Sir, I am not going to discuss the hon. member&#x2019;s batteries. That would be a mistake. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>In addition I want to refer to something which is of grave concern to me. We have already heard a great deal here about the distress of the pensioner. The hon. the Minister has decided to rationalize his staff. I have already told him that we are not opposed to that. But there is nevertheless one thing I cannot understand, and which no one can explain to me. Why does the hon. the Minister not rationalize the pension system as well&#x003F; The hon. the Minister can tell me that the pre-1973 model pensioner received less than the others because there are different funds. However, if the hon. the Minister was also gravely concerned about these people, he would put it to this hon. House that, according to actuarial calculations, he needs an additional R10 million to R15 million to put the two funds on a par. But his reply does not satisfy me at all. It does not enable me to give an old pensioner an explanation. The pensioner tells me:&#x201C;Sir, three years ago when I retired I was doing precisely what that man who is going to retire now is doing. We have an equal number of years of service, yet my pension is considerably less than his.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What explanation can I give for this&#x003F; What does the hon. the Minister say to this&#x003F; We are taking a realistic look at the position. The old age pensioner of today, who made no contribution to any fund, and his wife are now receiving an amount of R128 per month if they make application in the normal way. I still say that this is not enough, but this is what they are receiving. Now I have here a case of a man who worked for the Railways for 32 years. Over the years he made his contributions. Because he receives a Railway pension of R161 per month, he receives nothing as a normal pensioner, as a social pensioner. What he now receives for all his contributions over the years, over and above what the normal social pensioner receives who did not contribute a cent to any fund, is R33 per month. I think it is time we adopted a radical approach to this matter and I think it is time the hon. the Minister came to this House and said that he required R10 or R15 or R20 million to strengthen his funds to such an extent that all <span class="col_3045-3046" refersTo="page_0205"/>the officials who are on the same level could receive the same pension. Sir, this House would be unable to refuse it. For that purpose I myself would be prepared to increase the rates. If this cannot be done, I am telling the hon. the Minister that we will have to achieve a position&#x2014;and I repeat that he is a member of the Cabinet&#x2014;in which we have to provide the Railway pensioners with pensions on two fronts: Their Railway pension as well as an old age pension. Then they will receive a pension which will give them just over R200 per month. I am referring the the &#x201C;pre-1973 model&#x201D;. Sir, there can be no objection to that, because this House cannot sit idle and allow this situation to continue.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just want to deal briefly with the Capital Account. I find here in the Memorandum of the hon. the Minister that on 31 March 1975 he had 2 000 container wagons on order. Sir, the date on which containerization has to come into operation is not far off. In November 1975 not one of those wagons had been delivered yet. I may be wrong, but I believe the reason is that the Minister will argue that he was unable to obtain the steel and have those wagons built. I maintain that if there had been judicious management and if they had been unable at that stage to obtain the steel locally, steel should, if need be, have been imported. Then they would, in the first place, have been able to obtain the steel for the wagons more cheaply than they would have been able to obtain it locally and, secondly, would have been able to avoid all the steel price increases of the last few months. An amount of R27 million has been budgeted for those 2 000 wagons. I am watching the position very carefully, and shall see what it is next year. I want to tell the hon. gentleman that when that final account is presented to him, it will not be R27 million; it will be many millions more than R27 million. Now, if the hon. gentleman regards himself as an integral part of the Government of the Republic, I think he has sufficient grounds to say that even if he has to import the steel, particularly when he was able to receive it at a far lower price, he would do so rather than to wait a year, have all these escalations in the steel price and then have 2 000 wagons, wagons which he needs badly, but which would now cost many millions more.</p>

<p>This Budget will be known in the history of South Africa as the blind budget, a budget which was introduced by an hon. Minister who did not want to see. I almost feel like adding that he did not want to hear either. He did not want to see that his position required him to act in such a manner that he would promote and not harm the economy of South Africa. That is why I say, Sir, that I regret doing so, but I shall have to call this a blind budget.</p>

<speech by="#terblanche">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. D. TERBLANCHE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the speeches of the hon. member for Maitland are usually very entertaining and very amusing, but I must tell him that their content is just so much hot air&#x2014;and that goes for many of his colleagues&#x2019; speeches in this debate as well. I want to tell the hon. member for Maitland that the hon. the Minister is not indifferent towards inflation. The large-scale and very effective retrenchment campaign which the Railways embarked on, belies his argument completely. What is more: Experts tell us that the effect of these high railway rates will in any event not be as bad as they are trying to make out. Sir, it is a great pity that the Opposition, and especially the hon. member for Durban Point, found it necessary to break out into hysteria during this debate, and to do so despite the fact that the hon. Minister has succeeded, in the circumstances in which South Africa finds itself at present, in presenting the country, not with a crisis budget, but with a strikingly normal budget. In view of the conflagrations breaking out around us and the tremors which even we in this country can feel, it is particularly comforting and pleasing that the Railways has been able to continue so peacefully and practically undisturbed. But now in this debate, the Opposition comes along and lapses into wild hysteria. The hon. member for Durban Point sounded off melodramatically about &#x201C;shock waves which will spread into every corner of South Africa&#x201D;, and spoke about the &#x201C;blackest budget&#x201D; in the history of the Railways. The hon. member for Durban Point said that his amendment stood on four legs. Now I want to tell the hon. member that at the end of this debate, all four of those legs have been knocked out from underneath him. The hon. member and his party are lying flat on their backs, after one of the poorest shows which an Opposition has ever put up during a Railway debate. These people have become completely entangled in the astronomical figures of a growing Railways network. They are totally incapable <span class="col_3047-3048" refersTo="page_0206"/>of making calculations, and what is the use of arguments based upon inaccurate calculations, which they have so often made here&#x003F; Sir, there is no crisis in the Railways, but there is indeed a crisis in the United Party&#x2014;a chronic crisis.</p>

<p>Let us look at what has become evident during this long debate. In spite of everything said here, there are a few things which are as plain as a pikestaff. Firstly: the financial position of the Railways remains basically sound although there were a few increases in tariffs. It is very important that this great organization should be economically sound and strong especially in the times which we are facing. The Railways must always be ready for the challenges awaiting us and for the special demands which may be made of it. We are aware of the Railways&#x2019; important role in our economy, but now in addition to that, an equally important strategic role is developing, and we cannot allow this vital artery of our economy, and in a certain sense of our military activities, too, to be paralysed by a shortage of money. No, the Railways must remain vigorous and strong, and if possible must be made even stronger so that it may continue to play its key role in this country. To do this the Railways needs money. If one handicaps the Railways with too little revenue, then ons is handicapping South Africa, and we may not do this, especially not in these times. Therefore we shall have to make greater sacrifices and must be prepared to pay those high tariffs.</p>

<p>A second fact which has become obvious during this debate is that the Railways fully measures up to the basic demand made of it, namely, providing the country with an effective transport service. No-one, in the course of this debate, has been able to deny that the Railways are effective, not even the Opposition. All they could find to complain about here, was a matter of a few aircraft which were late now and again, but they were unable to deny that the Airways had one of the best safety records in the world. But they are not grateful for being able to travel safely. A third irrefutable fact is that the Railways has exhibited an exceptional degree of financial discipline in these times. If it had not been for the Railways&#x2019; vast retrenchment campaign, these tariff increases would have had to be much worse. If we look at what the Railways have done in order to combat inflation and rising prices, then we must raise our hats to them. They have not squandered money, nor have they, like the Opposition, lapsed into pessimism.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the hon. member for Durban Point. I ask for his attention. Because he emerged from this debate defeated, he clutched at a straw and made an unpleasant attack upon myself and my colleague here, the hon. member for Bloemfontein West, because we told a newspaper that we would look after the interests of pensioners. Now he sees it as a terrible sin that we did not rise to champion the cause of the pensioners here.</p>

<p>I will tell the hon. member why we did not rise to speak here. We did not do it, because we do not want to take political advantage of people as the hon. member for Durban Point does. We did not do it, because we do not want, to try and gain votes for a by-election, as the hon. member does. If my colleagues and I were to rise and make and announcement in this Parliament whenever we did anything for our voters, we would have to discuss it in every debate. Thus we have also done our duty as far as the needs of pensioners are concerned, with this difference, that we do not broadcast it in order to gain votes.</p>

<p>However, we wonder what the hon. member for Durban Point has actually done for pensioners, besides crowing about it here. I have before me correspondence which proves what I have done for pensioners in my constituency. To tell the truth, I have done much more, but I am not going to blow my own trumpet. That I leave to the trumpet blower of Durban Point. What is revealed during these debates, is not a twentieth of what we on this side of the House do for our voters in this Parliament, but we do not shout it from the rooftops as the hon. member for Durban Point does. We are not like the hon. member who tries to score political points off us merely because he lost the debate. The Railway people of Bloemfontein know what we do for them. That is why they make so much use of us. They know that my door, the doors of my colleagues in <span class="col_3049-3050" refersTo="page_0207"/>Bloemfontein and throughout the country are open to the Railwayman. This, side of the House has cherished the well-being of Railway pensioners and all other pensioners in the country through the years. It is the practice of this Government to revise pensions regularly, to increase pensions together with the periodical salary increases. The hon. the Minister knows just as well as the pensioners do, that the rising cost of living is making it more and more difficult for them to make ends meet. The hon. Minister knows these things because we continually keep him informed as regards the needs of these people. We tell him what is happening in the constituencies, and therefore he regularly considers these things. Nor does the hon. the Minister turn a deaf ear when it comes to appeals and many of the appeals come from us. When it is once again possible, there will be relief. The Minister has said so.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. D. TERBLANCHE</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, but the hon. member literally had hours to speak during this debate and now he wants to steal another few minutes from me. The railwayman knows very well that the NP is the true friend of the workers in our country, and not those people who want to undermine them with non-White labour.</p>

<p>In the few minutes which remain, I should like to deal with another very important matter. The Railways does indeed make more use of Black labour. In September last year, approximately 16 000 non-Whites rendered service in posts which were previously occupied by Whites. Non-Whites were placed in these positions because the necessary White labour was simply no longer available or obtainable. However, there are people in this country who are now trying to make political capital out of this. They are telling the railwayman that the NP is cramming the Railways with Black people. The UP is also guilty of this.</p>

<p>Whenever it suits them, during elections, for example, they shout from the roof tops that the Government allows the poor White workers to be ousted by non-Whites on the Railways. The result of this irresponsible talk is that uncertainty has arisen among some White railwaymen, especially those in the lower grades. The Railways Administration, however, sees to it that the employment of non-Whites on the Railways takes place in a very orderly and systematic manner. It is not a question of simply throwing open the doors as regards labour. This is done in collaboration with the staff associations, and the staff associations allow this because they can trust the Government. However, they will never ever trust the UP with that, still less the Progrefs. If a labour measure of that nature should be effected under those people, there would be strikes, rebellion and chaos in the Railways. The Opposition will not come into power, but should they do so, the very just thing they would do would be to eliminate job reservation. Job reservation, which is the White workers&#x2019; insurance policy, would be tom apart by them and thrown to the winds. The railwayman must remember this. There are doors which are kept tightly closed by the Government, and those doors will be thrown wide open by the Opposition. For the Opposition, job reservation is the stumbling block in the path of industrial expansion in South Africa, whereas the policy of the NP has always been that the White worker will be protected against the undermining of his wage level and from being rushed out of his spheres of employment by non-White labour.</p>

<p>However, the railwayman does not have to fear anything as long as the NP is in power in this country. Not a single White person has been forced out of his job by a non-White in the Railways. Non-Whites are placed in positions which were previously occupied by Whites, but these are positions for which no more Whites are available. In any event this takes place with the full collaboration of the staff associations concerned. This step is in no way prejudicial to Whites. Rather, it favours them, because it has resulted in it being possible to create more channels of promotion for Whites in supervisory capacities. What is the position in this country&#x003F; We have a position of virtually full employment. In these circumstances the Railways still find it very difficult to fill all vacancies. Out of an establishment of 32 099 in the bread-and-butter grades alone there was a shortage of <span class="col_3051-3052" refersTo="page_0208"/>7 570&#x2014;or 23,6%&#x2014;and this was in spite of an intense recruitment campaign, periodic salary increases and improved working conditions. The Railways has simply been unable to eliminate the shortages. They also employed more women in men&#x2019;s positions. At present there are 952 women working as checkers. There are 160 woman constables. I can mention many more such examples. The Railways is also doing everything in its power to help White workers so that they can improve their position. Therefore a committee has been appointed in order to give a hearing to all the White railway workers, viz. the lower income group in the Railway service, with a view to placing them in better positions. Five thousand people have been given a hearing and it has been found that 3 560 of them were suitable for promotion. Of this number 385 refused promotion and 208 were not interested. The training of its people, too, is a task which the Railways takes very seriously. More than R1 million is spent on this annually. The Railways are not only the biggest single employer in the country, but also the biggest trainer of apprentices. Approximately 7 500 apprentices are at present undergoing training in 38 different trades. The Railways spend a pretty penny on bursaries every year for students who want to study further.</p>

<p>To everyone, young or old, the Railway offers an opportunity for better training to enable one to acquire better qualifications and progress to better things. In this way the danger of his being ousted by non-Whites, is eliminated. In spite of all these efforts in the interests of the White worker, the number of people attracted to the Railways is nevertheless insufficient and the Railways is still faced with a serious shortage. This leaves the Railways no alternative but to make use of a greater number of non-Whites. If the Railways had not taken this step, certain services would definitely have come to a standstill and the Whites themselves would have suffered as a result. One can now see what a grievous untruth it is to maintain that Whites are being forced out of their posts in the Railways by non-Whites.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend entering into the hon. member&#x2019;s quarrel with the United Party and the hon. member for Durban Point, although listening to the word pictures which he painted, one is somewhat fascinated at the idea of the hon. member for Durban Point going into a debate hysterically, coming out naked and then looking for political fleas. However, when the hon. member for Bloemfontein North talks about job reservation as an insurance policy for the White worker of South Africa, I must quarrel with him because the policy of job reservation is not an insurance policy. It is the sort of policy which brings the future of South Africa into danger because it is discriminatory and unfair and engenders bitterness. I want to tell the hon. member that it is legislation like that which enforces the policy of job reservation which is holding South Africa back.</p>

<p>At this stage of the debate I want to come back to a section of the introductory speech of the hon. the Minister when he moved the Second Reading. I refer to the discussions which the hon. the Minister is going to have with the various staff associations during April concerning their claims for improved salaries. The hon. the Minister said that should an agreement be reached in regard to salary adjustments, this would necessitate a simultaneous adjustment in rates and fares. I hope the hon. the Minister will, as a result of what has taken place in this debate, rethink his attitude in this matter. I think that the country-wide adverse reaction to the budget which he has presented must have made the hon. the Minister realize that one thing he cannot do for a long time is to increase rates and fares further, if we are to have any hope at all of fighting inflation in South Africa.</p>

<p>The inflationary effect of the budget is already far more than the country can bear and the thought of yet another round of massive increases is quite appalling. The hon. the Minister just must not do it and I hope that he has already realized it. We in these benches would like an assurance from the hon. the Minister that he is not again going to increase tariffs and fares in the near future.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear to the hon. the Minister that I am not questioning the case for salary and wage increases for Railwaymen. Especially in view of the quite impressive increases in productivity which have been <span class="col_3053-3054" refersTo="page_0209"/>brought about, I think the case for the Railway employees is a strong and valid one. The money must, however, not come from increased tariffs. If increased amounts must be paid out on increments for the staff, the hon. the Minister must find the money elsewhere by cutting spending.</p>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. the Minister will just listen to my argument he will hear what I have to say. The hon. the Minister must realize that if he increases rates in order to pay increased wages and salaries, he will cause further inflation which will lead to further wage demands and then we are once again on the old inflationary merry-go-round except that it is not so merry. The hon. the Minister and many speakers on that side of the House have continually challenged on the basis of where cuts should be made. They have asked us to indicate where spending should be cut seeing that we are asking for cuts in expenditure. They want to know what should be cut out of the budget. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us whether the Administration has a list of priorities in so far as capital expenditure is concerned. Do they list in order of importance exactly what the priorities are in terms of capital expenditure&#x003F; The hon. the Minister does not say anything, but if they do, and I am sure that they must, then the answer lies in that list. I am sure that there is a list of that nature. If you just do not have the money to spend, then you cut back on the lower sections of your priority list. I want to make the point again that you cannot spend money which you do not have. The hon. the Minister must realize that he cannot come to the country again with further increases, because that will be the road to economic disaster. I can only urge restraint, self-discipline and the knowledge of what he is doing when he makes these tremendous tariff increases. The hon. the Minister seems to think it very funny, but I should like to tell him that the country does not feel that tariff increases are very funny at all. The fight against inflation has been virtually wrecked by this sort of thing.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased to hear that the hon. the Minister does not think it is amusing because nobody else in South Africa holds that view.</p>

<p>Another matter which I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister at this stage is the question of urban passenger services and the building of underground railways in the light of the Driessen report. I know, since I have raised it before, that in previous years the hon. the Minister, wearing his hat as Minister of Railways rather than as Minister of Transport, has denied responsibility in this matter altogether. He said that underground railways and other rapid transport systems did not fall within the ambit of responsibility of the Railways. I want to quote as follows from the recommendations of the Driessen report (para. 1.3.14)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A decision on the building of an underground railway as a mass transit system in any of the major urban areas of the Republic should be taken only after a full feasibility study and such other studies as may be necessary, including a detailed market survey and an evaluation of social and other non-economic aspects.</block>

<p>This recommendation is fair enough. I want to ask the hon. the Minister about the situation in Johannesburg and I quote again from the Driessen report where it says <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As suburban railway transport forms and important integral part of the urban transport system in the Republic&#x2019;s major urban areas, close liaison between the Railways Administration and the authority preparing an urban transport system plan is essential.</block>

<p>I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether such close liaison is taking place between the Johannesburg City Council and the S.A. Railways. Many transportation surveys have already been carried out in Johannesburg including a series on the desirability of an underground railway which could consist of 24 km of track serving the central area and other areas of high-density development in the city. The Railways are supposedly the experts in South Africa on the running of railways&#x2014; the only experts, although they are shortly going to get competition from Iscor. Presumably they have been consulted by the city <span class="col_3055-3056" refersTo="page_0210"/>council of Johannesburg. I should like to know how far this liaison has gone and whether any decisions have been taken, because I hold fast to the viewpoint that any underground railway system in Johannesburg should be linked in some way with the other suburban railway services. It would be most interesting to know what is happening because time is passing, costs are escalating all the time, traffic is getting worse in Johannesburg and unless there is a major movement very soon, Johannesburg is in danger of strangulation. As the hon. the Minister is aware, the Johannesburg City Council cannot finance a system of this nature without the assistance of the central Government. Just how far have plans for such assistance gone and how much help and attention are the Railways giving to this matter of extreme urgency&#x003F;</p>

<p>Proceeding to another matter, I want to talk about the efficiency of our Railways in terms of the service they are offering the public. I do not believe that there is any room for complacency. Modernization and improvement have taken place on a tremendous scale, but is the public really getting a better service&#x003F; I have here two railway timetables for the Cape Western suburban train service; one is date 1 December 1975 and the other July 1938. The latter is a most interesting document, a document of 38 years ago. Incidentally, it is not only a railway timetable, but an air timetable as well.</p>

<p>I find it most interesting to compare the service the public was getting in those days with the service they are getting today. It is of interest to note that 38 years ago the fastest time from Cape Town station to False Bay on the suburban system was 22 minutes. Today, after all the improvements that have taken place, the fastest time I could find on paging through the current timetable was 29 minutes. Let us look at all the technical improvements that have taken place since that time. During the period 1938 to 1976 a number of level crossings have been eliminated and the voltage has been stepped up from 1 500 volts to 3 000 volts, to give greater power. I want to point out too that the number of trains entering Cape Town station has hardly changed. If one studies the figures for trains coming in between, say, 8 o&#x2019;clock and 9 o&#x2019;clock on any weekday morning, one finds that in 1938 the figure was 16 while at present it is 15. That is the position despite two extra lines between Woodstock and Cape Town on the Simonstown line, the elimination of the awkward bend around the buttress of the Castle and the use of eight instead of six platforms at the Cape Town Station. In all these years of technical advance we do not seem to have achieved a tremendous amount of improvement in the service: A train that took 22 minutes in 1938, takes 29 minutes today.</p>

<p>I must grant the hon. the Minister that we have come a long way as far as air timetables are concerned. Looking at the Airways timetable of 1938, it is interesting to note that there were only four planes per week between Germiston and Cape Town and that the flying time was seven hours. I grant that in this respect we have come a long way since those days. However, I am not sure that these improvements have come about due to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s efforts.</p>

<p>The point I wish to make is that there is always room for improvement. I am certain that the Railways Management and Administration is aware of this. I must say that I would like to hear, occasionally, a little honest constructive criticism from hon. members on the other side. Hon. members on the benches opposite continually come with a paean of self-congratulating messages that flow in an unending stream to the hon. the Minister. I think that a little self-criticism, a little introspection, is always a good idea.</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Orange Grove who has just resumed his seat, displayed a logic which is completely beyond my comprehension. He told us that he had no objection to the Minister increasing his expenditure by granting salary increases after the negotiations to be conducted before long, but that he objected very strongly to the revenue being increased by increasing rates. In all fairness I must add that he did ask for a cut in capital expenditure. I am sure that the hon. member for Amanzimtoti, who is to be the next speaker, will elaborate on that theme of cutting capital expenditure. The hon. member for Maitland told us that this would be the theme of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. I remember that the hon. member for Amanzimtoti launched a cutting attack on the hon. the Minister about his lack of planning during this debate last year. A year ago we had the congestion of ships at Durban Harbour.</p>

<p><span class="col_3057-3058" refersTo="page_0211"/>The hon. member said that it was entirely due to the lack of planning by this Government that capital provision had not been made years ago for additional facilities and this was the reason for the congestion of ships there. If the Government had spent so much capital years ago, I wonder what we would have done with that unused capacity today. What a burden it would have been on the Administration.</p>

<p>It is understandable that the Opposition should try to derive any political advantage which it can from these tariff increases. One can understand this. However, what one cannot understand, is that in their eagerness to get at the Minister, some members of the Opposition have dealt very nasty blows at the management and the staff of the Railways. Under the impression that they were criticizing the Minister, they said extremely unflattering things about the staff, or at least insinuated them; so much so, that some of the hon. members had to back down and praise the staff. For example, the hon. member for Durban Central, who is very amused at something at the moment, stood up here and, even though he is a layman, found fault with the Administration and with conditions in the booking office. Nor did things in the workshops please him. With all respect, it really seems rather presumptious to me for a layman to express that kind of criticism.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Maitland attributed the shortages to two factors. Firstly he attributed it to the fact that 22 000 additional members of staff had been appointed&#x2014;it was later discovered to be 14 000. In the second place he attributed it to the amount of R43 million which had been spent on overtime. He has just stood up and asked that this amount be cut by R20 million. He was very enthusiastically supported in this by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. The hon. member for Colesberg made a striking reference to this when he said that what the hon. member had displayed in his speech was a whirl-wind style. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town spoke about the economic slump and asked how one could increase staff and pay R43 million in overtime in a time like this. What is the implication of this allegation&#x003F; If their premise is correct, the implication of this is that the productivity of our railwaymen has decreased, that the staff no longer work as hard as they are able, and that there are workers who are shirking and do not put in an honest day&#x2019;s work. After all, if five people are needed to build a certain wall, and one appoints six people to build that same wall, and still pay them overtime, surely it means that productivity has decreased, and this is exactly what the hon. member for Maitland said about the staff.</p>

<p>This covert insinuation is untrue, it is unfair and it is undeserved. What are the facts&#x003F; The revenue of the Railways has increased over the past five years from R970 million in 1970, to R1 854 million in the present year, therefore an increase of almost 100%. During the same period the increase in the staff of the Railways was just over 10%. I know that there are other explanations for the increase in revenue, but one of the most important deductions one can make, is a higher productivity amongst our railwaymen. They deserve to be thanked by that side and not belittled.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said here that the farmers were the most wronged members of the community. He used a whole long list of adjectives to describe the ways in which they were being wronged. I know which group in our community is the most insulted&#x2014;it is the railwaymen. The same hon. member who spoke about the wronged farmer, yesterday suggested a cut of R153 million in the salaries of railwaymen and that this would balance the Minister&#x2019;s budget. I think that railwaymen outside should take cognizance of what that hon. member suggested here.</p>

<p><span class="col_3059-3060" refersTo="page_0212"/>I should like to deal with the vacation employment of students. There are just over 90 000 students at our residential universities, students who have at least two months&#x2019; holiday at the end of every year. In my opinion we have a manpower potential here which is not being fully utilized as yet. I do not think that our employers are sufficiently orientated towards making use of this temporary source of labour. In Canada, for example, they are orientated towards the temporary employment of students to such an extent, that students belong to an unemployment insurance scheme, so that they may draw benefits if they are unable to obtain work during holidays. I should like to address a plea to the hon. the Minister, and that&#x2019;s that since the Railways have so often taken the lead and set the example in respect of labour affairs, they should also set the example for the orderly and organized employment of students during holidays. I am not asking for any type of charity on behalf of students. The students have a contribution to make in order to promote the interests of the Railways. The other day, I heard a system manager of the Railways saying in a private conversation that he would have had to cancel trains during December were it not for the fact that he could appoint 40 students as firemen on the trains. These are the things we should tell the students. The student must feel that the Railways need him, too, and that he is able to make a contribution in the interests of the Administration and in the interests of South Africa. Therefore I want to repeat: The students are not asking for charity but only for the opportunity to prove that he can render the Railways a service. It is undoubtedly to the student&#x2019;s advantage to work in the holidays. He needs the money. The other day I heard of a student who earned almost R1 000 as a fireman, because he was able to work a reasonable amount of overtime. It is necessary that we keep our students constructively occupied. The devil finds work for idle hands, and this must not happen in the case of the students. It is an enriching experience for students to be employed by the largest employing organization in our country. It broadens his outlook on life and it extends his knowledge of human nature. It equips him for the day and for his task when he enters a profession. Years ago it was my privilege to work as a steward on the Railways. I was young then, and I still think back with great satisfaction to that experience.</p>

<p>It is also of importance to the Administration that employment opportunites are created for students. During the debate it was mentioned that there was a shortage of 8 000 employees in the Railways. In the months of December a peak traffic situation is usually experienced because so many holiday-makers go on journeys, and as a result additional employees are needed. At the end of the year, when permanent members of staff usually want to go on leave, students are there as relief staff. Therefore I ask that the employment section of the Railways plan specially for the vacation employment of students. I know that there were students in the past who joined the Railways under the false pretext of wanting to take up permanent employment with the Railways and who resigned at the end of the vacation. I hope that this dishonest practice has ceased by now.</p>

<p>The Railways will undoubtedly give preference to its own bursary students. The hon. member for Bloemfontein North referred just now to the more than 500 bursary students who were studying in more than 10 directions. I do not know whether those people are bound by a contract to work for the Railways during vacations, but I assume that the Railways must give them preference. In addition to those people there are still others who would like to be employed on the Railways. Recently I saw a student being interviewed on television who said that this was the fourth consecutive year in which he had been employed as a fireman on the Railways.</p>

<p>Problems would undoubtedly arise if the Railways suddenly were to employ hundreds of students. After all, one cannot employ a student as a fireman for two months. What does one do for the rest of the year with the trains upon which such students were employed as firemen&#x003F; However, I do not think that these are problems which the Railways will be unable to solve. It requires planning to accommodate students, but it is not impossible.</p>

<p>In the few minutes which are still available to me, I should like to express my appreciation for what has been done in my constituency. Last year I asked the Railways Administration to do something to replace the steam locomotives in the shunting yards at Bay Head with diesel locomotives. This has been done, and <span class="col_3061-3062" refersTo="page_0213"/>now things are much better. It sounds ungrateful to say thank you and then still have a complaint, but nevertheless I still have a complaint. The complaint is that the person who designed the diesel locomotive&#x2019;s whistle did an extremely thorough job of work. The whistle has a terribly shrill sound which can be heard from very far away. It is a sound which banishes all sleep. If one tries to sleep while that sound can be heard, one fights a losing battle. I was at home for the weekend and my heart bled once again for my voters who are subjected to that noise night after night, not only the noise of the whistle, but also of the shunting yards. In the small hours of the night, I struggled with the question: What is the worst&#x003F; Is it the mosquitoes, the heat or the noise&#x003F; We can solve the problems of the mosquitoes and the heat, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister for the sake of peace of mind of our people, to do something in connection with this terrible noise.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must say that I agree with my hon. colleague, the member for Maitland, that this is a blind budget, and after listening to the hon. members for Bloemfontein North and Port Natal, I also have to agree with the saying that there are none so blind as those who do not want to see&#x2014;especially when listening to Government members who go chasing after railway workers&#x2019; votes, as these two hon. members have done. I must agree with the hon. member for Bloemfontein North there certainly is no crisis in the Railways at the present time. These hon. members are so busy chasing railway workers&#x2019; votes that they are prepared to pass any budget the hon. the Minister puts before the House, regardless of the consequences it could have on South Africa&#x2019;s economy. I would like to ask the hon. member whether he will deny that there is crisis after crisis in thousands of South African homes today as the result of inflation. Will he deny this&#x003F; Will he deny that inflation is the result of this Government&#x2019;s economic policies&#x003F; With regard to capital spending, I would like to tell the hon. member for Port Natal that if the hon. the Minister continues with the tremendous capital expenditure he is presenting to the nation without tightening up on it, South Africa will be faced with a serious crisis as to the availability of capital funds for other aspects of the South African economy. It is for this reason that I concerned myself so far in this debate mainly with the capital budget. We do this as an Opposition to ensure that the funds which are available to the South African economy are spent wisely and economically, especially by Government departments. I sincerely hope the hon. the Minister is not going to be blind to the needs facing South Africa today.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I put certain queries to the hon. the Minister with respect to certain items which appear in the Brown Book. I was terribly disappointed with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s replies to these particular queries. He said, for instance, that the reason for the tremendous increases were that there were no detailed plans available when the original estimates were drawn up. He said that after some of the projects had been commenced, there were changes in design. He went further and said that in the Brown Book there were estimates for certain items for which estimates were drawn up as far back as 1969 and which had not been updated to 1976-&#x2019;77. He used the excuse of inflation and devaluation as reasons why the capital budget has increased to the degree it has. I would like to tell the hon. the Minister that I do not believe that these are real and valid excuses for the tremendous increases which he has presented to us. Surely the Brown Book of the Railways is an extremely important Parliamentary document. Surely its accuracy should be above all doubt. Surely it is imperative that all the estimates shown in the Brown Book are based on sound engineering plans and on sound feasibility studies. Surely there should be detailed costing and estimating based on a cost-benefit ratio. Surely there must be written into the budget realistic inflationary factors. This is what businesses do today in projecting their five-year estimates.</p>

<p>They have compounded inflationary rates which have been taken into their estimates for the future. Surely, the Brown Book of the S. A. Railways should be a document which everybody can take as being entirely accurate in regard to what is facing the nation or the Railways at any particular time. I do not believe that this has been done. The only excuse I shall accept, is the one of devaluation which the hon. the Minister has put forward. This, however, is not his responsibility. It is the responsibility of the hon. the Minister of Finance. He is the one to blame for that.</p>

<p>I believe certain questions have now arisen out of this debate. I feel we should all know <span class="col_3063-3064" refersTo="page_0214"/>what the eventual costs of the projects which are now listed in the Railways&#x2019; Brown Book are going to be. I believe that this budget bears no real accurate figures as to what this eventual cost is going to be. I do not think the hon. the Minister can tell the House what the eventual accurate costs of these particular projects will be. Because of this, he has to be condemned. I am afraid that is the way we on this side of the House feel. The evidence of this debate has clearly revealed that there are weaknesses in his Administration with respect to the budgeting on capital works depicted in the Brown Book. I do not believe the hon. the Minister can be excused for this. After all, he is the managing director of the Railways&#x2014;he said so&#x2014;and he also has three highly paid commissioners who are his directors. They are the ones who should be blamed for this.</p>

<p>I should briefly like to mention something about containerization. I want to quote from a speech which was made at the Assocom congress last year in Margate. It was made by a member of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce, who asked the following question with respect to containerization&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Can South Africa afford the enormous outlay over a brief period of years such as will be required for the implementation of the programme&#x003F;</block>

<p>He went on to say that the first estimates were that this programme was going to cost R2 billion. Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With inflation and with other alterations to the scheme, as the estimates now stand, within five years this cost will have risen to R3,5 billion. This is a tremendous amount of money.</block>

<p>I should like to quote a further passage from his speech where he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prudence on the part of the Government in their husbandry of the country&#x2019;s resources would seem to us to indicate that a more cautious approach should be adopted. Experience elsewhere in the world shows that containerization cannot possibly be justified, having in mind the enormous burden of capital expense with which the country will be saddled and for which the trading community and ultimately the public will have to pay.</block>

<p>He goes on to say that the results of this project on which the Government is working will cause an increase of 50% in the freight rates of shipping between the Continent and South Africa. He also says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This enormous freight hike will, in itself, create an inflationary situation.</block>

<p>The main theme of this debate has been the effort to fight inflation and the Government&#x2019;s tremendous campaign to fight inflation. I put forward these quotes from this gentleman&#x2019;s speech for the heeding, I hope, of the Government. I hope the hon. Minister is going to heed these warnings which have been stated by people in the commercial sector. To back this up, I should like to refer to a number of items in the Brown Book. There are five items, namely 489, 527, 557, 624 and 565, which all have something to do with container traffic facilities. The original estimate was R41 million. In this Brown Book they are asking or a further R51 million. I appreciate the fact that some of their original estimates were provisional estimates. I believe this bears out what I have already said. How much is this project going to cost South Africa in the long term&#x003F; I should once again like to ask the hon. the Minister: How do these present figures compare with those which were originally drawn up when this project was originally conceived&#x003F; I should like to know what the final figure is going to be. Because I like to think that the hon. the Minister is a responsible Minister of this Government, I should like to appeal to him to institute or have instituted a thorough examination of the total capital expenditure programme of the S.A. Railways. I should like to ask him to up-date, for us in the official Opposition, all the estimates which are now appearing in this Brown Book, so that we will be able to see a more accurate estimate next year of what these projects are going to cost the South African taxpayer and the South African economy. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will give us more details in this particular regard next year. In conclusion, I should like to say that we in these benches are going to watch next year&#x2019;s Brown Book very closely and we sincerely hope that we are going to see a vast improvement in the figures.</p>

<from><span class="col_3065-3066" refersTo="page_0215"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to complain about the fact that the hon. member for Orange Grove did not use his time to the full, because that now enables me to bring a little matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The hon. member referred to the trains which in 1938 took 22 minutes to reach a certain place, while today they take 29 minutes to do so, but this is unfortunately not the whole story. If the hon. member&#x2019;s research department had done their work, they would have noted that a few stations have been added in the meantime, in other words, that there are now a few more stops on the route than there were in 1938.</p>

<p>It is very interesting that the hon. member for Amanzimtoti came here to complain today about the enormous increase in capital costs but we do not get an indication of where capital expenditure should in fact be reduced. To be practical about this matter, we should say that the only effect which capital works have on the budget, is the burden of interest charges which they entail. If the hon. member were to investigate the rise in the burden of interest of which the Railways during the past number of years compared to its increased revenue then he would have to concede that the rise in costs was completely in proportion to the increase in revenue.</p>

<p>There is one idea I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister at this late hour, because this is a matter which has for many years earned the attention of the average railwayman and which has remained an enormous need as far as the average railwayman is concerned. On occasion I have described the Railway Sick Fund as probably being one of the best in the world, but nevertheless the lack of a free choice of doctor or specialist has all the years been a very thorny matter to the average railway worker. The Conradie Committee, who investigated this entire matter, made three basic recommendations in this connection. In the first instance it was recommended that the basis upon which contributions to this fund are made, should be changed. Secondly it was recommended that the proposed improved provident scheme should fundamentally comprise the same elements as those of a medical aid scheme, except that free choice of doctor or specialist is excluded from it. Thirdly, they recommend that the establishment of a medical aid scheme should in due course be proceeded with.</p>

<p>The first two recommendations of this committee were accepted and they are already being implemented, but the third recommendation, namely, the establishment of a medical aid scheme in the true sense is still being withheld. Talks on it may be reopened on the initiative of the Management or the staff. The advantages obtained under the improved aid scheme, are basically the same as those under a medical aid scheme, except as regards the restriction which I mentioned, i.e. the free choice of doctors. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what the real factor is which prevents the establishment of a full-fledged medical scheme being proceeded with. What influences the choice at this stage&#x003F; Is it the fact that the Management is not yet in favour of this or is it that the staff association, for specific reasons, are not in favour of it&#x003F; I believe that an additional payment of 20% is an inherent feature in most medical aid schemes while the improved aid scheme is basically insurance-orientated, in other words that at this stage a 100% cost cover still exists if the additional payment of R1 in respect of prescriptions for medicine which contributors have to make, is not taken into account. If this 20% additional payment were to be a requirement for a change-over to a full-fledged medical aid scheme with such a free choice, then one could accept that there might be hesitation on the part of a large section of the staff because they would think that this additional payment will in fact cause inconvenience under certain circumstances. For that reason I should like to ask the hon. Minister today whether it is not possible for the Management to go into this matter and whether it is not possible for an effort to be made to find methods by which servants who could be adversely affected by the additional payment of 20%, to be assisted. One feels in any case that railway pensioners ought not to make a higher additional payment than 10%. I want to ask whether a special auxiliary fund could not perhaps be created for this purpose or that the existing Railways Auxiliary Fund could be utilized for this purpose so that people who find themselves in a situation where they have to pay enormously high medical expenses, could raise a loan from it at a low interest rate or free of interest. Another possibility is that, where the case is a <span class="col_3067-3068" refersTo="page_0216"/>particularly deserving one a grant should be made from the auxiliary fund in an effort to cover the additional payment of 20%. If I am today advocating things which are already receiving attention, I should be very grateful if the hon. the Minister would inform us about this, because the ordinary public are profoundly ignorant of this entire matter. I should be particularly grateful if the hon. the Minister would indicate whether that which the railway workers have been looking forward to for so long, namely the arrival of the day when they would have a free choice of doctors and specialists, is not too distant.</p>

<p>While there is much unanimity with the other side of the House, I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the hon. the Minister. I hope the unanimity still exists. I should like to thank him for the many opportunities he grants the Railways group on this side of the House to bring certain needs to his attention from time to time. There is also the particular opportunity which he grants us to discuss the situation of the Railway pensioners in depth with him from time to time. Unfortunately the Opposition tried to make a political lollipop of these people&#x2019;s need in this House. I think the hon. member for Maitland tried to act reasonably, although I would still like to address a remark at him. The hon. member for Durban Point, in particular, came riding up like a knight of old and tried to create the image among the public that he was the only person who was fighting for these people; that he was up against a brick wall, a heartless National Party Government and a Nationalist Minister who refused to give way. He wanted to create the impression that he was the only man who was pleading for the needs of the pensioners. It would be closer to the truth to say that the hon. member is a Sancho Panza on a very wretched political donkey when he raises this matter. We have the opportunity to discuss this in depth from time to time and I know that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s door will not be closed to us in future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland came forward today with a very sound idea which at first sight has much merit and which rouses a great deal of sympathy in one. I grant him the sympathy he will be receiving through it, because he needs this very much from time to time. He said that if the hon. the Minister should wish to effect an equalization of pensions, even if it were to cost R20 million, the hon. the Minister could feel himself entirely at liberty to come to this House, and that he would be the first man to vote for this, even if it gave rise to increased rates. This would have been a beautiful thought had one not known what the hon. member had advocated earlier on in the week and had one not read the record that he was one of the greatest advocates of the Railways not paying for uneconomical services and not being held responsible for socio-economic services. I do not know how the hon. member wishes to collect the R20 million by way of increased rates without abandoning the principle which he advocated. It is too easy to advance such minor arguments in order to score a political point off someone, but in practice it simply does not work this way. As far as we are concerned, the debate has reached its end and we thank you once again.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to reply to the Third Reading debate. Firstly I want to begin with the hon. member for Maitland, who introduced the debate. He spoke about inflation, and said that I was entirely indifferent. I had allegedly said that inflation was not being stimulated. Those things are not true, because I accept co-responsibility for inflation and the combating of inflation together with the other members of the Cabinet. We are as much in earnest about this matter as he or any other person. Besides, I never on any occasion said that this Budget and the rates increases would not be conducive to inflation. It is indeed the case to a greater or lesser extent, and that is where the difference lies. It is true that we regret having had to increase our rates, but hon. members know that I did not really have any choice. Circumstances and the increased expenditure compelled me to increase the rates. At least that is as I see it and as I am <span class="col_3069-3070" refersTo="page_0217"/>doing this in the best interests of the S.A. Railways.</p>

<p>As far as inflation is concerned, there is one aspect which I am very concerned about. It is the allegations which were made here in this House and blazoned abroad, but which are not correct. Perhaps the allegations were made entirely in good faith, but they leave the general public with an impression which is so wrong. I am referring in particular to the hon. member for Durban Point. He said in this House that the increased rates on livestock would inevitably cause meat prices to rise. Secondly, he alleged that the increase in the meat price could be as much as 10 to 15 cents per kg. The hon. member is shaking his head, but he did say so. What worries me is that the newspaper published the hon. member&#x2019;s allegations. Not only did the newspapers publish the allegations, but the radio and television services also reported the hon. member as having said so. One wonders how and when such allegations are refuted among the people outside. I obtained information from a leading cattle farmer. This specific farmer is 400 km from the market. Up to now it has cost him R16 a head to get his cattle to the market. The new rates will increase his costs to R24 per animal. After the animals have been slaughtered, each carcase has an average weight of 250 kg. If one were now to make a distribution,&#x2019; it means that the additional costs&#x2014;and I am making this calculation on the assumption that the extra costs will be passed on to the consumer&#x2014;of R8 per animal over 400 km will amount to 3,2 cents per kg if the weight of the animal is divided into this. If one were to make provision for the bones, and so on, the calculation would amount to a maximum of 4c per kg.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That is precisely what I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member &#x2026; [Interjections.] In the first place I am saying that if the increased rates are passed on to the consumer&#x2014;this is a point which one could argue, yet it is something which is very unlikely&#x2014;it would amount to a maximum of 4 cents per kg. That is what the increase would have amounted to.</p>

<p>In the meantime the hon. member has announced to all and sundry over the radio and television&#x2014;he appeared on television but unfortunately I was not watching at the time&#x2014;that the increase would mean an increase in price of 10 to 15 cents per kg. I should therefore be very pleased if the communication media&#x2014;the Press, television and the radio&#x2014;could rectify these matters. I hope they find it possible to do so, for it is not in anyone&#x2019;s interests that such allegations should be made without being rectified.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the 4 cents is not merely the increase in price at the abattoirs, before the meat is sold therefore.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am saying that it is not the case, for I have already made provision for the bones. The price was 3,2 cents on the hook. I made provision for the bones and this brought me up to 4 cents. I have therefore made provision for this already, but the hon. member still wants to give the butcher a profit as well. With the butcher&#x2019;s profit already included, it only amounts to 4 cents. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, my time is limited, and there are a few other matters I should like to dispose of.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with the hon. member for Maitland at all when he argues that we should reduce our percentage depreciation even further. What this amounts to, in other words, is that we should make it even lower. Surely this is the case, for depreciation is an expense. It is contained on the expenditure side, and the depreciation makes provision for the Renewals Fund. However, the hon. member went on to say that we should not have made as much money available as we are in fact making available in the Renewals Fund. I cannot agree with the hon. member. We must maintain a relationship between the money which we make available from our own funds for capital purposes and money which we have to borrow on the loan market.</p>

<p>What were the accusations then&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member then said that the little nest-egg of R20 million which I have in the Rates Equalization Fund should also have been thrown in. In other words, if anything goes wrong this year, I would have nothing at all, no nest-egg left.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Then you simply increase the rates again!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then I would have no nest-egg left, and then I close the year with a loss which I would not have been able to repay from any source. Therefore I cannot agree with the hon. member on this point at all. The hon. member for Maitland argued further that I had not yet replied as far as the amounts were concerned. I shall now furnish him with the amounts. According to the calculations which have been made we are making provision here for wages and salaries etc., to a total amount of R998 million. This is more than the R931 million which appears in the White Book, under the heading: Summary of Staff. The pension and sick fund contributions by the Administration and the R20 million for work revaluation have not yet been included in the R931 million. In other words, the total amount which we are providing for wages and salaries this year is R998 million. I want to break it down as follows: Salaries and wages, R810 million; bonuses R11 million; vacation bonuses, R21 million; other allowances, R7 million; and overtime and Sunday time, R146 million. This is the total amount for which we are making provision. This year our expenditure in respect of those various items is R884 million. This is according to calculations up to the end of this financial year. The difference between the two is R114 million. If you now deduct from that R114 million, firstly the amount of R20 million for which we are making provision for the work revaluation of non-Whites, then there is a balance of R94 million.</p>

<p>If one takes into account that we expect an increase of 5,5% in respect of goods traffic and one makes provision for that in this year&#x2019;s expenditure on wages and salaries, then one still has to deduct a further R50 million. [Interjections.] Of course, yes, for there is after all an increase in the amount of traffic. We are making provision for increased goods traffic of 5,5%, and that is why we have additional expenditure. Surely we cannot have more traffic while the expenditure remains the same. This leaves an amount of R44 million from which provision has been made for particular projects, <i>inter alia</i> the Ermelo-Richards Bay line on which we expect to convey 9 million tons of coal in the coming financial year. It also makes provision for the rationalization about which we had so much to say here. All those extra things have to come out of the remaining R44 million. I think this gives the hon. member a better picture of the entire matter. The hon. member also discussed pensions. He referred to social pensions and said that a social pension amounted to R128 per month today for a husband and wife. Do you know what it was during the time of the United Party&#x003F; It was R20. Social pensions have therefore increased by more than 600%.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to container wagons and steel. In reply to that I just want to tell him that Iscor imports the steel according to a pool system. The Railways does not import steel. These wagons are built for us by Dorman Long according to tender. I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate any further on this.</p>

<p>I am very aware of the interest of the hon. member for Bloemfontein North in Railway matters and particularly in the railway worker.</p>

<p>As it happened, he also discussed pension matters, about which I shall say a few words in a moment. The hon. member for Orange Grove discussed salary increases &#x2026; I stated explicitly here that if salary increases are granted, rates increases must also be expected. In any case, surely the hon. member will not say that he does not want to see salary increases being granted, for the staff last received a salary increase on 1 June 1974. But he tells me that I should not increase the rates. Where on earth must I now find the money to pay increased salaries if I may not increase the rates&#x2014;only a Prog will know. No other person in his right mind would be able to make such a <span class="col_3073-3074" refersTo="page_0219"/>calculation. The hon. member also referred to underground railway lines. I just want to tell him that we are still in the process of implementing the Driessen Report. A metropolitan advisory committee will be established for each metropolitan area, and as a result of that recommendations will be made. The Railways will always be prepared to work in close co-operation with the various bodies, as it is in fact already doing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal discussed the students in particular. He is aware of the situation: as he himself said, he was a waiter on the Railways in his student days. We employ students, as frequently as we can and wherever it is necessary, to do that kind of work. We employ them as waiters, stokers, checkers, etc., and we shall continue to do so. The hon. member referred to the horns of the diesel locomotives. The hon. member for Walmer also referred to them yesterday. The hon. members for Port Elizabeth are also aware of this problem for it is in fact a problem. Recently we went so far as to refer the entire matter to my legal division, and asked them whether we should not rather place the responsibility on the road-user, even though this would mean that statutory provisions would have to be changed so that the Railways have the right of way at level crossings. In other words, it should not be the responsibility of the Railways if an accident occurs; it should be the responsibility of the road-user. Then we would be able to eliminate this use of horns completely. An exhaustive study was made of this matter, and my law advisers made a recommendation to me. We concluded that the risk was too great. In other words, we feel that we shall have to continue sounding these horns.</p>

<p>However, we shall give further attention to the matter to see whether we cannot soften the shrill sound of the horn, which is such a nuisance. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Amanzimtoti discussed capital expenditure. I shall shortly deal with that in general, but first I just want to refer in particular to what he said about containerization. This is a matter which is being passed on to us and we simply have to keep pace with it, otherwise we will lag behind strategically. Containerization is being applied everywhere in the world today and whether we like it or not, we have to adapt to it. It is costing us an enormous amount of money, but do not think we can afford to lag behind.</p>

<p>What happened in Australia&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter what happened there. Nor do I know what reply the hon. member wants. In our own interests, however, we simply have to do what we find ourselves called upon to do.</p>

<p>In the time I still have at my disposal I should like to make a few observations by way of summary. In my opening speech I said that our revenue had been as we had expected, but that our expenditure had increased very considerably. The fact that our revenue had been what we had expected, is an indication that we had been reasonably active and that the demand for services was there. In spite of the so-called levelling off in the economy, or the slump to which such frequent reference has been made here, the amount of traffic which the Railways had to handle increased. Ton/kilometres in fact increased, and we expect a further increase in this respect. Another interesting feature of this Budget&#x2014; and here I should like to refresh hon. members&#x2019; memories a little&#x2014;is that there were no complaints about the handling of traffic by the Railways. The only thing which in any way resembled a complaint was the hon. member for Walmer&#x2019;s reference to the late departure of aircraft. Apart from that there were no complaints about the Railways. One heard no complaints concerning the conveyance of coal, and we were also able to convey the maize in the way my friend, the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, wanted. We also conveyed timber and fruit, and in spite of the disruptions in many spheres as a result of washaways&#x2014;almost every day I find reports on my table of washaways in various places&#x2014; there were in fact no complaints in this Parliament about the service the Railways have recently been rendering.</p>

<p>Today we are geared to mass exports as never before. But this requires <span class="col_3075-3076" refersTo="page_0220"/>a tremendous amount of capital. I am thinking for example of Richards Bay and the construction of the central yard between Johannesburg and Pretoria. I am also thinking of the fact that we speeded up the electrification programme&#x2014;as hon. members can recall&#x2014;as a result of the fuel crisis. This required additional capital. Major projects of this kind really do require major capital expenditure.</p>

<p>I now want to consider the various services, and first of all I want to consider the services per rail. I should like hon. members to take into consideration that besides our own increase in traffic, we also have to make provision for the circumstances which are, as it were, being forced upon us now by the closing of the border between Mozambique and Rhodesia. Hon. members opposite signified their assent to our handling the traffic as far as it is in any way possible, and we shall do so. I have also stated that we shall try our best to do so. This does not apply only to Rhodesia, but also to other countries in Southern Africa such as Za&#x00EF;re and Zambia, for whom we should like to handle traffic if they wish us to do so. However, these things cannot be done without our making the necessary provision for them. These are all things which result in heavier pressure on the Railways. Nevertheless we received no complaints during the course of the debate.</p>

<p>If one considers the Airways, one finds that the addition of the aircraft which have now been purchased will make the S.A. Airways one of the most modern airlines in the world. There will be ample provision for overseas and internal services, and this will improve our image in the world. What is more, it is also a very valuable earner of foreign exchange for South Africa. We expect that the irritations that have recently occurred will soon be eliminated. The booking system will also be improved.</p>

<p>As far as our harbours are concerned, I can say by way of summary that we had many complaints and difficulties last year, but that this is no longer the case. In the Durban harbour things are functioning normally and in the Cape Town harbour there is capacity. I heard nothing about the fruit traffic through Cape Town and consequently I take it that things are going well. There is no problem. Richards Bay will give us a new harbour and, as the hon. member for Simonstown rightly commented, this is the first new harbour we are building since Union. As I have said, this will afford us sufficient harbour facilities for many years.</p>

<p>Iscor looks after their part, and I shall look after the rest.</p>

<p>As far as the pipelines are concerned, we are working on a new pipeline which will convey white products and which will meet our needs for many years. This is the picture as far as it affects the various services of the Railways. I am pleased to be able to say that there were no complaints here, and this is how we would like it to be. We do not want there to be any complaints in Parliament about a shortage here, a bottleneck there and a difficulty elsewhere. We should like to keep things like this, and that is why we are making the necessary provision.</p>

<p>As far as the staff is concerned, all signs indicate clearly that we will have to specialize to an increasing extent. Important work on the Railways is being entrusted to specialists&#x2014; especially trained men&#x2014;while the less important work on a lower level is being left to the available labour. In this way we are managing with fewer highly trained and scarce members <span class="col_3077-3078" refersTo="page_0221"/>of staff. The highly trained staff is our scarce staff. It goes without saying that we will employ increasing numbers of non-Whites, as we have been doing in negotiation with the various staff associations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Tygervallei put certain questions to me in regard to the Sick Fund. I should like to furnish him with the following information: Arising out of representations made during 1972 by the Federal Consultive Council of S.A.R. and H. Staff Associations a committee was established to inquire into the Sick Fund. Three fundamental aspects are covered by the recommendations of the Sick Fund Committee, namely (1) the alteration of the basis in terms of which contributions are calculated; (2) the introduction of an improved provident scheme; and (3) the introduction of an auxiliary scheme. Aspects Nos. (1) and (2) were accepted and put into operation with effect from 1 April 1975. As from this date Railway servants have been receiving improved benefits in respect of dental services, maternity benefits and opthalmic services. The scheme also entailed, <i>inter alia,</i> that panels of Railway doctors are as far as possible being limited to 1 500 beneficiaries, in order to offer a wider choice of doctor. The contribution scales of members were at the same time raised by approximately 25,6%, and the levy per prescription was raised from R0,50 to R1. As far as the aspect to which the hon. member made particular reference is concerned, namely aspect No. (3), I can point out that the Federal Consultive Council was not prepared to commit itself at that stage to the question of the introduction of an auxiliary scheme. However, it was decided that depending on future developments, negotiations on this aspect could take place between the Administration, the Sick Fund Committee and the Federal Consultive Council, at the request of any of the abovementioned bodies. This is the position in respect of the Sick Fund.</p>

<p>I said a moment ago that one could discuss the matter of pensions at great length. However, hon. members must remember that our officials who are pensioners are linked to certain pension schemes. Over and above the pension, anything contributed by the Railways is on a par with social welfare work; in other words, it has not been earned. This is an aspect which is very important and should be borne in mind. The question which arises is whether those additional services are the responsibility of the S.A. Railways. It is correct, as the hon. member for Tygervallei said, that the transportation group of our party has on several occasions already had discussions on pensions, and in addition there are the representations we receive from time to time from pensioners. However, I want to emphasize once again that as far as pensions are concerned, we cannot deal with them in conjunction with an ordinary Budget. It is traditionally the case that pensions are considered when consideration is given to salary increases. Therefore it is possible for attention to be given to pensions at a later stage.</p>

<p>I should like to express a few thoughts on the provision of capital. In this House emphasis has been placed on the positive aspect of our provision of capital, but unfortunately, too, on the negative aspects, for suspicion has been cast on the capital estimates, as the hon. member for Amanzimtoti did. It was stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that the provision of capital is not making the necessary contribution to the welfare of the country, that too much is being provided&#x2014;I think this is the important aspect&#x2014;and that it is inflationary. Let us first consider what the function of our capital estimates is. In the first place its function is to replace obsolete assets. By this I do not mean only obsolete in the sense that they have become worn out, but also assets which have to be replaced for economic and technological reasons. The emphasis lies particular on &#x201C;technological&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In the second place it has the function of meeting the growing need for transportation. In the third place it has the function of enhancing productivity. These are three important considerations as to why such provision has to be made. Naturally we have problems in obtaining capital, for capital is not very readily available. Therefore it is necessary for us to consider our list of priorities. There are hon. members, however, who doubted whether we had in fact drawn up a list of priorities. Recently, in December, when we considered our capital estimates, we drew up our list of priorities and considered what was last on the list. We then cut down on our expenditure in respect of Richards Bay by R1,5 million; we cut down on the expenditure in respect of vehicles for the road transportation service by R3 million; we cut down on our expenditure in respect of containerization by R4 million; and <span class="col_3079-3080" refersTo="page_0222"/>we cut down on our expenditure in respect of rolling stock by R13 million. The items on which we were unable to cut down were for example the Nyanga/Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain railway line which was the penultimate item on the list of priorities. We felt that we were just not able to cut down on that. Another item which was also low down on the list was the quadrupling of the Hercules/Winternest line, and also the railway line from Mabopane via Belle Ombre to Pretoria, both items requiring large amounts. We considered cutting down on those items, but concluded that we were just not able to do so because they were too important. The next one we considered was the Thabazimbi/Ellisras railway line. This is the new line which has to be constructed for Iscor. Owing to the requirements of Iscor we decided that we were unable to cut down on this. Consequently we eventually decided on these cut-backs which I indicated here. I am mentioning this for the sole reason of giving the hon. members an indication of how carefully we consider cut-backs on our capital expenditure, particularly this year. However, we do not want to place ourselves in a position where we are going to cause ourselves future bottlenecks, which will cause the costs to rise.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The General Manager of the Railways is a member of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council, and naturally there is therefore a close connection.</p>

<p>I think I should conclude now. What I still want to say is just that the Railways have over the years succeeded in increasing its productivity. Over the past ten years the productivity index of the Railways has risen by 20,4%, or 2,1 % per annum. The expert calculations which have been made for me indicate that in respect of capacity on the Railways we have a margin of only 5%. I think that hon. members will agree with me that this is not a very wide margin, and that it was therefore necessary for us to make provision in the capital account for the possible bottlenecks which could arise.</p>

<p>Finally I want to point out that the Railways is these days more than just a transport organization. The Railways is today, in Southern Africa, playing a role as far as the relations between various countries are concerned, as we have already indicated. The Railways is making a valuable contribution in the sphere of d&#x00E9;tente and better relations between our country and our neighbouring states. Hon. members are aware of what we intend doing for Rhodesia and of the co-operation which we have from Mozambique to convey our goods. Hon. members are aware that we may perhaps have to help Zambia and Zaire with their transportation. Owing to those circumstances, as were also pointed out by the hon. member for Bethlehem, the Railways is, with its activities, playing a very important strategic role. Hon. members may rest assured that the Railways will continue with its activities to the best advantage of our people and our country and its interests.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In terms of the provisions of section 23 of the National Road Safety Act, the National Road Safety Council is required to submit to the Minister a report on its activities together with its audited financial statements at the end of each financial year. Such financial year extends of course from 1 April to 31 March of each year. In terms of the relevant section the <span class="col_3081-3082" refersTo="page_0223"/>Minister is also required, as is the practice, to table the reports in this House and in the Other Place.</p>

<p>Owing to the statutory requirement that only audited financial statements may be tabled, practical problems are being experienced in having the documents ready shortly after the close of a financial year.</p>

<p>In order therefore to obviate that the reports on the activities of the Council are already a year old at the time of their tabling, and in order to afford hon. members here and in the Other Place, as well as the public, an opportunity of taking cognizance at the earliest possible stage of the activities of the Road Safety Council, I consider it necessary to request approval for the amendments contained in this Bill, i.e. to provide that the report year on the activities of the council and the financial year in regard to financial matters shall not extend over the same period.</p>

<p>Hon. members will agree with me that road safety is a social matter which concerns all levels of the community and it is therefore necessary that all of us have an opportunity to scrutinize the activities of the Road Safety Council and take cognizance of what has been done and what is still being envisaged as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As far as clause 1(2) is concerned, I may explain that the report year for 1974-&#x2019;75 under the existing Act extends from 1 April 1974 to 31 March 1975, and contains an audited balance sheet as well as a detailed statement of revenue and expenditure for the same period. This report will be tabled in both Houses of Parliament in the course of the next few days. For the period 1 April 1975 to 31 December 1975, however, it is not practicable to prepare a separate report and to incur printing costs in this connection, and consequently the Government Law Advisers have recommended that the period of 21 months from 1 April 1975 to 31 December 1976 be deemed to be a period of a year.</p>

<p>That, Mr. Speaker, is briefly what is being envisaged with the proposed amendments.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. the Minister has explained to this House, the underlying purpose of the Bill which is before the House is to separate the financial year and the report year of the council, which in practice will mean publishing two reports, as it were. As far as the activities of the council are concerned, I think that it is essential that a report on the council&#x2019;s activities be made available to the House as soon as possible. It deals with a matter which is of the greatest importance to South Africa. Perhaps I should mention here that one has some doubt as to the success of the council&#x2019;s operations if one considers the fact that we have just as high an accident rate on our roads today as we had a few years ago. This is a matter which must very definitely receive the attention of this council as soon as possible towards the end of the year.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. the Minister is very wise to come to this House with a proposal which means that we shall have the report on the activities of the council available to us early in the session so that the matter may be considered. So the practical effect of the proposal is, for the sake of argument, that if we were to receive the report on the activities up to 31 December of the previous year, while the financial statement which accompanies it will cover the period up to 31 March of the previous year. Mr. Speaker, under the circumstances we have no objection to this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now come to the end of a series of Bills having <span class="col_3083-3084" refersTo="page_0224"/>passed through this House, a series of Bills which have as their object the protection of nurserymen, of plant breeders, and assistance to the industry in the propagation of plants and plant species, this I believe will be to the benefit of the country as a whole. These Bills, and the one we are now dealing with in particular, are most important to agriculture. It is important that we should have proper stock and healthy stock to produce food for our people in this country. It is also of importance to every householder who has a love for the soil, as most South Africans do, and who has a little garden and wishes to produce either flowers or vegetables. Whatever it is that they produce in that garden, this Bill is of importance to those people as well. I believe that from these Bills we are going to derive tremendous benefit for the country as a whole. In the Committee Stage we did move certain amendments and I wish to commend these amendments to the attention of the hon. the Minister. They were handled by his Deputy during that stage of the debate. I wish to reiterate that we believe that these amendments are important, particularly the amendment to clause 22, to protect these seedsmen and nurserymen themselves when an inspector comes; also the amendment which we moved in clause 37 to restore to the courts the discretion which this clause appears to remove from the courts in deciding whether or not an employer or a principal was part of an offence committed by his employee.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister did give an undertaking that he would have another look at these two amendments, with the possibility of amending the Bill in the Other Place. I would sincerely commend to the hon. the Minister that he should do this in the best interests of what, I wish to repeat, is a series of Bills which can only work to the benefit of the industry in this country. We wish all nurserymen and seedsmen well and we wish the department well in the administration of these measures which can work to the benefit of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that the hon. member on the Opposition side adopted the attitude he did towards the Bill. I am very glad that they do not oppose the Bill. I had the opportunity a few days ago of conversing with one of our most foremost researchers and nurserymen at one of our research institutes. I was greatly impressed once again by the fact that plant improvement is making excellent progress. In spite of the fact that there is a dire shortage of researchers and experts at our research stations, things are going very well. At the moment, sixty new peach cultivars have already been developed. They have not been released yet, but they vie with each other in excellence. In addition, there are 20 new table grape cultivars, all of an equally high standard, of which at least six qualify to be included on the export list. We have come to a stage now where we can select the best from the best. We are very proud of that achievement. At the same time, the Plant Improvement Organization is also making use of the best material which is available overseas. At the moment, Prof. Strydom of the University of Stellenbosch is evaluating cultivars in America for South African conditions. He is returning at the end of March and we are looking forward with interest to what he will have to report on his return. The idea is to evaluate imported cultivars before they enter South Africa, to ensure that no undesirable cultivars enter which have to be evaluated at a high cost here just to find that they are useless.</p>

<p>For this reason cultivars are now evaluated overseas according to the information available, and when they have been accepted and imported, they are further evaluated here. So you can see what we are aiming at, and this process has already gained momentum. We should like to see plant improvement protected, and I am glad that we have reached this stage with the Bill. I pointed out in a previous speech that the societies concerned had had discussions with the department on behalf of the S.A. Nurserymen&#x2019;s Association and the Association of Seed Dealers, and that they had all approved of the Bill in its present form. As the hon. previous speaker said, the Opposition had problems with a few of the clauses in the Bill during the Committee Stage. I want to agree with them that there are clauses which are very drastic and which seem at first sight to lay down excessively high requirements. The hon. member for East London City said that I would have to account for my attitude to my association. I want to tell the hon. member that I speak on behalf of my association, too, in adopting the standpoint that I do. Precisely because my association places a very high premium on the integrity of its members, we <span class="col_3085-3086" refersTo="page_0225"/>are prepared to support stringent measures such as this one. I should like to refer to clause 37 again. The hon. members had problems with it and I agree that it is an onerous clause, but can the requirements we lay down for an employer ever be too high&#x003F; Is it asking too much to expect of him to ensure that the other person&#x2019;s interests are protected&#x003F; If I walk into a shop and I buy a penknife, then I see what I buy. If I walk into a nursery and buy a 1 000 peach trees, from which I intend to make a living, at the same time fitting into a broader economic set-up, three or four years pass before I see what I have bought. For this reason we must provide in our legislation for the protection of the producer. This clause will mean that employers will have to exercise strict control, and only strict control will enable us to have success in plant improvement. Only by means of strict control can the best interests of the fruit industry in South Africa be served.</p>

<p>Consequently it is a very great privilege to me to support the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the two proposals made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South will be considered. The hon. member may take it that clause 22, as proposed by him, will be accepted in the Other Place; it will be amended in accordance with his proposal. As far as clause 37 is concerned, there are certain technical problems, as the hon. member for Middelburg has indicated. If one sells a person a yellow cling peach tree and he finds after three years that it is an Early Dawn peach of which he has planted a 1 000 or 2 000 trees, there will be trouble. This is something we have to investigate. I should like to tell the hon. member that we are considering how we may accommodate his proposals. The hon. member for Middelburg is the chairman of the Nurserymen&#x2019;s Association, and what he says is quite right. I opened the congress of his association and I saw there that they welcomed this legislation. It does not only protect the producer of good plant material, but the buyers, the public, as well. I want to thank the hon. member for his positive contribution.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The provision of and control over slaughtering facilities was the subject of an investigation by a commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of Dr. F. J. de Villiers during the early sixties. The findings of this commission of inquiry led to the passing, in 1967, of the Abattoir Commission Act. In terms of this Act, an independent body of experts, known as the Abattoir Commission, was established to deal with and exercise control over the abattoir industry, in accordance with a policy determined by the Minister of Agriculture. Under the guidance of this commission, considerable progress has been made over the past decade in creating and modernizing slaughtering facilities to comply with present and future requirements.</p>

<p>However, in recent years there has been a development in the abattoir industry which was not foreseen at the time. Owing in particular to the high cost of providing modern slaughtering facilities, local authorities, who have traditionally provided these services, have increasingly indicated that they are no longer interested in the provision of slaughtering facilities. Although the above-mentioned Act explicitly provided for the taking over of abattoirs by the Abattoir Commission, the intention at the time was that this should serve as a last resort, for preventing the closure of essential public abattoirs, for example, if no one else could be found to manage them. The exception became the rule, and the commission was forced, in the public interest, to take over from local authorities several abattoirs, such as those at Pretoria, Benoni, Springs, Germiston, Durban, Pietermaritzburg and Johannesburg (Newton and Wynberg). However, some of these abattoirs are so obsolete that they are no longer serviceable, and the Abattoir Commission is presently undertaking the erection of new abattoirs for Johannesburg at City Deep and for the Durban/Pieter-maritzburg complex at Cato Ridge.</p>

<p>The result of this development is that the primary function of the Abattoir Commission <span class="col_3087-3088" refersTo="page_0226"/>i.e. to serve as an independent body for controlling and rationalizing the abattoir industry, is being frustrated by its own subjective involvement in the industry. This is creating an embarrassing situation for the commission, particularly when, as the controlling body, it has to determine its own tariff and those of rival abattoirs, for example. As one can understand, the present arrangements are resulting in a conflict of interests for the commission, which is undermining confidence&#x2014;especially on the part of the producers&#x2014;in the control exercised over abattoirs by the authorities.</p>

<p>The intention is now to rectify this problem by reorganizing the functions of the Abattoir Commission in the manner set out in the Bill. It is felt that the commission should rather be converted into a State corporation operating on business principles and that it should in future concern itself exclusively with the management and conduct of abattoirs. Consequently the Bill provides in the first place for a South African Abattoir Corporation which will be the legal successor of the commission as far as its assets, liabilities, rights and obligations are concerned. The corporation will also take over the commission&#x2019;s staff.</p>

<p>The object of the corporation will be to acquire or erect abattoirs in the public interest and to conduct and manage such abattoirs on a utility basis and in an economic, orderly and effective manner. The intention is to subject the acquisition and erection of abattoirs to strict ministerial control, and to do the same in respect of the abattoir tariffs, which will be the corporation&#x2019;s only source of operating capital. As far as the administration is concerned, the corporation will be as free as possible of external control and will consequently have to operate on a business foundation within limits set by the moderate tariffs. The administration of the corporation will be in the hands of a direction of five members appointed by the Minister, one of whom must be a representative of the Meat Board, and another the representative of the new Abattoir Commission whose function I shall now explain.</p>

<p>As regards the functions of control exercised by the commission, it is proposed that they be vested in the Minister of Agriculture, in accordance with the arrangements already applicable in respect of fresh produce markets. The intention is that the Minister will be assisted in the performance of these functions by an expert advisory body which will not be a juristic person, but will have to fit into the existing sphere of administration of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. This advisory body will be known as the Abattoir Commission and will consist of three to five members who will be appointed by virtue of their expert knowledge concerning the meat and abattoir industries. In order to avoid duplication, the Bill provides for the Meat Board and the proposed corporation to perform certain auxiliary functions for the new Abattoir Commission, such as the provision of technical advice, the conducting of cost investigations at abattoirs, etc., which will make the employment of additional specialized staff by the department unnecessary.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made in drawing up the Bill to simplify control by the Minister and the new Abattoir Commission as far as possible. It is proposed, <i>inter alia</i> that the present system of registration of abattoirs be replaced by a simpler system of operating control over abattoirs. Furthermore, smaller abattoirs are completely exempted from control. In addition, control will be concentrated on certain controlled areas, while outside these areas it will be exercised only in a general sense.</p>

<p>The existing slaughter levy is not being abolished. The intention is to continue the levy and to pay the money into a special account controlled by the Minister. The money in the account will be available for direct utilization on behalf of the abattoir industry, for matters such as rationalization.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to point out that all interested parties were consulted in drawing up the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has explained the proposed legislation to us, and I want to tell him right at the outset that this side of the House will support the Second Reading. Before I come to the legislation, however, I should like, on behalf of this side of the House, to place on record our appreciation for the work which has been done by the Abattoir Commission since 1967. We supported the 1967 legislation as well. In fact, it is in consequence of the outstanding work done by the Abattoir Commission since 1967 that its functions and activities have increased to such an extent that <span class="col_3089-3090" refersTo="page_0227"/>the hon. the Minister has had to introduce this legislation today.</p>

<p>The Abattoir Commission was the result of an inquiry conducted by Dr. De Villiers in the early sixties. I believe that the foundation was laid at that time for the rationalization of our slaughtering facilities in South Africa, as well as for the creation of better facilities. It is calculated that in 1960, the Witwatersrand only needed to slaughter just over half a million head of cattle a year. By 1990, according to experts, approximately 1,6 million head of cattle will have to be slaughtered for the Witwatersrand. This means, therefore, that within a period of 30 years after 1960 there will have been a threefold increase in the number of animals slaughtered in that area. For that reason one may take it that slaughtering facilities in South Africa will require more and more attention and that the necessary facilities will continually have to be created.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister emphasized once again in his Second Reading speech that we would have to improve our slaughtering facilities and that this would be the function of this commission and of this corporation. What is alarming, however, is that where this commission initially believed that that the commission will have to do considerably more even than was envisaged in 1967. One can understand why matters have taken this turn. The erection of abattoirs has become extremely expensive and for that reason local authorities are simply not interested in it any longer. It is too expensive for them. If a service or a facility which used to be available in the past is no longer available, a vacuum arises which has to be filled. There is no argument about that. In this case it is going to be the proposed corporation which will take over the functions of the commission.</p>

<p>Especially if local authorities are not interested&#x2014;nor do I believe that provincial authorities will be interested&#x2014;we have no alternative other than a bigger share in this kind of matter for the central Government. The hon. the Minister said in his speech that the smaller abattoirs in South Africa would eventually be excluded from control and that the control would therefore be exercised only in a general sense. Of course, I do not share the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s optimism in connection with this matter. Looking into the future, I foresee that not only slaughtering facilities in our urban areas, but also those in our rural areas, our production areas, will require more and more attention.</p>

<p>I said in a debate in this hon. House last year that it was impossible as well as unfair towards the transport industry to ask the Railways to make a large number of trucks available for transportation of live animals, and that we should rather create the necessary facilities for slaughtering animals in the production areas themselves. The carcasses can then be conveyed from there to the urban areas, to the consumer. However, I have to express my disappointment again today, just as I did in 1967, about the fact that there is a clause in this legislation, clause 28, which gives the hon. the Minister the right to impose a certain levy on the slaughtering of animals. This has nothing to do with the slaughtering tariffs which he may determine. We have no objection to that, because one cannot expect that if animals are slaughtered, the producer should not be responsible for it. Here a facility is being created, not only for the farmer, but in particular for the consumer in the urban areas. However, who has to pay the cost to the commission&#x003F; Once again there is only one man who has to pay it; the producer. If he had been the only one who would enjoy the immediate and eventual benefit of it, that would have been in order; then we on this side of the House would have had no objection.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Carletonville usually has a good memory. He will remember that we said in 1967, nine years ago, that it was a statutory body which was being created by legislation. We said that the commission was going to provide important advice to the Minister and to the co-operations; it was being created by means of legislation and its expenses should be covered from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This argument still holds. When the hon. the Minister introduced it at the time, we wanted to impose a restriction. To a certain extent we succeeded in doing so, but on a later occasion&#x2014;I think it was in 1973&#x2014;when he introduced another amendment, he changed the Act in such a way as to enable them to impose any levy in order to pay the expenses of the commission. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that it is not in my power to do <span class="col_3091-3092" refersTo="page_0228"/>this, because I cannot suggest that it come from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Under the rules of the House I am not able to do so. However, I want to tell the hon. gentleman that we are going to vote against clause 28.</p>

<p>There is a request we shall put to him. It lies within his power to move such an amendment and we shall support him whole-heartedly if he will move an amendment to clause 28 to provide that there will be no levy and that the expenses incurred by this commission will be covered by a contribution given by Parliament and derived from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Then it will be equitable, and it will be fair to the producer.</p>

<p>We have been conducting a debate over the past few days about a 50% increase in the transport costs of livestock on the Railways. We have pointed out the the hon. the Minister of Transport that the farmer is already getting a reduced price for his meat in comparison with a year ago, and now he still has to pay an increased transport cost on it. We say to the hon. the Minister that this is another additional burden. This has been the situation over the past nine years&#x2014;we know this is so&#x2014;but it is a new principle which was introduced in 1967. The hon. the Minister must bear in mind that the farmer is prepared to do his share and that he will always do what he can to improve his own industry. And this is the way it should be. But here the farmer of South Africa has to pay. If one looks at clause 28 and at the clauses which follow it, as well as at preceding clauses, one sees in clauses 16 and 17, for example, that when an abattoir is closed, the cost involved must be recovered from levies, including the levy imposed on the farmer in terms of clause 28. That is why I say this particular clause is unfair, because we are creating a facility which will benefit the city-dweller, the town-dweller and the consumer as well, and why should we alone be responsible for the cost entailed by this&#x003F; We are not entitled to add a single thing. From the moment you load your animals on the farm up to the time when you receive your statement of payment, you have to give up anything between 25% and 30% these days in transport costs and levies for the stabilization of the price of your product.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I find the desperation expressed by the hon. the Minister rather too strange to believe. He says he agrees with us, but he will never get the money. Sir, I do not know then what is becoming of this great fight against inflation in South Africa. Here we all have to co-operate, after all&#x2014; every sector must play its part&#x2014;but the hon. gentleman sits back and says that he will not get the money and it is the responsibility of the farmer alone. That is what it amounts to.</p>

<p>There is another point in this legislation that I want to discuss. It may not be a very important point, but in the earlier legislation of 1967, the commission was able, in terms of section 4, to &#x201C;grant financial assistance for study and research relating to abattoirs&#x201D;, for example.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I presume that would be to universities and to Faculties of Agriculture in order to establish bursaries and loans for post-graduate students who would like to further their studies in the direction of promoting the abattoir industry in South Africa. Now, according to the piece of legislation which is before us, there is no such provision. Does the hon. the Minister intend that the Meat Board, for example, should grant facilities in that direction&#x003F; Why is this particular provision not in the present Bill&#x003F;</p>

<p>*I should like to have a reply from the hon. gentleman on that point. Sir, I believe that this <span class="col_3093-3094" refersTo="page_0229"/>corporation will eventually play a tremendously important role in South Africa. I foresee the day when the abattoir facilities will be of such a nature that almost every abattoir in South Africa will be an abattoir from which meat may be exported from South Africa. I foresee a time when they will all be able to comply with the standards. Consequently it is the wish of those of us on this side of the House that the corporation may have great success and that we shall have no problems with the availability of slaughtering facilities in South Africa in the future. We support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in one respect I want to agree with the hon. member for Newton Park, and that is that one should express one&#x2019;s gratitude on this occasion for the good and important work done by the Abattoir Commission since 1967 in respect of abattoir activities in South Africa. The Abattoir Commission worked under very difficult circumstances, more difficult than its task had originally been expected to be, in 1967. The main recommendation of the De Villiers Commission was that the divided control over the abattoir industry in South Africa should be co-ordinated and rationalized. Accordingly, this was the main task of the Abattoir Commission, and now, in terms of clause 2, this will also be the main function of the Abattoir Commission that it will be constituted. For the performance of this function, certain extensive powers are being granted to the Commission according to which abattoirs in South Africa are to be controlled.</p>

<p>One matter which the commission had to contend with had probably not been anticipated, and this was that because of the high standards which abattoirs were required to comply with in terms of another Act which runs parallel to the Abattoir Commission Act, namely the Animal Slaughter and Hygiene Act, and Act which required abattoirs to comply with extremely exacting health requirements, the management of abattoirs had become extremely expensive. The hon. member also mentioned this. The standards were so high that the situation developed where most municipalities did not see their way clear to managing them any longer. It had become too enormous an undertaking. By means of the Abattoir Commission the Government exercised control so that the profits which abattoirs could make were limited. The result was that many of the large abattoirs&#x2014; eight of them in our most important urban areas&#x2014;were transferred to the Abattoir Commission. It had to take over these institutions at great capital expense and manage them itself.</p>

<p>The problem arose that while the Abattoir Commission had to advise the Minister on the Abattoir industry in South Africa, the tremendous rate of a take-over caused it to become subjective instead of objective towards the abattoir industry. Therefore, this legislation provides for a division to take place between the control function and the operating function. The control function is transferred to the Abattoir Commission while the operating function is transferred to a public corporation, the Abattoir Corporation.</p>

<p>However, during the nine years yet another problem developed. In spite of the findings of the De Villiers Commission that abattoirs should be run by the local authorities as had traditionally been the case, we provided in our abattoir policy after 1967 that private initiative in the form of large meat enterprises could also enter the industry. Even they, after they had applied to build abattoirs and had been granted permission to do so, were reluctant because of the enormous capital requirements, and even they did not get round to building abattoirs. Therefore I want to predict that the abattoir industry in South Africa will be controlled, managed and conducted mainly by the Abattoir Corporation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park objected to clause 28. This concerns the co-ordination of the various parties involved in the abattoir industry. The first is the Meat Board, the second is the corporation and in the third place there are the producers. Clauses 34 and 47 of the Bill co-ordinate the various parties. The Abattoir Commission cannot continue its control function if it does not receive its statistics, its figures and its information from the Meat Board and from the corporation. For that reason clause 34 specifically makes provision for the Minister to be able to obtain statistics and information by means of these organizations so that he can in accordance with the statistics and costs surveys determine the slaughtering levy. The corporation&#x2019;s board of directors, as hon. members will notice in clause 47, must include a member of the Meat Board and a member of the Abattoir Commission. Therefore, there will be good co-ordination. <span class="col_3095-3096" refersTo="page_0230"/>This naturally means that the producer will obtain representation on the Abattoir Commission by way of the Abattoir Corporation. One could regard this as a kind of indirect say which the producer is obtaining.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 28, which deals with the levy. It is not possible to cover certain operating costs if one does not impose a levy upon a unit. The unit which must be used is the animal in the abattoir. When it is slaughtered, a levy must be imposed upon it. This is the unit which one must use, and this unit is supplied by the producer, be it an ox, a sheep or a pig. The meat scheme provides that there must be a floor price. Therefore, the levy which is to be imposed upon the slaughtering of the animal is in fact a part of the farmer&#x2019;s expenses. When one comes to determining meat prices, or to a floor price as provided for by the scheme, then one must necessarily take slaughtering costs into consideration, because they are part of his expenses. In this way the determination of a floor price protects the farmer against increased slaughtering costs. The purpose of a floor price is simply to prevent meat producers from producing meat uneconomically. If one makes provision for this in the floor price, then this necessarily means involving the consumer. In the process the meat becomes more expensive after all, and therefore the consumer is affected in some way or another. This is a service which is rendered, and in this way everybody must contribute to it. Therefore I do not quite agree with the hon. member for Newton Park that the whole burden is being laid upon the farmer. He already enjoys a reasonable amount of protection, and the provisions of the legislation will enable him to protect himself.</p>

<p>Another matter which I would like to bring to the attention of hon. members is the fact that the Bill provides for only certain areas to be placed under control. Provision is made for certain areas to be proclaimed. Therefore, most rural areas are excluded from control. I should like to ask the hon. Minister whether this would necessarily mean that the proclaimed abattoir area would not be the same area as that of the scheme of the Meat Board. The position is that in many of the adjacent urban areas tremendous growth and development are taking place. In such cases, too, abattoir co-ordination and control is of the greatest importance. We experience a tremendous number of problems in rural areas and towns. Hon. members know to what extent our local authorities compete with one another and for this reason there is never any co-ordination, and at times there is duplication as well, which leads to enormously high slaughtering costs. I think the hon. the Minister should look at these rural or semi-urban areas to see whether he cannot make this applicable there as well. In doing so, one would be able to effect co-ordination there as well. If necessary one could move in the direction of regional abattoirs. We support this legislation because it is a great improvement on the old Act, especially in view of the fact that the present Abattoir Commission, under the present circumstances, cannot perform its functions properly. This new legislation was very essential for this purpose.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased with this Bill which is under discussion. It has been drafted along the lines which I have been mooting over the years, as some hon. members in this House will recall. This subject of abattoirs is something which has come under the searchlight from time to time over many years. As has already been said, the Abattoir Commission was appointed in 1967. Our problem has always been the siting and the standard of abattoirs in South Africa. One knows full well that it is a very costly business. I have always believed that the real secret of success in the meat industry is to be able to conserve the meat in the flush seasons and then to distribute it economically in the lean seasons. I should like to remind the hon. House what I said about this very subject in 1971. I quote from Hansard, Vol. 33, col. 5622 where I said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that we must provide for the storage of all surplus meat in the flush season and that we must also ensure an even distribution of meat in the lean season. The hon. the Minister will ask me how we can do this. I will tell him how it can be done.</block>

<p>Then I went on in column 5623 to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must first decentralize and then in the lean season we can distribute the meat evenly. The producer will then certainly benefit by it and, what is very important, the butcher also.</block>

<p><span class="col_3097-3098" refersTo="page_0231"/>Decentralization is therefore something which I myself and others on this side of the House have been mooting over the years. As I mentioned, what is important&#x2014;and I think it is something on which we shall have to concentrate in the years to come&#x2014;is the strategic position of abattoirs, whether they be sited centrally or at other vantage points. I have already mentioned in the past that a place such as Upington could be a vantage point to decentralize too. Places like De Aar and Berlin in the Eastern Cape as well as a larger city like Bloemfontein in the Free State could also be considered.</p>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Windhoek too. All such strategically situated places can be considered. The standard of refrigeration trucks of the S.A. Railways is important too in order to make this a successful exercise. What has been our problem over the years is the financing of abattoirs. We know that agriculturists have come down to Cape Town during sessions to ask about establishing private abattoirs for example at Upington. De Aar has been suggested by others, but the problem has always been how to finance these schemes. Now we see in chapter 2 on page 37 of the Bill something which is very close to the answer, namely the establishment of a corporation which will manage and finance these projects. This is the answer we have been looking for and I believe it is something which all of us in South Africa, the producers, the butchers and the consumers, will be very pleased about.</p>

<p>The terms of reference of the Abattoir Corporation which is suggested here are very wide. They give the hon. the Minister wide powers and I personally welcome this. It is something we must be able to control completely all the time, and there must be a person to whom the corporation is responsible, and nobody is more suitable than the hon. the Minister himself. The corporation will of course be responsible for the control over all matters in connection with abattoirs. Here I have a problem. A commission is being established in terms of clause 2. It is a commission which will act in an advisory capacity, as an advisory board. I believe we should not have too many boards advising the hon. the Minister. I fail to see the object of the commission acting as an advisory board. I should prefer to see the Meat Board act in an advisory capacity. The members of the Meat Board are there, and if we do not have confidence in them, then we should put people there in whom we have confidence. I believe they are quite capable and should be capable of advising the hon. the Minister at all times. We should not have this other advisory board arising from the commission. After all, we have the Dairy Control Board which is a good body doing good work. We also have the Wheat Control Board. Why ehould we not have the Meat Control Board acting in the same manner&#x003F;</p>

<p>It is accepted that a very high standard of abattoir is required in South Africa. Here too we have always met with problems from the local authorities. We now come back to the argument of the levy. Local authorities have always in the past levied the producer on every animal which had entered that particular area or that particular abattoir. There are other incidental expenses such as municipal fees, etc. A levy has always been raised from the producer. When it comes to the financing of abattoirs, I know many of our smaller villages have found it impossible to finance abattoirs to the standard required. Even in my own constituency of East London North, we have an abattoir which is well below the standard required, especially for export. If we have to start improving it, we know what it will cost the ratepayers of East London North. It is humanly impossible for those people to improve the standard of that abattoir and to pay increased rates today. My hon. colleague from Newton Park has mentioned clause 28, dealing with the levy. This is a problem. I agree with what he said and I support his suggestion, but on the other hand I must agree with much of what the hon. member for Bethal has said. He has a good point, and it is something we shall have to discuss in the Committee stage.</p>

<p>Statistics from the South African Agricultural Union reveal that the agricultural industry as such has only enjoyed a net profit throughout the country of 2&#x00BD;% to 3%. These are reports of recent years we have seen. I want to know what commercial institutions and what industries in South Africa would be prepared to function on a net income <i>of</i> 2&#x00BD;% to 3%. It is only the agricultural industry <span class="col_3099-3100" refersTo="page_0232"/>which has to be prepared to run at such a small net income. The tariffs raised in the recent Railway budget are going to create a problem under clause 28, which deals with levies. However, what I do like about the Bill is that it will certainly guarantee more stability in the industry. Stability, and more stability, is what the farming industry needs. Stability is what the butchers need, and stability in the meat industry is also what the consumers require very urgently. I am very happy that we on this side of the House can support the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to reply very briefly to what the hon. member for East London North said. He had certain reservations about the function which the Abattoir Commission will have to fulfil in terms of this measure. However, I do not know whether the Marketing Act, as it reads at present, makes at all adequate provision for empowering the Meat Board to exercise a controlling function over abattoirs as well. I do not think it is possible. If the hon. member were to read the De Villiers report of 1967, he would see in that report that it was strongly recommended, after all the parties had been consulted, that the controlling function over abattoirs should be removed from the Meat Board and conferred on the Abattoir Commission. I think the hon. member will concede that the Meat Board in fact has a marketing function only and in this respect only exercises control in controlled spheres. In other words, it operates in a very limited sphere, for it may only exercise its marketing function in controlled areas. If one were now to confer the proposed powers of the Abattoir Commission in the measure before us on the Meat Control Board, problems would crop Up since it is being intended to make the operational area of the commission far wider than only the controlled areas. We also know that we shall experience problems in respect of South West Africa, because the Meat Board does not operate in South West Africa either. These are the few problems which I foresee.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to read the conclusions and recommendations of the De Villiers Commission of 1967. In the short space of nine years since, the entire set-up of the abattoirs has changed. In the De Villiers Report, as the hon. member for Bethal has already stated, there was a very strong recommendation that abattoirs should fall under municipalities exclusively. But during the past few years in particular we have seen the set-up of the abattoirs and the costs involved changing to such an extent that local authorities, with the limited tax resources at their disposal, and the limited possibility to obtain capital, were unable to manage abattoirs on their own. At various places the Abattoir Commission had to intervene and take over abattoirs when they were threatened with a close down. The costs connected with the control of abattoirs have risen tremendously, especially as a result of the fact that many of these abattoirs had to qualify for export. Because export regulations are very strict, it was in some respects impossible for local authorities to comply with all the regulations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal, for example, also referred to the health regulations. Because of the inability of local authorities, matters took such a turn that the Abattoir Commission had to take over various abattoirs which were being threatened with a close-down. Should the latest negotiations succeed there will soon be only one abattoir which still falls under a local authority, and that is the Cape Town abattoir. Therefore, one can see how matters have taken a completely different turn in the short space of four years. Whereas the Abattoir Commission, in the initial stages, only had a controlling, co-ordinating and rationalizing function, matters have changed radically during the past few years and an operational function has been added. With the building of the City Deep abattoir in Johannesburg and the proposed Cato Ridge abattoir at Pietermaritzburg, the matter has assumed such tremendous proportions and such an enormous capital amount is involved that even the operational function has become very difficult for the commission to carry out. Particularly in recent times serious misgivings have been expressed in certain quarters concerning the activities of the Abattoir Commission, as a result of certain circumstances already mentioned by previous speakers, primarily because of its subjective and physical involvement in the industry of course. However, I must say at once that this criticism and these misgivings are to my mind quite unjustified and unfounded. I want to associate myself with previous speakers and say that to my mind the members of this Abattoir Commission deserve the gratitude of every <span class="col_3101-3102" refersTo="page_0233"/>person involved in the meat industry in this country. I think it is of cardinal importance that we realize that slaughtering facilities in the meat industry could have become chaotic had it not been for steps taken by the Abattoir Commission. For that reason I think they really deserve the gratitude of everyone involved in the meat industry in South Africa.</p>

<p>To my mind the measure before us is for the most part aimed at eliminating the prejudice and misgivings I mentioned and at transferring the complete conduct of abattoirs to a State corporation which will operate strictly in accordance with business principles. The controlling function will of course be accordingly entrusted the proposed Abattoir Commission, a body which will provide the hon. the Minister with the necessary advice, since this function will now be transferred in its entirety to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. I am also pleased that there will be proper liaison since a member of the Meat Board as well as a member of the proposed commission will serve on the Abattoir Commission.</p>

<p>However, I should like to go a little further and look into the future as far as the effect of this Bill is concerned. While it is now possible for the State President to proclaim a certain area, I think it is necessary that one should give very serious consideration, especially as regards the costs for the industry, to the immediate proclamation of areas where growth points are developing in our country&#x2014;I am thinking for example of the enormous development which is going to take place at Saldanha&#x2014;the establishment there of one abattoir which would serve the whole area instead of a few small abattoirs, which would of necessity cause the costs of such an undertaking to soar. I think it will be necessary for the Abattoir Commission to keep the hon. the Minister constantly informed of developments in this regard and that we will be able to render a much better service to the industry with a large regional abattoir than with a number of smaller local abattoirs. Therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister as far as this aspect is concerned, to instruct this commission from the outset to make an immediate survey and to ensure that where such growth points develop or developments of this kind take place, they should advise him immediately in respect of the proclamation of certain areas.</p>

<p>I would like to associate myself with what the hon. member for East London North said about abattoirs in production areas. I did not have the time during the Railway debate which has just been concluded to discuss this matter a little further. It is a fact that we have over the years tried on the level of Organized agriculture to make slaughtering in production areas possible, but there have been certain factors which prevented this. It is an unfortunate fact that the abattoirs at Cato Ridge and at City Deep are going to give rise to enormous costs which will have to be met. Nevertheless I think that as soon as this new legislation is promulgated, the hon. the Minister should instruct the commission to consider, in conjunction with the South African Agricultural Union and the Railways, the possibility of slaughtering in production areas and that one could select certain areas in the small stock areas and in the large stock areas in which to establish such abattoirs. I think such a discussion could take place to very good effect and an investigation could be directed in which all aspects were taken into consideration, including the fact that the abattoirs at City Deep and Cato Ridge have already been built. I think the future of this industry should be investigated. I think this could be done to good effect, especially in view of the fact that transport costs are escalating and that one should make every effort to try and reduce these costs.</p>

<p>I should like to join the ranks of the other hon. members who welcomed this legislation. I think it will be to the great advantage of the industry. We would very much like to assist the hon. the Minister in making a success of this legislation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet said, <i>inter alia,</i> that the object of this legislation was to place all abattoirs under the control of the corporation. In my opinion the object, as defined in the Bill, is not in accordance with what the hon. member said.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has once again come forward with excellent legislation. It strikes one that he has come forward in this House with several good Bills this session. I should like to say that there are certain factors which are very important in this discussion. The first is that the production of meat cannot keep abreast of the rapid increase in the population in South Africa. Indeed, this is a phenomenon <span class="col_3103-3104" refersTo="page_0234"/>one finds throughout the world. The per capita consumption of meat is dropping. At the same time the cost of meat to the consumer keeps on rising. For that reason this Bill is very important. One accepts the object of the legislation is to make the industry as a whole more efficient and in this way to ensure better prices for the producer and to keep the consumer price under control so that it does not rise too rapidly. If we want to examine the Bill, we must do that on this basis.</p>

<p>I should like to comment on certain clauses. I shall commence with clause 16(1), which deals with the closure of abattoirs. Subsection (1) provides that if the Minister is of the opinion, after consultation with the commission, that the closure of an abattoir is in the general interest, a particular abattoir may be closed. I think this provision has been phrased in very wide terms. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not want to give this House further information about the circumstances under which it may be deemed advisable to close an abattoir.</p>

<p>In clause 17(2) we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that no compensation shall be paid in respect of&#x2014;(i) any indirect damage or loss of profit caused by such closure.</block>

<p>Once again I think that this has been put too widely and may create the impression that the Government deems it advisable to close a particular abattoir, the owner of such an abattoir will not receive his right of compensation for the closure of the abattoir. I think that it is important that the hon. the Minister set the minds of all abattoir operators and owners at rest that any compensation will cover the costs and damage which they will suffer as a result of that closure.</p>

<p>Clause 21(4) provides that no person shall demand a lower tariff than the tariff fixed by the Minister. One can see the sense in the Minister laying down that an operator or owner of an abattoir should not simply be able to demand higher tariffs. But in the case where an operator of an abattoir finds it possible to demand lower tariffs as a result of more efficient management, surely this would promote the anti-inflation campaign and then one cannot understand why the hon. the Minister finds it necessary to prohibit an abattoir operator or owner by legislation from demanding a lower tariff if it is within his power to do so. The operator may find that he is able to demand a lower tariff due to the more efficient management of an abattoir. I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to reconsider this particular provision so as to afford the operators of abattoirs the opportunity to demand lower tariffs if they wish to and in this way to make meat available to the public at lower prices.</p>

<p>In clause 22(3) provision is made for orders which may be issued to operators or owners and no mention is made of a time limit for giving effect to the directives embodied in the order. It is felt that when an order is issued to an operator or to the owner of an abattoir, it would most likely be very difficult for him to react immediately to the directives embodied in that order and that it would be reasonable if the Minister made provision for a reasonable time limit in this provision.</p>

<p>Clause 27(6) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person may without the permission of the Commission attend such inquiry.</block>

<p>When inquiries of this type take place, it is, in my opinion in the public interest, in the interest of the consumer, of the producer and of all the people and bodies who are concerned, for them to be able to attend such an inquiry. I feel that the attendance of inquiries of that nature should be open to the public as a whole. The impression should not be created that there is anything secretive in connection with these inquiries&#x2014;in other words the impression must be created that the public is welcome to attend inquiries of that nature.</p>

<p>In clause 38(1) mention is made of &#x201C;Purporting to be an affidavit&#x201D;, a writing purporting to be an affidavit. This is an expression which often occurs in the legislation which has been before this House this year, and I should like to ask why it cannot simply be described as an affidavit. After all, an affidavit is a writing upon oath made before a commissioner of oaths to be generally accepted by all courts and investigating officials and I do not think that it is necessary or that there is any reason to refer to it as &#x201C;purporting&#x201D; to be an affidavit, or to describe this writing in this manner. Why cannot the legislation simply refer to an &#x201C;affidavit&#x201D;&#x003F; After all, it is a document which is clearly defined and acceptable in legal process.</p>

<p><span class="col_3105-3106" refersTo="page_0235"/>In clause 39(1) the onus&#x2014;and this, too, is something which has appeared in several other pieces of legislations&#x2014;is placed upon the employer, in respect of offences by his staff, to prove that he is innocent. In other words, in terms of this provision an employer or owner is automatically deemed to be guilty and the onus rests on that employer to prove that he is not guilty. This is something with which we cannot agree. It is in conflict with basic principles and therefore we believe that it does not belong in legislation of this type.</p>

<p>Finally I want to refer to clause 72. Here, once again, we have something which has also appeared in other legislation recently introduced in this House. It is provided in this clause that the department&#x2019;s officials are not liable in respect of anything done in good faith by any member of the department or in terms of the provisions of the Act, in other words that in spite of the damage which an owner of an abattoir or any other body or person concerned may suffer in consequence of action taken by officials of the State, the Government does not hold itself liable in that regard. The Government indemnifies itself merely on the standpoint that such action was taken in good faith and in terms of the provisions of this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, subject to the comments which have been made, I should just like to tell the hon. the Minister that we will support the Second Reading of this Bill, provided that the hon. the Minister will give satisfactory answers to the representations we have made in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botma">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. BOTMA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the previous speakers on both sides. What strikes one particularly is the great sense of peace which prevails here. In point of fact, I want to say that a great peace has &#x201C;broken out&#x201D;. This makes one think involuntarily of the peace of Hohaganas in South West Africa in the year 1858, when all the peoples met and signed a peace treaty. The first clause of the peace treaty&#x2014;it was drawn up in High Dutch&#x2014;provided that the people that was attacked did not have the right to defend itself. While they were celebrating, Jonker Afrikaner attacked the Ovambos, robbed, plundered and murdered them. Therefore I want to warn the hon. the Minister that he should be careful, because while we are celebrating here, an attack may be planned against him. We remain sceptical. Nevertheless, it is pleasant to discuss the common problem of the agricultural industry in such a calm atmosphere as this.</p>

<p>When one looks at the Bill which is before us, it is necessary first of all to look at the old dispensation. We see that the Abattoir Act, Act No. 86 of 1967, which is now to be repealed, provides for the functions of the Abattoir Commission, functions which, as we have already said, are mainly of a regulating nature. The modernization of abattoirs at high cost, especially to comply with high hygienic standards which were laid down, as well as mechanization at high and ever rising costs, made it possible for fewer bodies to meet requirements and therefore fewer bodies were prepared to modernize or to mechanize. Economic factors were therefore responsible, in the first instance, for the Abattoir Commission becoming deeply involved in the operating function. So there was necessarily a conflict of functions. Whereas it used to be objective, it has now become subjective. The new Bill seeks to rectify this and the functions are very clearly outlined; I am particularly thankful that control is being reduced.</p>

<p>Section 13(1) of Act 86 of 1973 provides that no animal may be slaughtered at any place, other than a registered abattoir. The implementation of section 13 presented major problems to the municipalities in the smaller rural towns. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet referred to controlled abattoirs. If one looks at the smaller abattoirs throughout the country, one finds that on a percentage basis, local authorities still are the largest owners or operators of abattoirs. Modernization is an expensive process and consequently the small municipalities have been unable to embark thereon. The fact that urban municipalities either have had to throw in the towel or close their establishments and hand them over to the Abattoir Commission is in my opinion sufficient proof of that fact. In terms of clause 35 of the Bill the Minister may now make different regulations in respect of different classes of abattoirs. The Act piloted through this Parliament a year ago, had far-reaching effects for municipalities. In the year when the great slaughter took place in the ranks of the United Party here, the Act also imposed a prohibition on the cutting of sheep&#x2019;s throats. Section 42 provides that certain abattoirs may be exempted from control altogether, as was <span class="col_3107-3108" refersTo="page_0236"/>stated here by the hon. the Minister this afternoon. The spirit of this new legislation is therefore clearly aimed at control in the larger centres where hygienic standards must be high and where control is essential. This is where livestock is slaughtered by the thousand. If one takes note of the conditions which prevailed at Maitland in earlier years one never wants to see a repetition of those conditions. This must definitely also bring relief for smaller places, where stricter control has resulted in an unbearable burden.</p>

<p>Because of the low turnover, often one unit per animal, it was impossible for these small municipalities to modernize and because of the small turnover the Abattoir Commission will not be interested in taking over such an establishment either. The result was that those abattoirs simply had to close, as again happened quite recently in the Cape Province, with the detrimental effects which this has. The retailer must now acquire his own vehicle which complies with the regulations and because of the small turnover he will not be able to recover those costs. The only alternative is that the retail business will have to close, and if this should happen the man who possesses a vehicle may fetch his meat elsewhere. But what about the large section of our population who do not have their own transport&#x003F; That is why I welcome the spirit of this Bill, that is, that strict control will be exercised and that the smaller municipalities will be exempted from control. This does not imply that unhygienic standards will be allowed. The Animal Slaughter, Meat and Animal Products Hygiene Act lays down very clearly the conditions under which an animal is to be slaughtered. Even where this Act does not apply or is not made applicable the local health regulations are sufficient to ensure hygienic conditions. Municipalities have improved their own regulations over the years and have made them more strict, because they have had to take into account the so-called bush butcher whose activities have had to be curbed in order to obtain the small income from slaughtering for a local authority which is struggling as it is. Since we are discussing the Hygiene Act, I should like to point out to the Minister that it may be useful for him to look at this Act. New, modern installations are required, but do they work&#x003F; If we look at the immensely high standards and if we look at the freedom given to architects and builders to draw up the most expensive plans, only the best imported materials are good enough &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, and the Minister of Finance too. I have referred to the fact that the local authorities have a major interest in the matter. According to information at my disposal, the United Municipal Executive of South Africa has decided, in consequence of representations made to it and in consequence of the numerous problems experienced with the building, management and operation of abattoirs to appoint a study group to inquire into the conflicting requirements set by various State departments and to publish a handbook which will be applicable to all municipalities. Because the local authorities have such a major interest in this matter and because a study group has already been appointed and will begin sitting on 15 March 1976, I want to ask the hon. the Minister when the study group has completed its work and the report has been published, to look at that report as well and if there are any positive proposals, to consider making them applicable by legislation at a later opportunity.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park waxed lyrical about the so-called levy. It is well and good his pleading here for the interest of the farmer, but I should like to read out a single sentence from the report of the Abattoir Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission&#x2019;s income to provide for administrative expenses is derived from levies which, with the approval of the Minister, are imposed in terms of section 33 of the Act.</block>

<p>It goes on to mention that the maximum levy for which provision was made in that year, was six cents per head for cattle, horses, mules <span class="col_3109-3110" refersTo="page_0237"/>and donkeys. For pigs it was 1,5 cents and for calves 3 cents per head. In 1973 the hon. the Minister introduced an amendment in Parliament and they were granted an increase.

<p>I agree with that, but if we look at the original Act, it is not laid down in the Act either, but I have the greatest confidence that the Minister will ensure that nobody is exploited. I agree that we should see to the interests of the farmer, for example the interests of the farmer in South West Africa who market an average of 200 cattle per year. To him it means R20 per year. Increased railage and bus tariffs amount to R11 per animal for that farmer. Therefore railage alone is increased by R2 200 on 200 animals per year. I should rather associate myself with the hon. member for Bethal and ask for regional abattoirs. We have the abattoirs, the facilities in South West Africa, namely in Windhoek, Otavi and Okahandja. The only thing the hon. the Minister has to do, is to apply the powers conferred on him by the legislation and declare those areas controlled areas, so that the floor price may be made applicable there too. It will assist us a great deal, and I trust that the hon. member for Newton Park will see his way clear to support us in this.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Omaruru dealt with the question of control which this Bill seeks to introduce. He also mentioned in passing the question of mechanization. I rise mainly in connection with clause 31 and to put forward to the hon. the Minister for his attention a suggestion which will make for the smoother working of this particular clause. I raise this during the Second Reading of the Bill in order to give the hon. the Minister ample opportunity to consider an amendment which I wish to propose during the Committee Stage in relation to this clause, the clause which deals with inspectors. The amendment which I will pass on to the hon. the Minister in due course, will make for the smoother administration of this particular provision, particularly in regard to the functioning of the inspectors. As the clause stands at present, it lays down that inspectors shall on demand present their certificates of authority. It is desirable for the inspector to be required to exhibit his certificate of authority prior to conducting an inspection on the people involved in the administration of this particular measure. If my amendment is embodied in the Bill it will make for the smoother working of this measure and for a better relationship with the people being affected and will also protect the owners and those involved in abattoirs against any likelihood of their being inspected by bogus inspectors.</p>

<speech by="#uys">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. UYS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is one problem which arises when all of us agree on a Bill. Then we usually start talking so much that eventually we might start disagreeing again. I should like to start by referring briefly to the general objection which has been raised by the Progressive Party with regard to clause 39 of the Bill. They raised a similar objection to the Plant Improvement Bill. Their objection is that an employer can be held criminally responsible under certain circumstances for offences committed by his employees.</p>

<p>As far as both Bills are concerned, I have done some looking up and I have found that clause 39 of this Bill is exactly the same as section 55 of Act No. 86 of 1967&#x2014;the present Act. I have also tried to see whether this particular clause or the section of the Act caused any practical problems in the past, and I have been unable to find any verdict of a court in which a final ruling was given about the application of this section of the Act.</p>

<p><span class="col_3111-3112" refersTo="page_0238"/>Therefore I can come to two conclusions, i.e. that this section has caused no problem in the past with regard to the application of the Act and, in the second place, that the deterrent value of this section has been so effective that employers are careful to ensure that their employees do not contravene the provisions of the Act. Furthermore, clause 39 does not create a general responsibility on the part of the employer with regard to the actions of his employees.</p>

<p>This Bill creates specific offences, which are closely related to the provisions of the Act, and offences in respect of Acts or omissions which fall under or should fall under the intimate knowledge of an employer. With a view to the strict enforcement of this legislation it is necessary that employers be held responsible for the actions of their employees in any case, except if they can escape from that responsibility in terms of the provision which is made.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer briefly to the objection raised by the hon. member for Bryanston to the provision in clause 21, in terms of which the owner of an abattoir is prohibited from asking lower tariffs than those which have been fixed by the Minister. There is a good reason for that. If the hon. member for Bryanston has read the clause properly&#x2014; and I assume that he has&#x2014;he will have seen that the Minister may fix tariffs on the recommendation of the Commission or on application by the owner. Tariffs may therefore differ from abattoir to abattoir. What possible reason could there be then for the owner of an abattoir to fix lower tariffs than those the Minister has fixed on his application or recommendation&#x003F; That could only happen in cases where the owner of an abattoir gives preference to certain clients to the detriment of other clients. Therefore I believe it is necessary to oblige the owner of an abattoir to impose the same tariff on all his clients&#x2014;in this case, the tariff as fixed by the Minister. If the owner wishes to impose a lower tariff, however, he has the right to approach the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and to consult him about the proposed lowering of tariffs. I am convinced that the hon. the Minister would not refuse any reasonable request.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of this legislation is the possible erection of regional abattoirs. It is a very important aspect of this legislation, especially where we are dealing with areas which may develop in future. Here I should like to refer in particular to the tremendous development which is at hand in the south-eastern Transvaal. I believe the new corporation will have to be careful to ensure that mistakes made in the past are not repeated if a regional abattoir were to be erected somewhere in the south-eastern Transvaal.</p>

<p>The idea of a central regional abattoir sounds attractive, but the transport costs to a central abattoir will have to be kept in mind, especially in that particular region of the south-eastern Transvaal where most types of small as well as large stock are locally available to the consumer. A regional abattoir, which would replace local abattoirs, could therefore create extra transport costs and other costs.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to refer briefly to the provisions with regard to the closure of an abattoir. I am referring in particular to the provisions of clause 18(1), in terms of which a local authority is prohibited from closing down an abattoir, unless it has given to the Minister a written notice in the prescribed form at least 180 days before the date on which it wishes to close down the abattoir concerned. As far as I know, quite large private abattoirs still exist throughout the country. I refer in particular to the abattoirs at Vereeniging and at Balfour. In my opinion, this particular clause should perhaps refer to the closure of an abattoir, not only by a local authority, but by any owner of an abattoir.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that it is necessary to reply to what the hon. member for Barberton has just said. He has said nothing contentious and nothing with which we cannot agree. I shall deal with the hon. member for Bryanston in the Committee Stage on the particular matters that he raised. However, I want to discuss with the hon. the Minister very briefly the whole question of why and how this Bill has been introduced in this particular fashion. We have at the moment an Act which provides for an Abattoir Commission with a dual function; control, over the erection of abattoirs and physical control and management of abattoirs. In this Bill we are now being asked to separate those two functions. So far so good. We can agree with that entirely. I believe the establishment of the Abattoir Corporation is a step forward in the direction of taking over the actual physical <span class="col_3113-3114" refersTo="page_0239"/>control and powers of the commission as it stands at the moment, followed by the establishment of a commission to handle the other control measures.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that would have been all right, but now we find that there is a radical departure from that in this particular Bill. The departure is this: In terms of the Abattoir Commission Act, the Abattoir Commission has certain powers. In terms of the Act as it stands today, the commission has the power to register abattoirs, to erect abattoirs, to alter abattoirs and to prohibit the erection of abattoirs. All those powers are vested in the commission, but now we find in this Bill that the Minister takes those powers unto himself. No longer are those powers vested in the commission, with the consent of the Minister, but now the Minister takes the power to act after consultation with the commission. This happens in every case. Unfortunately time does not allow me to detail them. In other words, the commission, instead of being a body, as it is at the moment, with the power to control, the power to do everything, the commission now becomes solely and simply an advisory body.</p>

<p>It is simply there to advise the Minister and when the Minister requires any information or requires to do anything he may act after having consulted with that commission. Now I do not know whether there is any real reason why this has happened. I must say that I personally am not altogether happy with the situation. I want to mention one particular aspect, and that is that I believe the hon. the Minister is laying himself open to a lot of vilification and a lot of trouble by taking for instance the powers he is taking in clause 10 to allow or to disallow the erection of an abattoir in a proclaimed area. He is making himself the Lord Pooh Bah by saying it is solely, wholly and completely his responsibility, with no reference to anybody else. He is not even making provision for an appeal from his decision. I believe that this leaves the hon. the Minister wide open to the most terrible criticism and I do not believe that that really is what he should be doing or that it is really what he wants to do. The only appeal that can lie against a decision of the hon. the Minister, if this Bill is accepted in its present form, will be to the courts on the grounds either of <i>mala fides,</i> which is an extremely difficult thing to prove, and I do not believe that this hon. Minister would ever act <i>mala fide</i> anyway, or on the point that the Minister failed to apply his mind to the Act. Once again, I do not believe that these are the only grounds on which an appeal should be allowed. In terms of our agricultural legislation at the moment control boards make decisions and those decisions are appealable to the hon. the Minister. I believe that some such similar system should be introduced here and that the Minister should not take upon himself the sole right to decide, without there being any right of appeal.</p>

<p>We then come to the question of the commission which is to be appointed, of three to five members. Again the hon. the Minister takes upon himself the whole right and responsibility of appointing these people without consulting with anybody, without acknowledging anybody. Like my friend from Newton Park, I believe that the S.A. Agricultural Union at least should be acknowledged in the Act. I know the hon. the Minister will tell me that he will consult with them and that he will consult with the Meat Board, but I believe that they should be acknowledged here in the Bill and that he should bring an amendment to the Bill allowing him to acknowledge those people and to consult with them and to appoint the people whom the Agricultural Union feels should be appointed to this particular commission.</p>

<p>I have another problem with this Bill. The Minister is introducing into this a concept of proclaimed areas; he is going to proclaim certain areas where the provisions of this Bill will apply. He takes in clause 10 the power to control the erection of an abattoir in a proclaimed area. The first question which arises is this. Is it his intention to proclaim the whole of the Republic or will it be only certain areas&#x003F; If it is to be only certain areas, will there be no control over the erection of abattoirs in the unproclaimed areas&#x003F; I think the hon. the Minister sees my point. There is no provision anywhere in the Bill for the control of the erection of abattoirs in unproclaimed areas. Similarly there is no provision in this Bill whatsoever for the registration of abattoirs. There is no provision for the registration of existing abattoirs. They should all be registered under the Act as it stands now, but there is no provision for the continuation of the registration under this Bill. If I read this Bill correctly, the hon. the Minister will exercise all these powers in these proclaimed areas, and <span class="col_3115-3116" refersTo="page_0240"/>the next question is this. What is going to happen in the unproclaimed areas, or outside the proclaimed areas.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Therefore, outside the proclaimed areas there will be no control at all. In other words, this is a marked departure from the present policy, where there is supervision over all abattoirs in all areas, because in future there will not be control over all of them.</p>

<p>Now I come to clause 28 and the question of the application of levies. Levies will be applied in terms of clause 28 to all abattoirs inside and outside the proclaimed areas. Now, if this Bill applies only in the proclaimed areas, then he cannot apply this section to abattoirs outside the proclaimed areas. He must have a look at that as a well. There is another question, viz. that in terms of section 13 of the present Act, there is a prohibition on the slaughtering of animals. It says that no person shall slaughter any animal or perform any service or permit any animal to be slaughtered for any service to be performed at any place other than a registered abattoir. That prohibition is not included in the new Bill. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will tell us why it is that there is no longer any prohibition on the slaughtering of animals&#x003F; Sir, if that provision is not included I do not know of any other provision in any other Act which prohibits the slaughtering of an animal at some other place. The Animal Slaughter, Meat and Animal Products Hygiene Act does so to a certain extent, but I do not think it fully answers the questions I have raised. I sincerely hope the hon. the Minister will have a look at that as well.</p>

<p>When we come to the Abattoir Corporation, we find that this will take over most of the powers of the existing commission. There is one danger that I want to point out to the hon. the Minister and that is the danger which comes from monopolies and the danger which comes from a large corporation being the only body performing a particular service. Firstly one finds monopolistic tendencies, and secondly inefficiency can creep in. As long as we can continue to maintain in the application of this Act a measure of participation by private enterprise, whether that private enterprise is by individuals or companies or whether it is by way of a local authority, I believe that this will be a healthy sign. I believe it is important that the hon. the Minister should in the application of this Act see to it that private enterprise is maintained in the industry in the interests of the industry as a whole.</p>

<p>With those few words, Sir, I must endorse what my friend, the hon. member for Newton Park, has said, viz. that we will support this Bill, but I would like to have answers from the hon. the Minister on these matters.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park disappointed me greatly this afternoon. Over the past few years he gave me the impression that as far as he was concerned, we did not play politics in agriculture, and I believed him. When we had to determine the prices of agricultural products and I asked him whether he was satisfied with an increase of 3c a litre in the price of milk, for example, he said:&#x201C;You are the Minister.&#x201D; He never gave me the impression of being concerned about the producer only; he gave me the impression of wanting to maintain the balance, just as I do, and of believing that we should take the producer and the consumer along with us.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now the hon. member rises and says that he supports this Bill, but because of certain things in respect of which he brought me under a false impression, he says they are going to vote against clause 28. For what purpose&#x003F; Let him tell me that honestly. Is it to go outside and to tell the farmers that they voted in Parliament&#x003F; They were not prepared, in respect of the tariff increase of 50% on livestock in the Railways budget, to move an amendment and then to tell the farmers that they voted against the 50% tariff increase. [Interjections.] Now the hon. member says he cannot introduce an amendment because it is concerned with a levy, but he is going to vote against clause 28. He is doing it so that he can tell the farmers that this Government is imposing that levy on the <span class="col_3117-3118" refersTo="page_0241"/>farmer and not on the consumer. That is what he wants to tell them. It is the most adroit piece of political manoeuvring we have had from that hon. member, and they are going to vote, Sir. I am convinced of that, but then he will have to be consistent in that attitude of his throughout the rest of this session. In the course of this session he is going to confront me about the increase in the price of certain agricultural products. He has never supported me in the past, but now he will have to be consistent all the way through, in respect of each of these increases that are going to come. Sir, when we introduced the legislation in connection with the marketing of fresh produce, there was a clause in terms of which the Minister, in consultation with the municipality, could determine the levy or the tax to be paid by the farmer on a bag of cabbages or a bag of pumpkins. The hon. member agreed with that, and the farmer is the one who has to pay that 5% or 6% of 7% in order to pay for these municipal markets. The hon. member did not say at that time that he was going to vote against that clause. [Interjections.] My dear old &#x2026; I almost said my dear old friend, and then I would really have been lying! [Interjections.] What is the purpose of this levy&#x003F; Why do you want to vote against it&#x003F; It is only a small fraction of the farmer&#x2019;s expenses.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The municipality, too, can impose a levy. Why then are the municipalities giving the abattoirs back&#x003F; The small municipality, to which the hon. member for Omaruru referred, is in a financial quandary. With this I have also replied to the question of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member spoke about monopolies. Our problem is that no municipality whatever is prepared to carry on with an abattoir at 1% to 2% interest on their investment. That is the reason why we have this problem.</p>

<p>*Otherwise I would never have introduced the legislation to the House. A monopoly simply cannot arise and it is impossible to manage abattoirs at such a small profit margin.</p>

<p>Very well, it is what it is. However, the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal is that the taxpayers of the country should bear the burden. The Minister of Finance is to raise his taxes to obtain funds for financing the levy for the abattoir industry. After the maize price has been determined, the Meat Board meets to make proposals for the new floor prices for beef and mutton. In this floor price all cost increases, including, therefore, the increase in railway tariffs, are incorporated. The increase of 50% in the railway tariffs will be taken into consideration when we determine the new floor price in May. The levy, and all the other things I mentioned, are incorporated into the floor price, and a part of it is absorbed by the consumer&#x2014;the hon. member may say whatever he likes. Even if everyone were to disagree with me, it remains a fact that all the costs are reflected in the price which the housewife pays for the product. I replied by way of interjection to what the hon. member asked me in his speech. What was the hon. member&#x2019;s reaction then&#x003F; He said I would not get the money. I was frank with the hon. member. The fact is that we do not have enough money today to do the necessary financing and to grant loans to the Department of Agricultural Credit for repairing the damage caused by floods, etc. The hon. member knows, after all, that I cannot now ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to give us the money from the Treasury. I cannot tell the hon. the Minister of Finance to increase the taxation on cigarettes and income tax. If I were to do so, he could ask me what had become of the list of services to be economized on by every Minister&#x2019;s department.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member for Newton Park understands what I am trying to say. I shall reply to the hon. member later. I thought we would be able to take all the stages today, but it seems to me that this will not be possible. I shall reply to the hon. member later on his questions relating to the provision of bursaries. If the hon. member reads the Act carefully he will understand the position. The hon. member for Bethal spoke of the separation of the control and the management of abattoirs. He is quite right in this connection. The hon. member mentioned another important point, i.e. the co-ordination of regional abattoirs. In my opinion, the increase in the transport tariffs can have only one result. As the hon. member for Bethal said, the meat industry will have to plan over a long term. The 50% increase is going to cause the contribution made by livestock to the budget of the hon. the Minister of Transport to be reflected even more unfavourably next year. The contribution will be less than 76%. The cattle conveyed by the Railways during the past year showed a decrease of 0,9 million head as against the year before, and the reason for this lies in tariff problems. We slaughtered a tremendous number of animals at Vryburg and took the carcasses to the Witwatersrand consumer areas. Consequently I am glad that the hon. member for Bethal and various other hon. members are thinking in this direction.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for East London North had the same idea about decentralization. He mentioned refrigerated trucks. To decentralize and have refrigerated trucks as well, will not solve the whole problem. The hon. member must keep in mind that we cannot all of a sudden have cheaper meat because of decentralization. The refrigerated trucks have to be bought. However, the hon. member did put forward some positive ideas.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet was quite right when he referred to the De Villiers Commission with reference to the question asked by the hon. member for Newton Park. There it says quite clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The De Villiers Commission, which recommended after mature consideration that the function of control be exercised by an independent and expert body &#x2026;</block>

<p>and not by the Meat Board. The De Villiers Commission recommended that this work be done by an independent body. It is because of this that we have the abattoir Commission which is now to be changed. The hon. member also referred to Sishen and to the fact that we shall have to give attention to regional abattoirs.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bryanston is not here at the moment. The hon. member is a Prog, but he did not disappoint me so much as the hon. member for Newton Park. I came to respect him today. He asked for information and said quite frankly that he was not going to vote against the legislation. He did not play a trick as the hon. member for Newton Park did in saying they would vote on clause 28.</p>

<p>The hon. member made a very clever move today by saying that he was going to vote on clause 28 in the Committee Stage, and for only one purpose. However, he does not have a ghost of a chance to go and say in the country areas that he voted against clause 28 for the sake of the farmers. We get around too, after all. One finds a few people occasionally who are not quite all there, but the chance which the hon. member took today is not going to work out.</p>

The hon. member mentioned another point which is important, i.e. the question of hygiene. We are in a dilemma. An inquiry is being conducted into the abattoir at Pretoria, for example, and then one has big newspaper headlines on the front page of a newspaper in Pretoria, saying that salmonella has been found at the Pretoria abattoir.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is quite right. In my time we slaughtered cattle under the eucalyptus tree, and not one of the little Schoemans came to any harm. You must remember that when the housewife reads of salmonella in an abattoir, the hygiene men of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services rightly say that the Act must be enforced. But to enforce the Act and to obtain the highest degree of hygiene costs a fortune. If one wants to build new abattoirs and one wants to comply with all the requirements, it will cost a lot of money. To my mind, the best example is to be found in America. I arrived in Illinois and wanted to visit an abattoir where 3 000 head of cattle were slaughtered every day. They kept me away from it for a long time, but eventually I did get there. When I walked through the abattoir, they said to me:&#x201C;You have to wear gumboots. &#x201D; So they gave me my gumboots and I had to walk through blood and dung all day. So I asked them: &#x201C;Is this hygienic&#x003F;&#x201D; They said: &#x201C;Of course, yes, look at all the meat, it is not in the dung. You must remember this is not an export abattoir. &#x2019; &#x2019; Now, my goodness me, if an American can eat that meat, then a fellow living in Houghton can eat it as well. Hon. members must understand that I do not want us to be unhygienic. I just want to say to the hon. member for Omaruru that with today&#x2019;s building costs, expensive food, inflationary conditions and higher railway tariffs, we have to react to these matters to the best of our ability and in the most practical way. I have told the hon. member for Berea that I will accept his amendment. The hon. member for Barberton said that the efficiency on the part of the employee was not enough. We are investigating this and I shall reply to him on that point in the Committee Stage. As far as regional abattoirs are concerned, he agrees with other hon. members.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South must remember that the whole thing changed since we had the original Abattoir Commission Act. I told him that one could not actually compare the two functions. I agree with him that the sole responsibility goes over on to the Minister, but why&#x003F; The responsibility to erect a new abattoir is going over to the Government. We have decided to build a new abattoir at City Deep after the old one was 50 years old. The city council was not prepared to carry on with it. This would eventually have cost R12 million. We are completing it in September this year at a cost of nearly R23 million. We are now busy with a new abattoir at Cato Ridge which will cost R33 million when completed. Who has to foot the bill and take the responsibility&#x003F; This Government, through the Minister of Agriculture. The whole pattern has therefore changed.</p>

<p>*It is no use comparing the two pieces of legislation and saying that the Minister is getting too many powers, because the Government has been left holding the baby. I do not blame any municipality, because to erect an abattoir at current prices will cost a fortune, and therefore we want these powers, because it is Government money which has to be <span class="col_3123-3124" refersTo="page_0244"/>controlled. I shall explain to hon. members later why the Meat Board must not have a share in this. There are several reasons. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet has already referred to one. However, there are several reasons why we do not want the Meat Board to have a share in this activity. The hon. member was a member of the comission of inquiry and ought to know that the Meat Board takes decisions on marketing, etc. However, when it comes to a slaughtering function which used to be in the hands of the municipalities and which is now being transferred to the Government, we must have these powers.</p>

<p>I am afraid I got too excited for the hon. member for Newton Park, but I am not angry with him. It is just that I am having trouble with my voice, and I think I should prefer to discuss this further in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is intended to amend the Marketing Act, 1968. Hon. members are aware of the commission that has been appointed to investigate aspects of that Act, the recommendations of which still have to be considered. It will not be possible to introduce statutory amendments which may flow from these recommendations of the commission before next year. Unfortunately it will not be possible for the statutory amendments I am moving now to be held in abeyance until then.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, the Government pays consumer subsidies on various food products, <i>inter alia,</i> on bread as well. For various reasons, but particularly owing to the fact that a section of the population is still baking their own bread, the policy being followed is make the payment of the subsidy applicable to flour. However, flour is not only used for baking bread, but also for the manufacture of various other products, for example, glue. Therefore, it is obvious that people using flour for purposes other than for baking bread, also enjoy the benefit of the Government subsidy.</p>

<p>Up to now the Wheat Board has, where practical, recovered the subsidies from people using the flour for purposes other than the manufacture of bread. However, the Board sometimes experiences problems with the recovery of such subsidies and since considerable amounts of public money are involved, it is deemed advisable for the recovery to be based on specific statutory authorization. This Bill therefore makes provision enabling a control board to recover a subsidy paid in respect of a particular product in cases where such product is used in a manner for which the subsidy was not originally intended.</p>

<p>For the rest provision is being made in the Bill for certain law of evidence aspects relating to such recoveries.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this side of the House agrees with the amendment to the Marketing Act. We think it is necessary. A person who uses flour for a purpose other than to bake bread, has to be compelled to surrender the subsidy that has been paid, because the subsidy is intended for quite a different purpose. Since I do not want anything further to go wrong with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s throat, I am not going to say anything further except that we support this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that the hon. member for Newton Park supports this legislation and that he has so little to say about it, because it seems to me that the danger exists that the hon. member might land into trouble if he says too much. I am very pleased that we have this legislation in front of us this afternoon, particularly viewed in the light of the amounts of money this Government spends on food subsidies. We find that between R80 million and R90 million per annum is being spent to keep the price of bread to the consumer low. This matter has been raised on numerous occasions. There is a great diversity of opinions on the subsidies which are being paid to agriculture. Some people are of the opinion that a subsidy is only to the advantage of the farmer, while others again are of the opinion that it is only to the advantage of the consumer, and so on. In other words, various standpoints are being adopted <span class="col_3125-3126" refersTo="page_0245"/>on this matter. From time to time reservations are expressed to the effect that the subsidy which is being paid by the Government does not reach the consumer. It would be wrong for the Government to spend large sums of money for a certain purpose, i.e. to assist the consumer to obtain cheaper food on the one hand while, on the other hand to assist the producers to provide the consumer with cheaper food and for this money to disappear along the way. For this reason it is good that this legislation is serving before us this afternoon. As has been said by the hon. the Minister, since a commission has been appointed to investigate marketing, we cannot wait for the report of that commission to be published, and for that reason I think it is only right for him to rectify the deficiencies which are noticed from time to time. In this way we can consider legislation enacted in 1974 and which is closely linked with this legislation, i.e. Act 73 of 1974, which empowers the hon. the Minister to determine certain prices of secondary agricultural products himself, instead of this being done by the board. Moreover, this is partly in line with what is being envisaged by this legislation today. I think it is only right, and for that reason I am pleased that our Opposition also supports this Bill and, on behalf of this side of the House, I also want to give our support to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Section 2 of the Mountain Catchment Areas Act, 1970, makes provision for the Minister of Forestry to declare an area as defined by him in the <i>Government Gazette</i> to be a mountain catchment area and to make certain directions applicable to it. However, a mountain catchment area must be defined by means of a beacon to beacon boundary description so that there can be no doubt whatsoever in regard to its boundaries. Because all declared mountain catchment areas will consist of private farms or portions thereof, and the rights and duties of owners on their own land are being interfered with in the national interest, and also because possible prosecutions will arise as a result of offences in declared mountain catchment areas, it is necessary for the boundaries of such areas to be acceptable and immovable.</p>

<p>In those cases where mountain catchment areas include only portions of farms and it is not possible to define the boundaries of such portions by means of existing beacons or fixed landmarks, the possibility might be considered of including the whole of such farms in the catchment area and of declaring the directions for the management of the area to apply only <span class="col_3127-3128" refersTo="page_0246"/>to those portions of the farms which form part of the actual catchment area. This method will, however, have the disadvantage that the agricultural land which is included in the declared mountain catchment area in this way will not qualify for subsidies in terms of the Soil Conservation Act, 1969, as amended. Nor will it be possible to define the fire-belt around the mountain catchment area as its boundary because a fire-belt does not follow a fixed demarcated line year after year and therefore cannot be regarded as an immovable boundary.</p>

<p>The only solution, therefore, is to erect beacons where beacons do not already exist and then to define the area accordingly. For the purposes of court proceedings, however, a beacon must be surveyed in terms of the Land Survey Act, 1927, as amended. The surveying of all beaconless points on the boundaries of mountain catchment areas will not only involve considerable State expenditure but will also result in a delay in the demarcation of mountain catchment areas. The most acceptable solution will therefore be to make provision for the erection of unsurveyed, numbered beacons which can nevertheless be accepted as immovable in any civil or criminal case.</p>

<p>The Bill which is before the House is intended to give effect to this. Clause 1 of the Bill provides for unsurveyed beacons, which will be immovable, to be erected for the purpose of defining mountain catchment areas, while clause 2 gives the necessary right of entry on or way over private land to properly authorized persons for the performance of functions in connection with such beacons.</p>

<p>The form and dimensions of the beacons, the method of erection and maintenance thereof and other relevant matters will be prescribed by regulation, and this requires an addition to section 13 of the principal Act, as set out in clause 3.</p>

<p>Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill are merely aimed at making interference with a beacon an offence and extending the delegation of powers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support the Second Reading of this amending legislation which has come back to this House from the Other Place, as I understand it. An amendment to clause 2 was moved and agreed to in the Other Place. This amendment makes entry by officers or other persons upon certain land subject to prior notification of the landowner, occupier or manager concerned.</p>

<p>We are very glad indeed that that amendment has been accepted. We believe this will make the legislation more acceptable to the farming community, which is very largely the community affected by this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think one needs to follow expert opinion when it comes to the wording of legislation before the House. Various people have their own feelings and tastes in regard to how Bills should be worded, but it is not for me as a layman to comment on legal aspects. I have argued about phraseology with the legal experts, but it is the legal draftsmen who stipulate this usage. A point like this cannot really be argued across the floor of the House. I do have some sympathy with the hon. member. We want legislation in a language which is easy to comprehend, but easy language is not always the correct language, nor is it always acceptable to those authorities who draw up legislation.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have a problem with the words which have been added to clause 2 in the Other Place, i.e. the words &#x201C;subject to prior notification of the landowner, occupier or manager concerned&#x201D;. Mountain catchment areas are usually remote. One often finds that the owner of the farm or the landowner is a weekend farmer from the <span class="col_3129-3130" refersTo="page_0247"/>city or one that lives elsewhere in this country or abroad. That is often the case when it comes to most remote areas. When the poor man who has to do the work arrives there, he will find that he is unable to contact the owner. There are no provisions in respect of such an eventuality, where the owner cannot be found immediately. Therefore I have my doubts about the practical value of this part of the clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 2 deals with the entering of a person&#x2019;s property by an inspector or official in carrying out his duties. The legislation does not provide sufficiently for an official form of identification for such an inspector. Such identification has to be shown by the inspector or official of the department to the owner or a representative of the owner if such owner or representative of an owner can be contacted, so that the official or inspector will not be able to enter the site or property at will. The official must therefore be able to show specific identification to the owner or the representative of the owner.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Third Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the Third Reading does not call forth any discussion, I should like to refer briefly to the problem which the hon. member for Etosha raised during the Committee Stage, a problem which the hon. member for Mooi River has also raised before. I am referring to the practical implementation of the provisions included in clause 2. In the Other Place it was proposed that we should notify only the landowner concerned. I felt that would be very awkward, because these catchment areas are mountain areas, as the hon. member for Etosha said. If the workers arrive there and the owner is not there, they may not enter the land. Therefore I proposed there that we should only be enabled to notify not the owner, but also the occupier or manager, so that one would at least have a choice. Hon. members will just have to accept from me that my department does not usually enter people&#x2019;s land unnecessarily. Before they erect beacons, they will of course ensure that there are no problems and they will naturally notify the people concerned so that one should be able in practice to solve the problems which the hon. member foresees. I just wanted to explain that to the hon. member.</p>

<p>I should also like to express my appreciation at this stage to the hon. member for Mooi River for his support and co-operation in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Considerable uncertainty exists in legal and medical circles as to whether persons between the ages of 18 and 21 years may themselves and without the permission of their parents or <span class="col_3131-3132" refersTo="page_0248"/>guardians, agree to undergo an operation or medical treatment. The practice up to the present has nevertheless been to insist on such permission by the parent or guardian. In cases where the parent or guardian refuses such permission or where he cannot be traced or is unable, on account of mental illness, to give such permission, or in cases where he is deceased, the permission of the Minister or medical superintendent concerned is obtained in terms of the provisions of the Act.</p>

<p>Young people in the age group that I have mentioned, in many cases nowadays do not, however, stay with their parents and it is often difficult to obtain the necessary permission in time, in particular in cases of emergency. However, apart from the practical problems experienced in this connection, the uncertainty prevailing in this regard, creates considerable problems for the medical profession in particular. In fact, a medical practitioner who <i>bona fide</i> believes that the permission of an 18-year-old person is sufficient to carry out a serious operation on the latter, may subsequently discover that he has seriously erred and that such permission was invalid.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary for me to explain to hon. members how important this whole matter is to the medical profession, but I should nevertheless like to mention for the information of hon. members that the Federal Council of the Medical Association of South Africa has considered this matter of such importance that it has asked for something to be done about it.</p>

<p>In pursuance of that request, the Minister of Health consequently appointed an interdepartmental committee to investigate the matter. This committee found that considerable legal uncertainty does exist in regard to the whole matter and that it is, in fact, not possible to say with any certainty what the legal position in this particular connection is. It also appears that various countries in the Western world apparently had to deal with the same problem and have, in many cases, passed special legislation to legalize permission by minors for such operations or treatment.</p>

<p>I do not want to refer to all this legislation here, but for the information of hon. members I may mention briefly that a country such as, for example, Britain as far back as in 1970 granted 16-year-old persons statutory authority to give permission themselves to undergo their own medical treatment.</p>

<p>However, what is important, is that this legal uncertainty continues to exist with us and that it is not in the interest of our country and its people and certainly not in the interests of our young people that this uncertainty should continue to exist any longer. What is more, we cannot allow the medical profession which has so left its mark in our country to live in a state of uncertainty as to what it may and may not do. In fact, it is not impossible to say what we want to say or do in this connection, and for that reason we are in fact doing it in this Bill.</p>

<p>Hon. members may differ with me on the matter in which we are tackling this matter in this Bill and some of us may possibly feel that it is too much to grant a young person of 18 years of age the right to decide for himself whether or not he wants to undergo a particular operation or specific medical treatment. I readily admit that, depending upon the circumstances in a particular case, the question as to whether permission should be given for an operation or treatment could be a momentous one. However, may I remind hon. members that we have in more than one respect placed momentous decisions in the hands of 18-year-old persons. Just think of the franchise we gave them by means of which they are able and, in fact, called upon to make a decision in regard to momentous and even vitally important national issues. And to draw the parallel even closer, if we permit them and trust them to decide and to determine who is to represent the people in the highest Chambers of the country, on what grounds can we then say that they are not to be trusted with their own health&#x003F;</p>

<p>What is more, we not only allow them to participate in the democratic processes and to decide of their own accord what they want or do not want in the political sphere, but we also demand of them that they defend those democratic processes by force of arms. If we already trusted them with so much, on what grounds then do we want to withhold the right from them to decide on matters affecting their own health&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as I and the Government are concerned, we have sufficient confidence in our young people to leave to them decisions which, after all, affect them personally. We are now establishing certainty where uncertainty hitherto prevailed and, in doing so, we are perpetuating our confidence in the sound judgment of our own youth and, as you have <span class="col_3133-3134" refersTo="page_0249"/>no doubt noticed from paragraph (b) of clause 1, we are now affording their own decisions in regard to matters which, after all, affect their own health, the force of law.</p>

<p>This is what this Bill is dealing with, because the remainder of clause 1 merely consists of a number of amendments which are essential now that we have moved in the direction in which we are, in fact, moving.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House have no objection to the Second Reading of this Bill. It is a short Bill, consisting of just two clauses and the hon. the Deputy Minister has motivated the amendment contained in clause 1. This is perhaps an opportune moment to say that we on this side of the House welcome the hon. the Deputy Minister in his new capacity as Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions. We wish him well in his post. We know him in this House as a sincere man. In this portfolio he will be dealing with matters requiring humanity and compassion in many instances, and we have every confidence that he will acquit himself well in his new post. That is why we are pleased that this first piece of legislation the hon. the Deputy Minister has introduced in this House is of a positive nature, and is aimed at bringing about clarity where in the past there was a certain amount of uncertainty. In terms of the existing law there is a certain amount of uncertainty in regard to the position of the person who has not reached 21 years of age and who has to give consent to an operation or to medical treatment. It is interesting to note that in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act of 1960 the age mentioned in the definition of &#x201C;child&#x201D; was reduced from 19 to 18 years. Since that legislation was passed, other legislation has come before this House in which the age has been lowered. The Children&#x2019;s Act itself, however, is recognized as the legislation which provides protection for persons under 18 years of age, in terms of that definition of &#x201C;child&#x201D;. That is why, in clause 1, reference is now made to a &#x201C;child&#x201D;, as clearly defined in the Children&#x2019;s Act. The hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated various fields in which the discretion of a person who has attained the age of 18 years is recognized and accepted. He referred, for instance, to our electoral laws, the Liquor Act and other legislation. That is why we on this side of the House have no objection to this Bill. We realize that there have been difficulties in the past, and that the medical profession have asked for clarity. This clarity is now forthcoming. We therefore support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Umbilo has expressed the opinion of his side of this House. I should like to give the hon. the Deputy Minister, who is a very modest person, the assurance that we on this side of the House also have full confidence in the dignified manner in which he is handling this office. This legislation contains one basic concept, i.e. that the Government realizes that the youth, when reaching the age of 18, has full confidence in themselves and also accept full responsibility for life in all respects. This legislation therefore only contains an adjustment in terms of which we admit that when a young man or a young woman becomes 18 years of age, he or she is fully capable of deciding upon his or her own physical conditions.</p>

<p>I further want to point out that the term &#x201C;mental illness&#x201D; is now being substituted for the former concept of &#x201C;mental disorder&#x201D;. We welcome this adjustment which is in line with the new approach in respect of the treatment of psychiatric illnesses.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>I do not believe hon. members will have any difficulty in establishing that this Bill deals for the most part with the extension of the period of office of members of the National Welfare Board and of the Regional Welfare Boards and of the various commissions appointed in terms of the National Welfare Act of 1965. Perhaps hon. members will wonder why such a step should be necessary at this stage.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is still somewhat early to go into this in detail, but nevertheless I feel that I owe it to the House to sketch briefly the necessity for the steps we are taking.</p>

<p>We feel that the time has come for the establishment of a dynamic welfare programme in which the planning and co-ordination of welfare services will play a key role. As we see it, the community, in pursuance of existing policy, ought always to become more closely involved with the future developments in the sphere of welfare which are at issue here.</p>

<p>It can therefore be stated that communal action is fundamental to the developments at issue here where the community, in co-operation with the department, will have a say in, and will take a hand in, the interests of the community. In practice it is envisaged that the regional welfare boards and the department&#x2019;s regional organizations will be merged and developed into conferring and planning teams which will determine, plan and promote the welfare needs and welfare services of the various regions, and advise the department in this regard. In this way it is anticipated that it will be possible to obtain a blueprint of the welfare services which may be required in a specific region and that this may then be implemented systematically. What this will amount to is that the welfare requirements of every region will be systematically investigated and determined and the necessary steps may then be taken in good time to meet those needs.</p>

<p>These developments, however, will cause a radical change of emphasis in the activities of regional welfare boards and may even result in the way the boards are constituted at present, having to be changed.</p>

<p>The practical implementation of the developments we have in mind, imply, too, that the National Welfare Act will probably have to be revised drastically and could even result in a new dispensation being created for the National Welfare Board. The views of the department in this specific connection have already been discussed with the National Welfare Board and the Board is in full agreement in this regard.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned for the further information of hon. members that the developments at issue here will in all probability require a great deal of legislation, and I hope that we shall be able to have it ready for introduction by 1977. However, hon. members will understand that at this stage I am unable to discuss in full or in greater detail any legislation envisaged in this connection. This is not the time to discuss such legislation. I merely refer to this in order to provide hon. members briefly with the necessary background against which the necessity for the legislation at present before this hon. House must be considered. From what I have already said it must already be clear to hon. members that the continued existence of the National Welfare Board and of the various regional welfare boards within the present set-up, is at stake. The same applies to the four commissions appointed in terms of the National Welfare Act of 1965.</p>

<p>The period of office of the members of the boards in question and of the four commissions expires on 30 June 1976. These members <span class="col_3137-3138" refersTo="page_0251"/>are usually appointed for a period of five years, and therefore, if they are appointed again this year, their next term will only expire in 1981. In view of the developments envisaged, which I have tried to sketch to you briefly, it seems to me that it would be prudent to extend the period of office of the present boards by a year or 18 months, rather than constitute new boards which would then have to be dissolved after a year or 18 months, when the new boards were to come into operation under the new dispensation. We consider that it would also be less disruptive if the present boards and commissions could continue with and dispose of the work on which they are engaged before the start of the new dispensation, than if new boards had now to be appointed, boards which before long would have to be dissolved again before getting fully into their stride.</p>

<p>This whole matter has been discussed at length with the National Welfare Board. The Board agrees that the procedure we envisaged in this connection is the most acceptable. The idea, therefore, is simply to extend the period of office of the boards and the commissions by a year or 18 months, but at most by two years, so that they may carry on with their activities undisturbed and so that we shall be afforded the opportunity to prepare the necessary legislation and take the other steps necessary for the further development of the new directions we have in mind. It is probably not impossible that the whole process may be completed by the end of next year, but for safety&#x2019;s sake we are making somewhat more ample provision, particularly since further discussions are still necessary in this particular connection. As hon. members are aware, such discussion can sometimes be time-consuming.</p>

<p>The fundamental aims of clause 2 are simply to extend the period of validity of the nomination lists drawn up in terms of the Act so that they may be used if vacancies occur on the boards after 30 June 1976.</p>

<p>I do not wish to imply that I have now replied to all the questions which have occurred to hon. members, or that I have satisfied their desire for further information relating to the developments we envisage, but I believe that this is as far as I can go for the present. I trust that I shall be afforded the opportunity next year to inform them in detail when we introduce the necessary legislation. For the present, however, I want to content myself with saying that I believe that we are preparing the scene for a development which, in my opinion, will place the welfare services of this country on a sound basis with unlimited possibilities for the future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated the reasons why this Bill is necessary and why the periods of office of the National Welfare Board, the various commissions and the regional boards should be extended. As his main reason he told us that the whole question of the co-ordination and replanning of the welfare services in South Africa was under consideration, that there was a possibility of legislation being introduced during the course of the 1977 session of Parliament, and that it was therefore necessary that the present boards, commissions and regional boards should remain in office for a period of at least two years so as to give them an opportunity to complete the work that is necessary in the various aspects of welfare services that require the attention of the boards. For this reason we intend supporting the Second Reading of the Bill, in view of the fact that it is necessary that the lives of the boards should be extended while this important planning stage is being dealt with.</p>

<p>However, were it not for the fact that it was necessary in these circumstances for the periods of office of these boards to be extended, we on this side of the House would have had to have given very serious consideration to opposing a Bill which would have extended the life of the various boards. I would like to just mention this fact, because I believe it is important to bear this in mind when other legislation eventually comes before the House and the reasons for extending the life of this particular board and these commissions is given. When the principal Act of 1965, establishing the various boards, was passed, it was felt that it would be in the best interests of the welfare services to proceed along these lines. We on this side of the House supported that legislation and made various suggestions. The regional boards, as constituted for a period of five years, from 1 July 1971 until a date mentioned in the Bill, i.e. 30 June 1976, when their period of office would normally expire, did not inspire us with a great deal of confidence because we did not believe they were balanced as far as the various groups and the various sections of our community <span class="col_3139-3140" refersTo="page_0252"/>were concerned. That is why we would have had to give very serious consideration before supporting a Bill of this nature which would extend the life of these boards.</p>

<p>In regard to the nomination list that was submitted when the members of these boards were to be appointed&#x2014;and let me say that this hon. Minister is not the person who appointed the boards; I think the present Minister of the Interior was then the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions&#x2014;it came as quite a shock to us when these boards were appointed and we then found that the members had been drawn almost entirely from a certain section of our community whereas they should have been more widely based. It would have been much better balanced if the other sections of our community had been taken into account as well. Let us look at one of these commissions whose period of office will be extended for another two years. I am referring to the Welfare Organizations Commission, a commission that deals with some 2 000 welfare organizations and that has to consider and review the applications for registration of other welfare organizations. The seven members are all Afrikaans speaking. I do not object to this. Obviously it is a question of merit, and a person has to be appointed on merit. However, it does seem imbalanced if one considers the fact that although many of the English universities submitted names on the nomination list, not one of these persons was appointed either on the welfare board consisting of 16 members or on one of the four commissions consisting of seven members each, making a total number of members on the board and the commissions of 44. I believe too that, as times change, the large number of organizations which are catering for the other racial groups, the non-White racial groups, must be taken into account. Surely it is time that they too must be considered when their names are submitted on a nomination list. In terms of clause 2 the nomination lists are kept open so that vacancies can be filled, should they occur on the welfare board, the commissions or the regional boards. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if, during the extended period of two years for which the board will be in office, such vacancies should occur, to give the matter due consideration so as to ensure that there will be a better balance as far as the boards are concerned so as to cater for the wide spectrum of the community in South Africa. In view of the special circumstances the hon. the Deputy Minister has outlined we support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry that the hon. member for Umbilo availed himself of this opportunity to discuss the composition of the boards. If we want to shock the House, then I can tell the House what we found when we came to power in 1949 in connection with the first board. At that time we had to provide people on the board with a translation of what we had said if we had spoken Afrikaans, to enable them to understand what we were saying. And then the hon. member talks about &#x201C;imbalanced boards&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The chief aim of the Bill is to assist us in carrying on with the work that has been started. The present board, the four commissions and the nine regional boards have shown up many of the shortcomings of the present Act and its implementation. The board, the commissions and the regional boards welcome the opportunity they have been afforded to consider draft legislation which is being prepared in view of the nature their experience over the years.

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members are likely to have noticed already, the impact of the Bill is contained in clauses 2 and 3. Consequently I want to pause for a moment at these two clauses and briefly sketch the circumstances which gave rise to the amendments proposed in these clauses.</p>

<p>Section 4 of the Aged Persons Act, 1967, confers certain powers of inspection on, <i>inter alia,</i> social welfare officers. As hon. members are aware these powers are, however, limited to inspections of registered homes for the aged, with the emphasis on the word &#x201C;registered&#x201D;. Therefore, we now have the curious position that although a social welfare officer may inspect the home which is registered and therefore has already been approved by my department and may investigate the welfare and treatment of the aged person in such a home, he has to adopt a completely different procedure when it comes to aged persons who are accommodated and cared for in an unregistered place.</p>

<p>Section 5 of the Act admittedly makes provision for action in the case of aged persons who are being cared for in unregistered places, but before a social welfare officer may take action in terms of that section, he nevertheless requires information. However, it appears that he cannot acquire it by way of an inspection, as in the case of a registered home. The result is that any action which he may consider necessary in the interest of the aged persons in a specific case is frequently delayed and that he is frequently prevented, within the limits of the Act, from taking the rapid action which is sometimes necessary for the welfare of aged persons who are being cared for in some of these places. Unfortunately there are people who operate homes for the aged as a business for their own gain. There are also those who do not always have the welfare of the aged persons at heart, but for whom the profit motive is more important. Consequently we have a responsibility to ensure that these people are cared for properly.</p>

<p>What is more, inquiries in terms of section 6 of the Act, take a considerable time and it is hardly possible to wait until such inquiries have been completed before looking after the welfare of the aged persons in question. In fact, it has recently happened that officers of my department were refused access to aged persons who were being accommodated in a place in respect of which an inquiry in terms of section 6 was in progress. It is probably not necessary for me to explain how imperative it is to guard diligently over the interest and welfare of such aged persons, particularly in cases where circumstances are such that an inquiry in terms of the Act ought to be instituted.</p>

<p>We cannot allow the curious position to continue where homes who fail or refuse to register in terms of the Act, or which apparently do not qualify for such registration, enjoy more protection than homes which comply with all the requirements and have been registered in terms of the Act. We are now rectifying the position by means of clause 2.</p>

<p>Section 6(10) of the Act confers certain powers on a magistrate who has instituted an inquiry into the accommodation and care of aged or debilitated persons. Unfortunately that section provides, <i>inter alia</i> that the magistrate who holds the inquiry may prohibit the person involved in the inquiry from accommodating or caring for an aged or debilitated person for the period determined by the magistrate. However, there is uncertainty as to whether such prohibition may be imposed for a longer period than three years, or whether such a prohibition may be applied in another district than that of the magistrate concerned. This matter is also being rectified in the Bill, because we believe that a person who has allowed aged persons to be neglected in one place, should not be allowed to do so in another district. As in the case of the previous Bills there is nothing in the clause of this Bill either in regard to which we could differ in any way.</p>

<p>This is a constructive Bill and we intend supporting the Second Reading. [Interjections.] I cannot quite hear what the hon. member for Carltonville is upset about&#x2014;perhaps it is because the Committee Stage of the previous Bill went through without debate. If he so wishes, we can of <span class="col_3143-3144" refersTo="page_0254"/>course keep debate on legislation of this kind going for a considerable period of time. There are many items here which require comment. We realize that a certain amount of abuse by certain people has been taking place, people who are unfortunately prepared to exploit the provision of accommodation for aged and debilitated persons. Consequently it is important to see that, where there are loopholes in the existing legislation, where a degree of exploitation is taking place which can be rectified by legislation, steps are taken so as to obviate the exploitation of these people. Indeed, the original Aged Persons Act of 1967, which was first introduced to the House as the Aged Persons Protection Bill, has been amended from time to time. The position as far as the pensions that are payable to aged persons are concerned is that it was deleted from the principal Act when the Social Pensions Act of 1973 was introduced and passed by this House. Consequently, the principal Act, as it stands today, is looked upon as an Act to protect aged persons from exploitation. There is no doubt that where this exploitation has taken place, this legislation will facilitate an investigation in terms especially of clause 2, whereby places will be more accessible to the social welfare officers to obtain the necessary information about places which are principally being provided for the accommodation and care of these aged and debilitated persons.</p>

<p>If one looks at this clause one sees that the inspector will be entitled to examine any document or book a person might have in his possession at such a home for aged and debilitated persons. This is important, because in the past some of these people have taken advantage of these old people in that they had in their possession the pension books of these people and on their own initiative assumed financial responsibility for these people. Therefore it is necessary that the department&#x2019;s inspector and the social welfare officer should be entitled to demand these documents. We know there is the possibility that a person can be in doubt whether the social welfare officer in fact has the right to demand these documents, and that is why it is provided here that he must have authority to do so and must produce a certificate to show that he is indeed an authorized officer with power to demand these documents. This is important, because we must also bear in mind that there are cases where these people might not be exploiting the aged and indeed might be providing a very good service for them. Certain unfounded complaints might have been lodged and therefore it is only right that a person who runs a home for the aged should have the protection of knowing that he can demand that the inspector should produce a certificate to show that he has the right to inspect and demand these various documents. There are people who are in fact providing accommodation which is found&#x2014;after inspection&#x2014;to be suitable and then no steps need be taken against that person. Unfortunately there have been cases where it was necessary to take steps against some of these people, and it has been found necessary, in cases of persons who have registered homes for the aged, to withdraw that registration until such time as the person responsible for administering such a home, is able to meet the requirements of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions.</p>

<p>This leads me to clause 3. The hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated that there will be a Republic-wide prohibition on a person administering such a home if he is found guilty of not having provided a home that meets the necessary requirements. The hon. the Deputy Minister did not indicate the reason for the limitation of ten years as may be determined by the magistrate. The original Act did not specify any particular period. The hon. the Deputy Minister has also dealt with the question of people who are not permitted to run a home for the aged in certain magisterial areas. This is now being extended Republic-wide and will therefore be enforced throughout the Republic. We on this side of the House support the provision that makes a Republic-wide provision, because it would be most improper for a person who has been exploiting the aged and debilitated persons, to open a similar home or provide accommodation for these people in another magisterial area or district without having the necessary authority.</p>

<p>The Bill, as it now stands, is an improvement on the principal Act, and therefore, as far as the principle is concerned, we accept this Bill. We hope it will have the desired effect of stamping out an undesirable element which, unfortunately, takes advantage of the aged in certain circumstances.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill before us is a very brief one, but it is also a very important one, dealing as it does with a growing population of aged persons in South Africa. It is important to note, from the latest report of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions for the period 1972-&#x2019;74, that as far as South Africa&#x2019;s White population is concerned, the percentage of aged persons in homes for the aged is higher than in most other developed countries. Here we are dealing with a piece of legislation which has as its fundamental thrust or principle an attempt to protect the aged against exploitation. The hon. the Deputy Minister in his Second Reading speech on Friday pointed to the incidence of exploitation and potential exploitation. It is a matter of real tragedy that this kind of protective legislation should even be necessary. We know, however, that there are people who will use any opportunity to further their own ends, even at the expense of those who are unable to protect themselves. Here one thinks especially of small children and, of course, the aged as well. One is grateful, therefore, that this Bill provides that additional protection. Firstly, it makes it possible for inspectors and other officials to visit and to inspect not only those institutions which are registered, but unregistered institutions as well. It also makes it clear that anyone found to be neglecting of exploiting the aged will be guilty of an offence. I am sure that there is no member in this House who will not agree that it is essential that those who are guilty of such exploitation should be most severely punished. We support the increased powers given by this Bill and we support its Second Reading.</p>

<p>I should like to refer briefly to some of the developments which have taken place in this field, because one seldom has an opportunity in the House to devote any time at all to geriatrics and the care of the aged. The subject of the care of the aged is receiving far greater attention today than at any other time. The advance of medical science means that people are, on the average, living longer. One therefore simply has to give more time, more manpower and more finance to the care of the aged. I would suggest that geriatrics is now at the stage at which paediatrics was about 25 years ago. At that time, in the medical profession and generally, children were regarded as little adults and were cared for in that kind of way. Of course, things are very different today. Paediatrics has become a highly specialized science and area of medical care. I submit that geriatrics is beginning to move in the same direction. Old or elderly people are not merely old adults. This is a very highly specialized area of service. Of course we have to have homes for the aged, and we have a number of them in many parts of the country.</p>

<p>In many other parts of the world, however, and to an extent here in South Africa as well, there is a move away from that towards what may be termed a community based domiciliary care. If one looks at page 39 of the recent departmental report to which I referred earlier, one is gratified and encouraged to read of the step which was taken in 1971 by the department, i.e. the establishment of an entirely new scheme for the housing of the aged. This scheme provides for the erection of local authorities, welfare organizations and utility companies, of group housing comprising specially adapted flatlets for elderly married couples and single persons. That scheme was instituted sometime ago, and I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister, in introducing legislation which to an extent is negative&#x2014;in other words, a protective measure&#x2014;will also do his utmost, as I am sure he will, to expedite this scheme which was introduced in May 1971. Since the scheme was introduced applications have been approved for 60 such projects with a total of 752 double and 1 795 single flats. Some of these projects have been completed, but according to this report, most are still, five years later, in the planning or construction stage. It has been found by the department that there is a particular need for flats for single people, mainly for widows. The <span class="col_3147-3148" refersTo="page_0256"/>co-operation of officials, welfare organizations and other institutions in the case of the aged is to be encouraged. However, I want to suggest that we go even further. When one thinks of the inflation one faces today, one realizes the need to increase productivity by making the best possible use of all our available sources. And when one thinks of the enormous skills and experience which is locked up in the minds and lives of many of our senior citizens, something which we should seriously consider in our attempt to care for and administer to the aged in South Africa, is the creation of an employment agency in order to avoid aged people lapsing into senile decay, as so often happens, but to allow them to retain their independence for as long as possible and continue to serve the country as they have done in the past. We welcome this legislation and support its Second Reading.</p>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we think of debilitated persons, hon. members will certainly agree with me when I say that this is a growing problem. It is not that we want to reject debilitated aged persons who cannot look after themselves. Unfortunately there is an enormous increase in numbers as far as these aged persons are concerned. Unfortunately we also have the phenomenon that the children are no longer inclined, out of gratitude for what their parents have done for them, to care for their parents we used to care for our parents, especially if the old people are in a condition where they need some extra treatment.</p>

<p>As I have said, this is becoming a growing problem. To illustrate this, I can tell hon. members that the number of ordinary aged persons in subsidized old-age homes has increased by 13%&#x2014;from 5 300 to 6 200 during the period 1970-&#x2019;74. On the other hand, the number of debilitated aged persons has increased by 186%&#x2014;from 2 050 to 6 350 during the same period. The considerable increase in the number of debilitated aged persons can certainly be ascribed to many causes.</p>

<p>Hon. members on both sides of the House will certainly agree with me when I say that the Government has a proud record as far as caring for its aged persons is concerned. As has been said by the hon. member for Pinelands, this is being done to such an extent that proportionately more aged persons are being cared for in old-age homes in South Africa than in most other developed countries of the world.</p>

<p>Aged persons have always occupied a special place in our society. This is perhaps one of the subjects one could discuss in very sentimental terms especially when it comes to the debilitated aged persons who are neglected. It is unfortunately a fact that the Government cannot care of all of them in institutions and that many of the old people therefore live in private institutions. I want to say immediately that we are grateful towards the people who are doing such excellent work in the private institutions without their having any other thought in mind than to render a service. However, it is also a fact that, unfortunately, we sometimes come across unscrupulous people who exploit and maltreat aged persons who are destitute. For that reason we are grateful that the hon. the Deputy Minister has introduced this amending Bill to protect and promote the interests of probably the most destitute people. We particularly welcome the amending Bill, because it is being envisaged to have inspections carried out without unnecessary delays at unregistered institutions where the motive to make a profit is more important than the motive to render a service. In the implementation of this legislation we should not merely be looking for offences.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister that some guidance be given to the aged persons in such unregistered institutions during inspections. We are dealing here with the most uniformed and helpless people when it comes to the services they are entitled to. For instance I have in mind here free medical services which they are entitled to. They are afraid that when they receive medical treatment and have to acquire medicine, they would be held responsible for those accounts or that the people who run the institution would be held responsible for such accounts. It is these people who are the loneliest and most destitute people and who have no one to whom they are able to complain. For that reason I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister that such inspections should not only be aimed at looking for offences, but should also be used to give guidance to prevent aged persons from being neglected unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to thank the hon. members for Umbilo, Pinelands and Boksburg for supporting this Bill and for what they have said. There is not very much I have to reply to. In reply to the question about the 10-year period which the hon. member for Umbilo put to me, I want to tell him that this resulted from a complaint which was received in connection with a place of care in the Benoni area where a magistrate, in his judgment, stated that he was unsure as to whether he could grant a period of more than three years. We think that to impose a sentence which will be almost indefinite in that it exceeds a period of ten years, would perhaps be unfair and that conditions could change in a period of 10 years. That is why we are suggesting a period of 10 years.</p>

<p>It could be, but I take it that the people passing judgment, in their wisdom, will be as lenient as possible. However, if there is a repetition of this kind of thing, then I think we should give them the power to extend it to ten years.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Pinelands for his support. He has rightly pointed out all the problems that we shall be faced with in future and those which we are at present already facing. As I said during the Second Reading, we intend introducing legislation next year which will cover a wide field, including the aspects which he raised.</p>

<p>*As far as the hon. member for Boksburg is concerned, I want to tell him that I am pleased about the suggestion he made, because I should not like this Bill being regarded only as an attempt to prosecute people. It is, after all, a fact that welfare work in South Africa, more than any other work, shows that a service is being rendered by the people to the people. It would be a pity if the tendency for people to render services themselves by means of welfare organizations, and soon, were to disappear and that people are going to be afraid of rendering services for fear of being prosecuted. For that reason I should like to assure the hon. member for Boksburg that we shall most certainly instruct our inspectors not only to look for things that might be wrong in both unregistered homes and registered homes, but, as far as possible, also to furnish old people and those caring for them, with advice and guidance on what they are entitled to.</p>

<p>Question agreed to.</p>

<p>Bill read a Second Time.</p>

<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause deals with the powers of inspection. The hon. the Deputy Minister, in the course of his reply to the Second Reading debate, indicated that it was not the intention of the department to discourage persons who are providing some form of accommodation for aged or debilitated persons. In terms of this clause the word &#x201C;registered&#x201D; is to be deleted and certain other words are to be incorporated whereby the social welfare officer will have the right at any time to visit or inspect any home. This therefore refers not only to a registered home, but also to an unregistered home where any aged persons are being accommodated or where any provision is being made for their care. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether the interpretation of this clause means that there will be no limitation as far as the number of persons who are being accommodated, is concerned. The position has been that a person would have to be accommodating more than eight or 10 persons, or a specific number of persons, before he could really be considered as merely accommodating for remuneration of a certain category or type of person. In terms of this clause it would appear that even if one person is being accommodated at one private home, the social welfare officer will have the right at any time to visit and inspect that home and also have the powers referred to in the latter sections of this clause in terms of which he can demand any documents which a person might have in regard to an aged or debilitated person who may be accommodated in that home. I therefore wish to ask whether there is any limitation in regard to the powers of inspection being provided for in this clause before a person can be classified as actually <span class="col_3151-3152" refersTo="page_0258"/>providing a home or a place for the care of the aged.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to reply briefly to the hon. member&#x2019;s question by saying that the problem which we are faced with is not primarily the number of persons affected by ill-treatment or lack of treatment. One may at one stage have 10 persons accommodated at a home. Nine may then leave, and one may be compelled to stay for some reason. That is why we do not specify the number of persons to be accommodated. I am also informed that, whereas in the case of homes for children all these homes have to be registered, there is some uncertainty as to whether the welfare board can refuse to register certain of these welfare organizations. Therefore, the position may arise where two or three people are accommodated at one stage and that their numbers may rise to 10 the very next day. This could happen in a private home as well and therefore we also want the powers to inspect those homes.</p>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause contains the definitions which will apply throughout this Bill when it becomes an Act. It is from this clause that we get a clue as to what exactly the hon. the Minister is asking for. The hon. the Minister will recollect that during the Second Reading debate on this measure, I did raise with him the confusion that exists, as we see it, through this Bill, regarding certain provisions which refer to proclaimed areas and other provisions which do not mention proclaimed areas at all. It would appear that there are provisions in this Bill which will apply only to certain areas, while there are other provisions which will apply throughout the Republic, in other words, irrespective of whether those areas are proclaimed or not.</p>

<p>In terms of definition (xxii) a &#x201C;proclaimed area&#x201D; is &#x201C;any area which the State President may from time to time by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> declare to be a proclaimed area for the purposes of this Act&#x201D;. Unfortunately the hon. the Minister was precluded from replying fully to me during the Second Reading debate, and so I would like to refresh his memory by pointing out that it appears that, in terms of clause 10, the hon. the Minister may prohibit the erection of an abattoir within a proclaimed area. However, I find no provision whereby he will be enabled to prohibit or in any way control the erection of an abattoir in any other area. Similarly clause 13 allows the hon. the Minister to control the alterations which may be made to an abattoir within a controlled area, but no control whatsoever exists outside the proclaimed area. He may direct the corporation to take over an abattoir in a proclaimed area. He may issue orders which owners of abattoirs in proclaimed areas will have to comply with, but he may also prohibit the use of an abattoir anywhere; not only in a proclaimed area, but anywhere. He may also direct the closure of an abattoir anywhere in the Republic, and South West Africa, incidentally. He may direct the corporation to erect an abattoir anywhere in the Republic, not only in proclaimed areas. He can fix tariffs for any abattoir in the Republic, not only in the proclaimed areas, and he may of course direct the commission to conduct an inquiry regarding abattoirs anywhere within the Republic. This last provision we can accept. Finally, he may impose levies in respect of abattoirs, not only on those within a proclaimed area, but also on those outside.</p>

<p>This has led to quite a lot of confusion, and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could tell us what his thoughts are on this matter. [Interjections.] My hon. friend reminds me that you can have an inquiry into any abattoir, whether it is in a proclaimed area or outside it. Now, the first question is: What does the hon. the Minister envisage will be the areas which will be proclaimed&#x003F; Are they to conform to the present controlled areas in terms of the meat scheme&#x003F; It is really his intention that any person may erect an abattoir outside of these proclaimed areas without any let or hindrance, with no &#x201C;by your leave&#x201D; from anybody&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_3153-3154" refersTo="page_0259"/>Because that would appear to be the situation as far as the erection is concerned. I know that as far as the operation is concerned, that abattoir owner will have to comply with the Animal Meat Products and Hygiene Act. But there appears to be confusion, that there will be no control over the erection of abattoirs outside the proclaimed areas, and of course, coupled with this is the whole question of registration. Nowhere do we find any provision here for the registration of abattoirs. Will the hon. the Minister know what is going on outside the proclaimed areas if he has no control over the erection and, secondly, he has no provision for the registration of abattoirs&#x003F; I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can throw some light on this particular subject.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think if the hon. member will look at this thing in practice, he will see that nobody is prepared to erect an abattoir today because of the costs. As I have told hon. members, with the exception of Maitland in Cape Town, none of the municipalities are prepared to carry on with the operation of abattoirs. Now, we did not spell it out in this clause although we can do so if that will make the hon. member happy. The position is if you want to erect an abattoir today in the controlled areas, you must get a permit from the Meat Board. Under the scheme that we have to prevent overtrading, we could not allow people even when the erection of abattoirs was still economical, with cheaper steel and cement, etc., to erect abattoirs without obtaining a permit from the Meat Board.</p>

<p>*The requirement still exists today. If a new man wishes to erect an abattoir in the controlled area, he has to obtain a permit for it. We have made an evaluation of what the abattoir requirements are and we have given private permits to five companies, but not one of them has built. They obtained it two years ago. They all say that the building costs are too high today, and therefore we are spending the R24 million, through the Abattoir Commission, to build the City Deep abattoir which will be finished by August. Therefore this is no problem in practice. The hon. member says we have no registration. That is so. We do not want to register small abattoirs, because they usually are in the hands of small municipalities and they fall under the Hygiene Act, where the hygiene inspection of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services applies to them. For what purpose should we register&#x003F; What is the use of registering an abattoir at Nylstroom, for example&#x003F; It will not assist us in any way and it will not simplify things.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The question is whether we must impose a levy. The levies are imposed to help the municipality which is still busy with an abattoir, to cover the costs. If they say that they want a levy in a non-controlled area, because it is an abattoir which cannot show a profit, then we have the power under this legislation to help them to impose levies to pay for the cost of the operation of the abattoir.</p>

<p>Yes, it is the tariff. The tariff is applicable to cover the cost of the abattoir. I believe we shall always be prepared in future to make an amendment, if some of the objections raised by hon. members should prove to be real and should hamper the application of the Act. If perhaps I do not quite understand the hon. member at the moment, he may tell me later and I could change it in the Other Place as well. Perhaps he is seeing a point which I have not noticed.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to one little point which is in the latest report of the Secretary for the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, the latest report I have access to. With regard to abattoirs, the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although the commission finds it difficult to establish contact with all abattoirs in South West Africa, owing to the extent of the territory, 15 public and nine private abattoirs have already been registered.</block>

<p>I believe that is the aim of the hon. member behind me. When I speak about control, I do not mean that every little thing that people do should be looked into, but control in the interests of our meat industry in the country. Because difficulty has been experienced up to now in contacting everyone, just in South <span class="col_3155-3156" refersTo="page_0260"/>West Africa, the hon. the Minister must be very sure that we know which abattoirs he is referring to. Is it just those in the proclaimed areas&#x003F; If that is so, is it not necessary to go a bit further&#x003F; Therefore I can believe the hon. the Minister would be wise to give a little more consideration to this matter and then, if it is necessary, to change this legislation in the Other Place.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, section 4 of the Act of 1964 lays down very clearly what the functions and the powers of this commission are. I pointed out to the hon. the Minister during the Second Reading debate that an important aspect had been omitted in the proposed legislation. I am referring to the fact that the commission is also intended to render financial assistance for studies and research with regard to abattoirs. I see that this function does not appear in clause 3 of the Bill. As far as I can remember, the hon. the Minister has not even given us an explanation about that particular point. As far as I am concerned, this is surely one of the most important functions of such a commission. Surely it should encourage study and research and, if necessary, it should also make available the necessary bursaries to the universities, especially for post-graduate study in this field. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister why this function is not being taken over from the old commission. If he still wants that function to be fulfilled, in terms of which clause in this legislation will it be possible&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the powers of this new corporation in terms of clause 28 are so wide as far as the application of its funds is concerned that it will also be able to provide bursaries.

<p>Clause 4:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are dealing here with a clause which provides for the constitution of the commission. It provides for the fact that the hon. the Minister, on his own, acting entirely <i>in vacuo</i>&#x2014;he need not consult with anyone else, let alone take their advice&#x2014;may appoint from three to five persons to serve on what would be the Abattoir Commission of the future. During the Second Reading debate I did raise the question of the tremendous burden and responsibility which the hon. the Minister is taking on his shoulders in this particular Bill. No longer is he establishing a commission which is going to do anything. It is going to be a commission with solely an advisory function. It has no executive function at all. Who is going to benefit from the establishment of this particular commission&#x003F; I believe that the persons who will benefit most will be the meat producers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>And the consumers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The meat producers are primarily going to benefit from this. The consumers will benefit to a degree, but basically it is the meat producer who is going to get the benefit from this. As testimony, I want to point out the fact that, if one goes through this Bill as we shall be doing today, one will find that it is the beef producer, i.e. the farmer, who is going to pay for this commission, and no one else. Because of that, I believe the meat producer should in some way be recognized in the establishment of this commission. I believe it is only fair that an organization representing all the meat producers in the country should have the opportunity <span class="col_3157-3158" refersTo="page_0261"/>of nominating at least one person to serve on this commission for the Minister. There is only one body I know of that is representative of all the meat producers, whether it be mutton, pork or beef. I refer to the S. A. Agricultural Union. I believe that, when the hon. the Minister constitutes the commission, he should consult with the Meat Commodity Committee of the S.A. Agricultural Union.</p>

<p>If I may digress for one moment, I think the S.A. Agricultural Union has for too long been ignored in our legislation. I believe we should give recognition to that body in our legislation since it represents all the producers in the country, whether they be meat producers or any other primary producers. For that reason I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 7, to add the following proviso at the end of subsection (1):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that one member shall be a nominee of the Meat Commodity Committee of the South African Agricultural Union.</block>

<p>The hon. member says the farmer is going to have to pay for the levies, the erection of abattoirs, etc. I told him last Friday that in determining the floor price for beef, mutton and pork, all cost increases to the farmer are taken into consideration. Such cost increases are added to the floor price. That serves as a protection for the farmer to produce. In effect, if the price goes below the floor price, the Meat Board buys it in. Consequently, I think the hon. member is completely wrong when he says the farmer is going to pay for all these expenses.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now the hon. member wants to play politics. I know him.</p>

<p>The Meat Board is a control board in terms of the Marketing Act. Its powers are defined in that Act. The control board&#x2019;s jurisdiction is limited to those matters to which its scheme authorizes it. If the function which it has as far as abattoirs are concerned, is assigned to this board by means of special legislation, it will mean that on the one hand the board will be carrying out its scheme and on the other hand will have to apply the Abattoir Act. Whatever the position of the S.A. Agricultural Union may be, it nominates a member of the Meat Board to serve on this body. This is the very difficulty we have, because the Meat Board is a producers&#x2019; board and the majority of the members of the Meat Board rightly are producers&#x2014;this is why we have such a good Marketing Act. The producers are in the majority on all the control boards. The Meat Board exercises marketing control only at public abattoirs in the controlled areas. Abattoir control, on the other hand, is country-wide and includes South West Africa, where the Meat Board has no jurisdiction in any event. I want to accept that what the hon. member said is correct, but this commission has to operate not only in the Republic but also in South West Africa. In what sort of situation is a man placed if he has to serve on this commission&#x003F;</p>

<p>At present the State has immense financial interest in the erection of new abattoirs. To secure the State&#x2019;s financial interests, direct control by the Minister, as proposed, would be preferable to control by an autonomous body such as the Meat Board. To be specific, the Meat Board would be involved in the matter of <span class="col_3159-3160" refersTo="page_0262"/>taking decisions. It is well-known that control boards, because of their composition, sometimes have sectional interests. I have been speaking of the Meat Board only, but the hon. member will probably understand what I mean. The Meat Board, or the S.A. Agricultural Union, asked me whether a particular member could not be defined in the Act. I do not want to be bound in respect of which people I may appoint. There are sectional interests in the Meat Board. If I were to ask the S.A. Agricultural Union for nominations, as the hon. member suggested, and the Union were to nominate a person serving on the Meat Board, it would create problems for me.</p>

<p>This whole matter has been thrashed out by the De Villiers Commission of Inquiry. After thorough consideration, that commission recommended that we draft up legislation in its present form. The composition of the proposed commission recommended by the commission of inquiry is exactly the same as the composition embodied in the Bill. The hon. member may call for a division on this clause today. He may bring about that I do not want to consult the S.A. Agricultural Union about this Bill. If there is anyone with whom I co-operate most cordially, it is the S.A. Agricultural Union. Do not let us have a division on this and do not let the hon. member say afterwards, &#x201C;He is ignoring the S.A. Agricultural Union.&#x201D; Truly, if he does say this, he is lying in his teeth. [Interjections.] I withdraw that, Mr. Chairman. I apologize.</p>

<p>Taking everything into consideration, with the practical application of this in mind, I unfortunately cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. When we walked in here, he gave me a whole lot of amendments he intended moving. He did not warn me beforehand. I have taken a quick glance at them and see that I shall be able to accept many of them. I want to ask the hon. member not to insist on this amendment, because it will make things difficult for me.</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that one member shall be a nominee of the Meat Commodity Committee of the S.A. Agricultural Union.</block>

<p>If the hon. the Minister wants us to give him a panel from which he may choose, if he wants more than one name from which to choose, we are prepared to change it in this way. This body is involved in the industry and is intimately concerned with it. This body will naturally know the meat industry from top to bottom and does not have sectional interests as the Meat Board may have. This committee is representative of the producers. Why does the hon. Minister not want to consult it in this&#x003F; This body need not nominate one person only which the hon. the Minister must then appoint. We are prepared to accept that the committee should submit a few names and should ensure that the people nominated by it do not have sectional interests, but producers&#x2019; interests. We ask the hon. the Minister to reflect on this type of thing. In the past we have found that it does not get the hon. gentleman anywhere simply to say that he co-operates very easily and well with the S.A. Agricultural Union. We accept that this is the case. But if he co-operates so well with them, he should at least grant recognition to these people. If he does this, he will prove not only that he does co-operate with them, but also that he is prepared to make their influence and opinions felt in a body like this. This is what we are asking the hon. gentleman to do in this amendment. If he does not want to do it, good and well. The hon. the Minister wants to enter into a kind of agreement with us, because he says there are many amendments which he may possibly accept. However, he has not said <span class="col_3161-3162" refersTo="page_0263"/>which amendments. He is being clever by not saying which he will accept. He does not have to accept the one which we have just moved; he must simply indicate his willingness to reconsider it with a view to accepting it or otherwise in the Other Place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to look at it if the hon. members suggest a panel of five.

The abattoirs of Springs, Brakpan, Benoni, Germiston, Pretoria&#x2014;the lot&#x2014;have all been passed on and now come on the account of the Ministry of Agriculture. Therefore the farmers accept that this is a function which has passed into the hands of the State. The State must accept responsibility, and consequently I have to give an account to the Minister of Finance of what happens to the money. However, I am not unreasonable, and if the hon. members suggest a panel of five, I shall look at it and we may possibly move an amendment in the Other Place which will satisfy the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to point out to the hon. members who support the amendment, that the composition of the Meat Board is such that the Agricultural Union has a say there in any event. I think the hon. members should check by whom members who are producers are nominated and submit the panel of names to the Minister. I think that they will then be satisfied that the Agricultural Union does in any event have the principal say as far as producing members of the Meat Board are concerned. Consequently I cannot see why one should go further and give the Agricultural Union representation on the Commission. I think that it is sufficiently represented as it is. The Agricultural Union is perfectly happy as far as this matter is concerned. It is not a problem to them. I therefore do not know where the hon. members have come by this point. I think there is sufficient representation as it is.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet does not grasp the matter at all. It is not a question of whether or not the hon. the Minister acknowledges the S.A. Agricultural Union. It is not a question of whether he works smoothly with them or not. I accept that he does, because I know that he does. I have had the privilege of serving in the commission and hearing evidence from the Union and hearing how well they do work together. The point that I want to make is that I believe that the time has come to give them recognition in our legislation; not just through the good heart of the hon. the Minister, who says he is prepared to consult them. I should like to see it written into the Bill. The hon. the Minister said that he does not want to be tied, although he is quite prepared to discuss matters with the Agricultural Union. He says he is quite prepared to accept their advice about whom he should put on the commission. Only he does not want to be tied. We feel that his successor might not be so popular with the Agricultural Union or the Agricultural Union might not be so popular with his successor and we want to tie his successor also. I believe that we must give the Union this recognition. I know that the Government recognizes them and I know that the Government consults with them. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet correctly stated that the Union has a large say on whom are appointed as the producers&#x2019; representatives on the Meat Board. However, again he brings in the Meat Board. We have not mentioned the Meat Board here at all and we do want to have that board mentioned. We do not want the Meat Board recognized in this connection at all. The hon. member replied to the hon. the Minister. He mentioned the Meat Board. We referred to the meat commodity committee of the S. A. Agricultural Union, which is the body which is most representative of all the primary producers of meat in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that he would consider a panel of five names. It is for that very reason that I chose my words very carefully when I drafted the amendment and speak of &#x201C;a nominee&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C; &#x2019;n genomineerde&#x201D; en nie &#x201C;die genomineerde&#x201D; nie. I did not say the nominee, which would imply that they can say &#x201C;this is the man&#x201D; and the Minister is tied. They should be able to put up a panel of names, and one of the people whom they suggest should be appointed to the board. However, the hon. the Minister has indicated that he will have another look at this, that he will have another thought before the Bill goes to the Senate. With that undertaking by the hon. the Minister, I withdraw my amendment with the leave of the Committee.</p>

<block name="quote">A member of the commission may at any time be removed from office by the State President.</block>

<p>This is a bald statement. We on this side are quite prepared to accept and acknowledge the fact that if a commissioner is to be removed, he should be removed by the State President. We are also prepared to acknowledge the fact that the State President should have the right to remove a commissioner. However, I wonder if the hon. the Minister can tell us under what circumstances he anticipates that a commissioner should be removed from office. There are provisions in subsection (1) in terms of which, if the commissioner does anything wrong or if anything goes wrong, including being elected to this place for instance, he will vacate his office automatically. But it is obvious that the hon. the Minister envisages something in addition which may require the removal of a commissioner from his office. The right of the State President to remove him is absolutely unqualified.</p>

<p>It does not say that this will happen if he is guilty of a misdemeanour, if he has become insane or something like that. Those things are all dealt with under clause 7(1).

<p>Mr. Chairman, it all depends. In other Acts we have the same clause. No reasons are given. This is a business undertaking. I can give the hon. member an example. A commissioner could, for example, become a shareholder in another abattoir. We must then have the power to get rid of him because he would then be a shareholder in an abattoir competing with some of the State abattoirs.</p>

<p>*I cannot think of all the reasons. However, I shall obtain more reasons and give them to the hon. member. All I know is that a similar clause is incorporated in other legislation as well&#x2014;for instance in the case of business concerns like Escom and Iscor. Business should be done properly.

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a reason would be where there are, for example, two abattoirs operating in the same area. I can think of an example in Wynberg in Johannesburg where two abattoirs are operating within ten kilometers of each other. We have provision here enabling us to close one of the abattoirs. We have to be practical because by competing with each other, they will cause costs to rise and not one of them will be running economically.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must reply to that. Where there are, for example, two abattoirs with a capacity to slaughter 500 head of cattle each and there is a total supply of only 700, it means that the two abattoirs will be slaughtering only at a 70% capacity, because they can slaughter 1 000 head of cattle between them, 500 each. But because they work under capacity, the slaughtering fees will inevitably have to rise from R5 to R7,50. The hon. member&#x2019;s argument is, therefore, a very stupid one. I would have been truly ashamed of myself if I had been he.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as the closure of abattoirs is concerned, it is clear that, where the hon. the Minister orders an abattoir to close down, it must happen within a maximum period of 90 days. However, when a local authority decides to close down an abattoir in terms of clause 18, at least 180 days&#x2019; notice must be given. I would like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether there is any particular reason for a distinction to be made between the two and whether the hon. the Minister would not consider making the period 180 days in both cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to refer to subsection (2)(i). This has to do with the compensation to be paid in the case where an abattoir is closed. Line 61 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) any indirect damage or loss of profit caused by such a closure &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>The words &#x201C;loss of profit&#x201D; are the important words. Again, this provision appears to be very wide indeed. One could have a perfectly legitimate private abattoir which might be running successfully and is in the general interests, being closed down by the Abattoir Commission while compensation is paid only for bricks and mortar and for machinery, but not for loss of profits.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am referring to subsection (4) on page 19 which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall in respect of the use of an abattoir or the performance of a service&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) demand a tariff other or higher or lower than the tariff fixed by the Minister in respect thereof &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister why a demand for lower tariff is excluded. Surely the hon. the Minister would like to encourage people to slaughter at the lowest possible cost&#x003F; If a tariff is fixed, surely this is a price maintenance mechanism rather than a mechanism which will enable people to cut costs if they are more efficient&#x003F; If there are two abattoirs in a particular district, I think it would be an advantage if one of them could cut costs to attract more business. Can the hon. the Minister comment on this&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Orange Grove has asked a very reasonable question. However, the whole intention with this Bill is to cut prices and to erect abattoirs in the most economic way by fixing slaughter fees, taking into consideration interest on capital outlay, electricity, etc. We would like to see slaughter fees as low as possible. One could, for example, have two towns like Naboomspruit and Nylstroom, and one of these could decide to cut prices. If Naboomspruit decides to cut prices drastically, the farmers will come from Nylstroom to slaughter at Naboomspruit. The abattoir at Nylstroom will then become an uneconomic proposition. The cattle which still are slaughtered at Nylstroom will have to be slaughtered at higher prices to cover the costs. It is to cut out this kind of competition that we have brought forward this provision. I wish the hon. member could see how we work the figures out. We cut it to the bone. If one bears in mind that a man is prepared to build an abattoir to receive a net 2% on his capital <span class="col_3169-3170" refersTo="page_0267"/>outlay, one realizes that one cannot get cheaper service. I know it is reasonable to ask: &#x201C;Why do you not allow a man to cut anybody else&#x2019;s throat&#x003F;&#x201D;, but then eventually, one will have only Naboomspruit and Nylstroom will be gone. That is the reason for this clause.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to draw the attention to a further argument, i.e. that it is being provided in clause 28 for levies which have to be paid in respect of different abattoirs to differ from abattoir to another. In other words, if one abattoir were to be in a position to pay a lower tariff as that recommended by the commission, the entire financial structure of the Abattoir Commission would be disturbed. These tariffs are calculated and determined on a cost basis. That money is paid into a special account from which have to flow various financial processes. It is therefore absolutely impossible and it cannot be allowed that one abattoir charges a tariff which is lower than the one which has been determined.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the whole position has now become totally clouded. If we are to accept what the hon. the Minister says, namely that it is his intention not to allow an abattoir to slaughter at a lower rate, then I am afraid that we in the official Opposition are going to have to move an amendment. I do not believe that that is the intention, however. [Interjections.] Will that noisy hon. member please be quiet for a moment&#x003F; I do not think he has even read the Bill. I am trying to help the hon. the Minister. The hon. member for Bethal came very close to the correct answer. However, he got himself confused between the tariff and the levy. The levy with which we shall deal a little later, is applied for the slaughter of every animal at an abattoir. That levy goes into the central fund with which the commission will deal. We are now dealing with a tariff. If hon. members will have a look at this Bill, they will see the following in subsection (2) of clause 21&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A tariff fixed in terms of subsection (1) may differ in respect of different abattoirs, different classes of abattoirs &#x2026;</block>

<p>The point the hon. member for Bethal was making here was that a tariff would be fixed on a cost plus basis for each abattoir. As I read it, there will be no question of undercutting it and I sincerely hope that I am right. If I am wrong and if the explanation given by the hon. the Minister is that it is his intention to stop an abattoir undercutting those costs, then we have to have another look at this. I wonder if the hon. the Minister could clear this matter up. Is it a fact, as the hon. member for Bethal said, that the tariffs for each abattoir are going to be fixed on a cost plus basis and that no abattoir is going to be privileged over another&#x003F; If that is the case, we can accept this, but if it is not, and if what the hon. the Minister says is correct, then we cannot accept it. Will the hon. the Minister tell us what the true position is&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I see the hon. member&#x2019;s point. In the Act exactly the same position obtains in terms of section 34, in that no time is fixed. For years we have not had any problem with this section. To stipulate a time limit at this stage is difficult, because it will depend on the nature of the operation. I am saying what the legal advisers have told me, and I cannot see that this clause will in any event be implemented. They tell me that one cannot fix a time limit here and that it should be kept as it is in the Act, according to section 34.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is specifically because of this that I rise. I have done a considerable amount of work in many abattoirs all over the country, and frequently abattoirs which have fallen below the health standards of local authorities, have been nailed under the old Act and have then not been given sufficient time, as they believed, to carry out rectification work so that they could meet the standards again. It is specifically because of this and because people feel that they need protection in that they should be given reasonable time, that I ask the hon. the Minister to include a time limit. If the hon. the Minister will talk to his legal advisers and they are prepared to stipulate &#x201C;within a reasonable time&#x201D;, I am quite happy for him to change this in the Senate. I shall therefore not move an amendment at this stage.</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall without the prior written approval of the Minister conclude an agreement whereby a person is granted the right to use an abattoir for the performance of a service for a period of more than two years.</block>

<p>It goes on to say that if it is for a period longer than two years, they must get the approval of the hon. the Minister and certain agreements are deemed to be agreements for a period of more than two years. It would appear that what the hon. the Minister is trying to do here, is to control who will perform services in abattoirs; who will do the slaughtering, who will do the cleaning up and who will do all the other myriads of services which are performed there, including the preparation of hides, skins, etc. Why is there a limitation of two years&#x003F; In fact, why does the hon. the Minister want to control them at all&#x003F; The second question is: Why does he only want to control those who have contracts for a period longer than two years&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one may find that an abattoir has an agreement with a slaughter contractor. One cannot have an agreement with a slaughter contractor, practically, for longer than two years because one may find that he is not doing his job, that he is ruining the knives, etc. That is the reason for having a period of two years. Within the two years one can see whether this man is doing his job, and then give him another two years&#x2019; extension of the contract. All the work is not done by a specific body. For instance, one has an offal contract, one has a slaughtering contract, one has a contract with a man to remove some of the skins and hides. These contracts, as has been the practice in the past, do not last longer than two years, because one can have problems with some of these people.</p>

What would be the point of that&#x003F; Under section 22 of the Act there are the orders which may be issued. There is an enormous number of requirements which have to be fulfilled in this regard, and surely, as far as I can see, the code should also have a bearing on this sort of thing.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, because I do feel that if this is in the Act it might have slipped in there too. The position as we see it is that the commission may draw up a code of instructions relating to various matters specified in the Bill. Then, having done that, the commission in all seriousness goes to the hon. the Minister and says this is the code of instructions which they would like to have applied&#x2014;in all abattoirs, incidentally, and not only in the proclaimed areas. The hon. the Minister then has a look at them and says it is a good idea and that he will accept the code. Then in terms of subsection (3), having approved it, he publishes it in the <i>Gazette.</i> The moment he publishes it in the <i>Gazette</i> we take it seriously. If there is to be an amendment at any time, if the commission decides that they would like to amend it, they again go back to the Minister and say they would like to amend this code, and if the Minister approves of the amendment, again it is published in the <i>Gazette.</i> Having done all this, we find that the provisions of the code shall not be binding upon any person at all, subject only to the provisions of clause 22. But in terms of clause 22 the hon. the Minister has the power to issue an order on any person concerned with an abattoir in the proclaimed area whereby he can direct that person to manage the abattoir, to replace equipment, to provide equipment, to alter and repair&#x2014;the long list of things which appear on page 21 of the Bill. So the Minister, in order to achieve the object of clause 22, does not require the code in terms of clause 26. Therefore I cannot see what this code is there for. If it is not enforceable at all, there is something wrong. I welcome what the hon. the Minister says and I sincerely hope that in the light of this he will have another look at it and perhaps amend it in the Other Place.</p>

<p>I cannot understand what the problem is which the hon. member is experiencing with clause 26. I believe when we look at this code, we have to read it together with the Animal Slaughter Hygiene Act, which is closely related to this. There you will see that abattoirs are divided into A, B and C classes and the idea is only to enable a class A abattoir, where tremendous activities take place and which could be export abattoirs, to enforce these codes more strictly and to apply stricter control measures, whilst there would be less control in class B or class C. I believe it would be quite clear if the hon. member would only read the two together and also together with section 22. Then it would really be impossible to find any fault with this. I should like to support it as it has been printed here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 27 empowers the hon. the Minister to direct the commission to conduct an inquiry into any matter relating to an abattoir anywhere in the Republic and not only in the proclaimed area. But then we find on the top of page 27 in subsection (7) that the commission may for the purposes of such inquiry at any reasonable time enter upon and inspect any land or premises. I agree that the commission should have the power to do that, but I also believe that there is a degree of courtesy which has to be observed here. I believe that we as legislators have to look after the rights of people. A reasonable time to the commission might not be a reasonable time to a landowner. But whether it is a reasonable time or not, I believe it is only right that the landowner should be notified or, if the landowner is not available, the occupier or the manager or whoever has control over the land at the time that the commission wishes to conduct its inquiry. For that reason I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 27, in line 7, after &#x201C;time&#x201D;, to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">subject to prior notification of the land-owner, occupier or manager concerned,</block>

<p>The clause will then provide that the commission may for the purpose of such inquiry at any reasonable time, subject to prior notification to the landowner, occupier or manager concerned, enter upon and inspect any land or premises. I do not believe that this is going to hinder the hon. the Minister or the commission in any way in the execution of their duty. On the contrary, I believe it will operate in such a way as to gain the confidence of the public when the commission does so act.</p>

<p>Clause 28:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I notified the hon. the Minister that I was going to speak on this clause, since here again a levy was being imposed which the producers in South Africa would have to bear. One does not object to a levy being imposed on the producer if he alone stands to gain by it. This is a clause which empowers the hon. the Minister to impose a levy which will be paid into a special fund with widely divergent objects. The hon. the Minister should not look at clause 28 in isolation. I am aware of the fact that we may not discuss clauses 29 and 30 now, but may only refer to them.</p>

<p>Those clauses, especially clause 30, very clearly state what is to happen to the money. When we look at what is to happen to the money, we see <i>inter alia,</i> the following included in that clause:<i>ex gratia</i> payments made by the hon. the Minister in terms of section 76 of the Act and the payment of compensation in terms of section 17, 20(5), 23 or 34. The commission will have wider functions, and these functions will not be solely in the interest of the producer. The hon. Minister maintains&#x2014;and we all admit it&#x2014;that this commission and the corporation will fill a vacuum which other bodies are not prepared to do. If they are not prepared to do so and the State takes over, which is correct in this case, it is necessary that the State pay for these services. In that case it is a national service, not a sectional service, nor a service which benefits the producer only. The hon. the Minister said with reference to one of the other clauses today that the responsibility to be taken over by the Commission was a tremendous one and that large buildings etc. would come into the hands of the commission and the corporation. Surely these are not the property of the producer. This would be good and well if the abattoirs for which compensation had to be paid upon their closure, were to become the <span class="col_3177-3178" refersTo="page_0271"/>property of the farmers. In that case we would accept this and bear the responsibility as well. Then we would not keep to a small levy, but accept our full responsibility. However, these properties will pass into the hands of the State, and who pays for them&#x003F; It is the producer who sends his sheep, goats and cattle to the abattoirs. It is not only the person who sends his animals to the abattoirs in the proclaimed areas, because every area is concerned in this&#x2014;the small abattoir at Pampoenpoort, Bronkhorstspruit, Naboomspruit or Nylstroom. They will have to pay the levy at all the places they go to to slaughter their livestock. We do not make any excuses for the attitude adopted by us. Last Friday the hon. the Minister was very angry with me, because he said that we were making a clever move, that we were going to tell the farmers of South Africa that we agreed with the Act, but that we did not want the burden to be placed on their shoulders. And the hon. the Minister will remember that in 1967, when this matter was before the House, we took up the identical standpoint. This side of the House has been absolutely consistent in its attitude for nearly nine years. We said at the time that it was unnecessary, although it involved only a small amount. Let us look at clause 5, which we have already agreed to. Who pays the people who are going to serve on the commission&#x003F; They will be paid by the State with money voted by Parliament. In other words, in this the principle is conceded that this will be a commission which will act in the interests of the whole country. If this is so, why should a levy be imposed on the individual producer in order to achieve certain other objectives. We therefore say that this levy is absolutely unfair and unjustified. That is why I have asked the hon. the Minister whether he would accept an amendment if I were to move one. I may not move that money be taken out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or that money be appropriated by Parliament, because only an hon. Minister may do this. Therefore we should like to see, in the event of this clause being negatived, it being replaced by a new clause reading as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>28. Moneys required for the purposes of the Commission, shall be appropriated by Parliament.</li>

</ol>

<p>I am not even going to take the trouble to move this, but I have the amendment, and if the hon. the Minister is prepared to take it over, I am prepared to table it or to give it to him. I think I have made out an adequate case. There are still dozens of arguments which may be advanced. The producer of South Africa has to contend with tremendous increases in production costs and they are still rising. Blow after blow is levelled at him in this respect and if it was a reasonable amount which the hon. the Minister wanted to collect, one could still understand it. There is no ceiling, however, and consequently it may be any amount. The hon. the Minister may, after consultation with the commission, from time to time impose a levy in respect of every animal slaughtered at an abattoir. He does not impose any restrictions upon himself, because if the commission says he is to impose a levy of R2 in respect of an animal slaughtered at an abattoir, that levy may be imposed. Originally, in 1967, the commission was prepared to accept small amounts, but since 1973 they have rejected that restriction altogether. Now it is an amount which may be imposed at the discretion of the Minister and after consultation with the commission. One has no chance of refusing to pay it. The only way in which one can get past this, is to slaughter all your animals at your own farm and to eat them yourself. If one slaughters them at an abattoir in a controlled or an uncontrolled area, one cannot refuse in terms of this clause to pay the amount laid down. I say that he is paying enough as it is. Therefore we are against the levy. We think that this is the responsibility of the State and I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us if he can make out a case for this having to be the responsibility of the farmer alone. If he says that this is the farmer&#x2019;s responsibility, then he must establish a corporation in which the farmers of South Africa are the shareholders. At the moment this is not the case. Now every South African, every tax-payer, becomes a shareholder in the abattoirs established in terms of this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member himself will also have to answer certain questions in connection with his argument, because I am experiencing problems with the practical implementation of his amendment. I want to give you an example of this. Suppose one has two abattoirs. Abattoir A is modernized and properly developed <span class="col_3179-3180" refersTo="page_0272"/>to meet all the basic, modern standards. One&#x2019;s tariffs are determined on one&#x2019;s capital outlay, as laid down in this legislation, in other words, one&#x2019;s slaughtering costs in respect of a well modernized abattoir will be higher than, for example, those in respect of abattoir B, which is in need of improvement. It is only logical that one must create a reserve by means of a levy, and this reserve can only be created in terms of this clause by means of a levy and the Minister must give his approval if such a levy is created.</p>

<p>Now I ask the hon. member this: Why, if I market my stock at abattoir A, where the costs for slaughtering are extremely high, must I also help to pay for abattoir B, where I never market an animal in any event&#x003F; There is, in other words, a difference in levy from abattoir to abattoir, according to their needs. One levy cannot be applicable throughout. However, it is also the position&#x2014;and I agree with this&#x2014; that the service provided by abattoirs, is a public service. Therefore it is logical, since the producer pays different amounts from abattoir to abattoir by means of levies, that an extra subsidy may possibly be paid by the State as may be needed. Therefore, what this amounts to is that the State, too, may contribute an amount towards a reserve fund, which may be a building or betterment fund. However, I cannot see levies of this type being eliminated altogether. The Bill puts it very clearly that the owner of an abattoir is authorized to demand such a levy. In my opinion, the only basis on which the owner of an abattoir is able to determine and demand such a levy, is the animal slaughtered. This is the unit on which he can operate. The levy must therefore be linked to the animal, and consequently the levy concerned will differ from abattoir to abattoir. This is how I understand the matter. I do not know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s answer will be to this.</p>

<p>The practical problem is that the farmer is not prepared to pay for an abattoir which still has to be developed, while the same farmer, by means of levies and building reserves, has built up an amount with which the abattoir where his animals are slaughtered, has been developed and modernized. If another abattoir has been left behind as far as development is concerned, it is not fair that a farmer should pay money to that particular abattoir, while no animal of his is ever slaughtered there.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate I gave my reasons why I favoured this Bill, and why I thought it was a very good Bill. At the same time I gave my reason, too, why I felt that the corporation should now stand the cost of building and maintenance of abattoirs. As far as I am concerned, the corporation is the crux of the whole Bill, of the whole issue. The problem that has been worrying me all along is: How will the corporation be financed&#x003F; As I mentioned during the Second Reading debate we know of people who have been wanting to build abattoirs along the line from Upington to Cape Town, at vantage points, but because of the finance problems, these projects have never materialized.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said earlier, while discussing one of the earlier Bills today that local authorities could no longer bear the costs of this sort of project. I mentioned in the Second Reading debate that the same applied to the old abattoir in East London. I believe that the costs should be borne by the State, because abattoirs are a public service, a service which is of national importance. The money to finance abattoirs should be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That is where the money should come from.</p>

<p>I support the amendment suggested by the hon. member for Newton Park. This is a good Bill, and I believe that we can make something of it, but with the present high Railway tariffs in respect of livestock in transit, I believe it would be most unsuitable, and most undesirable, to expect the producer to bear the full cost at the moment.</p>

<speech by="#botma">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. BOTMA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as I am concerned, the hon. member for East London North has now touched on the actual problem, that is, the provision of facilities. However, I want to point out that during the past year or two permission has been granted to five private bodies or persons to establish private abattoirs. Not a single one has been erected. The producer&#x2019;s problem is that he has to market his animals. If the slaughtering facilities are not provided for him, he cannot market them.</p>

<p>A few years ago the farmers were up in arms because they had to market according to a strict quota permit because of the fact that slaughtering facilities were not available. Must we now return to those times&#x003F; Must we <span class="col_3181-3182" refersTo="page_0273"/>discourage everyone&#x003F; Not a single producer has complained as yet, about the levy which is demanded. I do not believe that the hon. member for Newton Park can give us the name of a single farmers&#x2019; association which has raised objections to the existing levy. That levy is minimal. Now the hon. member talks about the railway tariffs in the same breath. I agree with him 100% that these levies are a completely different matter. It is only a drop in the ocean in comparison with railway tariffs. Therefore we must really not be petty and complain when we come to levies of this proportion.</p>

<p>Money must be found somewhere and the producer must be prepared to contribute his small share. It is very clear that the present abattoir at City Deep cannot possibly be built from levy funds alone. It is impossible. It is State expenditure. The additional expenditure involved, the things mentioned in clause 30, to which the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South referred, as well as in clause 17, which deals with the closure of abattoirs, and clause 20, which deals with the erection of new abattoirs, clause 23, which deals with the compensation to be paid when an abattoir is closed, and clause 35, which deals with the transfer to the abattoir commission or to the abattoir corporation, are all part of the same picture. They all fit into the circle of which levies also form a part. Therefore I believe that we should not be obsessed with the small amount which is involved here. Let us rather approach the Government with a request for a rebate on railway tariffs instead of concerning ourselves unnecessarily with this levy, which is an old levy in any event and which does not really affect anybody.</p>

<p>In this case, however, he does have the right to move an amendment. You could have done the same sort of thing here and then you would have been able to say that you had done something practical for the farmer. However, we have a fund here which may eventually disappear when it reaches saturation point, a fund which can be built up and strengthened in such a way that it may gradually disappear. The fund was used in the past to defray the administrative expenses of the Abattoir Commission. However, hon. members do not look at the picture as a whole. <span class="col_3183-3184" refersTo="page_0274"/>I am dependent on the hon. the Minister for finances. I can easily say today that I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment and that we shall write it into the Act. Then, however, the hon. the Minister of Finance will come to me and say, &#x201C;You ask for more than R50 million for abattoirs and I give it to you. You come forward each time and ask for the erection of silos, for example, and for assistance for the municipal markets, and now for abattoirs, too, where the municipalities say, &#x2018;We are throwing in the towel&#x2019;.&#x201D; You come forward each time and ask for those millions but now you are grumbling about a levy of 15 cents per head of cattle. This bedevils all my prospects of money I may ask for in future. This is what the hon. member cannot understand. Hon. members must not think that I am becoming excited. However, it is very easy to go and tell the farmers that they voted in Parliament to save him a levy of 15 cents, but in that case they have done nothing at all about all the other costs.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can give the hon. member the figures out of hand. Then he can make the calculations himself. The levy used to be 12 cents, whereas it has been 15 cents for the past ten months. We slaughtered 1,6 million head of cattle. The levy for sheep was between 3 and 4 cents per sheep and we slaughtered just over 7 million sheep. We must bear in mind that a fund has been built up. All the money has not been spent. It is still there. That is why I say that this fund will reach saturation point some time in future.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot understand why the hon. the Minister is getting so excited about the matter. He has said here himself, in reply to a question put by the hon. member for East London North, that no town council would build an abattoir today. He said the responsibility was being passed on to him and that he must find the money for it. The fact is that the town councils played their part in the old days, even before the Abattoir Commission and the legislation we are discussing at the moment. They also had a levy, but they obtained money from their ratepayers as well which was spent on the abattoirs. What we are asking for now is that the same thing should happen and that the whole burden should not be on the shoulders of the farmers. We have just had this increase in the railway tariffs. We objected to it, but we were unable to move an amendment. I should like to propose another solution to the hon. the Minister. An abattoir handles live cattle which enter from one side. The farmer is already paying a tariff for those cattle and is also paying an increased railway tariff. The abattoir then handles the carcass which emerges on the other side. Could the levy which is proposed here not be applicable to the carcass part of the enterprise so that there would be a <span class="col_3185-3186" refersTo="page_0275"/>distribution&#x003F; The farmer is paying on the one side, so that the consumer may also contribute something at the other side.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Albany is quite right. The city councils have played their part, but the average age of abattoirs is nearly 50 years by now. They have become antiquated and the city councils do not have money to replace them. That is why we have the nine large controlled areas; we have already taken over nearly all of them and have built new ones. Halfway between Pietermaritzburg and Durban there will be an abattoir which will cost more than R30 million. Where will the money come from&#x003F; From the hon. the Minister of Finance at a very low rate of interest to create this facility. Therefore the Government has also played its part. Now, however, the hon. member tells us how the levy should be utilized. Last Friday I said that when we fix the floor price of meat, this sort of argument is always raised. But the farmers are not stupid. They see all these cost increases and they add them to the floor price. For example, if the levy has been 15 cents and then it becomes 16 cents, the increase of one cent is taken into consideration. It is then added to the floor price.</p>

<p>Its full effect will not be felt by the consumer. The consumer price varies according to supply and demand. We must remember the floor price. Today the price is far higher than the floor price. It is no use raising the floor price, however, for if the auction price should then fall, the farmer would get even less. Traditionally, however, it still is higher than the floor price for 11 months of the year. That also has an effect on the farmer. He is protected by means of our floor price system in determining the price of meat.</p>

<p>Anyone who renders a service at the abattoir which will be established by this corporation will be able to make a profit from the service he renders there. In other words, this corporation would also have its income. It would not only operate on 2% profit. But even 2% is good enough under the circumstances for a utility company. Even if it should operate on no profit, one could still be satisfied. Our point, however, is this: If the corporation will be established without the farmers having to pay for it, why does clause 28 require payment for the services which the commission is rendering, even for the compensation which has to be paid&#x003F; I do not wish to repeat all the aspects now. The hon. the Minister knows that it will be possible to provide quite a number of services from that account in terms of clause 29 and clause 30. If that can be done if there is a separation, why cannot the corporation pay these costs&#x003F; Why cannot the hon. the Minister of Finance pay these costs&#x003F; It is very easy for the hon. gentleman to say that it is just a small amount. However, how long will it remain a small amount&#x003F; Originally, in 1967, there was a limitation on the amount. The hon. the Minister was not Minister of Agriculture then. Mr. Dirkie Uys was then the Minister of Agriculture. We argued that point across the floor of the House at that time and we on this side of the House got the limitation introduced. A few years later they wanted to amend the whole limitation. Why&#x003F; Because the hon. the Minister knows that the commission needs additional money because it has to do a tremendous amount of work. If it did that additional work only for the farmer as a <span class="col_3187-3188" refersTo="page_0276"/>producer, fine. It is not doing it for itself only, however; it is doing it for everybody. The hon. the Minister has not done his homework well enough. He must lay the blame on the hon. the Minister of Finance.

<p>It is very easy to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. However, we know this Government. Once they have that power in their hands and the costs begin to rise, they will make the producers pay for it. That is what we are fighting against. We want the burden to be distributed among everyone so that, if the hon. member for Vasco or the hon. member for Tygervallei, for example, were to get facilities in the city, they too would pay for it. That is the argument of this side of the House. I am certain that the hon. the Minister of Finance will not be so unreasonable, because he is already accepting responsibility in terms of clause 5 for the payment of the salaries of the commissioners. Why should the farmer be responsible for other large expenditure, including compensation and other services which have to be rendered&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal said that the levy would not be totally eliminated. As I understand clause 28, different levies may be fixed for different abattoirs. As far as I know, the commission has laid down a more or less constant levy in the past for every type of animal which has been slaughtered.</p>

If he does not accept it, we on this side of the House will believe that he is placing an unfair burden on the shoulders of the producer under the circumstances, while he expects the producer to be the only one who will have to propagate the fine objectives of this commission and who will have to pay for it. That conclusion will be unavoidable under these circumstances if the hon. the Minister is not prepared to change his attitude.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. I ask this for the simple reason that the hon. member for Newton Park wants to make the meat industry of South Africa entirely dependent on funds from the Treasury. It has always been the policy in agriculture for every industry to stand on its own two feet as far as possible. The argument advanced by the hon. member that since it is a public service, only the farmer should bear the cost, is not quite correct. The cost of slaughtering forms part of the farmer&#x2019;s expenses which, in order to protect himself, he can provide for by way of the floor price system for which provision is made in the meat scheme. If provision is made in this way for those expenses, the expenses in question are distributed among everyone in the meat industry. This is a logical economic argument. I want to ask the Minister not to accept this amendment because to make the development of the abattoir industry entirely dependent on funds from the Minister of Finance and not to provide for any levies would be a dangerous move. We could find ourselves in a situation which could cause the abattoir industry a great deal of harm. If the industry itself possessed no reserves, the meat industry in South Africa would become entirely dependent on bodies which would perhaps be unable to assist us in certain circumstances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not understand the hon. member for Bethal at all. What is the sum of money we are talking about&#x003F; The amount which he says he believes the whole meat industry in this country must be dependent upon is R500 000. The hon. the Minister gave me some figures a little while ago with the aid of which I have done a little sum&#x2014;if my calculations are incorrect, someone must please tell me. It would appear that, at the moment, all we are talking about is R500 000. The hon. the Minister says he cannot get it from the hon. the Minister of <span class="col_3189-3190" refersTo="page_0277"/>Finance, but that he must take if from the farmers. The hon. member for Bethal also says he cannot take it from the hon. the Minister of Finance because the farmers must be independent; they must not be dependent on the Government.</p>

<p>Let us see what is going to happen to this money. In terms of clause 28, a levy will be collected which, it appears, will be for R500 000. Then, in terms of clause 29, if I may refer to it, that money will be paid into a special account. What money is going to be paid into that special account&#x003F; This levy which is to be collected, plus any amount which the Abattoir Commission has to its credit at the moment. That, again, only involves the levy we have been collecting up to now. That is all it is. Consequently, it cannot be such a large amount of money. However, what is going to be paid our of that account&#x003F; That brings me to clause 30. The hon. member for Omaruru was correct when he said that all the compensation, the <i>ex gratia</i> payments and such like, will be paid from that levy. I believe there must be some other money somewhere&#x2014;I do not think there will be enough money in that account to do all these things if we are going to close abattoirs.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the levy will have to be increased, as my friend, the hon. member for Newton Park, says. The levy will have to be increased or else there will have to be another source of funds. The only other source I can think of is money that will be appropriated by Parliament for this commission. If one looks at clause 3, one finds that the members of this commission are going to come from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. Clause 5 provides that any moneys which have to be paid to the commissioners by way of salaries, will be moneys appropriated by Parliament for that purpose. Clause 5(5) specifically provides that. All we are asking the hon. the Minister to do, is to make a similar provision applicable here. An amount of R500 000 is to be appropriated by Parliament every year. It has become a matter of principle for the farmers at the moment, whether, as the hon. member for Newton Park has said, they should pay for something whereby everybody benefits or whether the necessary funds should be taken from the one source to which everybody contributes, viz. the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Producers and consumers&#x2014;all of us&#x2014;contribute to that fund. The farmers also contribute to it. It is the one fund which, if resorted to, will ensure that everyone makes his contribution. I believe that the request of the hon. member for Newton Park is reasonable. I urge the hon. the Minister not to listen to his friends on that side of the House, but rather to listen to his friends on this side of the House and to accept the suggestion made by the hon. member for Newton Park.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I again want to ask the hon. members opposite to listen to reason. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South mentioned the amount of half a million rand, based on the figures furnished by the hon. the Minister. One need only set against that the increase in the rail and road transport tariffs which are going to cost the farmers in South West Africa alone an additional R2,2 million, as against the amount of R520 000 for the entire Republic. As against that there is the Bill at present before the House. The whole spirit of the Bill amounts to a diminution of control, the exclusion of smaller abattoirs. In other words, it is far more to be expected that the overall responsibility of the Abattoir Commission will be considerably reduced, and not increased. What is all this about&#x003F; Do the hon. members not want to realize that we should rather try to obtain assistance where assistance is really necessary and that we should not burden the Government with trifles&#x003F;</p>

<p>Clause 31:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 29, to omit subsection (3) and to substitute the following subsection&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(3) Where an inspector exercises or performs any power, duty or function in terms of this Act in the presence of any persons affected thereby, such inspector shall first exhibit the certificate referred to in subsection (2) to any of these persons.</li>

</ol>

<p>As the clause reads at the moment, an inspector shall, in terms of subsection (3), on demand produce his certificate of authority referred to in subsection (2). The object of the amendment is to provide that the inspector shall produce his certificate before he fulfils his obligations or duties as set out in the clause. The purpose of the amendment is twofold. In the first instance it seeks to eliminate the need for a person to have to ask an inspector to exhibit or show his certificate, thereby possibly creating in the mind of the inspector the suspicion that his <i>bona fides</i> are being questioned. In the second instance it seeks to protect owners from operators who may be fraudulent or who may be impostors. I believe that whenever the legislature has an opportunity in law to protect the citizens of South Africa, no matter how small that opportunity is or how seldom it may arise, it should take advantage of such an opportunity to alter or improve laws with that object in view.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I indicated to the hon. member that I personally could not see anything wrong with his amendment. However, the legal adviser has informed me that on reconsideration of the proposal of the hon. member, he is not convinced that it will improve on the existing provisions of the clause. The reason for this is that an inspector will, through repeated visits to abattoirs, become well known to the abattoir owner and his employees. They will eventually become satisfied that he is, in fact, an inspector. A requirement that he should each time produce his certificate of appointment would, in the opinion of the legal adviser, be carrying the matter too far. In terms of the existing provisions the abattoir owner and his employees will be at liberty to demand <span class="col_3193-3194" refersTo="page_0279"/>production of a certificate whenever they feel so inclined. After consultation with the adviser I suggest that the provisions of the clause be left unaltered. Incidentally, the wording of this clause is in line with existing Acts, for example section 5 of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1973. I may add that it is a pity that the hon. member did not vote on our side because then I could have taken a chance and accepted his amendment. However, I shall have further discussions on this point. My difficulty is that I always prefer to have the support of the legal advisers when I accept amendments. If the general feeling is that the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment cannot cause major harm, I shall move a similar amendment when the Bill is considered by the Senate.</p>

<p>I am very surprised to hear that we have had an Act on the Statute Book for 10 years and that this particular section has never been used, when it involves inspectors with broad powers to inspect sources of pollution. That may be one of the causes of pollution. But it is not only in that Act. We also have it in the Hazardous Substances Act, the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act and in the Medicines Control Act and it has been accepted by various Ministers who have, I believe, accepted our point of view that this is a positive amendment as against the negative attitude adopted towards people who are being subjected to inspection. I am very sorry. I always understood the hon. the Minister to be a most reasonable and co-operative Minister, and I am sorry to hear that he is not prepared to accept the amendment because there are a number of examples which illustrate that this is perfectly practicable in the eyes of the legal draftsmen. So I would appeal to the hon. the Minister that if he feels he is unable to accept it here he will be prepared to give an undertaking that he will give it serious consideration and that he accepts it in principle.</p>

<p>In line 8 in clause 38 there is reference to &#x201C;a writing purporting to be an affidavit&#x201D;. I would like to tell the hon. the Minister that I have in fact checked with our legal advisers and they can see no reason at all why it should not just refer to &#x201C;an affidavit&#x201D;. I think the words &#x201C;a writing purporting to be&#x201D; should drop. In answer to the debate on another Bill when the same wording was used it was said that it came from the Government&#x2019;s legal advisers, but our legal advisers can see absolutely no reason at all why the words &#x201C;a writing purporting to be an affidavit&#x201D; should be used. If anybody purports to bring any document at all and say that it is an affidavit, in terms of this wording it can be accepted as being legal when in fact it is not. Why cannot we just leave it as a straight affidavit&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I also consulted my legal adviser and he says there is nothing wrong with it. The principle of the Act will not be altered and he feels that from the legal point of view, we should retain these words. In Afrikaans it says: &#x201C;heet te wees.&#x201D; These people have all kinds of ideas. He says it is better to talk about &#x201C; &#x2019;n verklaring heet te wees&#x201D; than simply a &#x201C;verklaring&#x201D;. So I cannot see why we have to cross swords about this. The main thing is that the abattoir is going to be built.</p>

<p>I am afraid the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply is a little too simplistic fo me. I feel it is totally bad to write into any clause words which are totally unnecessary and which can only confuse the issue. Certainly when you talk about &#x201C;a writing purporting to be an affidavit&#x201D;, it is not even good English the first instance. It is meaningless, and if you omit the words &#x201C;a writing purporting to be&#x2019; <span class="col_3195-3196" refersTo="page_0280"/>and just say &#x201C;an affidavit&#x201D; it seems to me to be a simplification. It is in every way better and there is no confusion at all, because if it is not an affidavit I would like to know what it is. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can tell me.</p>

<p>Clause 39:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>I would just like to raise again the question of the shifting of the onus in this matter. This point was raised a few days ago in the House when we debated the Plant Improvement Bill. In the case of that measure you will recall, Sir, that the employer was purported to be liable as long as his employee committed an offence, unless the employer proved that he had in fact in no way connived in that act. I pointed out at that time that the penalties in the Act were fairly severe and that there could be cases arising in which it would be very difficult for an employer to prove beyond a reasonable doubt&#x2014;because this is a criminal offence&#x2014;that in fact he had not connived at or been party to the commission of the offence. Because of the Government&#x2019;s reaction to the Plant Improvement Bill, which contained a clause which was almost identical to the one in the Bill we have before us now, we have not placed an amendment on the Order Paper because I presumed that the attitude of the hon. the Minister would be the same as it was last week. On the other hand I think it must be pointed out firstly that it is a bad principle in law to shift the onus unnecessarily, and secondly, that it places upon an employer a burden which sometimes, particularly in the case where you have an employee who is <i>mala fide,</i> is a very heavy one. Therefore I would suggest that the Minister should reconsider this matter. Rather than requiring the burden of proof to be beyond a reasonable doubt, as it is now, the burden of proof should be reduced by inserting here that that proof shall be on the balance of probabilities. That would give a far greater discretion to the court to exonerate an employer who may have difficulty in proving his case in the light of a <i>mala fide</i> employee. I may say that in the present circumstances we cannot support this clause as it stands.</p>

<speech by="#uys">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. UYS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we have already discussed this matter during the Second Reading. I went and had a look at the Act. This clause is identical, word for word, with the provision in the Act. I had a look at the cases in the law reports, and I could not find a reference anywhere in any law report to an interpretation of this section. There is an identical clause in almost all agricultural legislation and there is a very good reason for this. I have already said during the Second Reading that we should have strict control. It is vitally necessary that we should have strict control, because it must not become possible for employees to hide behind offences committed by the employees. It is the easiest thing in the world for an employer to escape responsibility which he ought to know about by simply shifting it on to his workers. That is why the burden of proof is placed so strictly on the employer in this case. To my knowledge there have not been any Supreme Court decisions on this point up to now and to me this is a good indication that this particular section is carrying out its function very effectively in its present form.</p>

<p>Clause 72:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 72 states that &#x201C;the State and its employees, the Minister, the members of the Commission, the Corporation, its directors and employees or any inspector shall not be liable in respect of anything done in good faith under the provisions of this Act&#x201D;. This is a blanket indemnity. This has become a standard provision, and we have seen it in a lot of legislation recently. I would again like to record our total objection to this sort of thing. I realize that a certain measure of indemnity should be granted, but our legal advisers have advised us that, with the addition of certain other words, such as &#x201C;reasonably done in good faith&#x201D; or &#x201C;done in good faith without negligence&#x201D; it then comes within the ambit of the courts. Their advice is that as it stands at the moment, any employee who does something in good faith, although it may be done negligently, can get away with it. Such a person will be indemnified completely. I really do believe that the hon. the Minister should ask his legal advisers to look at this again. The answer I have had in the past is that it is still within the ambit of the courts as it stands at the moment. I believe that this indemnity could be put on a more reasonable basis by a slight alteration of the words. I believe it would then be clearer as far as interpretation is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as always happens when one has legislation like this where we are doing away with one organization and creating another in its place, one always has the problem of what to do with the staff. It has always been the habit of this side of the House to look after the interests of the members of the staff and to see to it that they are adequately provided for. I have hunted through the Bill and this is the only place I can find where any mention is made of the staff of the present abattoir commission who are not officials of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. As I mentioned a little earlier, the new commission is to have a staff which will be made up of officials of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. Clause 76(2)(b) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the commencement of this Act any person who immediately before such commencement was an employee of such abattoir commission shall become an employee of the corporation &#x2026;</block>

<p>Yes, he will. When one looks at subsection (4), it would appear that the hon. the Minister does anticipate a problem or some problems, because he makes provision that he &#x201C;may&#x201D; pay an <i>ex gratia</i> amount. It is not mandatory now, whereas it is mandatory for an employee to become an employee of the corporation. I quote from clause 76(4)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may if he deems it fit pay an amount <i>ex gratia</i> to any person who in terms of the provisions of subsection (2)(b) becomes an employee of the corporation and whose services are terminated, in accordance with the terms of the contract of service in question &#x2026;</block>

<p>Subsection (2)(b) mentioned here is the one I mentioned earlier. It would appear that the hon. the Minister anticipates problems. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will tell us at this stage of this particular Bill before we close the debate, what exactly he intends doing to protect the interests of employees of the present commission. It is not quite clear here. He is asking us to give him the power to compensate by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment&#x2014;if he wishes and at his instance only. The employees are given no rights whatsoever. In fact, in terms of this legislation the employees lose rights because they &#x201C;shall become employees of the corporation&#x201D;. If they are retrenched or dismissed or their services are terminated, the Minister &#x201C;may&#x201D; compensate them; he does not have to compensate them. He may do so at his discretion. I wonder if the hon. the Minister could tell us what his thoughts are here and whether he has come across any problems or whether he anticipates any problems and, if so, how he anticipates he will solve them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. member realizes, the staff of the old commission will go over to the corporation&#x2014;most of them. These people are very scarce. I cannot foresee that even one of them will not be employed in the new corporation. There are certain activities and functions they have to do. I do not know whether the hon. member realizes it, but we even have engineers on the abattoir commission. They are qualified engineers and are difficult to find today. When we decide to go over to a corporation, some of the personnel will be transferred. I think that is the reason why we have the extra payment if a man feels he is not prepared to carry on with the job. I can think of specific names, but I do not want to mention them. We want the power to treat these people well because they gave us good service. I cannot see any problems in practice, because these people who want to be employed, will become employees of the

 <span class="col_3201-3202" refersTo="page_0283"/>corporation. However, they are free to resign if they want to, but I shall be very unhappy if they do, because we need them to carry on with the job in the future. I appreciate the fact that the hon. member is concerned about the welfare of the people working for us, but this clause is actually there to cover these people.</p>

<p>*This is a new dispensation that we are now entering and we want to see the men happy and retain them as far as we are able. This is the reason for the <i>ex gratia</i> compensation in some cases, of which the hon. member himself is aware.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Representations have been received from the Chamber of Mining and from the Commissioner of Police for the amendment of subsection (2) of section 156 of the Mining Rights Act, 1967, relating to police traps, as far as unwrought precious metal, such as gold or platina, is concerned. As hon. members know, it is essential to combat not only illegal dealing in uncut diamonds, but also illegal dealing in unwrought gold and platina. During the previous session this House approved an amendment to subsection (2) of section 108 of the Precious Stones Act, 1964, to the effect that money received by the Police from a suspected illegal diamond dealer is forfeited to the State, irrespective of whether the police have handed over the uncut diamonds to the illegal diamond dealer. For the information of hon. members I may mention that the wording of subsection (2) of section 108 of the Precious Stones Act, 1964, was the same, before the amendment of 1975, as that of subsection (2) of section 156 of the Mining Rights Act, 1967, except that the one referred to uncut diamonds and the other to unwrought precious metal.</p>

<p>This Bill which is to be considered by the House is not only intended to bring the provisions of section 156(2) of the Mining Rights Act, 1967, into line with those of the present wording of section 108(2) of the Precious Stones Act, 1964, but is also necessary for reasons to which I shall come later.</p>

<p>As I have said, section 156(2) of the Mining Rights Act is concerned with police traps. I do not think I need discuss the desirability of the system of police traps, because the fact of the matter is that in a country such as South Africa, where gold is found over such a large area, the system, which has been in existence for many years, is an absolute necessity. In making this point, I want to refer to a report which appeared in our newspapers on 11 March, to the effect that a Mr. So-and-so had been convicted and fined on a charge of having stolen platina worth R575 000 and unwrought gold worth R409 000&#x2014;a kind of thing which often occurs.</p>

<p>During 1974, we sold gold to the value of almost R2 620 million, and few people realize the enormous proportions assumed by smuggling in unwrought gold and platina in South Africa, in spite of all attempts by the police to combat this phenomenon. In order to illustrate the extent of these smuggling activities, the following information can be furnished for the period from 10 August 1972, i.e. the date on which the diamond and gold branches of the police were incorporated, up to the end of June 1975&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) There were 132 cases in which gold belonging to the State was sold to smugglers for a total amount of R77 682.</li>

<li><span class="col_3203-3204" refersTo="page_0284"/>(2) There were nine cases of theft in which a total of 71 871 grammes of unwrought gold, valued at R38 571, was stolen.</li>

<li>(3) In a 100 cases, a total of 40 100 grammes of gold worth R10 852 was illegally possessed.</li>

<li>(4) A total of 10 009 grammes of unwrought gold to the value of R5 678 was purchased from smugglers in 75 cases.</li>

<li>(5) Six cases occurred in which 32 472 grammes of platina valued at R112 484 was stolen and found back.</li>

<li>(6) There were six cases in which persons were in illegal possession of approximately 1 450 grammes of platina worth R4 905.</li>

<li>(7) A total of 3 219 grammes of platina worth R11 539 was bought from smugglers in two cases.</li>

</ol>

<p>I take it that hon. members will agree with me that any emasculation of the police trap system may cause the smuggling trade to reach unmanageable proportions.</p>

<p>I want to give a brief explanation of the existing provisions of section 156(2) of the Mining Rights Act. When a member of the S.A. Police has transferred possession of any unwrought precious metal to any person upon payment or delivery by such person of an amount in money or other consideration, and such person is subsequently convicted of an offence in connection with such transaction, the money thus paid over or delivered is automatically forfeited to the State. This provision was specially introduced as a further deterrent to illegal dealings in unwrought precious metal, because experience has shown that the heavy fines which can be imposed do not in themselves have the desired effect. It is important for hon. members to bear in mind that in terms of the present provision of section 156(2), the position is that money handed over to the police is automatically forfeited to the State only when the police have handed over the unwrought metal to the suspected smuggler.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The Chamber of Mines has an arrangement with the diamond and gold branch of the S.A. Police in terms of which gold bullion is supplied to the police for use in traps designed to apprehend people who contravene the illicit dealing provisions of the Mining Rights Act, 1967. A proportion of the money forfeited to the State in terms of section 156(2) of the Act is paid to the Chamber to compensate for losses suffered by the Chamber when gold used in traps cannot be recovered. This arrangement has worked well for several years but recently, due to the increase in the price of gold, the value of the gold lost has exceeded the proportion of confiscated money paid to the Chamber. In 1974, for example, gold to the value of R55 000 was lost and the Chamber recovered only R24 000. The losses of gold are ascribable to the provision of section 156(2) of the Mining Rights Act whereby the possession of the unwrought precious metal involved in a transaction must be transferred to the illegal buyer so that the money which has been paid to the police will, if the buyer concerned is convicted of an offence, be forfeited to the State. As a result, such buyers from time to time manage to get away with the gold. The Chamber of Mines is concerned about the needless cost of the assistance which it gives to the police and has therefore asked that section 156(2) of the Mining Rights Act be amended so as to correspond with section 108(2) of the Precious Stones Act, 1964, as amended in 1975.</p>

<p>All that we are doing now is to amplify the existing provisions of section 156(2) of the Mining Rights Act so that money or other consideration which has been paid to the Police in connection with an illicit transaction will, if the person concerned is convicted of an offence in connection with that transaction, be forfeited to the State irrespective of whether the possession of the unwrought precious metal which was the subject of the transaction was transferred to the convicted person prior to his arrest or not.</p>

<p>*The position is, therefore, that we have two Acts for precious metals and precious stones. The necessary amendments have been made to the one Act, but not to the other. The proposal which is now before the House is aimed at bringing the two Acts into line as far as this matter is concerned, and the argument used in the past, when the first Act was accepted, is applicable to this Act as well.</p>

<from><span class="col_3205-3206" refersTo="page_0285"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, last year we on this side of the House supported the amendment of the Precious Stones Act. It is only logical that we should support this amendment to the Mining Rights Act as well, and consequently we do not wish to raise any objections to the Second Reading of this Bill. I just want to add, as I did last year, that we are not always quite happy about the principle of police traps. We do realize, and we accept, that especially under the present circumstances, weak-minded people might be tempted to flee the country because they are not happy with the present state of affairs, and that they might then look for means such as precious stones or gold or platinum to enable them to get their wealth or property out of the country. Consequently there is a particular need to ensure that people cannot resort to smuggling with gold or precious stones in order to evade the normal control exercised by way of exchange control. For this reason I accept that there must be a system of police traps, but we request that it should be used with great circumspection to avoid involving in the traps people who may have a weak character or who may be avaricious, but who would not really be inclined to commit a criminal offence. We feel that this legislation is necessary and we support it in the circumstances I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. members for their support. It would not be logical to conduct an argument about police traps at this stage, because, as you know, this aspect has already been debated when similar legislation was before the House. Naturally, the Department of Mining does not do the police work itself; the police take care of this themselves. All the department is trying to do is to determine the circumstances within which the police will operate, and it is not for the Department of Mining to tell the police how to go about their work, because we have great confidence in that department of the police which is in charge of this work. I thank the hon. members for their support.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED, REHOBOTH AND NAMA RELATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill, the Second Reading of which I am moving today, is perhaps one of the most exceptional or unique pieces of legislation which has been introduced in this Parliament in many years. Consequently it is perhaps fitting that I state a few facts about the people of Rehoboth, viz. the Rehoboth Baster Gemeinte of South West Africa, for the information of hon. members, for I believe that hon. members of this House, too will then have great appreciation for this legislation and for what has been achieved in this way by my department.</p>

<p>The Rehobothers are a little nation of mixed descent which, in the previous century, migrated across the Orange River from the Northern Cape into South West Africa under the leadership of their kaptein, a certain Hermanus van Wyk.</p>

<p>In the year 1870, after many wanderings as well as privations in this vast and untamed region, they settled in the vicinity of the present Rehoboth after they had acquired the territory by way of negotiations from the Swartboois, a Nama tribe.</p>

<p>At present the Rehoboth Gebiet is 1 428 788 ha in extent. In general it is good agricultural land, especially suited to animal husbandry. There are approximately 19 000 Basters living in the Rehoboth Gebiet, while many are working in neighbouring towns and cities, including Windhoek. Unfortunately, separate census figures in respect of Basters outside the Gebiet are not available since they are classified as Coloureds outside the Gebiet.</p>

<p>What is important to realize, however, is that this group of coloured migrants was not a disorderly group of exiles, as were sometimes <span class="col_3207-3208" refersTo="page_0286"/>found in those days, but a community which led a law-abiding and orderly existance. In 1872, soon after settling at Rehoboth, they consequently drafted their own constitution which made provision for a government, as well as various other laws to regulate their communal life. Even today they still regard these laws, which they call the paternal laws, with great piety and love, and continue to live their lives according to them. With the occupation of South West Africa by the Germans in 1894 the Rehobothers also came under German rule and the customary Sch&#x00FC;tz treaty was concluded with them as well, but this was accepted with great reluctance on their part. During the First World War they rose in armed rebellion against the Germans and were in fact involved in an engagement with the German forces at a place called Samkhubis when South West Africa was invaded by the Union forces in the south. Consequently the German forces withdrew from Samkhubis and to this day the Rehobothers celebrate their Samkhubis festival every year as a kind of Heroes&#x2019; Day.</p>

<p>Nor were the Rehobothers very interested in the transfer of South West Africa as a mandated territory to the then Union Government after the First World War. In essence they regarded themselves as an independent nation, people who required only to be left in peace to live in Rehoboth under their own paternal laws.</p>

<p>The following are the distinguishing features of this community&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) They call themselves the Baster Gemeinte or the Basters of Rehoboth, and definitely have an identity of their own and a national pride.</li>

<li>(b) They have their own register of persons who qualify for citizenship of Rehoboth. Consequently applicants for citizenship have to be of related descent, of good conduct, have to be acquainted with the laws, morals and norms of the community, and have to go through a trial period and be approved by a council, after which they also have to pay to be able to become citizens.</li>

<li>(c) Then, too, the Rehobothers have numerous institutions of their own which sometimes enjoy no statutory recognition, but which they themselves recognize, maintain and observe, for example their own marriage laws, their own system of land registration, their own Basterhof, etc.</li>

<li>(d) Internally they are an extremely democratic community and the elected council members have to act in close liaison with the people at all times, report regularly to the community and also hold an annual &#x201C;policy meeting&#x201D; at which matters of policy concerning the Gebiet are discussed.</li>

</ol>

<p>As far as administrative institutions are concerned, for example a form of local government, a deadlock has existed during the past 50 years or more. No form of local government has been feasible or acceptable to them. All they wanted was to have their paternal laws recognized and further to be left in peace without outside intervention in their local community matters.</p>

<p>As a solution all administrative authority has since 1924 been placed in the hands of the local magistrate. He is known locally as &#x201C;the Kaptein&#x201D;, and since 1928 he has been assisted in his administration by an advisory council of seven elected Rehoboth citizens.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, however, that during the past 50 years there has been almost no co-operation between the Rehoboth community and governmental bodies such as the Administration of South West Africa or the Government. Indeed, the general atmosphere and disposition was one of great mistrust, stagnation and hostility. Under these circumstances it was impossible to promote the proper planning or development of the Rehoboth Gebiet and its inhabitants effectively. All institutions established on the part of the authorities, even institutions which were purely for the benefit of the inhabitants, for example the Rehoboth Development Corporation, were regarded with mistrust and virtually boycotted. Even assistance in the building of schools was refused, and for many years the Rehobothers built their own schools from their own funds.</p>

<p>During December 1973 my departmental head, however, held a long and very frank meeting with the Baster Advisory Council of Rehoboth. The various problems were discussed in detail and the question of an innate pride, self-development and the right of self-determination was emphasized through-out. <span class="col_3209-3210" refersTo="page_0287"/>As far as the demand for the re-enactment of the Paternal Constitution of 1872 was concerned, it was conceded that it could in fact be done by law. Indeed, the approach was that it was in fact very desirable to use what was indigenous to the nation, such as the paternal laws, as a foundation or starting point for further political development. A constitution should, as it were, grow out of a nation&#x2019;s history, and the background, traditions and administrative concepts of a nation should also be reflected therein.</p>

<p>With these negotiations the breakthrough was made as far as Rehoboth was concerned. At the beginning of 1974 the council began to hold a series of meetings, and formulated their own proposals for a constitution. Essentially their proposals amounted to their desire for the re-enactment of the Paternal Constitution of 1872, to this forming the basis of their constitution and to this not being deviated from. Because they realized, however, that the Paternal Law was obsolete, that it did not comply with all the requirements of a present-day government and that it contained no definition of powers, financial provisions, etc. the council itself put forward a considerable number of proposals for which provision also has to be made in the constitution.</p>

<p>Consequently it was agreed that the constitution would fundamentally be divided into two parts, i.e. a section which would comprise the re-enactment of the Paternal Law of 1872, and secondly a part in which all the additional general provisions would be contained.</p>

<p>On this basis a draft constitution was drawn up and numerous further consultations were held until the Bill in its present form was universally acceptable in its entirety to the Advisory Council and the population of Rehoboth. A number of minor amendments to the Paternal Constitution Act were effected only where necessary and with the concurrence of the council.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that this Bill was ready for introduction last year already, but because there was at that stage still dissension in the ranks of the Baster Council over the question of whether or not the &#x201C;nation&#x201D; had been adequately consulted on the matter, five members of the Baster Council resigned so that the feelings of the people could be tested. Under those circumstances the Bill was held back last year, an election was held in the Rehoboth Gebiet and the verdict of the voters was convincingly in favour of the Bill and for self-government for Rehoboth.</p>

<p>For the information of hon. members I should like to say that during the past two years since this &#x201C;constitutional&#x201D; dispute was resolved, a far better spirit of co-operation and progress has prevailed in Rehoboth. Matters which are, <i>inter alia,</i> receiving attention at present, are matters such as the proper planning of the town of Rehoboth, and the provision of an electricity as well as a water reticulation scheme for the town. Furthermore an overall planning committee for the Gebiet has already been established and it is being proposed to introduce a Bill for the registration of deeds in the Gebiet during the present session. In addition, Rehoboth citizens are already serving on the board of directors of the Rehoboth Development Corporation, the control committee of the Tsumis Breeding Station, the overall planning committee of Rehoboth, and Baster council members of Rehoboth are also playing an active and leading part in the constitutional conference which is at present in progress in Windhoek.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am of the opinion that it is of the utmost importance that hon. members of this House should bear four important aspects in mind in the consideration and discussion of this Bill. In the first place they must realize that the Bill is the product of extensive negotiations which were agreed to with the Baster Advisory Council of Rehoboth. In the second place, hon. members should not forget that this Bill reflects the wishes and desires of the citizens of Rehoboth. In the third place this Bill, as far as Rehoboth is concerned, is an historical document which also reflects closely the distinctive, eventful history and paternal laws of the Rehobothers. Last but not least, hon. members should bear in mind that with this Bill a raw wound which has existed for more than 50 years is being healed, that recognition is being granted to the right of self-determination of the citizens of Rehoboth, and that in this way the foundation is being laid for a new dispensation of co-operation with the Baster Gemeinte of the Gebiet.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, against this background I should now like to furnish a brief elucidation of the most important provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p><i>The Preamble:</i></p>

<p>In the Preamble the commitment of the <span class="col_3211-3212" refersTo="page_0288"/>citizens of Rehoboth to their own traditions and paternal laws is emphasized.</p>

<p><i>Part I:</i></p>

<p>This part of the constitution contains the provisions of the Paternal Constitution of 1872 which, through inclusion in this Bill, is again being brought into operation in Rehoboth.</p>

<p>This part of the Bill also makes provision for:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The election of a Kaptein who then appoints two citizens to his Kaptein&#x2019;s Council, in which the executive government of Rehoboth is vested;</li>

<li>(b) the election of a Legislative Council of six members representing the citizens and to which the laws which the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council wishes to make have to be submitted for ratification; and</li>

<li>(c) certain provisions with regard to citizenship of Rehoboth.</li>

</ol>

<p>As hon. members will see, there is perhaps a great deal which could be changed in these provisions, some of which may even appear strange to hon. members. The Advisory Council also realizes that there are deficiencies which will subsequently perhaps have to be rectified or changed, such as the provision that an annual election for the Legislative Council should be held in January. In order to carry out the instructions of the nation, the council was obliged to re-enact the provisions of the Paternal Law. These were provisions from which it was not permitted to deviate.</p>

<p>In any event, the provisions establish a workable system of government which is certainly quite unique in our public administration, but in which certain practical advantages, too, are definitely inherent, such as the vesting of the administrative authority in the hands of the Kaptein, who is elected directly by the people. A further advantage of the provisions is the establishment of a small Legislative Council which is able to meet as frequently as necessary and without undue embellishment, as well as a system of close liaison with the people themselves.</p>

<p><i>Part II:</i></p>

<p>Part II of the constitution contains general provisions, <i>inter alia</i> on the design of a distinct flag, the acceptance of a national anthem of their own and a provision that Afrikaans and English shall be the official languages of Rehoboth. In addition it is also being provided in what manner the first election of a Kaptein and members of the Legislative Council shall be held, and at what juncture the Government of Rehoboth shall come into being. Once the Government of Rehoboth is established the present Advisory Council falls away.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is being provided that the Executive Government shall be vested in the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council which, together with the Legislative Council, will be able to make laws in respect of all matters referred to in the Schedule. All such legislation has to be submitted to me for further submission to the State President for his assent. Bills thus submitted, may be referred back to the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council in view of further advice and information which may be given.</p>

<p>Although the Baster Gemeinte has had a separate community fund at its disposal all these years, the constitution now confers greater authorities and powers in regard to revenue in Rehoboth on the Government of Rehoboth, and provision is being made for a Rehoboth Revenue Fund of its own. It is foreseen, however, that the Government of Rehoboth will not be able to manage with its own available sources of revenue, and for that reason there is a provision that an annual grant may be paid into the Rehoboth Revenue Fund from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Republic. This will, however, be done in consultation with the Minister of Finance. Estimates of revenue and expenditure shall also be submitted to me annually, and until such time as the legislature of Rehoboth makes other provision, regular inspections shall be carried out by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Republic in respect of all accountable matters.</p>

<p>Every lawfully constituted court continues to exist until altered or disestablished by the authority having power to do so. However, the legislation contains a provision to the effect that at the coming into being of the Government of Rehoboth the control and administration of the magistrate&#x2019;s court and the Basterhof in Rehoboth shall vest in the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council. A separate prison for Rehoboth is also being envisaged.</p>

<p>It is foreseen that the Government of <span class="col_3213-3214" refersTo="page_0289"/>Rehoboth will not initially have sufficient competent and suitable staff at its disposal, and for this reason provision is being made for the secondment of officers to the Government of Rehoboth, provided that such officers shall in all respects remain subject to the laws relating to the Public Service of the Republic. The intention is that these officers will be replaced by suitable Baster officers as these become available.</p>

<p>A provision is also being included to the effect that all executive powers, authorities and functions that have to be exercised in terms of this legislation for bringing this Act into operation and, if necessary, for ensuring the continuation of the administration of Rehoboth in terms of this Act, may be exercised by the Minister.</p>

<p>In the Schedule to the Bill all the matters in respect of which the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council and the Legislative Council have the power to make laws which will not be inconsistent with this Act, are specified. The matters in regard to which laws may be made are clearly set out in the Schedule and warrant no further elucidation at this stage. Members will also note that the legislative and executive powers which are being conferred on Rehoboth in the Bill, and particularly in the Schedule, are restricted almost throughout in the Schedule to Rehoboth itself. The only exceptions of importance are paragraphs 10 or 20 of the Schedule which deal with electoral matters and the levying of taxes.</p>

<p>Clause 16 of the Bill, in which the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council and Legislative Council acquire legislative powers in respect of &#x201C;any citizen of Rehoboth, whether such citizen is or is resident in or outside Rehoboth, but within the territory of South West Africa&#x201D; should also therefore be read in conjunction with this restriction to the Rehoboth Gebiet. In essence it amounts to the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council and the Legislative Council only acquiring powers in regard to Rehoboth citizens outside Rehoboth in respect of the matters referred to in paragraphs 10 and 20 of the Schedule.</p>

<p>In addition hon. members will note that in this Bill there is no list of so-called &#x201C;reserved&#x201D; matters over which the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council and Legislative Council do not acquire executive or legislative authority. The reason is simply because it was deemed unnecessary. The Bill makes it clear that only the matters mentioned in the Schedule are being transferred. Matters not listed in the Schedule, such as foreign affairs, military matters, Posts and Telegraphs, Railways, etc., are obviously not being transferred.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a question which could perhaps be asked in conclusion is whether it is advisable or desirable to proceed at this stage of developments in South West Africa with the introduction of this Bill which, as will generally be understood, grants an advanced degree of self-government to Rehoboth. In this regard the following arguments apply:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The Baster Council of Rehoboth is very anxious to have the Bill passed as quickly as possible;</li>

<li>(b) it would be possible to interpret it as somewhat of a breach of faith to refrain now from introducing the Bill, after the co-operation of Rehoboth has been obtained and their enthusiasm aroused;</li>

<li>(c) the conference in South West Africa itself felt that further steps in the political development of the respective peoples should not be held back or come to a halt because of its deliberations; and</li>

<li>(d) if a different dispensation were to come about in South West Africa at a later stage, the political dispensation of all the various peoples would in any event have to be adjusted to it.</li>

</ol>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it goes without saying that we on this side have considered the Bill against the background of our own policy for South West Africa. When the Odendaal plan, which was actually Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s plan for South West Africa, was before this House in 1964, we condemned the political part of the plan and told the Government that it was making a mistake by weakening local government in the Territory and integrating the administration of the Territory so comprehensively with that of the Republic. We predicted that the Government would have to retrace its steps all the way, and that it would have to restore to South West Africa all the powers of which it had divested the Territory and that it would have to lead the Territory as a whole towards self-governing statehood. The Bill which is now before us deals with the Rehoboth Gebied, in other <span class="col_3215-3216" refersTo="page_0290"/>words only a part of South West Africa. However, it supports the principle of increased local government, and it comprises a transfer of powers from this Parliament to South West Africa. In this respect it runs in the direction of the policy which we have always advocated. We know that the Government is keeping back certain powers because a central government has not yet been established in South West Africa. However, we know that such a central government will have to come soon, and all the remaining powers of this Parliament will then of course have to be transferred to the Territory. A second point of policy which emerges in this Bill is that of decentralization of authority within South West Africa. Hon. members know that we have been advocating and pleading for years that certain regions or areas in South West Africa, which have of old had a distinctive political character within South West Africa, should be developed to enjoy the greatest measure of local self-government, and that they should then, in respect of matters of general national importance, be united in a federal framework. We believe that this is the only available constitutional manner in which the interests of cultural groups or national groups that are in the minority can be protected against domination by a majority. The Basters of Rehoboth have, since the time of the German occupation already, been recognized as a community with a distinctive right of existence and with land rights which ought to be respected&#x2014;which have in fact always been respected by South African governments. Over the years they have developed a strong feeling of solidarity around their own kind and their own land rights.</p>

<p>The Bill before us does not spell it out; it does not tell us what the constitutional position is which Rehoboth, on the basis of what is now being given to it as a start, will have to occupy in a coming independent South West Africa. The hon. the Minister said in his speech that this Bill was &#x201C;a starting point for further political development&#x201D;. I am sorry he did not afford us a glimpse of the political development which he envisages in future and of which this is then the starting point. The Bill recognizes the principle of a decentralization of authority&#x2014;in other words, a division of power within South West Africa. In our opinion this is reconcilable with the basis of a federal state. In this sphere, too, the Bill runs in the direction of our fundamental ideas on the future of South West Africa.</p>

<p>In reality the Bill formally confers on Rehoboth the status of a minority province with a political identity of its own within South West Africa. We believe that it would be wrong not to accord recognition to it. But then we will also have to observe that the community of Rehoboth will in the long run only be able to retain this status if the constitution for local government, which we are conferring upon it here, is going to form part of a further pattern which we think ought to be a federal pattern for South West Africa. I shall not discuss this aspect of the matter any further here, although it is relevant because it has been said that this is the beginning of further political development. However, I am simply mentioning it to reinforce our reason for being able to support this Bill at its Second Reading.</p>

<p>We find it encouraging that a person such as Advocate Eben van Zyl, who is a member of the Executive Committee of South West Africa and one of the three leaders of the National Party at the Constitutional Conference which is at present in progress in Windhoek, said some time ago when he was addressing a conference of 450 Government officials in Windhoek, with reference to the future&#x2014;I am quoting from the official text&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Jy het jou twee belangrikste staatsvorms, nl. &#x2019;n unie of &#x2019;n eenheidstaat, en &#x2019;n federasie, wat ook die vorm van &#x2019;n konfederasie kan aanneem, wat prinsipieel maar dieselfde ding is &#x2026;</block>

<p>He added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die posisie is dat, indien identiteite en maatskaplike stelsels en seggenskap oor jou eie persoonlike sake vir al die bevolkingsgroepe in Suidwes-Afrika van belang is, dan sou jy byvoorbeeld &#x2019;n federasie van State in Suidwes-Afrika kon kry, met een gemeenskaplike oorkoepelende liggaam. Met ander woorde, die integriteit van die Gebied, die geografiese integriteit van die Gebied, kan onder so &#x2019;n stelsel behou word, en daar kan terselfdertyd uitdrukking gegee word aan die verskille en die verskeidenheid wat wel bestaan, en die begeerte om oor jou eie identiteit te waak en seggenskap in jou eie sake te h&#x00EA;.</block>

<p><span class="col_3217-3218" refersTo="page_0291"/>I have seldom heard such an excellent testimonial to the position we believe Rehoboth should occupy in a federation in South West Africa. [Interjections.] I hope that members who represent the Whites of South West Africa in this House will endorse the course their leaders are adopting in Windhoek when they rise here to support this Bill.</p>

<p>Because the Bill is based on the principle of, firstly, the relinquishing of authority by this Parliament, by the Republic, to authorities in South West Africa, secondly, the recognition of the historical identity within South West Africa of Rehoboth and the Baster community there; and, thirdly a decentralization of political power wherever geographic-social circumstances make it possible within South West Africa, we shall not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. There is a further important reason why we shall not oppose it, which is that the Baster nation has for years been agitating&#x2014;the hon. the Minister also referred to this&#x2014;for the restoration of their local Legislative Council, as it is called, for the restoration of self-government according to their old traditional Kaptain system and for the re-enactment of the old Paternal Constitution of 1872. They admit candidly that the paternal laws are in many respects obsolete, and anyone who glances at the Bill before us will agree with that. They realize that they will have to modernize it, but they should like to do so themselves. We believe that it is a perfectly commendable sentiment that these people want to help themselves. That is another reason why we do not want to oppose the Bill. But I must say that the Government has chosen a bad time to come forward with this Bill. We believe that the Government should have introduced the Bill years ago. Under the circumstances in which it is now being introduced it will undoubtedly lead to misunderstanding and criticism in the outside world. But I shall return to this point at a later stage.</p>

<p>What we, as a responsible Parliament, cannot ignore is that the Baster community of Rehoboth has itself insisted on local self-government. In fact, it was the subject of the latest election for the Baster Advisory Council of Rehoboth, and the party of Dr. Africa, who was in favour of the restoration of the so-called Paternal Constitution, won the election convincingly. The hon. the Minister and speakers on the opposite side must not tell us that this Bill as such was before the voters of Rehoboth. Bills are not presented to voters. As far as we know, they did not express an opinion on the form and the wording of this Bill What they did in fact express an opinion on was the underlying principle, namely that the Paternal Constitution should be restored, and that the Kaptein and the Legislative Council should be elected by themselves and be vested with executive powers. We believe it to be an important consideration that the wishes of the Baster Community of Rehoboth should be heeded as far as possible. I am saying &#x201C;as far as possible&#x201D; deliberately, that we should heed the wishes of the voters of Rehoboth &#x201C;as far as possible&#x201D;, and also those of other regions if similar cases should occur. This Parliament has certain responsibilities towards South West Africa, responsibilities which we cannot simply put aside. That is why we are saying that these wishes should be heeded as far as possible. We must take into consideration that South West Africa as a whole, as a unity, has been entrusted to administration and care of South Africa. Our mandate has been defined, and we accept that the Territory has an international status. We cannot alter or modify that international status unilaterally, i.e. without the co-operation of the international community. To mention an example: If the Whites of South West Africa were unilaterally to request us to incorporate that portion of South West Africa which falls under the jurisdiction of the White Legislative Assembly, in the Republic of South Africa, then this Parliament would not be able to do so.</p>

<p>If a majority of the Ovambos, for example, were to ask us&#x2014;I know they are not in favour of this, but if they were to ask us&#x2014;to declare Owambo a sovereign independent state, then we would not be able to do that on our own either. Similarly, if the electors of Rehoboth were to say that they wanted to become an independent state, we as Parliament would not be able to accede to that. As Parliament, we have a framework within which we can act. The position has been accepted by the Government that it is a territory with an international status over which South Africa does not have unilateral control. It is not part of our sovereignty&#x2014;that is the reason, Sir, why we cannot act as we would like to do. All the population groups of South West Africa are shareholders in the whole. Therefore we cannot violate the integrity of the Territory in <span class="col_3219-3220" refersTo="page_0292"/>favour of some population group or other. We cannot put the unity of the Territory up for auction. In fact, the Government has guaranteed to UNO the preservation of the integrity of South West Africa. The concept &#x201C;self-determination and independence&#x201D; for South West Africa, as the Government and all of us accept it, relates to the territory as a whole, unless of course we obtain the co-operation of the international community for, say, a partition of the territory, provided its various population groups would want such a thing. I am mentioning this, Sir, because I want to indicate that the will of the voters of any population group&#x2014;and we are dealing here with the will of the voters of Rehoboth&#x2014; should be seen within this framework. Consequently we as a responsible Parliament are only able to comply with the wishes of the voters of Rehoboth in so far as they want local self-government and not complete, full, political independence.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter now is that the Baster Advisory Council under the leadership of Dr. Africa, who is at the same time the chairman of the Constitutional Conference in Windhoek, have expressed a very clear opinion in regard to this matter. I have here a copy of a memorandum submitted by the Baster Advisory Council to the Government, and I want to criticize the hon. the Minister for not having submitted this report to Parliament in the form of a memorandum.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am pointing out what the Minister ought to have done, timeously, when the Bill was introduced. A few of us received copies, but only much later. I think it was the Minister&#x2019;s duty to have submitted it as a document to Parliament. We had to go looking for it. There is not even a date on the document. In any case, the point I want to make is that in paragraph 11 of the report to the Government the people of Rehoboth made it abundantly clear that their request for the re-enactment of the Paternal Constitution was not intended as an endeavour to achieve a kind of homeland independence. I want to quote the full text. The hon. the Minister should look at paragraph 11. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Adviserende Basterraad beklemtoon dit dat hy geensins die bedoeling of gedagte het om deur die herinstelling van die betrokke wet &#x2019;n posisie van onafhanklikheid of soewereiniteit te bereik nie &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is absolutely clear. In personal conversations which five of us had approximately 14 days ago in Windhoek with quite a number of the leaders, <i>inter alia,</i> too, with leaders from Rehoboth, they emphasized this and in fact requested us to help eliminate the impression which the form of the Bill creates, viz. that they are aspiring to full political independence, when the Bill was before the House of Assembly. They were completely aware of the fact that within South West Africa, particularly among the Coloured group and the leaders of the Herero group sitting with them in the Constitutional Conference, there was serious criticism of the form of the Bill as well as its timing, in spite of what the hon. the Minister said towards the end of his speech. We heard that criticism ourselves, as expressed by those people. They want nothing to do with anything along the lines of the Governments&#x2019; policy in the Republic of partition or of little independent homelands.</p>

<p>This brings me to the criticism which we on this side have against the Bill. The Preamble, certain provisions and the general terminology of the Bill creates the impression&#x2014;I emphasize the word &#x201C;impression&#x201D;; I am not dealing now with what the motives of the Government or the hon. the Minister could have been&#x2014;that we are dealing with an independent State-in-the-making, something which is precisely what the Baster leaders wanted to avoid. No one his his right mind would ever dream that Rehoboth with its 19 000 people, which is the size of one electoral division in the Republic, could <span class="col_3221-3222" refersTo="page_0293"/>become an independent state, and even to think along those lines is too ridiculous for words. According to their report the Baster leaders themselves wish to avoid such an impression gaining ground. The hon. the Minister let it appear that they had looked at the Bill, and that is something which I accept. However, if they had looked at the Bill as it now appears in its final form, they were perhaps not careful enough to recognize its implications in some respects. I do not want to anticipate the Committee Stage of the Bill now, but to quote only a few examples, I want to point out that the Bill makes provision for the establishment of a &#x201C;Government&#x201D; for Rehoboth. Please note that a capital &#x201C;G&#x201D; is used. In the same Bill reference is made to the &#x201C;Government of the Republic of South Africa&#x201D;. In this case, too, there is a capital &#x201C;G&#x201D;. Surely it is absurd, in respect of constitutional status, to place the administration of Rehoboth on the same footing as that of the Government of the Republic. There can be only one Government&#x2014;with a capital &#x201C;G&#x201D;&#x2014;in a country. The Legislative Assembly of South West Africa has far more powers than the Legislative Council of the Basters will receive, but the Legislative Assembly is not referred to officially as the Government of South West Africa, but as the Administration of South West Africa. I think this is something to which ought to be given because it is the kind of thing which could create misunderstanding and cause the idea to gain ground that the Government is here creating an independent State-in-the-making in terms of its homeland policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>What is involved here is not their wishes. I have in fact stated that we in this House have a duty. There are certain wishes which the Whites have, and with which we cannot comply. We have an obligation to refrain from doing anything here which could cause misunderstanding to gain ground in the outside world. In any event the Basters asked us to eliminate that misunderstanding. Furthermore, where the Bill refers to &#x201C;self-government&#x201D; we shall propose that the expression &#x201C;local self-government&#x201D; be used, and that the words &#x201C;within the territory of South West Africa&#x201D; be added. If the Government is being honest when it says that it is not engaged here in the partitioning off of a region of South West Africa, I cannot see what objection it can have to our proposal. During the Committee Stage we shall make other positive proposals. <i>Inter alia</i> we want paragraph 11 of the memorandum, in which the Basters themselves state unequivocally that they want local self-government and not an independent status, to be clearly incorporated in the Preamble to the Bill so that there can be no doubt about what is being passed here. As far as we are concerned, it is essential to counteract hostile propaganda. Why place hostile propaganda into the hands of the outside world or the UN unnecessarily&#x003F; Misunderstanding should be eliminated. We therefore want these things to be removed from the Bill. We do not want citizenship of the Rehoboth Gebiet to be incompatible with a future general citizenship of South West Africa.</p>

<p>We are also strongly opposed to the provision in the Bill which will give the Legislative Assembly of Rehoboth control over Rehoboth citizens permanently or temporarily resident outside the Gebiet. None of our provincial councils&#x2014;regardless of the fact that it is in a limited sphere, as the hon. the Minister consequently indicated in his speech&#x2014;have such powers outside their area. We feel that this is an infringement of the right of other recognized regions in South West Africa to demand local government for themselves in their own regions. We feel that it intrudes on the spheres of others, and anticipates the programme with which the Constitutional Conference may perhaps come forward for South West Africa as a whole. I think that creating the impression that one wishes to anticipate the comprehensive taste of the Constitutional Conference should be avoided. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that it is the duty of Parliament to grant credibility to that constitutional conference.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is also a racial provision in the Bill which we cannot support. Colour discrimination is being introduced here. Clause 33 makes it compulsory that if a White person, presumably because he is White, is sentenced to imprisonment by a court in Rehoboth, he shall be transferred forthwith to a prison in the Republic of South Africa. We cannot accept this type of colour discrimination <span class="col_3223-3224" refersTo="page_0294"/>in legislation, particularly legislation relating to South West Africa. I am surprised that a Government which has committed itself to the elimination of colour discrimination is still able to come to Parliament with such a proposal.</p>

<p>I should just like to summarize our position. It is our policy that the territorial integrity of South West Africa should be recognized; that South West Africa as a territory should be led to sovereign independence as soon as possible; that the power which Parliament has over South West Africa and its people should be handed over to South West Africa and to authorities in South West Africa without delay; and that decentralization of authority within the framework of a federal structure for South West Africa is the best way of ensuring the existence of minority groups and avoiding the danger of the domination of all by some groups. Because we see that the fundamental principle of the Bill before us is not in conflict with the principles which I have just stated, we shall not oppose the Second Reading. However, I have mentioned that we have important objections to certain aspects of the Bill and that the Bill is cast in a form which could cause certain misunderstandings which should be eliminated. If the Government wants the Bill to be acceptable in its final stage as well then I want to say that we shall make positive proposals during the Committee Stage. We hope that the attitude of the Government will be as positive.</p>

<p>In conclusion: The usual contention from the Government side is that matters relating to South West Africa are of a delicate nature. We agree with that. We only hope that the Government will realize this itself. If the Government had been aware of its duty and had really been concerned about the delicacy of South West African matters then it ought to have submitted the Bill to and discussed it with the Oppositon before coming to this House with it. I am mentioning this because we can expect to receive considerably more amending Bills in regard to South West Africa, in the near future. If the Government has the wisdom which a government ought to have, it will try to avoid dealing with legislation relating to South West Africa on an ordinary party-political basis in future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on the one hand it is something to be grateful for that the Opposition adopts the standpoint that they are not going to oppose the Bill at this reading. On the other hand, however, there are certain things the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said which I deplore. At one stage the hon. member represented a seat in South West Africa and he ought therefore to know better.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the self-determination of South West Africa as a whole. I want to tell him, and provide him with proof, that every people in South West Africa has the right to self-determination, including the Rehoboth people. I want to quote from section 1(2) of the Charter of UNO&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to develop friendly relations amongst nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights of self-determination of peoples.</block>

<p>Hon. members must note that the word &#x201C;peoples&#x201D; is used. However, that is not how the original text of this article read after the Dumbarton Oaks Convention. In fact the four great powers, viz. Britain, Russia, China and America, effected an amendment. The original read quite differently, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to develop friendly relations amongst nations and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.</block>

<p>However, the four great powers then decided that the following should be added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; based on the respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.</block>

<p>It is interesting to note that when the matter was discussed in the General Assembly, where the charter was given its final form, a lawyer like Henry Rollin asked what this meant. He said that we could speak about the self-determination of states but asked what &#x201C;the self-determination of peoples&#x201D; meant. He asked whether it meant that the French in Canada had the right of self-determination, whether the Irish in Ireland had the right of self-determination, etc. The eventual outcome of the matter was that they decided unanimously to insert this amendment and to emphasize that all the peoples in countries with a diversity of peoples had the right of self-determination. <span class="col_3225-3226" refersTo="page_0295"/>I do not deem it necessary to go into this further.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a very good speech, but I strongly resent his jeopardizing the present constitutional conference in South West Africa and the future of the six hon. members who represent South West Africa in Parliament, by recklessly making quotations and making predictions in connection with the constitutional conference. He knows what our standpoint is. Nevertheless he comes along here and states that we want a federation in South West Africa. Not one word of this is true. To us, all options are open as far as the future of South West Africa is concerned. What did the hon. member himself say at the symposium in South West Africa the other day&#x003F; The Opposition in South West now call themselves the Federal Party with reference to the federal policy of the party to which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout belongs, and their mouthpiece in South West is the <i>Suidwes-Afrikaner.</i> I quote from a report which appeared in that newspaper on 27 February, in which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hy dink ons is by die punt verby waar &#x2019;n oplossing vir Suidwes-Afrika heeltemal vreedsaam kan wees, maar hy dink dat ons nog ons vyande kan uitoorl&#x00EA; as ons wakker skrik en selfs &#x2019;n revolusie in Suid-Afrika lei.</block>

<p>He then goes on to say, as he is time and again reported as having said in the article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons is reeds by die punt verby waar &#x2019;n oplossing heeltemal vreedsaam kan wees.</block>

<p>He then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit kan slegs met revolusie gebeur.</block>

<p>It should not be necessary for me to explain to that hon. member what the difference is between revolution and evolution in international law. All the hon. member did was to attempt to cause the conference in South West Africa to fail, because it would suit his book and the book of the UP for the conference in South West Africa to fail. He has no interest in the future of South West Africa, as I have, and as the hon. representatives of South West Africa in this House have. That is why he does not give two pins for the future of South West Africa. I shall come back to the hon. member later.</p>

<p>I first want to deal with this issue on a historical basis because I think that of all the members of this House, I have perhaps done the most research in connection with the various peoples of South West Africa. I am a member of the Archives Commission and I looked up the original documents to obtain further details in connection with the peoples of South West. It is interesting to note that the first miscegenation took place in the Cape as a result of a policy of the D.E.I.C. to bring about friendly relations between the various indigenous peoples and the Whites. As a result Eva, for example, a Hottentot woman who grew up in the household of Jan van Riebeeck, married one Pieter van Meerhof, a White traveller. This took place under the rule of the second governor, Zacharias Wagenaar, and was intended to promote good relations between the indigenous peoples and the Whites. It is very interesting to note that the cost of the wedding feast was borne by the D.E.I.C. As a dowry they paid Eva R20 and did her bridegroom, Pieter van Meerhof, the favour of appointing him as a doctor at a salary of &#x00A3;3 per month.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that we only began to hear about some of the Baster communities&#x2014;I am not referring to Coloureds now&#x2014;in the latter half of the 18th century. They were established in the north-west, where the Baster communities had developed at places like Kamiesberg, Zakrivier, Amandelboom&#x2014;now called Williston&#x2014;Kommaggas, Pella and other places. There it was a definite policy of missionaries like Schmelen, Wimmer and others to marry non-White women. They were constantly encouraging the Whites to marry the non-Whites. In terms of their laws, if a White person married a non-White woman, he received a farm as a dowry. Nevertheless, an English missionary by the name of John Campbell arrived there in 1813 and told them that the word &#x201C;Bastards&#x201D; in English&#x2014;up to now they have been known as Baster communities&#x2014;was not the right word for them, and that they should change it. He persuaded them to adopt the name &#x201C;Griquas&#x201D; because at the time they were established at Klaarwater, which later became Griquatown. A large group of these Basters did in fact leave there to trek to South West Africa. In 1847 they crossed the Orange River border. In <span class="col_3227-3228" refersTo="page_0296"/>February 1868 at Warmbad, the Paternal Laws, to which the hon. the Minister referred, were drawn up for the first time. Not only those Acts, but a great many others were also drawn up. I have them here. One of the most important was one dated 31 January 1872, dealing with the Kaptein, the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council, the Legislative Council, civil rights and decisions. They also have another Act dated 31 January 1872, dealing with the judges, field-comets and officials. There is one dated 27 February 1872, another dated 13 March 1872, another dated 10 April 1872 and another dated 8 July 1872, all of which are regarded as their Paternal Laws. It is interesting to note that they then moved further north, towards South West Africa, and there their leader, Hermanus van Wyk, went to Okahandja, where he met Maharero, the chief of the Hereros, and Abraham Swartbooi, who was really the lawful owner of the present Rehoboth Baster area. They did not call themselves Griquas, but Basters. In Rehoboth, too, they applied the law that if a White married a Baster girl, he received a farm as a gift from the Rehoboth government.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that a dispute then arose and they first had to rent the place because Swartbooi did not want to sell it. Initially they had to pay a horse a year to Swartbooi for the rent of the territory. At one state they were short of water and they then maintained that they could not develop the territory unless they bought it, and eventually the territory was bought at a price of 100 horses and five wagons. The date of the agreement is given as 23 December 1857. However this is a misprint in the document because the year should be 1875 and not 1857. The Rev. B&#x00F6;hm maintains that the contract was put in writing but apparently the contract was lost when the documents of the Department of Bantu Affairs were lost in a fire at Cape Town. Today no-one knows what became of the document. Nevertheless, Hermanus van Wyk succeeded in obtaining the territory and it does not matter how this came about. When the Germans came into power they concluded a treaty of friendship and subsequently a treaty relating to the defence of Rehoboth on 15 September 1885 and 26 July 1895 respectively, which gave Germany absolute sovereignty over the Rehoboth territory. For example, section 1 provided that the German flag would be hoisted in Rehoboth. However, it is very interesting to note that after the death of Hermanus van Wyk in 1905, the Germans abolished the post of &#x201C;Kaptein&#x201D;. I obtained the details of this from the original documents. It appears that they received instructions that from then on there would no longer be a &#x201C;Kaptein&#x201D;. However, Cornelius van Wyk, the son of Hermanus van Wyk, continued to be the Kaptein of Rehoboth in the eyes of the people. They also called him Neels van Wyk, but the Germans called him the Gemeindevorsteher, which is more or less the same as &#x201C;leader&#x201D; in English. When the Union troops took over, a deputation from the Rehoboth Basters approached the late Gen. Botha in Swakopmund and consulted him as to what was to become of the Rehoboth &#x201C;Gebiet&#x201D;. I shall read to you an instruction from the Secretary of Defence dated 9 June 1916&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Genl. Botha denkt dat ons niks moet doen nie om hul onafhanklikheid of hul status deur die Duitse Regering erken, te verminder nie.</block>

<p>In other words, the political position as it was left by the Germans was accepted. That is how the position there continued.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the Rehoboth Basters sold more and more of their land to Whites, as would have happened in every Bantu area in South Africa if we had not protected the Black people of South Africa. The tragedy is that in the year 1905, Magistrate B&#x00F6;tllin, the then magistrate at Rehoboth, pointed out that the inhabitants of Rehoboth had already sold 250 ha of their land, one-sixth of the total area, to Whites during the previous seven years. He calculated that within 50 years they would have bartered away the whole of Rehoboth to Whites. That is why the then Union Government proclaimed Rehoboth as a territory and granted them a certain degree of self-government. An agreement was concluded with them on 27 August 1923 but various factions developed in Rehoboth which I should not like to go into now. For example, in 1924 there was an election and the majority party refused to take part in the election. The minority party won the election and subsequently the majority party held their own election, won all the seats and said that they were the legal government. Subsequently the Union Government issued proclamation 31 of 1924. It came into effect <span class="col_3229-3230" refersTo="page_0297"/>on 10 December 1924. This proclamation totally abolished the office of &#x201C;Kaptein&#x201D;, took away all the powers of the &#x201C;Kaptein&#x201D;, the Council and the officials and placed everything in the hands of the magistrate at Rehoboth. And today we have the privilege of having one of the former magistrates of Rehoboth sitting in the Government officials&#x2019; bench.</p>

<p>That, in broad outline, is more or less the history of the Rehoboth Basters. I should also like to pay tribute to this Baster community in Rehoboth. If one examines the entire history, one notices one outstanding characteristic of the way in which they developed, viz. that they adopted and lived in accordance with the Christian faith, and that is why I am pleased that in this Bill, too, the Minister mentioned the following in the preamble to the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas it is the desire of the citizens of the &#x201C;Rehoboth Gebiet&#x201D; that self-government be granted to them; &#x2026; and whereas it is desirable &#x2026; to establish &#x2026; a Government for Rehoboth that &#x2026; will propagate the ideals of the Christian civilization &#x2026;</block>

<p>This has been a characteristic of the Rehoboth Basters throughout. Another very fine characteristic which we should in fact have remembered in this year of the Afrikaans Language Festival is the fact that the Rehoboth Basters have retained Afrikaans as their home language throughout. This Bill, of course, lays down that Afrikaans and English are the official languages of the Rehoboth Baster community, but they have retained Afrikaans as their home language throughout. The third tribute I want to pay to them is that throughout their history they have never lived lawlessly, but have always had laws, and drew up a constitution for themselves. From the earliest days when they were living at Komaggas, they drew up the 14 laws and subsequently they drew up their Paternal Laws and they are bound to them. Today we are placing this legislation on the Statute Book for them.</p>

<p>The legislation represents a milestone in the history of Rehoboth and crowns the colourful history of the Rehoboth people. Today I want to pay tribute not only to the White officials who have served there as magistrates and in other capacities, and who have served with the greatest dedication, but also to the Basters of Rehoboth, like Dr. Africa, who feels that it is their territory and who has ploughed back the learning he has acquired into the territory belonging to his people. He returned to his people to uplift them because after all, what is finer than for a man to come back to his own people to uplift them&#x003F; We are today engaged in the conference in South West Africa and Dr. Africa is one of the outstanding figures. If you have seen him on television and at Press conferences abroad, you will realize what a distinguished man he is.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is also a history of division, which was caused chiefly by the fact that a section of the Rehoboth Basters intermarried with a White group, whereas another section did not do so. There is still conflict between those two factions today, and it is a pity that this should be so. I hope that this legislation, which provides for their own national anthem and their own flag, will contribute towards making Rehoboth a great territory, a prosperous territory, a territory where unanimity prevails, a territory in which each Rehobother&#x2014;I do not like the word &#x201C;Baster&#x201D; and furthermore it is spelled out in the legislation that they will no longer be called Rehoboth Basters, but the people of Rehoboth&#x2014;will make use of these privileges.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked how far these people would progress under the legislation we have here. The answer is obvious: They have self-determination in the full sense of the word. If they were to come forward next year with the request that they wanted to replace their Paternal Laws with something else, then it would most definitely be the duty of this Parliament to comply with their request. The legislation before the House today cannot be regarded as the end of the road as far as Rehoboth is concerned. A great many improvements could still be effected, and I believe that as Rehoboth develops, this legislation will be adapted from time to time. However, it is their sovereign and inalienable right to exercise their right of self-determination. However, they will have the right of self-determination. The right of self-determination is not only for great peoples like America, France and Germany; it is the right, too, of the 19 000 people who are living in Rehoboth at the moment, and of the approximately 10 000 Rehobothers living outside that territory.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the hon. member whether he accepts in principle that it would be possible, if the Rehobothers were to request this Parliament to become fully independent within the South West African territory, that this could then take place&#x003F;</p>

<p>Most definitely so, yes. Every people in South West Africa has the inalienable right of self-determination. Hon. members opposite always like to talk about the Declaration of Human Rights. I want to put it to them that self-determination is the highest right of man. If a people cannot be free, how can the individual be free&#x003F; If a people is enslaved and does not have the right of self-determination, how can the ordinary citizen of that people enjoy human rights&#x003F; That is why it is my argument that self-determination is an inalienable right of every person. The right of a people to freedom and self-determination is the highest claim which a people can make. In Africa, South Africa is the champion of true human rights. Nor do we begrudge this freedom to any other people either. That, too, is why it is the policy of this Government to place all people in this country on the road to self-determination and to enable them to become sovereign and independent in time.</p>

<p>Now of course, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is going to ask me whether Rehoboth is viable.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the member how a people which does not have territory of its own, which has to share the same territory with other peoples can ever exercise fully the right of self-determination.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I could give the hon. member the example of South Africa. The hon. member will of course want to lump the Transkei, Vendaland, Bophuthatswana and all the other territories together and make one country of them. However there is as little possibility of doing that as there is of combining countries like Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy into one conglomeration and trying to make a single people out of all of them.</p>

<p>That is why I say that the greatest right a people can ever demand is the right of self-determination. Only then can the individual lay claim to those so-called, much-praised true human rights.</p>

<p>Time is catching up with me and there is still a great deal I want to say. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout discussed this matter in the context of the constitutional conference in South West Africa. Today I should like to make a very friendly and earnest appeal to hon. members of the United Party and the Progressive Party&#x2014;if they would like to see how responsible people determine their own future&#x2014;to go to the Turnhalle in Windhoek where representatives of the 11 population groups of South West Africa are engaged in their constitutional conference. Those people have learned the lesson of Angola, of Mozambique and of all the other parts of the world. They are setting an example of how responsible people reject the chaos and disorder which has prevailed elsewhere in the world and are seriously, and without excessive haste, discuss their own future. There is no haste; the future of a people is not decided within minutes, nor is it decided overnight. It is a lengthy process. There are people whose future has been determined over centuries.</p>

<p>Now I want to make a further appeal to those hon. members. We are dealing here with legislation relating to Rehoboth, legislation which confirms those things to which the Rehobothers may rightly lay claim. We concede that there are many open possibilities. If the people of Rehoboth were to ask, tomorrow or next year, to be allowed to integrate with the Hereros or with the Damaras, or whoever, this would be regarded as part of their right of self-determination and they would not be stopped, with the proviso that the other people also wanted to integrate. If the Hereros declared themselves prepared to integrate with the Rehobothers, then in terms of their right of self-determination they would be free to do as they chose. This Government would have no alternative but to allow it. Nothing can stop them from implementing their own decisions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that the hon. members opposite do not have the vaguest idea of the meaning of the right of self-determination. Apparently they will go to their <span class="col_3233-3234" refersTo="page_0299"/>graves without understanding it, too, because the essence of their policy is still the imperialists of the 17th and 18th centuries. [Interjections.] The ghosts of Kitchener and Milner still haunt this House. Those hon. members think of South Africa as one great country which they can appropriate for themselves, that they can therefore lay claim to the Transkei, to Bophuthatswana and the others. Just like the British Empire, they want to appropriate as much as possible for themselves in order eventually to establish one great empire.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must come back to the Bill. I must say that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout provoked me a great deal. We, the representatives of South West Africa in this House, are aware of the vitally important decision which must be taken by the representatives of the various population groups there. That is why I want to appeal once again to hon. members here not, in heaven&#x2019;s name, to try to misuse this legislation to cause the conference in South West Africa to fail. If that conference fails, it will not only be to the detriment of the Whites in South Africa; it will also be a crime against the non-White peoples of South West Africa.</p>
