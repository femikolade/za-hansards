<p>Mr. Speaker, we have come now to the last hour of the debate on the budget, which has taken place all week. We have witnessed in the past few days in this debate an unprecedented attack by the Government members on the PRP, and in particular the representatives of this party in these benches. Just to put the record straight, I want to refer to the comments made by the hon. member for Bloemfontein North regarding a report in <i>Die Volksblad</i> which referred to a visit and a conference in Germany. In the first instance, the report is totally inaccurate in that the hon. member for Sea Point was not even in Germany, as the report stated.</p>

<p>It was Japie Basson.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>I understand the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was there. Secondly, Sir, the Secretary for Coloured Affairs was there and, after the hon. member for Rondebosch had made his speech at that conference, he was congratulated by the Secretary for Coloured Affairs at that time, which he would hardly have done if the hon. member had done the sort of thing this newspaper article attributed to him. So, Sir, we dismiss this report with contempt, and have written to the newspaper to that effect.</p>

<p>The nature of the attack by the hon. members on that side of the House has been emotional, hysterical and totally irresponsible. Sneers, innuendoes, half-truths and insinuations have characterized the tirade which has flowed from that side. [Interjections.] Now, we have to ask this question: Why have they resorted to this all-out attack at ministerial level, at Deputy Minister level, at middle bench level, and, of course, at back bench level&#x003F; Why have they done this&#x003F; Why have they mounted this enormous attack&#x003F; I would suggest that there are four reasons.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Before the hon. member continues, I want to point out to him that he may not allege that hon. members of this House have made use of half-truths. He must therefore withdraw that remark.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Speaker. As I was saying, I believe there are four reasons for the attacks by hon. members opposite. The first is to obscure a most severe budget, which has already sent the cost of living soaring to new heights and has made life even more difficult for the poorest people in this country. The second is to remove the spotlight from the miserable failure of 28 years of Nationalist rule, which has left South Africa in a position of grave vulnerability. The third reason is that they have finally realized that the real opposition to their unjust, unrealistic and dangerous policy of apartheid or separate development is the PRP. In allocating most of their speeches to this party and to these benches throughout this week, they have paid us the supreme compliment. We have found a nerve and they have responded with what was intended to be an angry cry of outrage, but which came across as the desperate squeal of a party that has lost its way. [Interjections.] The fourth reason is that we must not forget that there is a by-election in Durban North. That is why we had all these hysterical outbursts. It is true that Senator Denis Worrall is on record as saying that only two alternative policies face South Africa, namely the one offered by his party, the Nationalist Party, and the other offered by the PRP. He has said this in Durban North, and of course this has found a grave echo here in this House. The only mistake that the Senator has made and continues to make is that the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy has no viable alternative to offer South Africa at this time. Sir, if the Government members had hoped that, by this pathetic display, they would hide the failures of their own policies, they were mistaken, for the casualties, the heartaches, the anger, the growing hostility amongst the Black peoples of South Africa, bear eloquent witness to the disastrous consequences of 28 years of Nationalist rule. At this very moment in time South Africa faces a crisis. I shall come back to that, because we stand by it that we are in a time of crisis. [Interjections.] As I have said, I shall come back to that. At this very moment, when we stand in this hour of crisis, what does this Government do in the implementation of its policies&#x003F; At this moment it has bulldozers knocking down the frail shanty homes of people who have nowhere else to live. That is what is happening. Secondly, what are they doing at this very moment to implement their <span class="col_4915-4916" refersTo="page_1140"/>group areas policy&#x003F; Coloured people who are living in Somerset West and have lived there all their lives are now being moved, despite the protests of the White community in that area. They are being moved right at this very moment and we cannot afford such destructive methods and such wastefulness. This is the kind of attitude that this Government adopts. It is blind to the crisis which stares us in the face. Bulldozing is a characteristic of that party&#x2019;s policies. That is how they solve the situation. That is how they solve the situation.</p>

<p>Their second area of activity is to break up communities. One of the major reasons for the housing shortage of the Coloured people in the Cape is that this Government, by design and not by accident, has destroyed a community called District Six. There is a shortage of housing; that is part of their policy. There is inequality in education; that is part of their policy. They subject the vast majority of people living in this country to the indignity and dehumanization of the pass laws. Part of their policy is race classification, part of their policy is job reservation, and the keystone of their entire labour policy is based on the iniquity of migrant labour. Right at the very heart of the Government&#x2019;s policy is a determination, not merely to separate, but also to destroy, to break, to divide a Black man in half. On the one hand he is a labour unit and on the other hand he is a person with a family. The Government has separated those two. We cannot afford to do that in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, I have no time to answer questions now. We are trying to solve our economic development with a labour force of which the vast majority really cannot be expected to extend moral commitment to a social system which the economy serves. Fifty-nine per cent of economically active African men in the so-called White areas in 1970 were migrant workers. If you exclude the agricultural sector, that proportion goes up to 85%. As one economist has pointed out, more than half the adult males in homeland rural areas are absent from their homes for the greater part of their working life, and amongst the better educated echelons this absentee rate reaches nearly 90%. [Interjections.] This Government has no right to undermine the family unit as it is doing in South Africa, and that is one of the reasons why we are facing the kind of crisis we are at this moment. As a result of this, by its very policies, the Government has created a seedbed of unrest which is tailor-made for communist exploitation.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. the Minister of the Interior, let me say that we are on record as having said that the PRP is diametrically opposed to the communist philosophy and practice. [Interjections.] Hon. members have asked the question. Let me now answer it. We believe that no party, no organization, no person guilty of subversion or seeking to overthrow constitutional government, should be allowed to operate in South Africa, but&#x2014;hon. members must listen to the whole answer&#x2014;we do not believe in banning individuals or groups. I understand that the hon. the Minister of the Interior and his Government are absolutely consistent in their policy. They have a policy which allows people to be restricted or banned&#x2014;use whatever term you desire. However, I want to put a question to the UP, and I am sorry that the hon. member for Umhlatuzana is not here. Let me ask the members right now whether they believe in banning.</p>

<p>&#x201C;What nonsense&#x201D;, says the hon. member. Well, how on earth then are you going to deal with the situation except through the courts of law&#x003F; We have maintained that in order to overthrow and condemn communism &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member is completely irrelevant; so just keep out of this. I was talking to your front bench. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, we do not believe &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! May I point out that the members of the minority party have been addressed in this debate from various sides of this House regarding their policy and standpoints and that they should therefore be given the opportunity now of replying to that. I want to request the hon. member for Pine-lands, however, to moderate his language as much as possible. For the rest, I ask hon. members to give the hon. member a proper hearing. The hon. member may proceed.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from><span class="col_4917-4918" refersTo="page_1141"/>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The major point that I wish to make is that you do not have to destroy democracy in order to deal with subversion. And that is exactly what the Government&#x2019;s policy announces. We have said again and again, and I repeat it now, that the PRP stands for impartial courts while the communists do not. We believe in a policy of free enterprise while the communists do not. With due respect, the hon. the Minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that we represent capitalism on the one hand and then by implication suggest at the same time that we are soft on communism. Hon. members on that side of the House cannot have it both ways. They have to make up their minds. We believe in the mobility of labour; the communists do not. We believe in the liberty of the individual; the communists do not. We believe in freedom of essential association; the communists do not. We believe in the rule of law; the communists do not. We believe in parliamentary democracy; the communists do not.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask you a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>No, <b>I</b> am sorry. I have very little time. I know the nature of that hon. Minister&#x2019;s questions and I am not prepared to answer them. We have said repeatedly that we are in an hour of crisis in South Africa. The hon. the Minister of the Interior is very concerned about the fact that we believe we are in an hour of crisis. As I listened to that hon. Minister&#x2019;s own remarks, to the speeches of the hon. the Prime Minister, those of many of his colleagues and the many speakers in this debate and in other debated, I realized that we were in a situation which perhaps we have never faced before. Whether hon. members call it being at the crossroads or whether they call it a watershed, the fact is that we are in a time of extreme difficulty and of potential danger in South Africa. Anybody who pretends that this is not so, is living in a dream world. I should say that written large on the walls of all our societies&#x2014;in capital letters, if hon. members would like it&#x2014;is the fact that we are facing a time of crisis. A time of crisis is not only a time for handing over or a time for capitulation. Who is talking about that&#x003F; [Interjections.] We do not say that. We are saying that a time of crisis, by its very definition, is a time of opportunity. Only this very morning, in today&#x2019;s newspaper, we find a professor at Stellenbosch saying almost exactly the same thing, viz. &#x201C;Must you disown all your academics, must you disown all your scholars&#x003F; South Africa race pledge now urgent.&#x201D; Why in the name of heaven is this urgent if we do not face a crisis&#x003F; That is what I am getting at. He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Implement your declared policy of removing racial discrimination, but do it now because we are running out of time.</block>

<p>We in these benches are saying exactly the same thing. Let us look at what Prof. Moolman has to say. I am not surprised that the hon. member for Vereeniging wants to disown apartheid and I am not surprised that he is sensitive to this, because he realizes the damage this has caused. Prof. Moolman said the following after a recent visit overseas&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wonder whether we realize what damage that word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; has done to us. It has become the symbol of everything bad in human relations.</block>

<p>This is what Prof. Moolman says and by no stretch of imagination can one describe Prof. Moolman as a PRP member. He goes further&#x2014;and the hon. member for Vereeniging will agree with me that the thrust of his own speech was that we were talking about separate development and not apartheid any more&#x2014;to say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have disowned the child you have once bore; now it has been given another name and it is called &#x201C;separate development&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Let us look what he says about that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apartheid as a description of South Africa&#x2019;s policies has to go. Separate development is a better term, but still unacceptable because of the word &#x201C;separate&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is what Prof. Moolman says; it does not come from these benches. He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you think separation through, it leads to isolation. If an individual wants to live out the philosophy of apartheid or separation, <span class="col_4919-4920" refersTo="page_1142"/>he becomes a recluse. If a nation does it, it becomes an isolated, lonely nation. It leads to fragmentation and isolation.</block>

<p>Whether one calls it by any other name, the fact is that the Government&#x2019;s policy has led to isolation. I was glad and grateful to hear the hon. Minister tell us yesterday, and I wish he would tell us a little bit more, of the kind of action of d&#x00E9;tente which is taking place at high governmental level in Africa. When the hon. the Minister does that, he will have the fullest support of the members sitting in the PRP benches. We say that this is absolutely right. But, Sir, we want to suggest to the hon. the Minister, quite seriously, that it is one thing to go into Africa and to talk&#x2014;and we say to him &#x201C;Please go on doing that so that we can break out of our isolation,&#x201D; because we are part of Africa&#x2014;we have been saying that for years&#x2014;but we want to say also that in doing this we must not turn our backs and imagine that the great powers of the West are no longer important, because the very intervention of Russia in Africa means that the whole balance of power has been altered, and we must do everything we can, in particular with the United States of America, to keep our existing links as close as possible and to develop new links and fresh links. We must not imagine that we can now merely go through Africa. I believe that this is absolutely important. Sir, this crisis of which we are talking has been brought about by events to the north and on our borders, but it is inextricably linked with Angola, Mozambique, South West Africa and Rhodesia and it is compounded by the failure of this Government to devise a policy which will meet the aspirations and the hopes of Whites and Blacks in South Africa.</p>

<p>I said a moment ago, Sir, that this was a crisis of time, of opportunity, and we would urge this Government and even plead with this Government not only to speak with Africa, not only to maintain and even forge greater links with the West and with the United States in particular, but to realize that we cannot resolve this crisis on our own. This Government has within its power and within its hands, very largely, the very future and destiny of this country. It has within its power the choice of either moving towards a peaceful resolution of the problems which do face us from outside and from within or to follow a policy which will lead to dreadful confrontation, so we say to the Government: Keep working, even within the bounds of your own policy; and finally, Sir, we say: Let the Government do in South Africa what it is doing in South West Africa. Let it do in this country what it has told Rhodesia to do. Let it realize that we are in partnership, that we cannot resolve anything on our own. Let us come together round a table and work out a peaceful formula which is so desperately needed.</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was a different member for Pinelands who spoke here this morning. The hon. member was a curate and let me say immediately that previously when he spoke here, the expression on his face always made me think that the hon. member was announcing Heaven, but when I listen to his policy now it is clear to me that this will lead directly to political perdition. The hon. member says that this budget hits the taxpayer very hard. The whole theme of the Opposition was that apartheid is too expensive. I want to tell them that if one wants to apply a policy which will lead to peaceful and harmonious race relationships in South Africa, then it is absolutely necessary for one to spend money, particularly when one knows that one&#x2019;s policy is the correct policy. That is why I say that money which one spends in the implementation of the policy of South Africa, the policy of separate development, is the most productive capital investment. If that party&#x2019;s policy has to be implemented, I want to say immediately that the price that we will have to pay will be impossibly expensive; the price will be South Africa itself. The hon. member has always told us in this House that he is in favour of &#x201C;all the people&#x201D;. He wants &#x201C;all the people&#x201D; together, even though this may be in mixed slums where Black and White will simply be delivered into the jaws of a pernicious process of hybridization. He wants to oppose communism, but the breeding ground of communism in a country is precisely those mixed residential areas where there is already an intermingling and interweaving of races. The policy of separate development is a sociological necessity in order to destroy the roots of communism in South Africa in a positive manner. Mr. Speaker, I want to put it very clearly to those hon. members this morning that I have actually entered this debate to reply to the challenge by the hon. member sitting here in <span class="col_4921-4922" refersTo="page_1143"/>front of me, the hon. leader of the PRP, as well as to reply to the hon. member for Maitland.</p>

<p>I want once again to refer to the speech of the hon. member. First of all, however, I should like to say something else in connection with him. He is a protagonist of the so-called melting-pot idea. He wants to see all people, irrespective of race or colour, thrown into one pot. Then he expects me to have faith in him! While he is burning the people, he will probably say what the baboon said when he fell into the pot of boiling soap: &#x201C;Brother, you must continue to believe. You must keep cool.&#x201D; [Interjections.] I cannot go along with that. That is obvious. I am participating in this debate and as someone who came to this House 33 years ago, I want to say emphatically that I am only participating to express my disapproval of and my deep disappointment at the caustic, embittered and spiteful attacks that have been made here upon the recognized and acknowledged policy of South Africa, the policy of separate development. The attacks to which I refer came chiefly from the PRP side. That is the reason why I am participating in this debate. The hon. member for Pinelands spoke about emotionalism. Mr. Speaker, just see how calm I am now when I think of how that hon. member spoke about deep emotionalism.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you know that these attacks by those hon. members during this session have increased in strength and feeling. When I listen to the hon. member&#x2019;s eloquence, to his adroitness, to his high emotionalism and his fierceness, I think involuntarily of people like Mrs. Ballinger, and even of the communist, Sam Kahn, people who were really on their toes when they received the opportunity in this House to attack the policy of South Africa, the policy of apartheid, wildly and intensely. And now, after 33 years, we still have to listen to the same sort of untrue, unfair and wrong premises in respect of the policy of separate development which, in my opinion, is the policy of South Africa. Among all the policies, what is the policy of South Africa&#x003F; It is of course the policy which is accepted by the electorate of South Africa. [Interjections.] This is the only policy accepted by the electorate.</p>

<p>It was not only in 1948, but also in various elections subsequently that we have come back time and again with the same policy, a policy which in spite of all the changes that it has brought about, has been approved with increased majorities time and again by the voters of South Africa. That is why we can rightly say&#x2014;experience has taught us this&#x2014; that this is the accepted policy of South Africa. It is therefore a pity that in this hour of need, when the hon. gentleman talks about a crisis, the Whites in this country cannot even speak with one voice, but that their voices are divided. That is certainly not right. Mr. Speaker, I shall therefore put the policy of separate development here this morning. I can of course not put the policy of that hon. member. The only way in which their policy can be put is to expose it. [Interjections.] That of course, has already been done by other hon. members. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this policy has developed since the time of Jan van Riebeeck, more than three centuries ago, a policy which arose because of the contact between the Whites and the non-Whites in this country. The hon. member for Albany said here yesterday that this policy has developed in this way because many mistakes were made in the past. There was ignorance, selfishness and shortsightedness in the past. I want to bring it home to hon. members that it was short-sightedness which made this problem so involved and&#x2014; hon. members opposite must please remember this&#x2014;this is a historic inheritance. Why are they so condemnatory and why are they so embittered in their attacks against the National Government which came into power in 1948&#x003F; Since that time a completely new era has dawned in the sphere of race relations and race attitudes in South Africa. We are in fact trying to rectify some of the enormous mistakes of the past to some extent. However, what do we find today&#x003F; We have these embittered attacks. I say again that the NP was not the creator of this policy. The hon. member knows that. We were not responsible for this problem becoming all the more involved up to the year 1948. I want to call a witness in support of this statement. I refer you to Dr. Ben Marais&#x2019; book, <i>Colour: Unsolved Problem of the West</i> in which the following passage appears&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our generation did not create the colour problem in South Africa. We inherited that problem. But it is and remains our duty and primary task as church and nation to examine every possible avenue by which <span class="col_4923-4924" refersTo="page_1144"/>this historical situation may be brought nearer to the will of God.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize, therefore, that we were not the creator of this policy. The hon. gentlemen must please not be under the impression that we have made this problem so involved since 1948. I am very pleased that the hon. member agrees with me in regard to this point. I came to this House for the first time in 1943 and I was an eye-witness to the fact that the period of the war years and the few years immediately thereafter was actually the period during which this involved problem became more dangerous, more threatening and more acute.</p>

<p>I want to tell the UP that at that time they were at their height as far as numbers were concerned. Since Alberton, of course, they have reached their lowest ebb. However, as far as the handling of this problem is concerned, they have reached their nadir. Africa was already starting to awake with the Second World War. At the time, however, the then Government slumbered on blissfully, softly and sweetly, and in their drowsy state, to a very large extent avoided the urgent colour problem completely because of their <i>laissez-faire</i> policy, and I shall produce proof in this regard. It was in those times that the various churches in South Africa sent a joint deputation under the leadership of a moderator, to confer here with Genl. Smuts and also Mr. Hofmeyr in regard to the disturbing proportions which the colour problem had assumed. This discussion dealt mainly with racial intermingling and racial conflict, the crux of the involved and ticklish colour problem in South Africa. What was the reply of the spiritual father of liberalism and of that party&#x003F; Mr. Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr was naturally its mouthpiece, and do you know what he said&#x003F; I think I should quote it here because it is very good. He told the deputation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons (die VP) het geen beleid nie. Dit is onmoontlik en onwenslik om &#x2019;n vaste beleid te formuleer. <i>Solvitur ambulando</i>&#x2014;die saak sal hom algaande oplos.</block>

<p>I quote from <i>Die Kerk en die Rassevraagstuk</i> written by the Rev. Brink, page 6. I see that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is looking at me meaningfully because he knows that it was Mr. Hofmeyr himself, the crown prince of the UP in those days, who propounded the liberal policies just as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as his follower, is doing at the moment. This was the reaction of the church to the policy at that time, and what was the reaction of the non-Whites&#x003F; The hon. members on the other side, and particularly also the hon. member who has just spoken, are so fond of quoting what the non-Whites have to say. Let me refresh his memory a little. In the same year, 1945&#x2014;I quote from the Verbatim Reports of the Native Representative Council, 1945, page 130&#x2014;one of the members of the Native Representative Council had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not want to incite my people to action, but it is the Government itself which is inciting our people to violence and all these strikes which you see, are the result of the injustice the people are suffering from as the result of the disabilities imposed on my people. The time is coming when we shall have to preach &#x201C;Africa for the Africans&#x201D;. If we go on like this we shall have to have a Pan-African movement. It will come to this if the White people persist in the attitude which they are adopting now.</block>

<p>That was the reaction of the Black man, and what was the reaction of the world&#x003F; The hon. Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions has already during this session referred to the reaction of the world at UNO when General Smuts was overseas. What was the reaction then&#x003F; They went for General Smuts hammer and tongs. He came face to face with a wall of prejudice and hatred against the colour policy in South Africa. He came back to this country&#x2014;and I was sitting there at the time as a young Parliamentarian&#x2014;deeply disturbed and upset because of his experience at UNO in regard to the reaction to the colour policy in South Africa, and he warned us that we would experience still more difficult times. I say these things not as an accusation against the UP, but simply to show what the reaction was. What was the reaction of the White voters&#x003F; I also experienced that. This was the political miracle of 1948. Yes, it was then that the UP, and in fact probably all of us, witnessed the greatest political avalanche in South Africa. For the UP it was probably a shattering, breathtaking and probably painful experience, but for Koos Potgieter it was a <span class="col_4925-4926" refersTo="page_1145"/>wonderful occurrence. Sir, I want to give the assurance that the voting public in South Africa at the time, and precisely when we tested this policy, unseated the UP mercilessly and for all time put them in the place where they have been sitting now for the past 28 years. As long as they sit there, I had no fault to find with them. However, they must just not go along with the PRP. Sir, that is the way we came into power and now, in the time still left to me, I want to reply to the question that was put challengingly to us in regard to what the policy of the National Party is. I want to link my reply to what the hon. member for Sea Point said here, namely, that the basis of our policy is not sufficiently wide to meet all the changes here in South Africa. I am very pleased that he agrees with me. I do not wish to debate things on which we agree but I want to put our policy here. I want to put it clearly once more.</p>

<p>Must I go more slowly&#x003F; If I have to go as quickly as the UP deteriorated in Alberton, then I shall have to increase my speed! Sir, the policy of separate development was formulated at that difficult stage when the UP was practising its <i>laissez-faire</i> policy which Mr. Hofmeyr spoke about. In those days, towards the end and also after we came into power, the UP did everything to get away from integration and we tried to get away from what they call race domination in this country. That was why we formulated our policy and we came to light with a policy document. That policy document was the bearer of a certain policy system. I want to say to the hon. member for Pinelands that this policy system of the NP takes the realities of the situation fully into account. The hon. member is so fond of talking about the realities of the South African situation. I want to tell him in what sense we take those realities into account. We attach very great value to the community structure in South Africa which consists of separate, singular and different nations. There is a recognition of a multinational and multi-racial character, of a national diversity. It is a question of birds of a feather flocking together. The NP believes &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member has asked me a question. I know it is a great privilege to be able to ask a question but it is a greater privilege to be able to listen to the fine things that I am saying. The NP adopts the view that persons, whether they are White or non-White, experience and reveal a community orientation, an inescapable affiliation to their community, group, nation and race. This is one of the important reasons why this policy of ours is the correct instrument for handling the interests of those people, irrespective of race or colour, in relation to that community orientation and affiliation. That is why leading sociologists today agree with this and say that the policy of separate development is a sociological necessity to ensure right and justice in South Africa irrespective of race and colour.</p>

<p>Our policy system also attaches particular value to self-preservation and the survival of the White nation, but also the survival of the non-White nations. Throughout the history of the NP we have attached great value to these things. I have already listened to the policy statements of successive Prime Ministers such as Dr. Malan, Mr. Strijdom, Dr. Verwoerd and also the present Prime Minister. In all their policy statements they attached great value to the survival of the White race, and also as a condition for the survival and the development of the non-White races who have to some extent been entrusted to our care. I want to make the following point very clear. The policy of the NP takes account of the sacred principle of self-preservation and survival. The hon. member for Pinelands was, after all, also a moderator in his church, is that not so&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, please do not try to start an argument when I am busy with my speech. The policy of separate development is a policy system which takes account of this wonderful principle, a sublime and sacred principle. That is why I think it is quite wrong that we should be attacked. I think now of what was said by Dr. Schweizer, that great doctor who devoted his entire life to the people of Africa. He said: &#x201C;I am life that wants to live in the midst of life that wants to live.&#x201D; That is what he said. I want now to apply those words of his to the policy of separate development, and say: &#x201C;We are a nation which wants to live in the midst of other nations which also want to live.&#x201D; That is why we are a party which attaches a far greater premium than others to the survival of the White race and other races as well, and I know that the UP stands very much closer to us in this respect than to other parties. In other words, we are in favour of the retention of race although we are also in favour of the diversity of race.</p>

<p>Their policy however leads to racial integration and assimilation and eventually to racial domination because there will be no equality. They put people on the slide of one man, one vote, and then with a Bill of Rights they build a sort of protective wall. When the evil day of violence and revolution comes, nothing of that Bill of Rights will however remain. It will be blown away by a black southeaster like little walls of paper. That is why we are in favour of a policy throughout of the retention of national apartheid while their policy is aimed at destruction. It has always been the liberalists in this country who have said that the Afrikaner was the oppressor, the destroyer and the enemy of the Black man. With their liberalist agitation they have always held themselves to be the saviours, the friends and the guardians of the Black man. However, as our policy is expanded, those people will not even have an audience to address at a later stage. That is the way we will take them to pieces.</p>

<p>Some hon. members say that we do not take world opinion into account. This policy of separate development does however take full account of tendencies in Africa and the world in general. I say this for the following reason. I remember that as long ago as 1959 Dr.Verwoerd made a speech in this House. <i>Inter alia,</i> he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So sien die NP die VP se rigting met al sy gevare. Daarom s&#x00EA; ons aan die volk van Suid-Afrika dat jy nie kan regeer sonder om rekening te hou met die strominge in die w&#x00EA;reld en in Afrika nie. Jy moet daarmee rekening hou. Die beleid moet daarmee rekening hou en jy kan daarmee rekening hou &#x2026;</block>

<p>People come along now and accuse us before the world. However, what does the world want&#x003F; I think that the modem world demands the respecting and practising of certain principles. Right and justice must be done to all races and nations irrespective of race and colour. World opinion also wants self-preservation and self-determination in respect of nations. There must be full freedom of development&#x2014;this is another important principle. There must also be fellow feeling and human dignity. There must be inter-nation equality and full stature for nations. There is also a new principle that is being emphasized and that is assistance to underdeveloped nations. If one applies these principles in one&#x2019;s policy, it is obvious that race discrimination and race domination have to disappear. That is why I want to emphasize the fact that it is the system of separate development which is the answer to the challenge of change in our country. There have already been radical changes in our country but those changes have taken place within the policy system of separate development. There have been far-reaching and radical changes in the sociopolitical sphere which have had a good influence on national relationships in our country. Now, however, the hon. leader of the PRP has come along and alleged that that system is too narrow and cannot accommodate changes. The framework of our system however includes the whole basis in principle and course of our policy with all the eventual and immediate sublime objectives. All these things form the framework. That framework is so wide and free that all the necessary changes in respect of separate development can be accommodated in it. This is not at all impossible. I know there are people who say that we have to think again. Of course the NP will think again. After all, we are thinking people. We thought in 1948 while the UP were <span class="col_4929-4930" refersTo="page_1147"/>sleeping. We thought then and designed the basis in principle to take the wind out of the sails of an obnoxious world opinion and communism of the time. We put our policy correctly. Times have changed very swiftly. There have been breathtaking changes but change is the order of the day. I want to say immediately that because change is the order of the day, we have of course to put our house in order. We have an instrument for this. There is nothing wrong with it if Dr. De Klerk asks that a little work be done on the ground-plan. After all, he does not pass a condemnatory judgment of the policy of separate development. However, those hon. members do not mention this fact. We want people to be able to think because if one cannot think, one falls into a bemused state of mind, something from which those hon. members are suffering. One has to approach a matter from various quarters. We have to think searchingly as we did prior to 1948. One has to think searchingly and deeply in order to arrive at weighty decisions. However, there are dangerous signs in the air. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pinelands asked the UP a question to which I should like to reply immediately. He wanted to know whether the UP believed in banning. In respect of the Communist Party our answer is definitely &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. We certainly believe in excluding the Communist Party from the processes of democratic parliamentary politics, for a very simple reason. The Communist Party is the only political party in the world which has given open notice to the democratic world that it is out to destroy Western democracy and that it will do so, if necessary, by violence. Therefore, we believe that the Communist Party has placed itself beyond the pale. We see no reason why we should allow the Communist Party the privilege of using the machinery of democracy in order to destroy that very democracy. Therefore we are in favour of banning the Communist Party from the democratic order.</p>

<p>*Almost every single member on the opposite side of this House said that this was a good budget because Alberton had said it was. The debate in Alberton, however, had very little to do with the Budget. The election issue there centred mainly around two questions. The one was whether we should have become involved in the war in Angola, and the other was whether we should not go to the military assistance of Rhodesia. I do not at present wish to discuss the circumstances in which each of the three parties found itself in respect of these two questions. The result was undoubtedly a strong victory for the NP, and it is no secret that the UP came out of it without any advantage. Consequently no one finds it strange that hon. members opposite are deriving all the pleasure from it that they possibly can.</p>

<p>But the accusation which we are levelling at that side of the House is that they are constantly advancing the argument&#x2014;we have just heard it again from the hon. member for Brits&#x2014;that because the majority of the White voters support them at the polls it proves that their political policy is a fit and proper policy for South Africa. But that argument is completely untenable. The political history of the world is strewn with examples of voters who brought their countries to a disastrous fall because the majority of them slavishly tagged along behind a fatal policy. For years Italy had a fanatical confidence in Mussolini and his Fascism, until they strung him up in public with his head upside down. Caetano, as a disciple of Salazar and his Unionism, united the people of Portugal enthusiastically behind his Government for years until the fatality of his policy forced Portugal to its knees, and Caetano was lucky to escape from the scene with his life. The case of Hitler is so well known that I need hardly refer to it. There was a time when 95% of 18 million people voted for him and his National Socialism &#x2026;</p>

An enthusiastic majority at the polls has never been proof that winner&#x2019;s policy was correct. [Interjections.] This applies in our country far more than in any other. The reason for this being more true for this country than for any other country, is that the parliamentary electorate of South <span class="col_4931-4932" refersTo="page_1148"/>Africa comprises barely 60% of the adult population of the country. I do not want to deny that the majority of the White voters will continue without a break to vote for the policy of political baasskap and apartheid &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I believe in voting, but I am making the point that although a majority at the polls does prove that the voters are on your side it does not necessarily prove that your policy is correct. That is the point. [Interjections.] I admit that in constituencies such as Alberton the majority of the White voters will still continue to vote for and tag along behind apartheid and political baasskap. However, this does not detract from the greater fact that in the eyes of the overwhelming majority of people in South Africa, apartheid is a fatal policy which is going to bring our country to a fall if a speedy end is not put to it. The protection and the preservation of the White man is not inherent in it, as the hon. member for Brits intimated, but it is the greatest danger to the future of the Whites. That is why we oppose it. In any event it remains irrefutably true that whatever electoral system we have in South Africa, no policy of any political party in our country will succeed in the long run if it does not receive the support and the co-operation of the majority of the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>South Africa has great natural riches, and consequently it has been possible for the country to remain materially prosperous even under the worse restrictions of apartheid. Our problem has never been one of prosperity; our country is too rich for that. Prosperity has never been a problem particularly as far as the top layer of the population is concerned. It is peace and security that we are lacking. [Interjections.] If we cannot ensure peace and security for everyone in this country, nothing will remain of our prosperity either. Under this Government this country has become a threatened country, and despite the majorities which hon. members on that side have built up at the polls, majorities which they have so much to say about, we have never before in the history of this country since 1910 been in such an insecure position and so seriously threatened as we are today [Interjections.] These are bare facts.</p>

<p>What is more: That threat has been growing since the day this Government came into power. The threat has been growing around two issues. Firstly, it has been growing around the policy of apartheid and the humiliations implicit in it for the non-Whites, and in the second place, around the question of South West Africa. For a long time the threat was primarily one of long-distance hostility. It was primarily a political threat. We have been attacked in and excluded from the council chambers of the world in general, and in those of Africa in particular. Arms and other boycotts have been instituted against us by some countries. However, what was for a long time primarily a political threat has now turned into a physical and military threat which has advanced right up to our northern borders and has already spilled over the border of South West Africa in the form of a terrorist war. Eighteen months ago there were welcome stirrings in Government circles. These gave many people hope and had a dramatic effect within and outside South Africa. In the Security Council in New York the Government solemnly announced that colour discrimination in South Africa would be done away with. It was pledged that the Government would do &#x201C;everything in its power&#x201D; to put an end to colour discrimination in the country. In the eyes of everyone this meant one thing only, i.e. an end to the politics of baasskap and apartheid, which are synonymous with colour discrimination. The declaration in the Security Council coincided with the assurance that the Government would waste no time in leading South West Africa to freedom and self-determination.</p>

<p>As a result of these promises, which were made 18 months ago, doors were suddenly opened to the hon. the Prime Minister. Various African leaders were prepared to give him a <span class="col_4933-4934" refersTo="page_1149"/>hearing and to accept his <i>bona fides.</i> To South Africans of all parties this was a relief. In New York the leading States of the West were so impressed at the time that they were even prepared to exercise a veto in the Security Council in favour of South Africa on the question of South West Africa. They were prepared to give the Government a chance. But in the meantime 18 months have gone by. This is already the second session of Parliament since the Government made its declaration of intent before the Security Council, but not a word has so far come from the mouth of the hon. the Prime Minister to indicate that he has a programme for the repeal of apartheid laws in this House.</p>

I am not dealing with him in his personal capacity. I am not interested in a man as person, but in his politics and his policy. This is the second session after that pledge, but not a word has come from him yet to indicate that there is a programme for the repeal of apartheid laws. In fact, the propaganda which the Government Party disseminated in Alberton, in the name of the hon. member for Alberton what is more, was miles removed from the Government&#x2019;s declaration before the Security Council in October 1974. The propaganda was reactionary; it was racist, and bore the stamp of the entire negative spirit of apartheid.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, unfortunately my time is very limited. I am always very willing to reply to questions, but my time is almost up now. The problem we are experiencing with the Government party is that in spite of the overwhelming majority which it has in this House, it is never able to look beyond its party and perceive the urgent needs of South Africa. True patriotism does not lie in partyism; it lies in a person putting the interests of South Africa first. What hon. members on that side apparently refuse to realize is that the entire credibility of the Government is at stake, at home as well as abroad.</p>

<p>As a result of the Government&#x2019;s lack of meaningful action in fulfilling its promise to the Security Council, a reaction has now set in. During the past six months a new climate has been building up against us. We saw it in Angola. When the Government still thought it had a friend, it stood alone. The consequences of this are far-reaching for us. The Cubans are now the people who are regarded as heroes in the Black world. In the Security Council we have just been labelled aggressors. Not a single Western power&#x2014;neither England nor France nor America&#x2014;that was prepared last year to exercise a veto in favour of South Africa saw its way clear to opposing this. Our relations with America are at an alarmingly low ebb. How the Government can allow one and the same person to be our ambassador to the USA as well as our ambassador to the UNO under such circumstances I cannot understand. The ambassador in Washington is the person who has to forge friendly relations with America, while the ambassador to the UNO is the person who now has to attack America. This is the kind of diplomacy we have to deal with today. We may be dissatisfied with what happened in the Security Council, we may deplore it&#x2014;and we have reason to do so&#x2014;but for the strategy of the OAU, of the Russians and of the Cubans, it was a diplomatic victory. For us it opens up the danger that we may in future be designated as a threat to peace in Africa. This, in turn, may lead to direct intervention by the Security Council. It is clear that our enemies wish to cut us off from the West, and the West from us. At such a time we are saddled with a Government which allows itself to be outmanoeuvred even by a country like Cuba.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I want to state the facts to demonstrate what we get from that side of the House. The Government does not avail itself of the opportunities which arise. President Tolbert of Liberia said the same thing. President Leopold Senghor, Sir Seretse Khama, President Nyerere of Tanzania, President Machel of Mozambique, are all speaking along the same lines. The position is completely different to what it was eighteen months ago. All the signs are there that a major conspiracy is taking shape in Black Africa, the object of which is an onslaught, step by step, on Rhodesia, South West Africa and on us.</p>

<p>I have already indicated how the Government is falling hopelessly to recruit allies for us and, through allies, to ensure our security. Where would Israel have been today if it had not had at least one powerful ally to support it&#x003F; It would have been wiped off the map. Not only is the Government failing to ensure that we have allies abroad, but through its attachment to its negative policy of apartheid, it is also failing to win allies for the threatened Whites within South Africa. Hon. members on the opposite side are very fond of referring to other people who are causing polarization between Whites and non-Whites. Apartheid &#x2014;or whatever one would like to call it&#x2014;is nothing but a policy of extreme polarization between White and Black. Polarization is the offspring of the Government party. That is why the Government finds itself in a situation of frightening confrontation with the Coloured community today. The Government is doing nothing far-reaching to overcome this. About a month ago I attended a discussion at which important Black and Coloured leaders were present. There was also a prominent member of the National Party present. When a Black leader was asked what his attitude on Angola was, he replied: &#x201C;We are jubilant at the victory of the MPLA. &#x201D; &#x201C;Jubilant&#x201D; is the word he used. The Coloured leader put a counter-question. He said: &#x201C;Ek is lief vir Suid-Afrika, maar as jy my vra of ek vir Suid-Afrika sal veg, vra ek jou &#x2018;Watter Suid-Afrika bedoel jy nou&#x003F; Bedoel jy die Suid-Afrika van aparte vaderlande&#x003F; Bedoel jy die Wit Suid-Afrika waarvan ek nie &#x2019;n lid is nie en waarin ek nie regte van burgerskap het nie&#x003F;&#x2019; &#x201D; He went on to say: &#x201C;Vir so &#x2019;n Suid-Afrika sal ek nie veg nie, maar wel vir &#x2019;n gesamentlike Suid-Afrika. &#x2019; &#x2019;</p>

<p>A report appeared in <i>Rapport</i> on a survey which was made to establish whether our Black people would stand by the Whites in times of danger. The caption to the report was a banner headline, that the Black people &#x201C;&#x2019;n oorverdowende nee s&#x00EA;&#x201D;. The Government never learns any lessons. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has gone to Israel and I hope he will learn there the lesson of how a diversity of people and nations are each able to preserve their own identity in the same country without a single race or colour apartheid law. Preservation of identity does not require legislation. Throughout the world people are preserving their own identity. It is the easiest thing in the world to do if one wants to do it and one does not require apartheid laws in order to do so. It is not a question of doing away with diversity, for there will always be diversity in South Africa, no matter what system we have here. But what will have to be abolished is forced separation on the grounds of colour, which forms the basis of apartheid. In other words, the golden calf of forced and official colour apartheid will have to be abolished. In the words of Dr. Anton Rupert we shall have to accept the principle of inter-dependence in South Africa. If the Government does not want to do this and it believes that partition, the dividing up of South Africa, territorial separation at least between White and Black, is a practical policy, then I ask why it does not do so now. Then, with the emergency with which South Africa is faced, it should make the sacrifices now, and summon the leaders of the various groups to a convention and divide up the <span class="col_4937-4938" refersTo="page_1151"/>country politically in a fair manner and in a manner agreed upon. Why does it not do so&#x003F; If that is what is being contemplated, let us get done with it; let us resolve the issues. I have no objection if such a policy is acceptable to all the people of South Africa. Then it is good. Those who remain in the Republic &#x2026;</p>

<p>The Government plays no part in their convention. I am referring to a convention such as the one in Windhoek in which the Government should play a part and the initiative for which should proceed from the Government. Sit down with the Black leaders. Tell them you want to divide up the country, that you are pursuing a policy of a partition. Then demarcate the boundaries, and get done with it, so that we can become settled in South Africa. Those who remain in the Republic, could then be jointly accommodated. But as the Government is carrying on now, we are heading for disaster. The same applies to the Government&#x2019;s policy in South West Africa. It is not furnishing any guidance. It is standing on the sidelines and washing its hands of the whole affair. On Monday and Tuesday the editor of the German-language newspaper in Windhoek, the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung,</i> that has for years supported the National Party, made a bitter attack on the Government. Its editor is Mr. Kurt Dahlmann, who at the time of the South West Africa case gave evidence for the Government in The Hague. The newspaper described the South West African policy of the Government as lame and purposeless, and demanded that a timetable for independence, which should be no later than 1978, be laid down. It requested the Government to take the initiative immediately and abandon its &#x201C;silent tactics&#x201D; if there is to be any hope of being able to overcome the extraneous pressure and dangers. Until now the German population has been the most loyal ally of the National Party in South West Africa, and once they rise in rebellion and speak of a &#x201C;lame and purposeless&#x201D; Government, hon. members must know how late in the day it is.</p>

<p>Never before has a motion of no confidence in the Government been more justified than the one contained in the amendment submitted to this House by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members of the Opposition parties need not be concerned. I do not intend replying to the debate today. [Interjections.] However, I want to say that I find it very difficult to refrain from participating in the debate when listening to someone like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I should like to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, which he should consider. Does he share the surprising point of view which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout revealed here today on democracy in South Africa&#x003F; Does he agree that when a large majority of the electorate in South Africa express their opinion on a matter, it is an incorrect opinion&#x003F;</p>

</ol>

<p>I propose to address you on (1), (2) and (6) and one of my colleagues will address you on the remainder. The first and second amendments deal specifically with the amounts which are referred to in the proposed new subsection 74(1)(b), and mean if accepted, that the section would only be applicable if the total amount of all his debts due does not exceed R5 000. During the debate on an earlier clause it was suggested that R4 000 was adequate. In the light of existing inflationary circumstances, bearing in mind the fact that the amount of R2 000 had been fixed in 1954, and bearing in mind that the commission had reported in paragraph 162 that the value of R2 000 at the time when the commission&#x2019;s report was signed was said to be R3 715. The figure of R3 715 is the figure as at the end of 1973. The report was signed on 8 April 1974 and the figure based on the CPI as at the end of that year would reduce the result of R3 715. What the hon. members who criticized this and what the hon. the Minister who rejected, fail to take into account of, is that if you take the amount of R3 715 and you apply the inflation rate which has existed since the end of 1973 and the beginning of 1974, when this figure was fixed, and you apply the inflation rate, i.e. the increase of the CPI since then, the truth is that R2 000 in 1964 is today equivalent, in purchasing power, to R4 500. The result is that the amount of R4 000 has already been exceeded. If we are going to have the same standard applying, which is what the commission recommended, then we are in fact stipulating a wrong figure by stipulating R4 000 at the moment.</p>

<p>The second criticism is the fact that it was said that this related solely to household debts. This of course is utterly incorrect, because there is not a single word in the whole of the legislation that this only applies to household debts. It applies to all debts, to debts of any kind. The significant fact which cannot be allowed to go uncommended upon is that it is clear that, bearing in mind what has happened to the value of money since 1954, one needs R4 500 today to buy the same commodities for which you would have only needed R2 000 in 1954. The second point I want to make is in connection with the sixth amendment which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(6) on page 55, in line 22, after &#x201C;order&#x201D; to insert:</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">and any person who knowingly gives credit in an amount exceeding R100 to a person earning less than R250 per month who is subject to an administration order</block>

<p>The reason why we move this amendment is because we belive that the giving of credit to those who cannot afford credit is as reprehensible as in the case of people who are not able to pay their debts, if not more so. We believe that one cannot have a situation where excessive credit is extended to people of whom it is known that they cannot afford to pay, people who are already in financial difficulties and who, for the sake of wanting to do more business, are forced into more trouble and further difficulties by the fact that credit is made attractive to them. A man who gives credit to a person whose estate is already under an administration order, who earns less than R250 a month, who incurs further credit in large amounts and who has extended that credit, a man who gives that credit knowing of the circumstances, is a person who is acting anti-socially, who is getting people into bigger trouble. We believe that the giving of indiscriminate credit is one of the economic problems South Africa faces and we have to do something about it. For that reason we believe that this should, in these circumstances, be made an offence.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to deal with the third amendment which <span class="col_4941-4942" refersTo="page_1153"/>appears in the name of the hon. member for Yeoville on the Order Paper. It relates to the proposed new section 74E, in terms of which an administrator is appointed. The position under this particular provision is that any person can be appointed as an administrator. It is at present usual that the person who is appointed to be an administrator, is a practitioner of the court. Normally, the applications for an administration order are made by practitioners, but this is certainly not a hard and fast rule. I believe it is preferable in dealing with matters of this nature where debts are being collected and distributed, that a practitioner, a person who is bound by the rules of his law society in relation to trust accounts, should in fact be in control of these funds. I see from subsection (3) of proposed section that people who are not practitioners have to obtain security so that they can guarantee the proper handling of the funds which go through their accounts. However, I feel that even with this security provided which would incidentally only add to the costs of administration, the task of being an administrator is in fact the task of a professional person trained in law. The words which are proposed to be inserted are the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 39, in line 48, after &#x201C;administrator&#x201D; to insert&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">who shall be an officer of the court or a practitioner unless there is no such person in the magisterial district in which the order is granted who can or is willing to accept the office.</block>

<p>By inserting these words it does bind the court to appoint a person who is a practitioner where a practitioner is not to be found in that particular area. It provides only that the first choice, where possible, shall be a practitioner or an officer of the court. Therefore, I support that particular amendment.</p>

<p>The other amendments I should like to speak to are the fourth and fifth amendments which appear on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. member for Yeoville. These relate to the proposed section 74M which deals with the furnishing by the administrator of information concerning his administration to creditors and other interested people. Those of us who are practitioners all know of the delays that occur in trying to obtain information from administrators relating to debtors&#x2019; affairs and to payments. The suggestions which we have put to the hon. the Minister we feel will ensure that information will be provided regularly and promptly.</p>

<p>The seventh amendment relates to the proposed section 74T. We ask that the words &#x201C;and in writing&#x201D; be inserted. It would then read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any debtor subject to an administration order who changes his place of residence, business or employment shall forthwith and in writing notify the clerk of the court and the administrator of his new place of residence &#x2026;</block>

<p>One of the main banes of the lives of attorneys, creditors and people dealing with administration orders and the collection of debts, is the question of the debtor who moves far more often than he pays his accounts. We feel that in order to obviate difficulties and in order to make the matter certain a person who is placed under an administration order shall be obliged to notify his change of address in writing. We feel that this will save a lot of costs, because a tremendous amount of money is spent, which the debtor eventually pays himself, in trying to trace, locate and keep track of people who are subject to administration orders. I think therefore that the insertion of these words will create a little more certainty and assist in the administration and the collection of the debts concerned. I think this will at least go some of the way towards saving on the escalating costs of the collecting of debts and therefore I support these amendments.</p>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. A. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer to the amendment moved and motivated by the hon. members for Yeoville and Sandton. As far as the first and second amendments motivated by the hon. member for Yeoville are concerned, I just want to say that I do not agree with the hon. member in connection with the suggestion that the amending Bill contains no reference to household debts. I agree that the words &#x201C;household debts&#x201D; do not appear in the amending Bill. Basically, these are household debts which are affected by an administration order. If we consider the provisions of the proposed section 74C, we shall see which <span class="col_4943-4944" refersTo="page_1154"/>things, <i>inter alia,</i> are excluded by the administration order. For instance, there are mortgages, hire purchases, and so on. R4 000 is already a considerable debt for an individual to incur. The amount has been scientifically determined and I think that the manner in which the hon. member has argued it here, where he says that the amount should be R5 000, is very arbitrary. For those reasons and because of the arguments raised under clause 2 when the consequential amendment was argued by the hon. members for Brakpan and Umhlatuzana, <i>inter alia,</i> I cannot agree that the jurisdiction should be further increased. Indeed I am of the opinion that if the jurisdiction goes too far people may be encouraged to incur debts.</p>

<p>As far as the third amendment, as motivated here by the hon. member for Sandton is concerned, I am of the opinion that this amendment may cause uncertainty. The position was previously as set out by the hon. member for Sandton. An investigation was made and the legal practitioners do not want the particular amendment, as they move it now, because it will only create the problem that the court will often have to find an administrator. How is the court going to determine who wants to accept the position and who does not&#x003F; It could also have the result that a debtor would not necessarily be able to have an administrator of his choice, while the position is that he can actually choose an administrator for himself. For this reason I think that amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville will introduce some uncertainty into the position.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the fourth amendment places an unnecessary burden upon the administrator. As a matter of fact, I do not think that the fourth amendment, as it stands here, makes any sense. If we look at the position it is obvious that, according to the clause, the administrator provides certain information at the request of a creditor or anybody asking for it. The hon. member proposes that the words &#x201C;at intervals of not less than one calendar month&#x201D;, be inserted after &#x201C;shall&#x201D;, but the information is asked for in any event and it does not necessarily follow that information will be asked for by creditors during every calendar month. The position is quite clear if we take into consideration the duties which are assigned to an administrator. In terms of the provisions of clause 74J(8) the administrator is compelled to inform creditors forthwith when the debtor is in arrears. In terms of clause 74J(9) the creditors would then instruct the administrator as to what he should do. In terms of the provisions of clause 74J( 10) the administrator could apply to the court for the rescission of the administration order and, furthermore, the administrator has to divide the funds between the creditors every three months. After all, this is a way of reporting creditors and interested parties are therefore kept informed in a proper manner. I think that it will only place an unnecessary burden upon the administrator should the amendment be accepted.</p>

<p>As far as amendment (5) is concerned, I say that it would be an unnecessary and inconvenient limitation. Due to technicalities, such a limitation can only lead to applications being made against the administrator on grounds of alleged neglect of duty. As it is, severe obligations are now being placed upon administrators, and the proposed amendment will only make it difficult to find people who will be prepared to serve as administrators. As the article reads at present, it eliminates unnecessary correspondence and awkward inquiries and attendances.</p>

<p>As far as amendment No. 6 is concerned, as motivated by the hon. member for Yeoville, I want to say with due respect that I believe that an amendment of this nature is out of place in this legislation. This has already been referred to during the Second Reading debate. The aspect raised in this respect by the hon. member is actually a matter for the Department of Trade, and I do not believe that they will be happy about a provision of this kind. Indeed, the figures the hon. member mentioned here, i.e. R250 and R100, have not been motivated by him. I think that this can only lead to unnecessary disputes and confusion if the amendment is accepted. Certain circumstances may arise where such a person may indeed have to incur such debt, and if this amendment is accepted, a creditor would be guilty of an offence if he allows a person to incur debts. Sir, the clause deals with a person who is under administration and who incurs debts, and now the hon. member wants to penalize the creditors as well. The clause specifically deals with the position of a person under administration, and the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment now wants to introduce a provision against the creditors.</p>

<p><span class="col_4945-4946" refersTo="page_1155"/>As far as the last amendment, No. 7, is concerned, I believe that it is absolutely unnecessary that such a burden and onus, as is suggested here, be placed upon a debtor. I think it is far too technical, and can only lead to discord between the debtor and the administrator. Here it is in the interests of the debtor always to inform the administrator of a change of address. In any event one will not be able to pin down an irresponsible debtor with this particular amendment. For this reason I can, unfortunately, not agree with this amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the official Opposition also opposes the amendments proposed by the hon. member for Yeoville. With regard to amendments (1) and (2), I would remind the Committee that this matter was debated when a similar amendment was moved to clause 2 of the Bill. We made our position very clear then. I will concede that it is possible that since the commission sat there has been a further depreciation in the value of the rand; in fact I do not think there is very much doubt about it but, as the previous speaker has said, the figure suggested is in a sense an arbitrary figure. I think the objective of the figure, which stood for many years at R2 000, which is now to be increased to R4 000, was really to limit it to encompass normal household and personal debts. If the debt goes beyond that and encompasses business debts, then obviously the Insolvency Act is there to deal with the matter. On those grounds, Sir, we will not support amendments (1) and (2).</p>

<p>With regard to amendment No. (3), the hon. member for Yeoville must be aware that in 1962 the Act was actually amended to enable a person other than an officer of the court or a practitioner to be appointed as administrator. I think it is wellknown&#x2014;and the commission also makes this point&#x2014;that officers of the court are far too busy and occupied to deal with matters of this nature. Practitioners have found it irksome, time-consuming and unrewarding to undertake the administration of these estates and although there is a covering provision that a person other than an officer of the court may be appointed as administrator, it is nevertheless a burden for the court to seek a practitioner who is prepared to act as administrator.</p>

<p>It is not always a practitioner who presents the case for the debtor to the court for an administration order. In terms of the Act the debtor has the right to come to court himself, and debtors very often do come to court themselves to present their case with the assistance of the clerk of the court, and the court then has to make provision for the appointment of an administrator. The suggestion that the value of a practitioner lies in the fact that the public is protected by the fidelity fund is, of course, fully met by the Bill which makes provision not only for security but even goes further and provides for persons appointed as administrators to provide an overall form of security which will cover their appointment in all cases, thus avoiding the cumbersome necessity of providing security on each occasion when they are appointed as administrator. For that reason, Sir, we see no reason at all to change the existing provisions as enacted in 1962, when it was considered, in the light of past experience, that it was necessary to increase the classes of persons who could be appointed as administrator. I think adequate provision is made in the Act to cover the whole situation and I do not think that the amendment is of any value at all.</p>

<p>With regard to amendment No. (4) I think the acceptance of this amendment will only entail additional expense. There is provision that any creditor who wants information from the administrator can get it immediately. There is no difficulty at all. The Act fully provides for the provision of any information that is sought. To oblige an administrator to give an account every calendar month would only make his work more difficult and obviously more expensive, and I see no necessity for this amendment at all. With regard to amendment No. (5), we have no objection to it. It is a question of the period of time. This is quite an acceptable practice and we have no objection to this amendment at all. With regard to amendment No. (6), I am reminded of what the hon. the Minister said in dealing with some other aspect of this Bill. He said that the purpose of this Bill was not to deal with all the evils brought about by debt and that he was in fact considering the question of appointing a committee of inquiry to go into this whole question which is assuming serious proportions.</p>

<p>According to a recent statistical report the figures have now reached something in the <span class="col_4947-4948" refersTo="page_1156"/>vicinity of R80 million per year. That is the amount of debt incurred by people who are unable to meet their liabilities. The report states that during the period 1973 to 1975 the number of judgments rose by 8%, to reach the number of 272 986. The overall amount involved increased by a staggering 43%, to set a new record of almost R80 million. Obviously, these are people who have to be cured, but I do not know whether they will be cured through legislation. Therefore we are not prepared to support this particular amendment which deals with figures which are arbitrary and of no consequence.</p>

<p>We also do not support amendment (7). We have given our reasons previously. We believe that it is an encumbrance on a debtor to have to give information in writing, and we do not support the amendment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not prepared to accept a single one of these amendments. The arguments against them were very well stated by the hon. member for Klerksdorp and by the hon. member for Jeppe. I concede to the hon. member for Yeoville that his argument in connection with the money is correct, but I nevertheless want to bring it to his attention that one actually wants to limit this kind of procedure to cases of small debt. I believe that he will agree with me that we do not want to involve large amounts of debt in this. The reason for this is that the debt concerned must be redeemed by means of small amounts. This will become absolutely impossible when it comes to amounts of R6 000 and R7 000. Such amounts cannot be paid off at R10 per month. However, we leave the matter at that for the time being. Should it subsequently appear necessary for the amount to be increased we could do so by means of an amendment. Therefore I do not want to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment now.</p>

<p>As far as the third amendment is concerned, it means, in my opinion, that every magistrate would have to approach all lawyers beforehand in order to determine whether they are available to act as administrators. He will most probably have to certify that no one wants to accept the position before he appoints someone else&#x2014;someone who is not a lawyer. In a place such as Johannesburg this could involve an enormous amount of work. Therefore it is impractical. With reference to the fourth amendment I want to say that the creditor pays for the service. I therefore cannot see why he should not be able to receive the money at shorter intervals. If the money is required at shorter intervals and the debtor is prepared to pay it over shorter periods, it should not involve too much extra work. Therefore I am not prepared to accept that amendment either.</p>

<p>In his fifth amendment the hon. member for Yeoville suggests that the phrase &#x201C;within ten days&#x201D; be inserted. However, this does not contain any sanction to take steps. Failure by an administrator to furnish information which is requested is indeed an offence, but in any event there is no sanction to take steps should the &#x201C;within ten days&#x201D; be ignored. For this reason the proposed amendment is meaningless. With respect to the sixth amendment, I concede that a great deal of small debt is incurred. As it is worded here, the amendment in itself is a good one. However, the hon. member will appreciate that the practical implementation of this amendment would mean that every dealer would actually have to initiate a full inquiry into the creditworthiness of every aspirant client. The risk is therefore a matter for the dealer. He is the one who commits an offence if he transacts business which is contrary to the provisions of this argument, should it be included in the legislation. Sir, I think we are really going to place a very great burden upon trade by doing this, and I do not think it is practical at this stage. I have indicated that we shall consider this again, or refer the matter to my colleague, the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs, for his consideration, but I do not think it belongs in this Act. I have already dealt with the question of written notification. The most important argument is that many of these small debtors are persons who cannot even write and I think it actually places a burden upon them which we would not like to place upon them, and as a result of this I cannot accept any of the amendments.</p>

<p>I very briefly wish to motivate this amendment. The new section 106B creates an offence, if an employer who is requested to furnish a written statement fails to do so. The question of whether or not the request has been made will then be a credibility issue as between the employee and the employer.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the legislation which has now passed through the Committee Stage does, I think, without doubt improve the situation of debt collecting, and as far as that goes we in these benches welcome the legislation. However, there are two points that we regard as significant, and I have to mention them. In the first instance this legislation does, in a form which is unacceptable to us, introduce the concept of civil imprisonment with far greater ramifications than ever before. Our objection is that the non-payment of a debt entitles the judgment creditor, without a financial inquiry, to issue a document in terms of which the debtor is called upon to show cause why he should not be committed for contempt. In our view, to extend the ambit of civil imprisonment without a prior inquiry is something which is unacceptable. We believe that civil imprisonment as such is foreign to our principles and that we should not go back to the 17th and 18th centuries in Great Britain. We are living in a far more enlightened age, and I believe that our prisons should be kept for far more important things than the matters referred to in this legislation. We object to the concept of civil imprisonment being extended.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is that we believe that the giving of credit can be as wrong as the taking of credit. We have tried to move amendments in order to ensure that credit cannot be extended irresponsibly. We believe it is anti-social to extend credit to people who cannot afford to pay, and we believe that steps have to be taken to remove this anti-social phenomenon from our life and times. Since the amendments to this piece of legislation have not been accepted, one can only hope that there will be legislation introduced to root out this evil in our economy. Unfortunately, very often this is not merely an issue between a debtor and a creditor. Often these issues have social consequences for the community, and therefore we believe that urgent action is required to restrain the indiscriminate granting of credit to people who cannot afford to pay. Despite these two objections I have raised, we do believe that the Bill effects certain improvements that are necessary to the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act, and therefore we shall not oppose the Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that in accordance with the attitude adopted in the Second Reading we support the Third Reading of the Bill. We are all aware of the fact that civil imprisonment has not been a comfortable social experience. Even in Great Britain, however, where there have been some very disturbing indications of what civil imprisonment means, legislators have unfortunately not been able to root it out of their system yet. Contempt of court, it would seem, still remains a vital element in this issue. There must be some form of regulation of society so that people do not take advantage of others. In the social and economic system we have <span class="col_4951-4952" refersTo="page_1158"/>developed, people who incur liabilities and who enjoy the fruits of extended credit have to meet their obligations in some way or another. Unfortunately the make-up of some people in our society is such that they often do not meet their obligations. The only remedy&#x2014;and this applies in all commercial law&#x2014;is recourse to the courts. If a person, against whom judgment is given, does not comply with the judgment of the court he is obviously guilty of contempt of court, and there must consequently be some form of penalty. It is an unfortunate state of affairs and we hope that with other forms of social advancement we may be able to reduce this to the absolute minimum. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister himself is very concerned about the rapid escalation of civil judgments and the soaring increase in unpaid debt, but as he has rightly stated earlier, trade practice, which will now become an important feature of our commercial law, will have to play its part. Possibly in the normal course of social development other forms of inquiry will enable us to limit this evil to the absolute minimum as far as possible. We cannot, however, see any reason for not supporting the Third Reading because we feel that the amendments made will be an important contribution towards improving the unpleasant aspects of civil imprisonment to which I have already referred during my Second Reading address. We believe this will contribute towards reducing the negative aspects to a minimum, thus at least preserving to some extent the dignity, not only of the debtor but also of society in general.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in regard to the first point touched upon by the hon. member for Yeoville, we have already thrashed out the matter very thoroughly during the Second Reading debate. However, I still want to point out that apprehension does not take place without that investigation. The process is being reversed slightly, but apprehension does not take place without a proper investigation in fact having taken place. The hon. member would do well to refer to the position in the Bill again, because he will find that this is the actual state of affairs. As far as the second point is concerned, I readily concede that his argument is well-founded. It is a great evil that so much minor credit should be granted to people. However, my standpoint is and has been&#x2019;that this is not something which can be rectified by means of this Bill. In fact, I want to go as far as to say that I am not convinced that this falls under my department administratively. I am of the opinion that this should most probably fall under the Department of Commerce. I undertook to refer it to them, and therefore, I shall bring it to their attention.</p>

<p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my gratitude and appreciation to all the hon. members of the House for their contributions. The discussion of this Bill was to my mind an example of Parliament at its best, because everyone contributed positively to facilitate placing the best on the Statute Book. Even the series of amendments which I did not accept, at least stimulated our thoughts and brought possibilities to light to which very serious consideration were given. As the Bill in its present form will, to my mind, limit the legal costs. It will restrict both the judgment debtor and the judgment creditor, and this is what we had in mind with the Bill. I want to convey my sincere thanks to all hon. members.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This measure is being introduced with a view to the granting of independence to the Transkei. The opportunity is being created, at the request of the Transkei Government, for appeals from the Transkei Supreme Court to be heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa, until such time as the Transkei is able to establish its own court of appeal. For the present, the Transkei will be saved a great deal of expense, while no additional work will accrue to the Appellate Division of the Republic. An existing service will merely be continued.</p>

<p>Clause 2 of the Bill provides for the commencement of the legislation on a future <span class="col_4953-4954" refersTo="page_1159"/>date, that is to say, whenever it may become necessary after the Transkei has gained its independence. From the nature of the case, no obligation is being imposed on the Transkei to make use of the service. Our Appellate Division is merely being given a power which the Transkei will be able to make use of when it has become independent, if it so desires.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we supoport this measure. This is nothing new in so far as our Appellate Division is concerned because it has already dealt with appeals from other countries, <i>inter alia</i> from the protectorates and also from Rhodesia. At that time, of course, we formed part of the Commonwealth under a common sovereign head&#x2014;the king or the queen. However, when that connection ceased, those countries changed their laws on appeals and thereafter no longer made use of our Appellate Division. In this case we shall have foreign independent State making use of our Appellate Division and I do not know whether there is any precedent for such a procedure in other countries. However, if the Transkei wants it that way, we certainly shall be pleased to let them have it that way. Since they will lack experience in this type of thing for some years to come, it is only right that we should give them this facility if they require it. We therefore support the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think this is the occasion to debate the merits or demerits of independence for the Transkei and I certainly do not propose to do so. If the Bill provides what the hon. the Minister has said it does, namely for appeals from the Transkei Supreme Court to our Appellate Division, then quite obviously we shall not oppose it. It is clear that the Transkei itself will have to decide whether or not this facility should be used. As the hon. member for Griqualand East has pointed out, this is not unique in so far as South Africa is concerned. South Africa&#x2019;s Appellate Division acted as a court of appeal for Rhodesia and it also acted as a court of appeal for the then High Commissioner Territories. South Africa itself had such a facility at one stage in that at one stage there were appeals from our courts to the Privy Council in Great Britain. Even on the assumption that the Transkei does become independent&#x2014;which appears to be a certainty at the moment&#x2014;we welcome the links which would be maintained thereafter because in so far as we are concerned, we believe and hope that there will eventually be a link between South Africa and an independent Transkei. Many of us believe that this may well take the form of a federation and many of us believe that our own Appellate Division may well in the future become the federal appeal court of a federation of southern Africa. In that spirit we welcome the fact that our Appellate Division&#x2014;a court which is held in great esteem not only in South Africa, but also in many parts of the world&#x2014;will have this further status added to it. Therefore we support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. members for their support of the Bill. I want to point out that the Transkei was governed by our legislation for many years. Our courts were responsible for the administration of justice in that territory. I make bold to say that the nature of Roman Dutch enables it to be adapted to any circumstances which may arise in southern Africa. Consequently I want to express the hope that when the Transkei becomes independent, they will very seriously consider retaining links with South Africa as far as substantive law itself as well as the courts are concerned. By means of our Appellate Division we may be able, for a many years to come, to render a special service to them which they may feel they need. Under those circumstances I want to express the hope that the Transkei will very seriously consider retaining the link with South Africa as far as its administration of justice is concerned.</p>

<heading>MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN AFRICA BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the past few days I have had an opportunity of <span class="col_4955-4956" refersTo="page_1160"/>studying the speech the hon. the Minister made in introducing the Second Reading of the Medical University of Southern Africa Bill. To me this speech is one of the most serious indictments of the Government&#x2019;s ineptitude, its neglect and its failure to plan, not only for the future, but even for the present. The figures quoted by the hon. the Minister reveal a state of affairs in relation to the number of Black medical practitioners and the absence of Black dentists and veterinarians which makes very sad reading. The present position is a blot on the Government&#x2019;s performance in the past 28 years. For the past 18 years I and other people in this hon. House have asked the Government to do something to alleviate the obvious shortages in medical personnel that we have been experiencing in the Republic. Very little, if anything, was done. Our pleas fell on deaf ears. Indeed, some of our universities, which are supposed to enjoy autonomy, were even prevented from enrolling Black students in their medical faculties. We objected to this and again our objections were overruled. Wits University and Cape Town University were allowed, only on sufferance, only on a permit system, to have Black students in their medical schools. This hon. Minister has a great deal of courage to admit that there is only one Black doctor for every 45 000 Bantu. This knowledge is overseas as well. While I defended this country when these figures were thrown at me overseas, here in this House I want to condemn the Government for not doing anything about it. I wonder what would have been happening to the medical services of this country, both to the Black and the White population, if it were not for the efforts of our White doctors who served in the past and still serve all sections of our population. These doctors have put our Republic in the forefront of medicine in the world. They have given a performance that is second to none. The failure of the Government to provide sufficient doctors of colour, however, is most depressing. The serious shortages of Black medical personnel cannot be allowed to pass without condemning those who are responsible, i.e. the Government.</p>

<p>Now, at this late hour, when things are really going against us, the hon. the Minister becomes activated and suggests in this Bill that a new institution be established in the vicinity of Ga-Rankuwa, with teaching facilities for the training of medical and dental practitioners and also veterinarians. We on this side of the House have no objection whatsoever against new universities being brought into being in our country. We have got no objection whatsoever against this university to come into being, and if this was being done for the sole purpose of increasing the numbers of Black doctors in our country, I would be very very pleased indeed. At least we could then say that the numbers of Black doctors are going to increase from year to year. But what in reality is happening&#x003F; The Cabinet of ours, while opening the doors for a new university, closes the doors of an existing establishment. What has the Cabinet agreed to do&#x003F; They have given notice to the Natal University to phase out its intake of Black students. What worse action could the Government take at a time when it seeks to increase the numbers of Black practitioners in our country&#x003F; And what is more, this notice was given to the Natal University without prior consultation with that university. It was done without the knowledge of the people who are running the university, in particular those people who have an interest in and are running the medical school. I think that this is a shocking action on the part of the Government. And this action of the Government is being aggravated by not having the hospital at Ga-Rankuwa established as a teaching hospital as yet. It is going to take a minimum of seven years from the start of that hospital to produce the first doctor plus another year for his internship. Before that period has expired we cannot expect one single doctor to come from Ga-Rankuwa.</p>

<p>Therefore the medical school of the University of Natal must be allowed to continue its work. This is a most valuable medical institution. It has a dedicated staff. Valuable research work has been done and is still being done at that university while the graduates and the teachers have made a most significant contribution to the health of this country. It has also done its fair share in providing paramedical services and its fair share in seeing that nurses have been properly trained. Now this living being is going to be broken down. Why&#x003F; Why must the hon. the Minister close this medical school even though he is opening another one&#x003F; The writing on the wall is quite clear. He has already given notice that there will soon be a medical school for Indians and a medical school for Coloureds. Who then is going to go to the medical school that is <span class="col_4957-4958" refersTo="page_1161"/>established in Natal&#x003F; What is the reason for closing this school&#x003F; The only reason that I can think of that this Minister can give is that he does not want an institution for Blacks to be in a White area, and if I am right in saying that, then I condemn him for his action. This Government is obsessed with the idea of moving institutions for people of colour out of White areas, particularly in the case of this particular hospital which, situated where it is, serves the homeland area with the biggest population.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>This hospital has turned out 556 doctors, if the Minister&#x2019;s figures are correct. Does he anticipate that in the first 10 or 12 years the new hospital at Ga-Rankuwa is going to be able to turn out so many doctors&#x003F; I challenge him to tell me what his intake and final figures will be after 10 years, bearing in mind that during the whole of that period nothing will be happening to increase the numbers going to Natal. Sir, I do not know what the outside world is going to think when they hear of this sort of &#x201C;happening&#x201D; in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a Cabinet decision. The time is not too late to reverse the decision, and I ask the Minister to go back to the Cabinet and to say to the Cabinet, &#x201C;Let us keep this hospital viable; let us continue to take in Blacks, if they wish to go there; let us continue to take in Coloureds, if they wish to go there, and let us continue to take in Indians, if they wish to go there&#x201D;, and I say to you, Sir, that if White people want to go there, they should be allowed to do so as well. That should be our attitude. Let us leave the choice to the individual and to the autonomy of the university. They are the people who should decide. I want to appeal to the Minister and to the Cabinet to allow those universities that wish to admit Black students who want to study medicine or dentistry, to do so. Let us do away with this permit system. In this day and age it should not be necessary for the Minister even to think along those lines. These universities have been willing in the past to admit Black students; they have been doing so in the past but now they are no longer allowed to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on these benches and I have no objection at all to the establishment of a new university, but what I do not like is the way in which this is being done. This institution is going to be established in the vicinity of Ga-Rankuwa. It is going to serve Blacks in a particular area of Trust land, but it will cater for Blacks of other ethnic groups. Well and good. Can the Minister tell me with which ethnic groups he has consulted in this regard and with what result&#x003F; I would like to know who decided to establish a medical school, a dental school and a veterinary school at Ga-Rankuwa. I would like to know if the other ethnic groups agreed to the erection of this school at that particular spot. The Minister did not mention a word about consultation in his Second Reading speech.</p>

<p>I want to go further. Did the Minister discuss the naming of the university with the head of any other university in the Republic, especially the heads of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria Universities, which will have an interest in this university; if so, did they agree to this name&#x003F; Sir, I think that this name is a total misnomer. Firstly, one does not have a medical university; one has a university with a medical faculty.</p>

<p>I am not being facetious. I am very serious about this. This hospital is going to be built with South African money. It will have South Africans on its staff and South <span class="col_4959-4960" refersTo="page_1162"/>Africans will look after it except, of course, when they are interfered with by the Minister, but I will come back to that later.

I take it that this university is going to issue degrees and that the standards required for these degrees will be evaluated by the South African Medical and Dental Council. I wonder, Sir, whether this body has been consulted in these matters, or whether it is the intention of the Minister to consult with the Medical Council.

I wonder how my colleagues on the other side feel about this.

<p>He must allow it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Is he going to allow this to happen&#x003F; As far as I know, Onderstepoort has catered in the past for White students only. Is the Minister now going to open the doors of Onderstepoort to Black students, or is it the intention that this university that is going to arise at Ga-Rankuwa will have its own Onderstepoort&#x003F; I wonder what Pretoria University said about this. Did the Minister have consultations with Pretoria University in this regard&#x003F; Because if he is going to allow Black students to go to Onderstepoort, then he cannot refuse to allow White students to go to any other university.</p>

<p>On the council, which is going to be established at this university, we find that there are going to be representatives sitting on this council from the University of Witwatersrand and from the University of Pretoria. I want to ask the hon. the Minister again how the authorities at Wits and at Pretona feel about it. How did they feel about sending representatives to this council&#x003F; Will the hon. the Minister tell us how they felt about it and whether they were willing to do so. It is quite a simple question. The same question, of course, applies to Fort Hare, the University of Zululand and the University of the North. What are the feelings of those people about being represented on the council&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister spoke at length and he never once referred to any consultation with any other body or with any other council or with any other university. Not once, throughout his speech. I feel that it was most essential for the Natal University to be consulted in regard to the establishment of this new university, because their future fate depends on the establishment of this new university. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister took the trouble to discuss these matters with the University of Natal. Or were they treated in the same way in which they were treated when they were ordered to phase out&#x003F; I wonder. He closes down, as I said, a university close to the largest ethnic group, the Zulus. He neglects to tell us that he considers converting the largest hospital in Africa for Blacks into a teaching hospital for dentists and doctors. Even though the Baragwanath Hospital is situated on the very periphery of the largest and the most densely populated Black township in South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member for Rosettenville with considerable surprise. He maintained that the ratio of Black physicians to possible patients&#x2014;the ratio is 1:45 000&#x2014;was a blot on the name of South Africa. According to him the reason for this is insufficient planning by the Nationalist Government. I was truly very surprised to hear these words from the mouth of the hon. member for Rosettenville. Arising from all the reproaches which he heaps up on this Government, I want to ask him how many Black people matriculated in 1948, after many years of UP rule. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I should like to know how many Black people sat for their matriculation examination at the end of the United Party rule. The backlog which arose concerning Bantu education and provision of suitable matriculants was a product of the rule of the UP. [Interjections.] In 1958 there were 157 Black people who obtained matriculation exemption. This was just after we had taken over from the UP.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>In 1960 there were 182, in 1965, 827, in 1970, 1 856 and in 1975, 3 520. These are the latest available figures, as against just over 100 during the rule of the UP.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall tell you why there is a shortage of Black physicians. There are two reasons for this. In the first instance the UP failed to plan ahead during its years in power. They failed to produce a sufficient number of suitable matriculants for medical training and they failed to create training facilities for Black medical students in South Africa. [Interjections.] The contribution made by Bantu education to the provision of a sufficient number of suitable matriculants under National rule is absolutely phenomenal. [Interjections.] The allegation has been made that we have too small a number of Black physicians.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville thanked the White physicians and the physicians of other colours for what they are doing for the Black people in this country concerning medical services. I want to subscribe to this. I also want to avail myself of the opportunity today to express my sincere thanks to the White physicians for the good service which they are rendering to the Black people in South Africa. I want to thank the Indian and the Coloured physicians, too, for the services which they render to the Black people of South Africa. Now I want to take the hon. member up on this point of the lack of planning, which is alleged to be the reason why there is a shortage of Black physicians in South Africa. Sir, when the University of the Witwatersrand could admit medical students freely to that faculty, how many were there then&#x003F; [Interjections.] No, you must answer me. You accused us of a lack of planning and in fact you accused us of discrimination, but when these universities of Cape Town and the Witwatersrand were open, how many Black people then qualified there&#x003F; How many were enrolled&#x003F;</p>

I <span class="col_4963-4964" refersTo="page_1164"/>now want to call him as a witness, and a good witness, because he is the chief spokesman on education in that party. I want to tell him I agree with him wholeheartedly that there were no matriculants, because the United Party was in power at that time. I really want to express my sincere thanks to the hon. member for Durban Central. I regard him as a very good witness. I also accept what that hon. member said, because he certainly is much better informed on the United Party&#x2019;s policy and their problems, being a member of the United Party himself. From the nature of the case he must know more about them. For that reason I want to thank the hon. member very sincerely for the admission that there were no matriculants because they did not make provision for training matriculants at the time. [Interjections.] However that may be, I want to advise the hon. member to talk to the hon. member for Rosettenville about this, and to convey the accusation to him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville raised a hue and cry here about the name of the university and he objected strenuously to the concept of &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D;. But the hon. member knows, after all, that we also want to accommodate the Black people of South West Africa at this university, and South West Africa is not South Africa; it is part of southern Africa. What is more, Sir, the possibility is not excluded that we may admit students from other Black African States to this university as well. Is the expression &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; not a fine one&#x003F; To me it embodies the idea of an invitation to Africa. The invitation is that we shall help them if we have the necessary facilities, etc., available to us. Sir, to my mind a very serious thing was said here today. I now want to ask the hon. member for Rosettenville: If it were true that there are not sufficient Black people who qualify for medical training, would the hon. member want the standards for admission to this training to be lowered&#x003F; Sir, this is a very serious question which I am putting to the hon. member for Rosettenville and I do not expect the hon. member to reply to give a full reply to it immediately. But he may simply say &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;No&#x201D;. Does he want the standards for admission to this medical training to be lowered&#x003F; Sir, I think the hon. member should rather go and study my Hansard in his own time and then he can give me an answer. [Interjections.] Furthermore, the hon. member for Rosettenville made a fuss here about the standards which would be maintained at that university and about the consultations which should take place with the S.A. Medical Council and with the other universities concerned. I got the impression more and more, as the hon. member proceeded with his speech, that although the hon. member had been physically present here when the hon. the Minister made his Second Reading speech, his thoughts had actually been outside this House. The hon. member seems to have heard what the Minister said, but he did not understand it. I now want to refer the hon. member to the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister. I do not want to be sharp in my comments concerning the hon. member, because he is no longer a young man and I respect older people. However, I want to point out to the hon. member that to my mind he said a serious thing in regard to these matters. I want to quote what the hon. the Minister said, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But thirdly, it is essential to ensure that such a new institution &#x2026;</block>

<p>The reference here is to this new university&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; will from the outset maintain recognized standards in the training and evaluation of its students. The new university will consequently be specially situated so that it is within reach of two established universities, each with a medical and dental faculty, but of greater importance, with the only faculty of veterinary science with its own research institute not far away.</block>

<p>And further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a privilege for me to state that the universities of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria have consented to the deans of the corresponding faculties serving on the advisory pilot committee which I have specially appointed to help plan the new university.</block>

<p>Sir, the hon. member is not listening to me. He made accusations here. Now I want to quote further from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech&#x2014;</p>

<p>Then the hon. member should listen to what the Minister says. After all, the hon. member said that there had been no consultation and that the Minister had ignored them. The hon. member asked what consultation there had been and whether the Minister had done this in secret. Now the Minister has a special word of thanks to the controlling bodies of the two universities, the vice principals and five deans of the two universities, and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and in particular to Prof. Dr. H. W. Snyman, who owing to the good co-operation of the university of Pretoria is acting as chairman of the interim pilot committee and also my chief advisor for the envisaged training.</block>

<p>Sir, what more the Minister should have done I do not know. Only the hon. member for Rosettenville will know. But he definitely was not serious in making that allegation of his, because Prof. Snyman is also the chairman of the Medical Council, is he not&#x003F;</p>

<p>Do you now want to tell me Professor Snyman is two people; the one being Professor Snyman who is head of the medical faculty, and the other being the same Professor Snyman who is chairman of the Medical Council, and that the one Snyman does not know what the other Snyman is doing&#x003F; For the information of the hon. member I just want to say that these two are the same Snyman; there is only one Snyman. When he advises the Minister, he will have the interests of the Medical Council as well as those of the existing universities at heart. I want to say to the hon. member that I honestly think he owes the hon. the Minister an apology for having alleged that the hon. the Minister did not consult the institutions concerned.</p>

<p>The Medical University of Southern Africa Bill is of historical importance to us in this country. It is historical in the sense that a medical school exclusively for Black people is now for the first time being established in our country. This is the first and the only institution in South Africa which makes provision only for Black people. What is more: Apart from the training of physicians,provision is also being made here for the first time for Black people only to be trained as veterinary surgeons and dentists. The medical university will also be the first medical university which is situated in a Bantu territory.</p>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>As already indicated by the hon. the Minister in his introductory speech, a great need undoubtedly exists for the training of more Black physicians in South Africa. As I said a short while ago, the ratio between doctor and possible patients is one to 45 000, while the ideal ratio is in the order of one to 1 000. Here are two important aspects. The first is that if one considers the increase in the numbers of the Black people, an increase of approximately 400 000 a year, it goes without saying that there is not only a tremendous backlog, but a greater backlog is building up. This means that only to be able to keep pace with the population increase, 400 Black doctors are needed annually, but at the moment the existing medical school at Wentworth produces only 15 Bantu doctors a year on an average. Therefore, the factual situation is that the number of Bantu doctors being produced at present is completely insufficient for the existing need, let alone future needs. A very important point in this respect&#x2014;the hon. member for Rosettenville would do well to listen to this&#x2014;is that several of the Bantu Governments have already addressed representations to the Government for the provision of medical universities and medical training of their own. In addition, several homeland Governments have lodged quite a number of complaints against the existing medical school, but I do not want to go into that now. Therefore, it can rightly be said that the new medical university is being established, <i>inter alia,</i> in order to comply with direct requests from the homeland Governments.</p>

</speech>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Just as in the case of physicians, a great need exists for <span class="col_4967-4968" refersTo="page_1166"/>dentists as well. As far as we know, as the hon. the Minister has already indicated, there is only one Bantu dentist in South Africa. If we accept the ratio of one dentist for 5 000 possible patients as being adequate to meet the need, a shortage of 3 000 Black dentists exist in South Africa at present. There are no qualified Bantu veterinary surgeons in South Africa at the moment, while the homelands already need at least 22 Government veterinary surgeons. In the case of dentists and veterinary surgeons as well, therefore, a great need exists.</p>

<p>Another argument which may be advanced is that the expenditure of R30 million on a new medical university is a waste of Government funds seeing that facilities already exist at Wentworth. For the new medical university, an intake of 200 medical students a year is being planned, as well as an eventual intake of 50 veterinary and 50 dentistry students. This means a total intake of 300 students a year. The total cost of the planned university will, as I have already said, amount to R30 million. In order to expand the existing training facilities at Wentworth to such an extent that an intake of 200 Black students a year would be possible, an additional capital investment of R23 million would be needed. The amount of R23 million does not include the expenditure which will be required for the establishment of training facilities for veterinary surgeons and dentists. If one looks at this picture carefully, one realizes that by spending an additional R7 million at Ga-Rankuwa, we would be able to train, over and above 200 medical students, 50 dentistry and 50 veterinary students a year. This is indeed a relatively low capital investment per student. Therefore it goes without saying that it would be more economical to create the new university instead of enlarging the existing facilities at Wentworth. The expansion of the facilities at Wentworth would require a capital investment of R115 000 per student, but the establishment of the new university at Ga-Rankuwa will require a capital investment of only R100 000 per student. Therefore, there will be a capital saving of R15 000 per student if we establish the new university instead of enlarging the existing facilities.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<p>That is an underestimation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central always opens his mouth at the wrong time and shortly I shall lead him into a trap again.</p>

<p>One should also keep in mind that if one were to spend an additional R7 million by establishing the new Ga-Rankuwa University instead of expanding Wentworth, one would be able to train 50 dentists and 50 veterinary surgeons. This means that by spending an additional R7 million, 100 more students may be trained every year. Therefore, the training of the additional 100 students would be made possible by a capital expenditure of R70 000 per student, a very low capital expenditure. This is a very important point which should always be kept in mind.</p>

<p>The amounts which I have just mentioned appear even more favourable when one considers the advantages which result from the fact that Onderstepoort is not far from Ga-Rankuwa, while there is no veterinary research institute in the vicinity of Wentworth. The latter fact makes the training of veterinary surgeons in the vicinity of Wentworth a practical impossibility, due to the capital expenditure which it would require to create such a research institute in that vicinity as well. This argument tips the scale even further in favour of the establishment of the new university.</p>

<p>The proposed university should also be regarded as a training-ground for the establishment of further medical faculties for Black people. For that reason, post-graduate studies will also be emphasized at Medunsa, as the university will be called, because we should like specialists to be trained there who might later be used as staff for new institutions which will be created in future. The existing facilities at Wentworth have rendered no service to the Black people in this respect. No Black specialist has yet been produced by Wentworth. The state of affairs on 27 March 1975 was that Wentworth had only produced 12 Indian specialists and two Coloured specialists, but no Black specialists. In this respect I do not think it is unreasonable to say that the existing institution at Wentworth has failed. Another important aspect to mind is that the staff at Wentworth are not yet representative of the ethnic groups they serve. There is not a single Black professor at Wentworth, for example, and one may rightly ask why this is so. Indians have in fact been <span class="col_4969-4970" refersTo="page_1167"/>appointed as clinical assistants at Wentworth, but no Blacks. Might it not be a question of discrimination here&#x003F; I am just asking. Another important aspect and adavantage of the new university is that supporting studies will be offered in three directions. This has the great advantage that when study in any of the three main directions is for some reason abandoned, the training which has already been undergone may be better utilized should the student switch over to a related supporting direction of study. The fact is that there is a considerable loss of students during this training period at Wentworth and I want to supply a few statistics in support of the statement I have made. If we look at new admissions to the medical school during the past six years, we find that approximately 35 students were enrolled annually during the past five years, while the average number of graduates during that period was only 15. This means that there is a loss of 20 students per year, in other words, 57% of the students originally admitted. One can draw many conclusions from that, but I think it would be a fair and reasonable conclusion that a large number of these students who dropped out along the way would have been able to succeed in a supporting direction of study, as will in fact be offered at Ga-Rankuwa, and I think the future will prove the validity of this statement.</p>

<p>The idea of such a university was not conceived overnight, but was a Cabinet decision which was taken as long ago as 1966. A thorough investigation was conducted into the matter and the hon. the Minister even went overseas to investigate matters there. The Secretary of Bantu Education was also involved and conducted a very thorough investigation into the creation of a medical university of this kind. It is interesting to see what the opinion concerning such a university is overseas. I mention the following overseas universities which were visited: The Ludwig-Maximilians Universit&#x00E4;t in Munich, Germany, the Justus-Liebig-Universit&#x00E4;t in Giessen, West Germany, the Rijksuniversiteit at Ghent in Belgium and the Universit&#x00E4;t Zurich in Switzerland. These universities were asked, amongst other things, whether disadvantages would be attached to a university institution offering only medicine, dentistry and veterinary science in one or more faculties. <b>I</b> think this is to a certain extent the answer to the statement which the hon. member for Rosettenville made. These four universities&#x2014;at Munich, Giessen, Ghent and Zurich&#x2014;said that there would be no disadvantages involved. They were also asked what advantages could be derived from having medicine, dentistry and veterinary science together with other faculties at a university. To this they replied very positively. In Munich they said that it was actually advantageous for general studies and that deans of these faculties made positive contributions to the management of the university. At Giessen it was said that the groups lent status and made a contribution to bodies such as the Senate. The Rijksuniversiteit in Ghent said that it could be autonomous, but that it was also a good thing for the faculty to function along with the others. Zurich said it could be autonomous and after pre-clinical training each group could go its own way. In this way various questions concerning the university of Medunsa were all answered very positively. They were also asked whether students who did not pass their courses could follow a similar or less demanding course. The comment was that something of this kind would be commendable.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to reply to a few points raised by the hon. member for Lydenburg. It surprises me that we still hear reproaches at this stage about what happened in this country 30 years ago under the Government of that time. One would have thought that 30 years would be enough for the waters to wash away that bridge and that comparisons of that nature would serve no purpose any longer. I do want to point out to the hon. member for Lydenburg that for many years his Government was the one which pegged down expenditure on Bantu education, over and above the portion obtained from general Bantu taxes, at R13 million a year.</p>

<p>I shall not allow myself to be diverted by such nonsensical questions. I want to make it quite clear in regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s second point as well, where he objected to the statement of the hon. member for Rosettenville, that one can indeed speak of a lack of proper planning for <span class="col_4971-4972" refersTo="page_1168"/>the training of Bantu medical practitioners. I want to quote from the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister, in which he said of the total number of people accepted as students at Durban Wentworth&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, these 688 were only one-third of the number of candidates who applied and qualified for admission.</block>

<p>Whose fault is it that there are not enough facilities&#x003F; I was pleasantly surprised to learn from the hon. member for Lydenburg that all the homeland governments had been consulted. The hon. member for Rosettenville asked questions in this connection, and one could have assumed that the hon. the Minister would have given us those particulars in his Second Reading speech. The hon. member for Lydenburg admitted that there was a shortage of no fewer than 3 000 Black dentists at the moment. Once again one would ask who was to blame for this kind of situation. The hon. member for Lydenburg devoted a large part of his speech to the costs entailed by the expansion of the facilities at Durban Wentworth, further to what the hon. the Minister said in this connection. I have no intention of questioning the particulars furnished by the hon. the Minister, but I do want to tell him that the information we have is of a completely different nature. The effect of this information is that if the facilities at the medical school of the University of Natal were to be expanded over a period of three years to increase the intake capacity from 100 to 160, this would require an amount of R800 000, not including the accommodation for students. However, if the accommodation for students were to be included, and if a high-rise building were to be erected to provide for this need, it would cost an additional R5 million. I have the problem, therefore, that the figures available to us differ completely from the figure of R23 million referred to by the hon. member for Lydenburg and by the hon. the Minister as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Lydenburg raised another point. He asked why no Black members of staff had yet been appointed at Durban Wentworth. I should like to ask the hon. member for Lydenburg whether he could give us an assurance that if the University of Natal should want to appoint a Black member of staff, that appointment would be agreed to. I would be glad if the hon. member could tell me whether our other universities would really be allowed to appoint Black members of staff.</p>

<p>Since there is no reply forthcoming, I shall leave the hon. member for Lydenburg at that. My approach to this matter differs completely from the one adopted by that hon. member. I should like to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Rosettenville and to express the hope that the hon. the Minister and the Cabinet will comply with the request of the hon. member that this matter be referred to a Select Committee. One has to distinguish here between the creation of sufficient facilities for the training of doctors, dentists and veterinary surgeons and the particulars concerning where and in what way those facilities are to be created. There cannot be any doubt in anyone&#x2019;s mind as to the necessity for provision to be made&#x2014;and the hon. member for Lydenberg conceded this&#x2014;for the training of a much larger number of doctors and dentists to provide in the needs of a growing White and non-White population.</p>

<p>In fact, the hon. the Minister referred in his speech to the fact that there is approximately one doctor for every 2 000 persons in South Africa at the moment. He also put the ideal ratio at one doctor for every 1 000 persons. If we accept that ratio, the total number of doctors in South Africa is only half of what it should be today. In other words, we have a shortage of approximately 6 000 trained doctors at this stage. Naturally, great efforts will be required to wipe out this backlog. However, the problem becomes more critical if we bear in mind the expected population growth&#x2014;to which the hon. member for Lydenburg referred. It is estimated that the total South African population will increase by approximately 12 million in the 15 years between 1975 and 1990. On a basis of one doctor for each 1 000 persons, this means that we shall have to train approximately 12 600 doctors in the course of the next 15 years. In the five-year period from 1975 to 1980 we shall have to train approximately 3 600, i.e. more than 700 a year. In the five-year period from 1980 to 1985, approximately 4 200 doctors will have to be trained, i.e. more than 800 a year. Over the period from 1985 to 1990, the number will be <span class="col_4973-4974" refersTo="page_1169"/>approximately 4 800, i.e. more than 950 a year.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>This is the total increase of the population, i.e. Whites and non-Whites. In terms of this ratio, therefore, an average number of more than 800 doctors a year will have to be produced over the fifteen-year period just to keep pace with the population growth. If we also want to wipe out the present backlog in the course of the next 15 years, we shall have to produce an additional 400 doctors a year. Consequently, we shall have to train and make available an average number of 1 200 doctors a year over the next 15 years. How almost unattainable this ideal is appears from the fact that at the beginning of 1975, only 4 665 students were enrolled for all the courses at the medical faculties of all our universities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Lydenburg was quite right when he said that a large percentage of students never finish their studies. On this basis, the number of trained doctors we produce every year is considerably smaller than 1 000. In fact, the hon. the Minister of National Education said last year, in reply to a question put to him by the hon. member for Berea, that an estimated number of only 587 White doctors would qualify in 1980. In 1985, the number would be 685, and in 1990, the total would be only 783. As I have indicated, we shall have to produce an average number of 1 200 doctors a year over that period. Over the same three periods, an estimated number of 19, 21 and 24 Coloured persons and 54, 63 and 73 Indians, respectively, will qualify as medical practitioners. In other words, according to this projection, a total of 660 Whites, Coloured persons and Indians will qualify as doctors in 1980. In 1985 the total will be 769, while the figure for 1990 will be only 880. It has not been possible to make any projection in respect or the Bantu. Unless there is a drastic improvement, therefore, i.e. unless training facilities are improved drastically, it will be difficult to maintain even the present unfavourable ratio.</p>

<p>The Bantu population is expected to increase by approximately 10 million over the next 15 years. If it is the intention&#x2014;and I want to make it quite clear that I reject this approach&#x2014;that the Bantu population in South Africa should be served primarily or exclusively by Bantu doctors, then, in terms of the ideal ratio of one doctor for every 1 000 persons, approximately 10 000 doctors will have to be trained over the 15-year period, i.e. more than 650 doctors a year. I find it a pity that the hon. the Minister mentioned the ratio of one to 45 000, for when we have been accused in the past of having trained only one Black doctor for approximately 45 000 people, we have said in this House that that ratio was false. We said it was false because those needs were provided for to a large extent by other doctors. It is a figure which has no meaning at all.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct. I have mentioned that approximately 650 Bantu medical practitioners will have to be trained every year to provide in the needs of the Bantu. However, a mere 16 obtained the degree of M.B. Ch.B. at the end of 1974. In addition, I want to say that South Africa has a special responsibility towards other parts of Southern Africa as well. It is clear that we are faced with a crisis situation and that far-reaching steps will have to be taken on a basis of proper strategic planning. For that reason, steps aimed at expanding the training facilities for doctors, regardless of race or colour, are welcomed in principle by this side of the House. The inevitable conclusion is, furthermore, that it is completely absurd to curtail or to abolish existing facilities for the training of medical practitioners and especially of Bantu doctors. Consequently we on this side of the House are absolutely opposed to the closing of the medical school of the University of Natal to the training of Bantu. Indeed, we do not only ask for that school to be retained, but for it to be expanded to take in the maximum number of students, considering the population concentration in Natal and in the eastern part of our country in general. A medical school in Natal, in that part of the country, seems to us to be an obvious necessity.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister indicated in his speech that the existing intake capacity of the medical school of the University of Natal was such that it was not even able to accept all the students who applied. As I have already <span class="col_4975-4976" refersTo="page_1170"/>indicated, the hon. the Minister said that 688 students had been admitted during the past 25 years, but that this number constituted only one-third of the number of candidates who applied. In other words, there is a real need for the expansion of the facilities at the medical school. The hon. the Minister added that there was undoubtedly sufficient student material to justify expanded training facilities. I agree with that wholeheartedly. As he also indicated, there is an encouraging increase in the number of Bantu matriculants with matriculation exemption.</p>

<p>For the information of the hon. member for Lydenburg, who made a great fuss here about the shortages that existed, I want to point out that in 1957, there were only 850 matriculants, and that by the year 1962, this number had increased to only 878. Well, those times are past, and it would serve no purpose to elaborate on them. The hon. the Minister indicated that there was an encouraging increase in the number of matriculants with matriculation exemption. The number has increased from 182 in 1960 to 3 520 in 1970. On the basis of extrapolated figures, we may expect the number of Bantu matriculants to increase to approximately 57 000 by 1980, to approximately 62 000 by 1985 and to approximately 110 000 by 1990. Obviously, not all these students will qualify for admission to a university or a medical faculty. But from this point of view, too, it is clear that the creation of additional facilities has become an urgent necessity.</p>

<p>It is also a well-known fact&#x2014;and in part, this is my reply to the hon. member for Lydenburg&#x2014;that at each of the existing university institutions that provide medical schools&#x2014;i.e. Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Bloemfontein, Wits, Pretoria, etc.&#x2014;a large number of students are turned down every year because the intake capacity of those institutions is not big enough. What do these facts prove to us&#x003F; Firstly, that even if we were to accept this Bill and to establish a new medical school for the Bantu, no matter where, this would not nearly be sufficient to meet the needs. Secondly, that it would be completely illogical and irresponsible to close the medical school of the University of Natal to the training of Bantu doctors. In this connection I want to express our thanks and appreciation to the University of Natal, as did the hon. member, for the service they have rendered up to now. Thirdly, that it is equally illogical and irresponsible to prohibit the other White universities from accepting non-Whites as students in their medical schools if they wish to do so; and fourthly, that the training of Bantu as doctors must be seen as part of a comprehensive programme for the training of medical practitioners. For all these reasons it is essential, as an initial step, for this Bill to be referred to a Select Committee for investigation and consideration. The problem simply cannot be dealt with in isolation. Surely this is quite clear. Because this matter is so important, it is essential that attempts be made to obtain the largest possible measure of consensus in this House concerning the most effective steps that can be taken. In other words, this is not a matter which should be approached primarily from a party-political or a political-ideological point of view.</p>

<p>It is quite clear, as the hon. member for Rosettenville further indicated, that that expansion must take place in consultation with the people who are very closely affected by it&#x2014;i.e. not only the Government, but also the South African Medical and Dental Council, the universities of South Africa, those that offer medical training as well as the others and White as well as non-White universities, the various homeland governments, the Coloured Persons Representative Council and the Indian Council. As I have said, the hon. the Minister said nothing to indicate that these bodies had been consulted. For this reason as well it seems essential to me that this matter be referred to a Select Committee.</p>

<p>In this connection, as the hon. member for Rosettenville indicated, the sitting of the new institution is important. It is important that it will be erected on Bantu trust land in the vicinity of Ga-Rankuwa. The hon. the Minister did not make it clear whether that university would fall within Bophuthatswana and would therefore be subject to the Government of Bophuthatswana. We have no objection to Bophuthatswana&#x2019;s obtaining its own academic institutions if there is a need for this and if it is practicable. However, if it is to be an institution, and the only one of its kind at that, which is to serve all the Bantu population groups, it seems obvious to me that the other homeland leaders and governments must be consulted in this regard. The Government of <span class="col_4977-4978" refersTo="page_1171"/>Bophuthatswana has already indicated that it will probably request constitutional independence. If the proposed institution will in fact be situated within Bophuthatswana &#x2026;</p>

<p>Let me say further that it is obvious that major problems may arise if that institution which is to provide for all Bantu population groups were to be situated inside one particular homeland, especially if that homeland were eventually to achieve independence.</p>

<p>My time has almost expired. I just want to say that it seems essential to me that if a medical school is in fact to be established in the Transvaal&#x2014;it would appear to me that it is&#x2014;consideration should also be given, as the hon. member for Rosettenville indicated, to the question of whether that unspecified placed near Ga-Rankuwa is the right place for that institution to be established. The question was asked here by the hon. member for Rosettenville whether Soweto, for example, with its large concentration of people, would not be a better place, using Baragwanath as a training hospital. The hon. member for Rosettenville also explained our objections to the concept of a separate independent so-called medical university which is able to confer its own degrees. The hon. member for Lydenburg may say that overseas universities made all kinds of positive comments, but we know that as far as the South African set-up is concerned, that kind of thing is a completely foreign phenomenon. The only kind of medical training we know is in the form of faculties attached to existing universities. The question that this Select Committee should consider, therefore, is whether there is not an existing university institution which could be linked to such an institution for degree purposes at least.</p>

<p>I need not say that the training of doctors in South Africa has a special tradition, a tradition of high standards, of academic integrity and of service to the community as a whole, and it would be tragic if we were to establish an institution which might violate that tradition.</p>

<p>Of course, there are major ideological difference between the Government and the Opposition in regard to our universities. This is a fact. We have frequently emphasized, as has just been done here again by the hon. member for Rosettenville, that we are opposed in principle to the racial exclusiveness on which the Government bases its university policy. We have contended that all universities in South Africa should be free to decide who they want to admit as students. Similarly, we on this side of the House have rejected the principle of ethnic exclusiveness, as applied in the Bantu universities. In this regard, the Snyman report fully supported our view that it has been and is an undesirable principle. We find it illuminating that the institution which is being provided for in this Bill will be organized on a multi-ethnic or multi-national basis. And this applies to the composition of the council as well as to the student community. I just want to say thank heavens we have moved away at last from the idea of an exclusive council and from the ill-conceived practice of an advisory council to which this Government clung for so many years.</p>

<p>I should be neglecting my duty if I failed to express serious misgivings about the fact that we still think, in the times in which we live, or <span class="col_4979-4980" refersTo="page_1172"/>the creation of institutions, specifically academic institutions, on a purely racial basis. In theory&#x2014;I emphasize, in theory&#x2014;one might still be able to justify the establishment of a university for the Zulu, for example, or for the Xhosa, because it might be said&#x2014;we have often heard this said by the hon. members opposite&#x2014;that such an institution could play an important part in the development of a particular nation because it could promote national pride, and so forth. In any case, these theoretical considerations are not applicable to the proposed institution. The institution as envisaged in this Bill is one which is based purely on the principle of racial separation and racial exclusiveness, and in that sense it is unacceptable to us. It can only serve to do further harm to our international reputation, especially because we are concerned here with something which is of a non-political nature, i.e. the training of doctors and dentists. It is completely incomprehensible that as far as sport, hotels, and so many other fields are concerned, we should have realized that we cannot continue with the principle of racial differentiation and racial exclusiveness, but that we should produce a new academic institution here in which we want to apply that principle once again. One has the impression that the Government believes that friction can be eliminated by keeping people apart as far as possible. In my opinion, that approach is completely untrue and incorrect. That old-fashioned concept, that we can prevent friction by keeping people apart, has proved to be untrue. I should like to argue that matter further, but time does not allow me to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the course of my speech I shall come back to the hon. member for Edenvale, but I just want to start by saying that the hon. member does not like one to call back the past. He took it amiss of the hon. member who spoke just before him that he went back 30 years into the past. I think the hon. member for Edenvale is ashamed of his past. In life, if one tries to run away from oneself, from one&#x2019;s people, from standpoints one has adopted in the past, one will never find peace of mind in one&#x2019;s own soul. One will always be running away. I think that the hon. member will never be effectual in this House either, because in debate he will always have to be refuting things of which he was once convinced. Especially once one is older, this detracts a great deal from one&#x2019;s credibility and makes one very ineffectual. But I shall come back to a few things which the hon. member for Edenvale said.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this Bill which, in terms of clause 2, establishes a university called the Medical University of Southern Africa. If memory serves me, the hon. the Minister has now served for a little over ten years as Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. This has been a decade during which the hon. the Minister has carried the full responsibility for Bantu education. However, this university which is to be established will not only be a milestone which the hon. the Minister may look back on with pride, but testimony, too, to the purposeful growth and development of the multinational policy of the National Party. However, the establishment of this university will also be of inestimable significance as regards service to all the peoples of Southern Africa. Man and beast will profit from the activities of this university. It is ironical that so many negative things have been said and <span class="col_4981-4982" refersTo="page_1173"/>written about the coming and the presence of Europeans in Africa and that nothing whatever is said about the introduction to Africa of so many of the best cultural elements of the European&#x2014;this is suppressed completely. This statement is far more true of South Africa, not only as far as the Whites are concerned but particularly as far as the National Party is concerned, too. The past quarter century, or a little more than a quarter of a century, has been characterized to such an extent by a massive propaganda onslaught against the National Party, that the real and positive progress made in regard to the establishment of generally-accepted elements of civilization has been minimized to a very great extent. At the time of the victory of the National Party in 1948, it was openly proclaimed that everything in South Africa would come to a standstill and that everything would be destroyed. The policy statements of our leaders were not accepted. I want to quote an excerpt from a speech made by Dr. Malan in 1948 (Hansard, Vol. 64, col. 219)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An intolerable state of affairs has arisen here in the past few years in our university institutions, a state of affairs which gives rise to friction, to an unpleasant relationship Europeans and non-Europeans.</block>

<p>Now comes the important part&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not want to withhold higher education from the non-Europeans, and we will take every possible step to give both the Natives and the Coloureds university&#x2014;and sufficient university&#x2014;training as soon as we can, but in their own spheres; in other words, in separate institutions.</block>

<p>In other words, in 1948, notwithstanding all the prophecies of doom, the Prime Minister was at that time able to state categorically that we were not opposed to tertiary education for the non-Whites, but were prepared to provide it, on our own conditions and in accordance with our own view, and it is on that basis that people should judge us today, not according to the principle&#x2014;because we differ on that&#x2014;but according to what we have achieved in practice with the means at our disposal. This university to be established is not an isolated educational institution unconnected with the South African community. Superficial and wilful critics of the National Party, such as the hon. member for Edenvale, are quick to make out that we want to put forward this university as a piece of propaganda with which we want to appease the world, or that domestically we want to put it forward as a toy with which we want to console the Bantu people. The effect of criticism of this kind is no longer valid today, and I want to tell the hon. member for Edenvale that it is no longer effective, either. However, this university is one of the products of the education policy of the National Party, a policy&#x2014;and we have never been ashamed of this&#x2014;based on the multinational character of the population of this country. History furnishes the most conclusive proof that from the start the National Party has supported the principle of education, sound education, for all the peoples. Sir, I want to quote here what the late Dr. Verwoerd, as Minister of Native Affairs, said with regard to Bantu education policy. In a speech in the Other Place on 7 June 1954, Dr. Verwoerd said the following (Senate Hansard, Vol. 2, col. 2618.)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the policy of my department that education should have its roots entirely in the native areas and in the native environment and native community. There Bantu education must be able to give itself complete expression and there it will have to perform its real service. The Bantu must be guided to serve his own community in all respects. There is no place for him in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour. Within his own community however all doors are open. For that reason it is of no avail for him to receive a training which has its aim absorption in the European community while he cannot and will not be absorbed there. Up till now he has been subjected to a school system which drew him away from his own community and practically misled him by showing him the green pastures of the <span class="col_4983-4984" refersTo="page_1174"/>European but still did not allow him to graze there. This attitude is not only uneconomic because money is spent on education which has not specific aim, but it is even dishonest to continue with it. The effect on the Bantu community we find in the much-discussed frustration of educated Natives who can find no employment which is acceptable to them. It is abundantly clear that unplanned education creates many problems, disrupts the communal life of the Bantu and endangers the communal life of the European. For that reason it must be replaced by planned Bantu education. In the Native territories where the services of educated Bantu are very much needed, Bantu education can complete its full cycle, by which the child is taken out of the community by the school, developed to his fullest extent in accordance with aptitude and ability and thereafter returned to the community to serve and to enrich it.</block>

<p>Sir, criticism of the National Party has been directed mainly at its approach to university training. This is the case again this afternoon with the hon. member for Edenvale. He did not attack the Bantu education policy of the National Party as such, but he did attack the point of view and the approach of the National Party university policy in South Africa. Although we cannot discuss it this afternoon, I want to refer the hon. member to the report of the Van Wyk De Vries Commission, which points out very clearly the difference between our view as regards universities, which is based on service to the individual within his own national community and the classic approach of the UP, that a university should serve a general world, free of national links and to a large extent free from the ideals of the group it has to serve. Sir, the hon. member does now apologize for his conception of a university and I do not apologize for our conception of a university. That is where the difference between us as regards principle lies, namely in our view with regard to universities, and this is something which one can debate. But the fact that the NP has carried out its policy in a way that has been true to its principles and promises, and is still doing so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this university does not represent the end of the development in this sphere, but is only a precursor of further development. Criticism of this Bill cannot really be directed at the aim of the Bill itself. In my opinion it can only be directed at the fact that Bantu Students will no longer enrol at the medical school of the University of Natal. The fact that hon. members of the Opposition want a commission of inquiry means that they want a commission of inquiry into universities in South Africa. That is all this will amount to and that is why I cannot agree with their amendment.</p>

<p>The criticism levelled at this university by that side of the House is, firstly, to the effect that two medical schools&#x2014;the UP has not yet said this, but it may be said&#x2014;are better than one. Accordingly, they can say that the establishment of this university will involve too much financial expenditure, something we cannot afford economically, and thirdly, that the establishment of this university will harm us in the eyes of the world. Furthermore, the UP can also say that it will disturb Black/White relations in South Africa. Sir, I want to dwell for a moment on the problems I have mentioned here. As far as the first point is concerned&#x2014;viz. that two medical schools will be better than one&#x2014;I want to say that it appears that the hon. members of the Opposition are against this specific university in principle, too. They say that more universities can be established, but not of this specific kind. Sir, I must agree at once that two universities are better than one, on condition that both of those universities must comply with the requirements we set a university, because this university is not the end of the medical training we envisage for the non-Whites in South Africa. As long ago as 25 years ago we said that in the course of time, as financial and other circumstances permitted, we would not be able to escape our responsibilities. Just as Dr. Malan and Dr. Verwoerd put it 25 years ago, we, too, are today still saying that this university does not represent the end of medical training of the non-Whites in South Africa. Secondly, Sir, there is the <span class="col_4985-4986" refersTo="page_1175"/>economic aspect. Hon. members elaborated on this too, and said that our cost figures with regard to the present medical school were incorrect. Seen superficially, it could be said that one could extend an existing university by providing more facilities, using less money than one would spend on a entirely new institution. Sir, what I find so strange is that it is specifically that side of the House which is always accusing the National Party of not wanting to spend money on the Bantu. In the light of their so-called approach with regard to the Bantu, the UP ought really to applaud this. They ought to be very pleased that we are prepared to spend this money in the midst of difficult financial and economic circumstances. That is why I cannot see how there can be criticism from those people who supposedly understand nothing about the NP. The fact that we want to spend money on education ought to satisfy everyone in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is also said that in the eyes of world opinion, we are not doing the right thing here. But the concept of a world opinion is a very vague one. In any event we shall never be able to satisfy the communists and their fellow-travellers. However, I am convinced in my own mind that when we confront the world with this matter and state the fact that we are establishing a university of their own for the non-Whites in South Africa, for the training of medical practitioners, dentists and veterinarians, no intelligent person will have any complaint about that.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it can also be said&#x2014;and is in fact said&#x2014;that we will be disturbing relations between White and non-White in South Africa. We differ on that standpoint as well. The NP believes that when people develop within their specific national context and when, too, provision is made for their requirements in all spheres within that same national context, relations need not necessarily be disturbed. In fact, the opposite is true. When people are intentionally brought together, relations between population groups can be disturbed.</p>

<p>As regards the admission of Bantu students to this university, we can only take cognizance of what has been said by Bantu themselves in connection with the requirements for admission. A former Minister of Health of the Ciskei, Mr. Japhta, expressed himself as follows on this point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If I have said nothing about young students, both male and female, who have obtained their B.Sc. degrees, it is stated that those people who have this degree, meet with a difficulty as far as admission to Wentworth is concerned.</block>

<p>The disturbing of relationships which could occur in this case did not come from the NP. In my opinion the responsibility must be laid at the door of the people who determine the requirements for admission, the people who selected the students for the university in question. In a debate Mr. Mnandsa said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Republican Government saw fit that the Black student shall not be admitted for medicine at Wits and the University of Cape Town. They said that there would be a medical school opened in the University of Natal which would cater for the Black students, but significantly enough, the Coloured students continue to be admitted to the University of Cape Town, the Indian students continue to be admitted to the University of Cape Town and so is the case at Wits at present. Now, here is the irony of the whole thing. At the medical school in Durban the majority of students are Indian.</block>

<p>He goes on to quote Prof. Adams. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall continue to have more Indians and Coloureds at the medical school at Durban and, as to what happens to your students, you should not ask us. You should ask yourselves. We are fully aware that if there are people who need more doctors than any others in South Africa, it is the Black population. But you did not have to get doctors from us. You have to get the doctors from among yourselves.</block>

<p><span class="col_4987-4988" refersTo="page_1176"/>Then the hon. professor goes on to say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any second-grade matriculant, as far as we are concerned, is preferable to a first-class Black matriculation student. The tree you should be barking up is your own Government, but especially the Department of Bantu Education, which has brought you into the morass in which you are swimming. I would not like to cast aspersions on my colleagues. It does not matter where they are, but you must understand, you Black people, that you have not put the throb of your heart next to your Black universities. Apparently you do not know what is happening there. Whatever can be said, I want it to be quite clear to you gentlemen, that the type of B.Sc. that you produced some years ago, is far superior to the type of B.Sc. you are producing today.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is one of the problems which has occurred, viz. that the responsible people at those universities have in my opinion discriminated against Bantu students. They have discriminated in the sense that they have not admitted as many Bantu students as they could have. When this was pointed out to them by Black people, they placed the responsibility for this on the NP. To maintain that in its education policy for the Bantu the NP has failed to set high requirements, is untrue. I am of the opinion that the reason fewer Bantu students are trained at the University of Natal is the failure of the responsible people at that university to consult the Bantu properly in this matter. This is one cardinal reason.</p>

<p>However, what was the standpoint of the NP with regard to the medical school of the University of Natal&#x003F; In 1948&#x2014;because in previous years they had been concerned with the development there&#x2014;Mr. Jan Hofmeyr asked what the standpoint of the NP would be with regard to the medical school there. The then Minister of Education, Dr. A. J. Stals, expressly stated that the NP Government intended to continue with the development of that university. In that respect this Government did in fact keep its word, and did so in such a way that in an article written in 1966 Prof. Brooks could say the following in regard to this institution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The dissolution of Parliament and the general election supervened. The new Government of Dr. Malan was more prompt and more generous than his predecessor, but coupled its financial aid with the condition that the principles of apartheid should be applied to the medical school and that it should enrol non-European students only.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when someone like Prof. Brooks makes such a statement, it is proof that the NP has to the best of its ability seen to it that that medical school did not come to nothing&#x2014; because the NP took upon itself the responsibility for this.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the total number of Bantu matricultants has continued to increase in recent years. In 1971 there were 1 326 Bantu pupils in matric. In 1975 the number increased to 3 520. In 1971 the number of matriculants taking mathematics was 392, whereas in 1975 it was 1 224. In 1971, 303 Bantu pupils took physical science and chemistry as a matriculation subject as against 963 in 1975, whereas 1 116 matric pupils in Bantu schools took biology as a subject in 1971, a total which grew to 2 952 in 1975. This proves that the NP has established a sound foundation for Bantu education, one on the basis of which fruitful development can now take place.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville maintains that we should not move this university because the majority of its students are from Natal. However, I want to tell the hon. member that according to statistics only 12% of the students are from Natal whereas 47% are from the Transvaal. The argument advanced by the hon. member for Rosettenville therefore holds no water.</p>

<p>Another very important matter I want to mention with regard to the universities in question is the following. I want to refer to clause 10(d) in which the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One person from each of the faculties</block>

<p><span class="col_4989-4990" refersTo="page_1177"/>This relates to the composition of the council of the university&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science of the University of Pretoria appointed by the council of the University of Pretoria;</block>

<ol>

<li>(e) one person from each of the faculties of medicine and dentistry of the University of the Witwatersrand appointed by the council of the University of the Witwatersrand.</li>

</ol>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville stated that we had not consulted the various universities in South Africa. The hon. member for Edenvale elaborated on more or less the same idea. I can now tell hon. members that I do not think they read the Second Reading speech by the hon. the Minister, because here is the proof that we not only consulted those people but that we are in fact going to appoint those people to the council of the university. As a person with very close links with the University of Pretoria I want to say that I am grateful that my own <i>alma mater</i> is going to serve on the council in this way and that we at the University of Pretoria can put our years of experience at its disposal, and not only with regard to the doctors, either. When he tried to persuade us to accept his amendment, the hon. member for Edenvale said nothing about the training of dentists or the training of veterinarians. But here we are in fact causing the University of Pretoria with all its knowledge and its insight, to be involved in this new university which is to be established. We go even further. We do not only take a university which to a large extent shares our view with regard to universities; we also make use of the University of the Witwatersrand which has a totally different point of view with regard to universities. To us, however, the point of view of a university is not the issue&#x2014;it is the real scientific contributions which those two universities can make. I do not think the hon. member for Edenvale can insinuate in any way that as far as this university is concerned we are not going to provide the finest academic facilities for the Bantu, because here we are involving two universities which, in the light of their own history and their own knowledge and experience, can make a contribution to the benefit of these people.</p>

<p>There is another provision I want to mention and that is the clause relating to discipline. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that personally I am very grateful that there is a clause, clause 21, which states specifically that a student at the university is subject to the disciplinary provisions laid down by the council by way of statutes or regulations. I am very grateful that this specific provision exists because, specifically in the light of the point of view relating to universities held by the hon. member for Edenvale no university can really be a university if it lacks the power to enforce discipline. I want to appeal to the council and the senate of the university, together with its staff, to maintain there from the outset the kind of discipline which will really make a contribution to this particular university.</p>

<p>I now come to more or less the end of my speech. Throughout his speech the hon. member for Edenvale did nothing but try to place this university in an unfavourable light in the eyes, not only of the Whites of South Africa, but also of the Bantu, of the non-Whites of South Africa, and he did so by using one term. To be specific, he referred to this university as the so-called medical university. It amazes me that the hon. member for Edenvale, who was himself attached to a university for many years and who ought to know better than any person in this House what the leftist elements in South Africa have said about Bantu universities in South Africa, can adopt such an attitude. I want to ask him to indicate at a later stage, under the vote of the hon. the Minister, in what respect the qualifications and the standards of the Bantu universities are so poor and why, since he and I want to advance the cause of the training of medical practitioners, he should today want to place this university in a poor light right from the outset. The hon. member is shaking his head, but I hold it against the UP that its two speakers have by no means made out a case for <span class="col_4991-4992" refersTo="page_1178"/>our accepting their amendment. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am glad that I am getting a chance to speak in a reasonably tranquil atmosphere this afternoon. To begin with I should like to express a few general ideas. In the first place I want to express my appreciation towards the members of the Opposition&#x2014;especially the first speaker, the hon. member for Rosettenville&#x2014;for not having spoken of this project in a derogatory manner in their discussion of this matter. I really do appreciate it. I recall the year 1959-&#x2019;60 when we dealt here with the extension of University Education Act in terms of which we established the Bantu universities. At that time we heard many derogatory things in this Chamber. I am not laying this at anybody&#x2019;s door, but I just want to say that I am glad that a similar spirit did not prevail here today. There was a hint of this, and the hon. member for Rissik referred to it, from the hon. member for Edenvale, but I shall forgive him for that. After all, he sins so much in politics that I can forgive him that small sin. He is so often confronted with his other political sins&#x2014;and I think I am still going to do the same in this very debate&#x2014;that I shall not hold this small one against him. I must say, however, that the hon. member for Rosettenville surprised me somewhat. In my time I have often listened to him in this Chamber and he has always been someone who can state his case forcefully. But today he was very unconvincing. I think that the hon. member, as a doctor of standing, did not really have such serious misgivings about the Bill as he wanted to suggest. He asked quite a few questions about the institution as such, questions to which I shall come back in due course.</p>

<p>I want to thank hon. members on my side and on the opposite side for their contributions, and when I say &#x201C;on the opposite side&#x201D; I mean only half of the opposite side, because up to now we have in fact had participation in this debate from the side of the Official Opposition only. They at least did their duty by taking up a standpoint, I do not know whether this means that the PRP is supporting us fully this time as far as this Bill is concerned. We shall still have to see.</p>

<p>An amendment has been moved and I think I owe it to this House to give an indication at the first opportunity of our feelings on this side of the House about this amendment. I do not want to leave any doubt, as was pointed out by the hon. member for Rissik too, that the amendment is not acceptable at all. In fact, I think that the amendment is quite unnecessary because the matters raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville and also by the hon. member for Edenvale, matters which they apparently want to have investigated by a Select Committee, are matters which fall outside the scope of this Bill, completely outside the scope of this Bill. With all due respect to everybody who participated in this debate, I must point out that the facilities at Wentworth are completely outside the scope of this Bill. Consequently I do not know how a Select Committee to be appointed on this Bill, will be able to go into the Wentworth matter.</p>

<p>I know that on this happy day preceding our Easter recess, there is an agreement that we adjourn a little earlier. Sir, I think it is clear to you that I am suffering from an early winter cold and because of that I take pleasure in moving, if it pleases you&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Before asking the Secretary to read the first Order of the Day, I should like to make a statement on the reprinting of Bills which have been amended in this House or the Other Place.</p>

<p>At present when a Bill has been amended, it is reprinted in full with the amendments indicated by means of square brackets and underlinings.</p>

<p>As members will appreciate, this procedure greatly increases the expenditure on printing. In view of the recent steep rise in printing contract prices and the need in the national interest to reduce State expenditure wherever such reduction is compatible with efficiency, the question whether it is essential in all cases to reprint amended Bills in full has been considered through the usual channels.</p>

<p>In the case of a Bill which is extensively amended by the House in which it originated, it has been decided that the Bill will be reprinted in full as in the past. However, if a limited number of amendments have been made, a list containing only the amended clauses, subsections, etc., will be issued with the amendments indicated by the present method.</p>

<p>*I should like to make it clear, however, that although the amended clauses, etc., will be printed separately from the Bill and transmitted in this form to the other House, they will be regarded as being part of the Bill and the right of that House to debate or to amend the Bill further will not be affected.</p>

<p>When a Bill which originated in the one House, has been amended by the other House, and the Bill is returned for concurrence in the amendments, debate and amendment are strictly confined to the amendments made by the other House. It has therefore been decided that in such cases the Bill will not be reprinted, but a list of the amendments made by the other House will be issued. This procedure has been adopted for the first time in the case of the amendments made by this House to the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Amendment Bill, which originated in the Senate (<i>see</i> B. 47B&#x2014;&#x2019;76).</p>

<p>The proposed changes will not detract from the efficiency of the present system or cause members any inconvenience, while a considerable saving in printing costs will be effected.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the start of my reply to the Second Reading debate on the budget, I feel it to be a privilege and a heart-felt need&#x2014;and I am convinced that here I speak on behalf of everyone in this House&#x2014;to extend a hearty welcome to our greatly respected and popular Prime Minister and his wife, Mrs. Vorster, on their return from their outstandingly successful visit to Israel. Everything we have heard and read about this visit indicates that the hon. the Prime Minister has once again struck a major blow for South Africa and that he has once again shown very clearly the quality of his leadership and statesmanship, not only to his own country, but to the whole world as well. We thank him for this and congratulate him on the exceptional way in which he is carrying out his great and responsible task in the interests of all.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be able to testify that in spite of the increased taxes which had necessarily to be imposed in the budget, this budget has been exceptionally well received. In fact, the most responsible and knowledgeable critics are virtually unanimous in saying that the budget displays the degree of realism and financial insight and discipline which has become so essential in the conditions that prevail throughout the world. This sound grasp and understanding is something to be grateful for. I shall not, of course, read to the House the encouraging letters and other messages I have received in connection with the budget, but, Sir, you will perhaps <span class="col_4995-4996" refersTo="page_1180"/>allow me just to refer, in all modesty, to one telegram, since it is from a person of exceptional standing and experience in the field of state finance. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Veels geluk. U het begroot in die tradisie en met die moed van Havenga en Hofmeyr.</block>

<p>I want to tell the House that, of course, I value that message highly.</p>

<p>I listened carefully to every speech made in the Second Reading Debate and it was clear to me that the hon. speakers in the ranks of the Opposition parties found it somewhat difficult to level any well-founded criticism at the budget. I believe I can substantiate this statement.</p>

<p>By way of introduction I want to remind the House what I said were the main aims of the budget. I said that the aims of the budget were three-fold: Firstly, we had to make sufficient provision for the defence of the country; secondly, we had to maintain our economic preparedness, and in particular secure our balance of payments and contain inflation; and, thirdly, we had to ensure that our economic growth was maintained and that the interests of the lesser privileged people were seen to. I added that it was not easy to reconcile these three aims with each other, but that I believed that the budget maintained the necessary balance as far as possible. I want to emphasize once again that the proposals contained in the budget must be seen against the background of the most serious economic depression since the great depression of the early thirties and also against the background of the most sustained, intentional and, in my opinion, the most unjustified attack on the gold price and on the historical and fundamental role of gold in the international monetary system and system of payments. I say this because after one has listened to the Opposition speakers, one can barely appreciate these facts.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In a few words, what did I have to do in this budget&#x003F; I had to provide adequately&#x2014;that is to say, on a sufficiently large scale&#x2014;for the defence of the Republic and at the same time I had to safeguard the economy. I had to do these things at a time of world depression, world-wide inflation and an unprecedented onslaught on the gold market.</p>

<p>I do not intend saying very much at this moment about gold, except once more to confirm my faith in gold both as a monetary asset, and indeed, as a monetary metal. I believe that when the uncertainty which has been introduced into the world gold market is settled, once we know what precisely the International Monetary Fund intends doing about selling gold, how precisely the mooted auctions are to take place, when they are to start, what the quantities are to be and so forth, gold will once again reassert itself and in the longer term we shall see a recovery in the gold market. I think it is necessary that we should keep a sense of perspective. I made one or two calculations in regard to the funds needed to buy up the International Monetary Fund&#x2019;s gold. They are talking about selling 25 million ounces over four years. If that is done on a regular basis, it might mean approximately 6,5 million ounces per year. The funds required to buy up that quantity of gold are not excessive relative to the financial resources of, for example, the French, the Swiss, the Germans or the funds of the Bank for International Settlements. If you take a price of $135, for example, it will cost about $850 million to absorb the IMF&#x2019;s projected first year&#x2019;s sales, which I am taking as roughly 6,5 million ounces. In that connection I could perhaps just point out that the French and the Italians have reportedly spent far more than $2 billion in support of their own currencies so far this year alone and that these two countries have remaining exchange reserves of something like $4 billion to $5 billion and $0,5 billion respectively.</p>

<p>The Germans and the Swiss together have approximately 30 billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Furthermore, the value of the non-gold assets of the Bank for International Settlements is approximately 14 billion dollars. Therefore, if there is indeed a will to support gold&#x2014;even the American Government has stated that it does not intend to disrupt the world gold market&#x2014;I suggest there is most definitely and most undoubtedly a way to do so in view of the scale of the funds that are available.</p>

<p>Coming to the budget as such, I think one can say that the main thrust of the Opposition&#x2019;s financial criticism really comes down to saying that the economy is not all they would like it to be, that whatever is wrong with the economy can be blamed on the Government and that the budget is going to be inflationary in its effect. I do not propose to spend much <span class="col_4997-4998" refersTo="page_1181"/>time on the first two criticisms I mentioned, although I will come back presently to the sort of attack that is made along the lines that our problems arise largely from our ideologies.</p>

<p>Coming to the criticism that this budget will be inflationary, I must say that I find this one of the most remarkable criticisms that could have been levelled against the budget. One has got to see the budget as a whole. If ever there was a classic case of not seeing the wood for the trees, I think this criticism is such a case. Obviously, we have raised certain excise and sales duties and as a result of that certain prices will increase or have already increased. However, that is just one part of the picture. In so far as that might affect certain individuals and consumers, one regrets it.</p>

<p>But if one looks at the budget as a whole, if one looks at the scale of control of Government spending and the extent to which we are holding the line against an increase in Government spending&#x2014;to the extent that, if defence spending is taken out, there is an increase of only 6% over last year, which is very much less than the rate of inflation alone&#x2014;and if one looks, furthermore, at the way in which this budget&#x2019;s requirements are being financed, viz. substantially non-inflationary, and also at the scale of those requirements, I say that this budget must have an anti-inflationary effect. I was most certainly taken aback at the criticism that this budget was going to be inflationary. The hon. member for Constantia, for example, said this budget would press very hard on many people and that the rise in the cost of living was causing real hardship particularly among the members of our Black population. Yet, according to the latest statistics we have of salaries and wages, for the first three quarters of 1975 the increase in the wages of Blacks in all non-agricultural sectors of the economy was no less than 25%.</p>

<p>The increase was 25%. The hon. member for Johannesburg North came with certain calculations which I found extremely difficult to follow. The fact of the matter is that this is the overall increase for that large group of workers. This increase of 25% is more than double the rate of inflation. I think that serves as a very adequate reply to that particular point.</p>

<p>The Government does have the interest of particularly the less privileged people of this country very much in mind all the time. I think its record proves it. Let us look, for example, at the position of pensioners. We know that many of the pensioners living on fixed incomes are having a hard time of it. It is always like that with inflation. I have some comparative figures here. The old-age pension in April 1947 was exactly R120 per annum, or R10 per month. That was at a time when the Opposition was in Government.</p>

<p>If one compares that with the record of the Opposition as regards pensions, one does not know whether to laugh or to cry. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, another interesting thing that has emerged from the speeches by hon. members of both Opposition parties, is that, when they run into a <i>cul de sac</i> with their arguments, they increasingly and repeatedly fall back on the old cry of the problems that arise in this country, or that they think arise, reputedly due to this Government&#x2019;s ideology. They invariably revert to their old cries, for example that labour is being restricted, that there is job reservation and that there is influx control. On this point, however, they are very careful. The hon. member for Constantia was not so careful on that point a little while ago, but the fact of the matter is that that is the sort of thing that is trotted out.</p>

<p>I would like to ask hon. members opposite whether this Government does not in fact have an overwhelming mandate from the electorate of this country to apply the policies which it is <span class="col_4999-5000" refersTo="page_1182"/>applying in this country today.

In my opinion he ought to give others an opportunity of talking now. He has had his opportunity. I do not think his speech really made a great impact on this House.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the question of education. This Government has instituted compulsory school education for Indians and for Coloureds, something which costs millions of rand. That is ideological expenditure, if you like, but expenditure of which we are very proud. Does the hon. Opposition cavil at that&#x003F; What about that&#x003F; [Interjections.] It is in this budget.

<p>But of course. Mr. Speaker, when one puts the facts to them they realize themselves how completely ridiculous they appear. Thirdly, there is the Government&#x2019;s official policy of narrowing the wage gap among the different national groups. That is costing a great deal of money. It is part of our ideology. Is that something that must be criticized&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course not. The hon. member for Maitland is very quick to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;, because he realizes how sensible it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out that a number of hon. members on the other side have, during the course of this debate, referred to the fact that there was no mention of increased salaries for civil servants. They wanted to know what the position was and why I had not said something about it in my budget speech. The position there is perfectly clear. We are conducting an anti-inflation campaign and we have succeeded in obtaining the co-operation of all sectors of the economy in supporting this very worthwhile objective which, I believe, is paying very worthwhile results. We have never said that we are going to freeze wages and salaries. We have had this matter under constant consideration and I can assure this hon. House that the matter is under consideration by the authorities at this moment. I can also assure this hon. House that there will be an announcement on this important issue quite soon. There is no question, therefore, that this matter is simply being left in abeyance. It is something which the Government is watching, one can almost say, from month to month.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I notice that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South is not here. It is a pity, because I have been wanting to deal with some of the points he made. The fact of the matter is that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South had a good deal to say about the allowances&#x2014;investment allowances, initial allowances, depreciation allowances and such like&#x2014;being granted to manufacturers and asked why farmers were by comparison being treated so badly as regards taxation. Of course, there is nothing of the kind. I think everybody knows that farmers are allowed to write off, against their current incomes, expenditure of a capital nature normally incurred in their farming activities, such as expenditure on farm buildings, dams, pumping plants, fencing and many other things. They can in fact write it off in full. They can write off the full value of that capital expenditure and then, of course, further than that, it is a fact that farmers, if they can put up a case to the Receiver of Revenue, they can in fact ask to be allowed to write off their wear and tear on the basis of the so-called straight-line method. It is a fact that the straight-line method enables you to write off your depreciation more quickly than for instance the diminishing balance method, and you can write it off completely too. That is another very important concession which is made to farmers. The hon. member spoke about farmers having to pay an additional R40 to R400 per month on fuel and he made some very remarkable calculations. He said the cost of production of the farmer had gone up by a minimum of R150 per month as the result of this latest budget. The fact of the matter is of course that we have exempted the farming community from the duty on diesel fuel, which is after all the fuel mainly used by farmers, and <span class="col_5001-5002" refersTo="page_1183"/>it is therefore quite incorrect to say that their additional fuel bill will be between R40 and R400 a month, as the hon. member said. We also exempted them from the duty on power paraffin used for farming purposes. I think it is equally wrong to allege that directly as the result of this budget the farmer&#x2019;s average cost of production will go up by R150 a month, because no sales duty is payable on any agricultural implements, fuel costs will be virtually unchanged, intermediate products should not be more expensive and no tax is payable, under this budget at any rate, on labour, water, electricity and so on.</p>

<p>You know, Sir, the argument which the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South was trying to advance was that the Government was doing very little for agriculture, but I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that direct spending by the Government on various types of expenditure which are of direct benefit to the farmer, are evident when you look at Agricultural Technical Services, Agricultural Economics and Marketing, Agricultural Credit, Water Affairs and the Land Bank, the bulk storage facilities which are allowable under the Land Bank. The amount there is something like R150 million alone in this financial year, and if you look at the amount spent on subsidies in matters relating to them, it comes to over R200 million in the budget we are dealing with. So there alone you have R350 million being spent directly to the benefit of the farming community, and that is quite apart from the advantages they have under the tax laws of this country.</p>

<p>Now, to come very briefly to one or two other criticisms&#x2014;I do not propose to deal with them in too much detail&#x2014;the hon. member for Constantia said that the Minister admitted that Government expenditure was mainly responsible for the growth of the economy last year. Perfectly correct, Sir. If it had not been for the Government&#x2019;s expenditure when things got slack, where would the growth rate have been at the moment&#x003F; The Government did this quite deliberately and a very large part of that expenditure was on essential infrastructure which therefore must be classed as productive expenditure, and the result is to be seen in the development of the economy as a whole. The hon. member also criticized me for the fact that the loan levies carry, according to him, the &#x201C;iniquitous&#x201D; interest rate of only 5%, but the hon. member knows that that is tax free and if he were to look at the various income levels to see what that in fact amounts to he will find that in the case of the top level, R28 000, that 5% becomes an effective interest rate of 18%. But that is the sort of thing that the hon. member left out of account. You can also compare it with other income levels and each time you will have to add to the 5% to obtain the effective rate of interest.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Yeoville. That hon. member started his speech in what I thought was a rather noisy manner. He gave me the impression that he was rather rattled that day. I do not know why. He became very personal although later he seemed to settle down a bit. You know, Sir, on a previous occasion in this House I had the opportunity to draw attention to the sartorial grace of the hon. member for Yeoville, and last night I happened to be reading &#x2026;</p>

There will be opportunities in the discussion of the various Votes in this debate and there will be opportunities in the Third Reading debate, and I want to ask the hon. member to tell the House then exactly what he means by this allegation he levelled against me, of having indulged in window-dressing in this budget. I regard this as a serious attack and I think it is up to the hon. member to tell us exactly what he means. I know of absolutely no window-dressing.

<p>The hon. member also said a rather remarkable thing when he was talking of taxation and the way to finance this budget. You will remember, Sir, that after taking into account loan income and all the income on the existing basis of taxation, I still had to find R953 million. Of that I took R240 million out of the Stabilization Fund and R713 million out of taxation. [Interjections.] Just a minute. May I put my case&#x003F; The hon. member must listen now.

<p>Sir, the hon. member seems to be rather sensitive. He then said: &#x201C;We would not have increased the sales tax except on luxury items&#x201D;, which is a very small part of the sales tax income; &#x201C;we would not have increased the petrol tax or the income tax on companies or the income tax on persons, but would have used the money transferred to the Stabilization Fund and would have borrowed more money overseas.&#x201D; That is how he would have financed that R700 odd million. Sir, it means in fact, if you make a conservative calculation, that the hon. member would then have had to find something like R450 million, which he is not going to raise by means of sales tax, except on luxury items, or on petrol or by direct taxes on companies or persons. So he is going to take out of the Stabilization Fund something like R450 million, plus the R240 million I am drawing from that fund.</p>

<p>If the hon. member asks me a question, he might have the courtesy of allowing me to reply to it. There is a sensitivity about that party today which I think could most probably be due to the effect of their losing their nerve at Durban North. However, we can talk about that later. I have talked to the senior officials of the Department of Finance and the Treasury who were there in 1968 or at any other time, running back many years. Not one of them knows anything at all about an undertaking given by Dr. Diederichs that he would never change the gold tax formula. In any case, how can one Minister of Finance bind his successors into the future&#x003F; I want to add that I have in fact not touched the gold tax formula in this budget.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This is what one is up against. You will remember, Sir, that I said <span class="col_5007-5008" refersTo="page_1186"/>that as far as overseas loans were concerned, there was an amount of R55 million which you might say we had already got. It was there to be drawn on. Then I said that there were renewals of R90 million, loans to be renewed this coming financial year, the year we are now in. Regarding new loans, I said that I budgeted for an extra R175 million. Altogether this amounts to R320 million. The hon. members says, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister has made the assumption that he can only raise a net figure of R120 million overseas.</block>

<p>How on earth does anyone work that out from what I said&#x003F; Each time he criticizes, it is something which is derogatory to the interests of the country. I said we were going to raise R320 million, but the hon. member says I said that I was going to raise only R120 million. In dealing with the increased taxation of the gold mines, which is the one thing that he singled out and is the one thing that really hit him hard&#x2014;this little extra tax on the gold mines&#x2014;he said that this tax on the gold mines would &#x2026;</p>

<p>If I could give the hon. member some quiet advice, I would advise him to go back to his mining community and his mining friends and study the gold tax formula. He will then see that I have not touched it. He says that this increased taxation on the gold mines will have &#x201C;a severe impact on the marginal mines&#x201D;. This, Sir, comes from the director of a very big company in the gold mining industry who ought to know that there is no tax on the marginal mines at all. So what does this mean&#x003F; Just to wind up this matter, and this will be my last example, he said that I said that the provinces were in &#x201C;dire trouble&#x201D; financially. I said nothing of the kind. I want to state that clearly and put the record straight. I never said it. All I said was that I had to reduce the amount of money that would be voted to them, with their approval.</p>

<p>There was another point of criticism made in this debate and that is that there is a creeping socialism setting in in the economy under this Government. I want to refute that criticism for once and for all, because I think it is a mischievous criticism and I do not think that it is based upon the facts. In the first place, it must be noted that there is a world-wide trend towards a relative increase in State activity, in one country after the other. This is presumably so because in times of rising incomes there is an increased preference for goods and services which can only or most advantageously be supplied by the State. There are many reasons for this, but I cannot go into all of them. I think that it is readily understandable that a greater proportion of such increased income should be spent for example on better universities, better schools, better health services, better communications and the like, to say nothing of course of defence and all the requirements that go with defence in the modem day. If you take as a percentage of the gross domestic product, the current expenditure by general government in South Africa&#x2014;this is covering everything&#x2014;it has increased from 9,2% in 1960 to 12,4% in 1970 and to 12,6% in 1974.</p>

<p>I admit it is an increase, an increase from 9,2% to 12,6% over a period of 14 years. However, in judging these figures it must be remembered that the latter figure, 12,6% includes the very steeply increased defence expenditure on the stockpiling of strategic and defence commodities. If allowance is made for these special increases, which are very high today and I do not think I need justify them, there would in fact be little, if any, increase in that percentage at all. Furthermore, as a percentage of total gross domestic investment, the gross domestic investment of public authorities actually declined from 30,4% in 1960 to 29,5% in 1970 and 26,3% in 1975. A similar decline is to be seen in the case of gross domestic fixed investment. I should like to add that it is true that the investment of the public corporations has shown a relative increase. As a percentage of total gross domestic fixed investment the figure for the corporations rose from 6,3% in 1960 to 10,6% in 1970 and to 13,7% in 1974, but this is of course where we are dealing with an absolutely essential infrastructure. We are dealing here with new deep-sea harbours, we are dealing with enormous capital-intensive expansion <span class="col_5009-5010" refersTo="page_1187"/>projects of Iscor and Escom and we shall very soon be seeing sizeable figures coming in the shape of a new Sasol 2. These are projects which we believe are absolutely essential to our future prosperity. If one takes the Department of Statistics&#x2014;I want to quote one last statistic&#x2014;according to the estimates prepared by the Department of Statistics&#x2014;this is on a slightly different basis from those previously mentioned and therefore one cannot simply make a direct comparison, because there are certain allowances and adjustments one has to make&#x2014;the total contribution of the public sector to the gross domestic product increased from 22,8% in 19&#x00A3;P to 23,4% in 1970 and declined again to 22,8% in 1974&#x2014; the same percentage as 14 years earlier. If one takes all these factual things into account and I believe that these figures are extremely relevant to this argument&#x2014;then it cannot be said that allegations of creeping socialism have any foundation in fact in this country.</p>

<p>There was another very strange point that was raised by two or three speakers and I wish to deal with it very briefly. It is the allegation that South Africa ought to be, should be, the workshop of Africa, while allegedly under this Government it is not. If this country is not the workshop of Africa, I would very much like to know what a workshop is and what a workshop of Africa looks like. I have an article here which was written in 1966&#x2014;ten years ago. Since then this country has made enormous strides technologically, industrially, in the mining field, in communications&#x2014;in practically every single field of development. In 1966 an extremely distinguished American writer who is known to be highly intelligent and perceptive, John Davenport, visited this country and had a very good look around. He wrote what I regard to this day to be one of the finest single articles on South Africa that I have seen in many a long day. It appeared in <i>Fortune</i> of December 1966. John Davenport is a completely objective writer. I have met him several times and I have found him a most impressive person. In 1966 he wrote an article on South Africa under the heading &#x201C;The Only Real Industrial Complex South of Milan&#x201D;. He wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Half of all the cars in the entire African continent are registered in that one country&#x2014;South Africa.</block>

<p>He also wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By any standards South Africa&#x2019;s economy is the fastest-growing, the most dynamic and the most fully-rounded on the whole African scene.</block>

<p>He says that there are, of course, breath-taking scenic views and other attractions and to this he adds that a growing volume of Western visitors are attracted who come to view our game parks, dams and irrigation projects which may lift the inhabitants in a more ample way of life. &#x201C;South Africa possesses all these things and a great deal more,&#x201D; he said. He also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a surging half century of development it has become a fully-fledged industrial nation with coal, steel and chemical and manufacturing industries reinforcing each other. Johannesburg, a city built on the piled-up takings of gold mines, is not yet the Ruhr, but as an American businessman in that city recently remarked to me, looking out of his window at twilight, this is indeed the only real industrial complex south of Milan.</block>

<p>Davenport then says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Compared with the vast expanses that lie between it and Europe &#x2026;</block>

<p>He is now looking at the whole African continent&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; South Africa is economically of an altogether different order. Its gross product last year &#x2026;</block>

<p>He is referring to 1965&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; ran to $10&#x00BD; billion, a figure that might be within the margin or error for measuring the output of the United States, but in average income per capita it leads all other African nations by a wide margin. It is equipped with half the continent&#x2019;s telephones, it generates more than half of its total electric power and it operates one third of its rail transport system. With only 6% of Africa&#x2019;s total population and 4% of its land area, South Africa creates some 25% of the continent&#x2019;s product and some 40% of its industrial output.</block>

<p><span class="col_5011-5012" refersTo="page_1188"/>So one can go into the details set out here. One comes to one clear conclusion, namely that if there is one country on this continent that can be called a workshop of the continent, this must be South Africa.</p>

<p>To give the hon. members an indication of how we have developed in the ten years since 1966, I would like to point out that our gross domestic product per capita increased tremendously; and here we have to take into account our population, which is growing at one of the fastest rates in the world. I have the latest statistics which the World Bank has issued on population and national income. Out of 126 nations we are among the seven with the highest population increase. This, of course, makes things very difficult as far as per capita average income is concerned. But despite this our gross domestic product per capita of the whole population increased from R413 in 1966 to R978 in 1975. I think that we can take it in all fairness that it will top R1 000 per head of the whole population, of all national groups, man, woman and child, this year. The only other country in Africa that can come anywhere near us is Libya, whose whole economy is based on oil. They have vast oilfields. That is the extent to which our economy has grown and we can see it by looking at a single index over ten years. If, then, the position was as Davenport put it ten years ago, how much more would that be the position today&#x003F; We are indeed the workshop of this great continent.</p>

<p>Before I conclude I do want to refer to what I thought was an extremely unfortunate speech in this debate, the speech of the hon. member for Sea Point. Why the hon. member for Sea Point should have chosen this opportunity again to speak in such denigrating terms of his own country is something which I have ceased trying to understand. Sir, you will remember how, when speaking of communism and apartheid, he said, &#x201C;Hulle is twee perde van dieselfde stal.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I just want to point out that the hon. member withdrew those words.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, but, with great respect, I should like to make this point, because you did say a little later that you wanted &#x201C;to give the hon. member an opportunity to put his case and that the hon. member who followed him, or another hon. member, could then reply and state the other side of the argument&#x201D;. I regard this as so important that I hope you will allow me to say something in this regard. Although the hon. member withdrew the statement that apartheid and communism were &#x201C;perde van dieselfde stal&#x201D;, he also said this: &#x201C;Ek verkies nie die kommunisme nie en ek verkies nie totalitarianisme nie &#x2026;&#x201D; That was after he had referred to &#x201C;apartheid en kommunisme&#x201D;. He said further: &#x201C;To apply either of them involves totalitarianism and authoritarianism&#x201D;. That is what is worrying me, Sir. I accept your ruling and I shall not refer now to apartheid and communism being &#x201C;perde van dieselfde stal&#x201D;, but this further attack, that they both involve totalitarianism and authoritarianism, is just as serious and I shall try to show why. Today, when you talk of totalitarianism, you clearly mean communism. There were, some years ago, three forms of totalitarianism, namely Fascism, Nazism and Communism. The first two are no longer talked about and they do not really exist in practice, but communism exists, and if you say today that a certain ideology or policy involves totalitarianism, you can only mean that it involves communism.

Mr. Speaker, I make the statement that when he says that this policy of ours is a question of totalitarianism, he is saying an extremely grave thing, and something which cannot be justified, because he knows as well as I do that there is no freer Press in the whole of Africa and, indeed, probably in virtually the whole of the world, than the South African Press at this moment. That has been attested to by people from outside who are not particularly sympathetic to the South African Government. We have a judiciary which is the envy of the world. No one can deny that fact.

<p>The hon. member for Constantia was the first speaker after the introduction of the budget, so I shall refer to him briefly in conclusion. The hon. member for Constantia likened me to a medical doctor ministering to an alleged very sick patient, the patient being the South Africa economy. If I were a doctor, all I can say is that if all my patients were as healthy and full of life as the body economic in the Republic today, I would very soon be out of a job. However, I should like to extend the metaphor. If the hon. member for Constantia would for one moment see himself in the role of an undertaker&#x2014;and I think his doleful and very sad contribution to this debate might justify that view&#x2014;an undertaker dependent upon the demise of his patient, i.e. the South African economy, a strong and healthy economy, he would realize that he would be out of a job even sooner than I would.</p>

<p><span class="col_5015-5016" refersTo="page_1190"/>*In conclusion, I just want to point out that there will be problems in future, in the uncertain world in which we are living. However, we have much to be grateful for; as a matter of fact, more reason to be grateful than almost any other country in the world I know of. Provided each one of us in the public as well as in the private sector exercises the necessary restraint, especially in respect of spending and wages and salaries, and provided we are prepared to work hard and by so doing ensure that production and productivity increase, I have no doubt that a golden future awaits our country and all its people.</p>

<heading>MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN AFRICA BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate on this <span class="col_5017-5018" refersTo="page_1191"/>Bill was interrupted on 9 April I was indicating briefly why the Opposition&#x2019;s amendment was not acceptable to us. Therefore I need not go into the question of the amendment any further now; it would be an unnecessary repetition.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to certain points raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville. He said that his party had no objection to this proposed new university, Medunsa. That is an attitude which I welcome. He motivated his standpoint by also emphasizing that there was a great need for more doctors among the Black people. Unfortunately the hon. member then raised a small matter which, even with your permission, I cannot go into any further, Mr. Speaker. He referred to the alleged closing of the medical faculty of the University of Natal. No provision in this Bill refers to that in any way. Consequently I shall not elaborate on it. I want to content myself by saying only that the training of Bantu students at the medical school of the University of Natal is not being summarily discontinued. That institution will continue to train Bantu medical practitioners for several years. As far as Indian and Coloured students at the medical faculty of the University of Natal are concerned, I shall make no comment at this stage. The hon. member for Rosettenville also asked what students would be trained by that faculty in future. The hon. member will realize, that I cannot reply to that question at this juncture. As is already the case, the matter will nevertheless receive the necessary attention from this Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member alleged that the Government, and I as Minister, did not want the said medical school in a White area. On a subsequent occasion he even asked why the Government had not thought of linking the envisaged medical training centre with the large Bantu hospital at Baragwanath, outside Johannesburg. Although the hon. member does not support the policy of the Government, surely he is acquainted with it. After all, he has come to know it here over the years. In consultation with the other three universities for Bantu in South Africa the foundation has already been laid for the establishment of this medical university. It will be a university which, like many other institutions, will be regarded by the Government as being a very important stimulus and a body of which it will be possible for the Bantu people of South Africa to be justifiably proud. This institution will stimulate development. This applies to spiritual development, as well as to development in the sphere of health and economy. This is already the reason why the Government is establishing as many institutions as possible&#x2014;and these also include the contemplated medical university&#x2014;in the Bantu homelands. As a member who has been sitting in this House for many years and as a person who pays thorough attention to his work, the hon. member for Rosettenville ought to realize that the policy of this Government is in fact a policy of nation-building. In terms of this Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development all the Black nations of South Africa must ultimately be able to provide their own services in all spheres of their national life. If possible they must ensure that their services are provided by their own people. That is why the Government is trying to stimulate the nationally orientated development of the Bantu in commerce, mining, industry, agriculture and all other spheres, and is trying to make them nationally orientated. I hasten to add that the ideal situation would be to make an immediate start with a medical school, or even a university, for each separate Bantu nation.</p>

<p>However, Rome was not built in a day. Surely we all know that. But we are working in a specific direction and that is why we are able, at this juncture already, to express our gratitude at being able to make a start with nation-building as far as medical training and particularly as far as veterinary science and dentistry are concerned, two spheres in which nothing whatsoever has as yet been done for the Bantu nations of South Africa. In these spheres the Government is therefore able to begin to establish something specific in which the Bantu are able to share on an organizational as well as participatory level from the outset.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Rosettenville will understand the situation better now. It is for that reason that the Government will not want to consider linking this contemplated institution with a hospital, for example the hospital at Baragwanath. If the contemplated university were to be linked with the hospital at Baragwanath, the question arises whether the hon. member would want the institution to be an independent university, as will be the case in terms of this legislation, or whether he <span class="col_5019-5020" refersTo="page_1192"/>would want the institution to be merely a branch of the university of the Witwatersrand or of RAU.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>It could be either.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It could be either. I know that the hon. member for Mooi River would say that. But I wonder whether the hon. member could tell me what sense there would be in closing the medical faculty of the University of Natal and transferring its functions and activities to the University of the Witwatersrand. Surely there would be no sense in doing that. However, there is sense in allowing a medical faculty for the Bantu peoples to begin in embryo, for all of them at the same time, and in due course allowing it to develop into faculties and institutions for all the various Bantu nations, as such a development can be justified. I have already gone into this in my introductory speech.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked&#x2014;and it was a very fair question&#x2014;whether the Medical Council was consulted in this matter. The Medical Council&#x2014;and the hon. member, being a medical practitioner, might be even better aware of this than I am&#x2014;must not be asked whether another institution is necessary, and the hon. member did not say that either.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member did not say it. It is not for the Medical Council to say whether an additional institution like this is necessary, but the Medical Council must be consulted with regard to recognition for the training of doctors and others at these faculties, and that we will do at the appropriate time. It is not right to do it before we have the framework, viz. the necessary legislation.</p>

<p>*At the appropriate time we shall consult the Medical Council fully on this matter. In any event, we know very well what the recognized criteria and requirements of the Medical Council in this regard are, and we are being advised and guided in this matter, by some of the best members of the Medical Council itself, by experts from the two universities of Pretoria and Witwatersrand, as I have already said when I introduced the Bill. The hon. member asked what Pretoria has to say about the fact that this new institution will train veterinarians. Sir, Pretoria welcomes it, to such an extent that the dean of the faculty of veterinary science at Onderstepoort, the head of Onderstepoort, is serving on the committee which is assisting us with our preparations for this new institution. He and others are helping with it. Therefore, Pretoria welcomes it fully. The hon. member also asked what the other universities have to say. He said that we did not consult the universities in regard to this matter. May I remind the hon. member, for it seems to me he was not listening when I said this in my Second Reading speech, that I mentioned two universities specifically, and I have mentioned them again today: The Universities of Pretoria and of the Witwatersrand. These are the two universities in that vicinity which are able to assist us with this new university in practice&#x2014;not theoretically, but in practice. We wrote to them and we received letters from them in which they welcomed these plans of ours. The University of the Witwatersrand consented to its dean of medicine and its dean of dentistry&#x2014;I do not want to mention the names of these persons&#x2014; serving on the committee, and the same applies to Pretoria. The deans of medicine, of dentistry and of veterinary science are serving on the committee in order to be of assistance to us. Several meetings have already been held, and all five of them have already rendered very valuable services.</p>

<p>We informed both these universities that we do not only want assistance from them now, in the preparatory phase only, by helping us to consider the building plans and courses and all that preparatory work; we also told them that we should very much like to have their patronage, their protection and assistance once the institution is functioning, and for that reason we hope that we shall be able to succeed&#x2014;and I think this will happen&#x2014;in getting some of the lecturers of these two universities to be of very practical assistance to us at the outset perhaps with syllabuses and the maintenance of standards for internal and external examinations and also with the teaching at this new university. We have received indications from both these universities <span class="col_5021-5022" refersTo="page_1193"/>that they should like to do so. The hon. member will understand that it is unpractical to speak of a distant university such as Cape Town or Stellenbosch because they are too far to be conveniently involved, but distant universities such as Stellenbosch and Cape Town will certainly still be approached to be of assistance to us in other ways, for example by nominating people to the senate of this university for the sake of the standards, as is being provided for in this Bill. In this respect we shall make use of the other universities. In fact, we received a very fine offer only a few weeks ago from the head of all the universities, Prof. Marais of Port Elizabeth, who was with us here in Cape Town and indicated that the Committee of University Principals as a whole wished to be of assistance in the establishment of this new undertaking. In fact, his offer does not apply only in this respect, but to other university work as well. Sir, I am looking forward to a period of very sound and fruitful and, may I say, very necessary assistance from the other universities in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member let the cat out of the bag little by asking that all non-Whites should remain in the medical faculty of Natal University, and that in addition Whites should also be admitted. But that is not relevant here. However, Sir, the cat is out of the bag. The hon. member had political objectives with what he said in regard to university training. The hon. member for Edenvale, I think it was, also referred to that. Perhaps I am doing the hon. member for Edenvale an injustice and this point was also made by the hon. member for Rosettenville, namely that the other White universities should preferably all admit non-Whites, and that the permit system should be abolished. This is still the same political motivation which the hon. members had years ago and which they still have and through which they reveal no understanding of the intrinsic value of and the recognition which there should be for each of the Bantu nations, i.e. that they should receive their own medical training, should develop their own economies and their own agriculture, etc., as befits any nation in the world which desires to be independent. That is what we are doing here, but the hon. member loses sight of it completely. Now, the hon. member has asked what ethnic groups were consulted, and what their reaction was. The hon. member for Edenvale also put a question in this regard. We made a formal approach to all the Bantu homeland governments and put the whole matter to them in principle and explained it to them down to the minutest detail, and we provided them with this Bill at an early stage, and I may say that each of these Bantu homeland governments welcomed this new university institution for medical training. All of them, without exception, welcomed it. A single homeland said that it would be a pity if Black people could not continue to be trained in Natal as well, but apart from that all of them welcomed this new institution. The hon. member for Edenvale complained that I had not mentioned this in my introductory speech. Well, I could perhaps have said something about it, but surely it goes without saying that we always consult the Bantu Governments when we introduce legislation which affects their people here. We do this as a standing rule. But I owe him a vote of thanks for having raised this small point, for perhaps more justice is being done to this matter now than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>What about the name of this university&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. That is my next point. The hon. member for Rosettenville said that the name of this institution was a &#x201C;misnomer&#x201D;, but floundered about to such an extent that I could not understand very clearly what he was actually trying to say. He asked whether we had consulted the other universities about the name. Sir, I do not know where anything of this nature is done, i.e. that everyone a should be consulted about a name. But there was in fact considerable discussion concerning the name in the circles in which the Bill was prepared. We discussed it and we decided that the name should be &#x201C;the Medical University of Southern Africa&#x201D;. If the hon. member goes back to the original Greek meaning of the word &#x201C;medical&#x201D; he will find that the word &#x201C;medical&#x201D; has a very wide meaning, much wider than &#x201C;human medicine&#x201D;. &#x201C;Medical&#x201D; includes everything. Therefore we decided that it should be the &#x201C;Medical University of Southern Africa&#x201D;. We said &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; specifically because the impression should not be created that it will in a narrower sense be for the Republic of South Africa only. We <span class="col_5023-5024" refersTo="page_1194"/>are prepared to render this service in a wider sense. With this name we touch upon the two essential elements of such a university institution. The first is that we call it a &#x201C;university&#x201D; not a &#x201C;medical school&#x201D;. According to our South African view a medical school is a branch of a large, existing university. However, one finds universities abroad, and particularly on the Continent of Europe&#x2014;I have seen them myself&#x2014;which are medical universities only and which are universities for veterinary science only. Therefore we are not engaged in anything unique here in South Africa. In South Africa it is in fact unique, but not in terms of what one sees overseas. We are describing this institution as a university to demonstrate that the quality of its work will be of university level. Secondly, we are offering it a wide scope for its service by saying &#x201C;of Southern Africa&#x201D;. We are prepared to enrol people from beyond the borders of South Africa at this university, under certain conditions and circumstances of course. The hon. member would perhaps be pleased to hear that at present there are 24 or 25 students from other Black states in Southern Africa who are already studying at one of the three non-White universities which we have. We therefore allow them to be admitted here; this has been the case for years. Therefore we do not want the narrow connotation here that it will be for the Republic only. The hon. member must also realize that some of our Bantu homelands&#x2014; one very soon perhaps&#x2014;is going to fall outside the constitutional scope of the Republic of South Africa. It must still be possible for that homeland, the Transkei, as well as any other which is going to become independent, to continue to be served by this University of Southern Africa. That is why I think it is a very appropriate name.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that he did not like the ministerial control for which provision is being made throughout this Bill. I do not know whether the hon. member has compared this Bill thoroughly with the other legislation i.e. that of Fort Hare, that of the North and that of Zululand. If the hon. member had done that, he would have noticed that the role of the Government in those laws is prominent, but is merely worded differently. In this Bill we state, <i>inter alia,</i> that the rector is appointed by the Council with the concurrence of the Minister. In other words, the initiative, the main thrust of the action which is required, is entrusted to the Council and the concurrence of the Minister is requested, while the pattern in the other three Acts is that the Minister shall fill this post, the Minister shall approve of that, and the Minister shall do the other. We shall in the course of time, and I hope very soon, effect changes in this regard in the legislation of the three other universities. That is why we have devised the pattern as it is in this Bill. I think the hon. member will admit that since we are dealing with such a university as this one, which is in every respect dependent on the State for its finances, the State should at least have a firm say in the important matters&#x2014;and finances are probably one of the most important. If the hon. member were to make a study of overseas universities&#x2014;particularly on the Continent of Europe&#x2014;he would discover that many universities are out and out State universities. Every professor is appointed by the Minister, every administrative head is appointed by the Minister and the Estimates are approved by the Minister. Such things do not occur in our pattern at all. In other words, this university has something in it of those elements which one finds in State universities, but it is by no means as drastic as the hon. member might wish to imply with the question he asked.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Edenvale also raised a few points. I have already dealt with several of them in passing. For example: I have already discussed the homelands as a whole and stated that their reaction was positive. The hon. member discussed the institution in Natal because the Chair graciously permitted him to do so. However, he did not present his figures entirely correctly. The hon. member went according to figures which had not been calculated entirely correctly. Or let me rather say that he had in fact calculated correctly but on a much lower and simpler level than he should have done. The hon. member mentioned the figure of 100 or 160, and included in that all three non-White groups. The calculation should, however, have been based on the calculation which is made for this institution, namely a second year intake of 200&#x2014;all of them Bantu. The hon. member therefore approached the two sets of figures which he compared on different bases. The calculated figure which we have, was an official calculation made by the department concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked a strange question, and he will not take it amiss of me if, to his <span class="col_5025-5026" refersTo="page_1195"/>disgrace, I have to set him straight. He asked his question with reference to an observation made by my hon. friend, the hon. member for Lydenburg, when he referred to the need to draw the staff and students of the universities from a single ethnic group, which he had quite justifiably held up as a good criterion or objective. The hon. member for Edenvale then asked what the Government would have done if Natal, for example, had wanted to appoint non-Whites to the staff of the medical faculty at Wentworth. Apparently the hon. member is not aware that three have already been appointed, and that the Government has approved of this. Three Black medical practitioners as lecturers, have already been appointed in Natal, and the Minister concerned approved of the appointments. The hon. member was probably not aware of this. We know that the hon. member for Edenvale knows a great deal, but he does not know everything.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of land ownership. It is true that the Trust, although it may do so, is not supposed, as the hon. member said, to own land for perpetuity in a White area. It is not correct to say that the Trust owns land in the White area; the Trust does in fact own land in released areas. For all technical purposes released areas are no longer White areas. The hon. member must realize&#x2014;and this is stated in the relevant clauses of the Bill&#x2014;that the university possesses full-fledged juristic personality and that the university itself may own the land. Therefore there is nothing to prevent the Trust from transferring all the land of the university and the hospital to the university, which possesses such juristic capability at a given juncture. This is entirely possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member objected to the racial exclusiveness of the university. The hon. member is very race-obsessed. He was not always this way inclined. If one examines his previous writings, one will see that he was not always this way inclined. Of course, he became this way inclined since he came under the influence of the race-obsessed United Party. The United Party is very race-obsessed.</p>

<p>Yes, the United Party is race-obsessed. Even their policy is called a race federation. They engage in politics for all the Black people as though all of them, the seventeen to eighteen million of them, were a homogeneous group. The politics of the Government, on th other hand is not based on race, but the politics of the United Party is. Our politics is based on a national concept. That is why we distinguish between the various nations which exist. Our policy is based on anthropology. It is beyond comprehension that a former anthropologist like the hon. member for Edenvale cannot grasp this, but should refer to racial exclusiveness. I accept that it is the new atmosphere in which the hon. member finds himself which causes him to utter such statements. It is a great tragedy.</p>

<p>I think that I have now gone into all the important points of the Bill. I should like to thank hon. members for their support. It is perhaps very significant&#x2014;and perhaps I should place my gratitude in this regard on record once again&#x2014;that we heard nothing whatever from the PRP in regard to this matter.

<p>I do this at the request of my colleague, the Minister of Defence and Leader of the House, who, unfortunately, could not be present today, but, fortunately, will be here soon. This Bill is a non-contentious measure and is the result of representations made by judges of the Supreme Court of South Africa to the Department of Justice to the effect that they, too, be admitted to some medical aid scheme. As hon. members probably know, members of Parliament and of the provincial councils are not public servants and neither, of course, are judges. Accordingly they cannot become members of the Public Service Medical Aid Association. On investigation it became clear that Panned, the medical aid scheme for members of Parliament and members of the provincial councils, was the most suitable scheme to which judges, too, could be admitted. After the management committee of Panned had given this matter their due consideration, it was decided to recommend at the annual general meeting of Panned that judges be admitted to the scheme. The annual general meeting approved this admission. As a result, the existing Act is being amended to make membership of Panned compulsory for judges in office on a permanent basis.</p>

<p>Clause 21:</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate I mentioned the question of inspectors to the hon. the Minister. I notice from the way this particular clause is worded at present, that inspectors will be authorized by the corporation in writing, to do certain things. In terms of the Radio Act they are entitled to question radio dealers and to <span class="col_5029-5030" refersTo="page_1197"/>enter upon any land. They have fairly broad powers, which are clearly set out in this particular clause. It would seem to me as if there is an omission here, as there has been in many pieces of legislation in the past, something which, on the other hand, has not been omitted from some pieces of legislation which has been passed during this session. I refer to the fact that although the inspector is authorized by the corporation in writing, it is not stipulated in this clause that the inspector shall produce his authorization to the person, organization or body which he is inspecting.</p>

<p>I realize that in clause 28, the offences clause, there is a particular provision which reads, &#x201C; &#x2026; after an inspector has produced his written authority referred to in section 21 to such person &#x2026;&#x201D;, but as I read this clause, it deals merely with a situation where an offence has been committed. In clause 21, however, there appears to be no provision whatsoever for anyone who is being inspected, to question or to be enabled to establish the <i>bona fides</i> of the inspector by asking him to show his letter of authority. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that perhaps in the Other Place he will accept some sort of amendment which will not only regularize this position in so far as other legislation is concerned, but which will also take it a step further, to ensure that the public themselves are protected by stating also that the inspector shall be issued with a certificate which he shall present before undertaking any inspection in terms of the powers conferred on him by clause 21. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to do this. I believe that it will make for better legislation and that it will bring this legislation into line with other legislation. If the hon. the Minister wishes me to repeat the list, which is a growing list, of Acts in which this principle has been accepted, I shall willingly do so, but I think I have made my point.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the idea is as the hon. member for Berea has just put it. A person will not allow an inspector to have access to premises if he cannot furnish the necessary evidence that he is entitled to do the work of an inspector. It is the intention of this clause that he should have that authorization and should have a document at his disposal and should produce it. Therefore, I will agree to the hon. member&#x2019;s request and have inquiries made in this regard. If it should be necessary to effect an amendment to bring the posit on into line with the other Acts to which he referred, I shall do so with great pleasure in the Cther Place. I thank him for his contribution.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister for his sympathetic consideration of this point. I should like to take this a step further by asking him to see whether it is possible for this legislation to be brought into line with the present tendency, that an inspector shall produce his authority not on demand, but before he carries out any functions in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 23:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause empowers the corporation to make certain regulations. In replying to the Second Reading debate, the hon. the Minister did not react to the remarks and submissions which were made by the hon. member for Durban Central. Unfortunately the hon. member for Durban Central is not here today, and I must apologize for his absence. The problem which the hon. member for Durban Central referred to is that although certain of the regulations which the corporation may make, namely those in terms of subsection (1)(a), (b) and (c), which relate to licences, the payment of fees and exemptions, are subject to the Minister&#x2019;s approval, the actual regulation-making is to be done by the corporation. I am aware of section 17 of the Interpretation Act of 1957, which states that when the State President or a Minister is by any law authorized to make rules or regulations for any purpose in such law stated, copies of such rules and regulations shall be laid upon the Tables of both Houses of Parliament within a certain period, but that does not apply, in terms of the interpretation I have of this clause, to regulations made by the corporation, the corporation being neither in the position of the State President nor in the position of a Minister. That being so, it seems that unless this clause is amended, the corporation will be in a privileged position in relation to the position in which the State President or the Minister find themselves. It is <span class="col_5031-5032" refersTo="page_1198"/>I believe, in any event necessary to contain not only the first portion of the amendment on the Order Paper &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Chairman. I move the amendment to clause 23 standing in the name of the hon. member for Durban Central on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 21, to add the following subsections at the end of the Clause:</block>

<ol>

<li>(5) Any regulations made under subsection (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) shall be laid on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament within 14 days after promulgation thereof if Parliament is then in ordinary session, or if Parliament is not then in ordinary session, within 14 days after the commencement of its next ensuing ordinary session, and shall remain on the said Tables for at least 28 consecutive days, and if Parliament is prorogued before the necessary 28 days have elapsed such regulations shall again be laid on the said Tables as aforesaid within 14 days after the commencement of its next ensuing ordinary session.</li>

<li>(6) If both Houses of Parliament by resolution passed in the same session (being a session during which such regulations have been laid on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament in terms of subsection (5) disapprove of any such regulations or of any provision thereof, such regulations or such provision thereof shall thereafter cease to be of force and effect to the extent to which they are so disapproved, but without prejudice to the validity of anything done in terms of such regulations or of such provision thereof up to the date upon which they so ceased to be of force and effect, or to any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred as at the said date under and by virtue of such regulations or such provision thereof.</li>

</ol>

<p>The proposed subsection (5) regularises the position, since in terms of the Interpretation act rules and regulations should be tabled. The proposed subsection (6) affords Parliament the further right to take into review any by resolution to amend any of those regulations.</p>

<p>In reply to the Second Reading debate, the hon. the Minister undertook to lay all his cards on the table with reference to the SABC, SATV and this House. He undertook to give us a new experience of what a Minister could do who is in charge of this corporation. He said he had no intention of shrinking away from a single question that might be put to him in regard to the activities of the corporation, and I would therefore suggest that if regulations made by the State President under the Radio Act, which remains, are subject to this form of publication, i.e. being laid upon the Table, with this enacted right of Parliament, there can be no reason whatsoever why the hon. the Minister should not accept that a similar provision should apply in the Bill before us with regard to regulations made by the corporation. I therefore hope he will accept this amendment and allow it to go on to the Statute Book.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think there is a misunderstanding somewhere along the line about this particular clause and this amendment. If I am correct, I hope the hon. Opposition will see my point. I stick to what I said; I shall do everything in my power to prove that I mean to put all my cards on the table in all circumstances.</p>

<p>I first of all want to refer the hon. member for Green Point to clause 23(4) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A regulation made under subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) shall not be valid unless it was approved by the Minister.</block>

<p>In other words, it is very clear that no regulation can be promulgated without the permission of the Minister of National Education. That is very clear from clause 23(4).</p>

<p>*This is the first point which I want to put to the hon. member. I do not want there to be any misunderstanding about this matter, because I think that is quite unnecessary. Furthermore, I should like to draw the attention of the hon. member to the fact that section 16 of the <span class="col_5033-5034" refersTo="page_1199"/>Interpretation Act (No. 33 of 1957), reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Certain enactments to be published in</i> Gazette.&#x2014;When any by-law, regulation, rule or order is authorized by any law to be made by the State President, an Administrator or a Minister, or by any local authority, public body or person, with the approval of the State President, an Administrator or a Minister, such by-law, regulation, rule or order shall, &#x2026;</block>

<p>I emphasize the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; which suggests an obligation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; subject to the provisions relative to the force and effect thereof in any law, be published in the <i>Gazette.</i></block>

<p>In other words, section 16 of the Interpretation Act imposes an obligation. It does not merely state that this &#x201C;can&#x201D; or &#x201C;may&#x201D; happen, or that it is necessary in certain cases. Regulations made under clause 23 of this legislation, <i>shall</i> in all cases be published in the <i>Gazette.</i> Now I want to quote section 17 of the Interpretation Act, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the State President or a Minister is by any law authorized to make rules or regulations for any purpose in such law stated, notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, a list of the proclamations and government notices under which such rules or regulations were published in the <i>Gazette</i> during the period covered in the list, stating in each case the number, date and title of the proclamation or Government notice and the number and date of the <i>Gazette</i> in which it was published, <i>shall</i> be laid upon the Table in the Senate and in the House of Assembly within 14 days after the publication of the rules or regulations in the <i>Gazette,</i> if Parliament is then in session, or if Parliament is not then in session, within 14 days after the commencement of its next ensuing session.</block>

<p>The Minister of National Education is therefore obliged to publish it in the <i>Gazette</i> and to lay it upon the Table in Parliament. I have discussed this matter at length with the law advisers and they have informed me that I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Green Point. I have just given the reason for my being unable to do so. If there is still reason for misunderstanding in spite of this, I must point out that when the regulations are laid upon the Table in Parliament in terms of the provisions of the Bill, a member may put questions about them and the matter about which he put questions may be raised during the discussion of the Vote concerned. I hope that the hon. member understands the position. As he knows, I am not an unapproachable person and I would very much have liked to accommodate in this regard, but this is the legal position as the law advisers have put it to me and as a result I cannot see the necessity of accepting the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with all respect towards the law advisers, I cannot agree with the argument which has just been advanced by the hon. Minister. In the first place, section 16 of the Interpretation Act relates to regulations made by an organization.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Section 16 therefore provides merely for a notice to be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> containing regulations made by some subordinate body with the approval of a Minister or Administrator. In other words, section 16 highlights the fact that where a provision exists, as is contained in clause 23, that an organization may make regulations, certain of which will be subject to the approval of a Minister, the Minister is not the originating authority for those regulations. The Minister cannot make regulations; he only has the right to veto regulations, if he so desires, which the corporation may make.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I have to approve them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister should read clause 23 which provides that the corporation makes the regulations, certain of which require the approval of the Minister. The Minister therefore cannot initiate regulations; he has no power whatsoever to go to the board of the corporation with the instruction that it introduce a regulation to provide for certain issues. That is my problem. The power to make regulations is vested in the corporation and the corporation has to publish such regulations in the <i>Government Gazette</i> for <span class="col_5035-5036" refersTo="page_1200"/>general information. This is the position in so far as section 16 is concerned.</p>

<p>Section 17 of the Interpretation Act deals with the procedure to be followed when an officer of the Government or of Parliament does something. The provisions of the section are therefore applicable to the State President or Ministers. If the State President or a Minister makes a regulation, the regulation must be laid upon the Table because it affects Parliament. It affects the functioning of Parliament through one of the arms of the law-making process which Parliament has. That is why regard must be had to section 17. If the argument of the hon. the Minister is correct, section 17 of the Interpretation Act serves no purpose at all. What is of the utmost importance is that the corporation has a monopoly and is empowered to enter into the home of anybody who possesses a receiving set. Furthermore the corporation is empowered to make certain regulations but the Bill contains no provision to empower Parliament to take cognizance of the regulations which the corporation makes. There ought to be provisions which will make it compulsory that those regulations be laid upon the Table so that the time-honoured procedure which makes it possible for both Houses of Parliament to pass a resolution rejecting a regulation or commenting thereon, can be utilized. I believe there is substance in the argument I have put forward. I appreciate that the hon. the Minister is acting on the advice of the law advisers. However, following the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own approach of playing open cards in regard to this matter, I am sure if the State President is required to do what is stated in my amendment under the Radio Act, there is absolutely no reason why the corporation should not be obliged to do the same thing under the Broadcasting Act.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to support the hon. member for Green Point. I have found that when lawyers start arguing, it takes a sea-lawyer or a layman to settle the problem. I do not want to get mixed up with legal jargon, but I can understand words. Subsection (4), to which the hon. the Minister has referred states that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A regulation made under subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) shall not be valid unless approved &#x2026;</block>

<p>If one looks at paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (1), one will find that they cover the fees payable, the conditions subject to which licences may be issued and the exemption or granting of exemption from any obligations respectively. However, none of the other matters concerned here are covered by this. Subsection (4) does not cover subsection (1)(d) concerning &#x201C;the exemption or the granting of exemption to any person who, in terms of any television licence &#x2026; is entitled to use a television set in a particular place &#x2026;&#x201D; etc., nor does it cover paragraphs (e) and (f) of subsection (1) or subsection (2) concerning the different categories of fees that may be prescribed. None of those matters require the approval of the Minister. Therefore it is not correct that the Minister must approve the regulations. In terms of the interpretation dealt with by the hon. member for Green Point, the approval of the regulations that may be made does not even require to be tabled. Only when regulations are actually made by the State President or a Minister, must they be tabled. Specifically and by design, organizations are excluded from this measure. Only in terms of section 16 is an organization required to publish certain information in the <i>Gazette.</i> However, organizations are specifically excluded from section 17. It is only the State President and the Minister who have to table the regulations they make. What we are aiming at is that Parliament, which is the ultimate authority, and the Minister himself should have knowledge of this; they should receive the information and, have authority if necessary, to make alterations. Unless such matters come to Parliament, the Minister has no say because he cannot interfere except in regard to the matters contained in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (1). He cannot interfere with regulations made in regard to the matters stipulated in the other paragraphs. We are, in fact, trying to protect the hon. the Minister from any capricious act of the corporation. In terms of our amendment these matters would come to Parliament and be tabled so that, if something was done that could be regarded as capricious and unreasonable, Parliament could correct it and could protect the Minister against an act of his own corporation. [Interjections.] Parliament would have to have the right to approve, amend or reject. If the hon. the Minister or Parliament did not like something, it could amend it. <span class="col_5037-5038" refersTo="page_1201"/>Unless it comes to Parliament, the hon. the Minister will have no control or say at all other than in regard to the matters contained in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (1). If this is as clear as daylight to a layman, should we allow ourselves to be involved in legal quibbles between the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s advisers and people in the legal profession&#x003F; Should not we as laymen make things clear enough for Parliament to understand what it is enacting, and for the people who will be subject to this to understand it as well&#x003F; However, if legal people do not understand it, how on earth will the public understand it&#x003F; Surely, we must be reasonable. If lawyers are arguing over it, the poor public will have absolutely no concept of what legislation we are passing. Let us therefore make it so clear that, as my hon. friend says, even a farmer will understand it. [Interjections.] I speak as an ex-farmer. Let us put it so clearly that everyone will be able to understand it. Let us make it clear that regulations must be tabled in this House.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to repeat everything I have already said, but I do want to point out that it is quite unnecessary to argue about this matter in this way yet again. A senior official of the Post Office has informed me that as far as he can remember there has been no real discussion or debate since 1952&#x2014;and now hon. members must remember that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point, comes from the old Radio Act, word for word&#x2014;for carrying into effect what is proposed in this amendment. For the very reason that it has become apparent that this wording has become archaic over the years, the law advisers believe that it is not necessary to include it as a provision in the new legislation. As I have said at the beginning, the intention is to round off and to modernize this legislation as far as possible. According to information which I have obtained from the law advisers, it would be a retrogressive step if this amendment were to be accepted in its present form. It would mean that we would be introducing a provision from the old Radio Act directly into the new legislation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to assure hon. members that a regulation of this nature is drawn up in close consultation with the Minister concerned and his department. I repeat that I shall not give my approval to regulations which in my opinion will not be in the interests of all. I do not want to go into details once again, but want to emphasize once again that hon. members of this House will have the opportunity to put questions in connection with regulations of this nature and also to debate them under the Vote concerned. Hon. members will not be left in the dark about a single aspect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am disappointed with the attitude of the hon. the Minister. I know that he is relying on advice as to what has happened in the past. The hon. the Minister will be aware of the fact that the amendments which are effective to the Radio Act under the schedule to this Bill, transfer certain regulatory powers from the State President to the corporation. This is not a re-enactment of the existing powers of the corporation. It is an extension of the powers of the corporation. Where those powers would have been exercised by the State President under the Radio Act, the State President was bound by the provisions stated in this amendment of mine. If we are to extend the powers of the corporation, I can see no reason why the hon. the Minister should not accept the amendment which he has before him. It does no harm. What is the difference&#x003F; It is a speeding up procedure whereby this hon. House can have surveillance over regulations which are brought about by the SABC.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister reminds me of the person who said that a sweater girl is somebody who pulls one&#x2019;s eyes over the wool. I think somebody has been pulling the wool over the eyes of the hon. the Minister with regard to this matter. As far as this matter is concerned, there is a vast change in this Bill. There is a vast difference in the powers of regulation as they were in the original Broadcasting Act, and for those reasons I believe the hon. the Minister must accede to the request made by speakers on this side of the House and accept this amendment. There is no vast principle involved, but it does tidy up a procedure in keeping with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own undertaking of bringing the SABC more into contact with Parliament, to enable Parliament to know what the SABC is doing. It is for that reason that this amendment has been moved.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is another aspect which I do not think we can just let slide like this. When the hon. the Minister stood up to answer the first time, his standpoint was that the amendment was unnecessary because in terms of the Interpretation Act in any case these regulations would have to be tabled. Am I correct&#x003F; That was the Minister&#x2019;s case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in regard to (a), (b), and (c).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>He did not say in regard to (a), (b) and (c). He said in regard to the regulations. His case was that in regard to the regulations they would be tabled and he quoted from sections 16 and 17. This was obviously an in accordance with the advice given to him, but when one talks about pulling the wool over people&#x2019;s eyes, the Minister was trying to pull the wool over the eyes of this House, because we were told not to worry; this was not necessary. When the hon. member for Green Point and I took it further, the hon. the Minister changed his ground completely and then said it had not been used since 1952 and therefore it was antiquated. What is the truth&#x003F; [Interjections.] Sir, you cannot have the argument that they are going to be tabled anyway and, when we point out that they are not, then say it is not necessary to table them. This, to my mind, is serious. It is trifling with Parliament. You tell Parliament in one breath that it does not know what it is talking about by asking for this amendment because these regulations will be tabled, and then you come back 10 minutes later and say: &#x201C;No, if we table them that will re-enact antiquated provisions of the Radio Act which has not been used since 1952.&#x201D; I think this is serious, that the Minister should first try to tell us that the amendment is unnecessary and then say that if he accepts the amendment he will be reintroducing something which is unnecessary. Whoever advised the hon. the Minister has put him in a very embarrassing situation. [Interjections.] Surely the Minister is embarrassed when he has to swallow his own words, when he has to swallow his own argument and say it only applies to three paragraphs and the rest he will not lay on the Table. But what are the things he does not have control over&#x003F; There is excluded from this paragraph (e), which refers to regulations. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any matter arising from the provisions of section 8 or section 14.</block>

<p>Clause 14 deals with the engagement of officers such as the corporation may deem necessary for the attainment of its objectives; to determine their duties, their salaries, their wages and allowances or other remuneration and their other conditions of service in general, and then it goes on referring to housing funds and all the rest. That is a matter over which the Minister has no say. One would have thought, and it normally is so, when finances are involved, that the Minister would be recognized. But he is specifically excluded because this is not one of the regulations made under (a), (b) and (c), and these vital matters flowing from clause 14, are excluded from ministerial scrutiny. Therefore surely it is all the more important that regulations made in regard to matters of this nature should be laid upon the Table. Otherwise there is no parliamentary control and the board can pay anybody anything it likes. It can have uneven, unfair or unreasonable salaries. It can buy houses for R&#x00BC; million, because clause 14 provides that it may establish a housing fund or in any other manner provide for the provision of housing for its officers.</p>

<p>Now we know what this Government does in regard to the provision of housing. We know of R&#x00BC; million mansions bought for commissioners-general, for judges and for other people, but we know of them because they are subject to the authority of Parliament. We know of the tens, the hundreds of thousands, of rand that are spent on luxury homes for a small band of selected people. Now here we are giving that authority which the Government itself abuses to a corporation over which Parliament has no control. It can put up a R&#x00BD; million mansion for the director-general if it wants to, and neither Parliament nor the Minister can control it. It can even have chandeliers. Those chandeliers, Sir, could be in a private home and not only in the office buildings of the corporation. These are serious and far-reaching powers. It is essentially part of the duty of Parliament, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will now have a fresh look at this and that he will recognize that his first argument is wrong and that his second argument is invalid. I hope that he will therefore agree that this House, this Parliament, through the only means it has available, <span class="col_5041-5042" refersTo="page_1203"/>through the tabling of regulations, will obtain control over these matters which are otherwise delegated to the corporation uncontrolled and unlimited and without any reference back, not even to the Government, let alone to this House. I would ask the hon. the Minister to have another look at this and I think he will realize that the arguments we have advanced are of such importance that if the Minister does not accept them he will in fact say to South Africa and to the taxpayers of South Africa: I am abandoning parliamentary control over the right of the corporation to hire and fire, to fix salaries, to provide housing and do matters covering a wide range of important things. He will be saying to South Africa: I am giving them this power and I am abandoning it myself and I am removing it from Parliament although it has been there since the Radio Act was enacted. We say it should be carried over and that the same reporting to Parliament should apply in this case.</p>

<p>Both the hon. member for Durban Point and the hon. member for Green Point have now advanced several arguments here which, in my opinion, are not quite relevant to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point. The amendment of the hon. member for Green Point provides that &#x201C;any regulations made under subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) &#x2026;&#x201D;. It therefore refers specifically to clause 23 and in clause 23(4) it is stated that a regulation made under subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) shall not be valid unless it was approved by the Minister. In other words, the substance of this particular amendment is in any event provided for in the existing subsection (4), in that the Minister must, in any event, lay any regulation, in respect of (a), (b) and (c) on the Table. I cannot understand why the hon. member for Durban is now making such a fuss about all these other matters because they are not relevant to their own amendment which has been moved here. For this reason I cannot agree with it, and I also want to put it clearly that what these gentlemen want is already contained in this clause 23(4), in terms of which the Minister must give approval and that is why this Parliament has the control desired by the hon. members. Therefore I cannot understand why the hon. members are complaining.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in the name of the hon. member for Wynberg on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 23, to insert the following subsections to follow subsection (1):</block>

<ol>

<li>(2) The auditor may prescribe that the accounts of the corporation shall be compiled in the form prescribed by the Auditor-General as defined in the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1975 (Act No. 66 of 1975).</li>

<li>(3) The auditor shall have the right to investigate whether any moneys spent have been spent in an advantageous and and efficient manner.</li>

<li>(4) The auditor shall draw the attention to&#x2014;</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(a) any grant which has been exceeded or which has been utilized for a service or purpose other than that for which it was intended;</li>

<li>(b) any utilization of money that was wasteful or inefficient or not conducive to the best interests of the corporation;</li>

<li>(c) the use or custody of any stores in a manner detrimental to the interests of the corporation; and</li>

<li><span class="col_5043-5044" refersTo="page_1204"/>(d) any other matters in the public interest.</li>

</ol>

<p>This amendment aims at widening and considerably expanding the scope of the audit of the SABC. I believe it is not only in the interests of the public that the audit should be so expanded, but also in the interests of the corporation itself. After all, the corporation is a large public body, owned by the public and run on public funds&#x2014;to the extent of nearly R90 million according to the latest accounts. It is important that it be seen that its affairs are properly and efficiently conducted in the financial realm. For that reason I think it is advisable that the accounts and the audit of the accounts should conform to the requirements of the Auditor-General and that the auditor&#x2019;s report, which in its present form is a rather prosaic and formal document, should be much more informative than it is at present. At present the auditor&#x2019;s report merely certifies the existence of the securities, that all the information that is required has been obtained, that proper books of accounts has been kept and that the balance sheet and revenue and expenditure accounts are in agreement with the books of account, etc. I think it is important that the auditor should have power to do what we ask in paragraph (3) of our amendment. This is a provision of the Exchequer and Audit Act and I believe it is a very good feature of that Act. As a State corporation and as a State monopoly the SABC is not subject to the normal disciplines of competition or of the profit motive. As such, additional disciplines and safeguards are required. I believe that giving the auditor the power to investigate efficiency and waste is a most important safeguard and is one required by the public. After all, the public is interested in an efficient broadcasting corporation and in the service that it provides. The report of the SABC is informative in respect of technicalities and the service provided. It also contains other things, such as pictures members of the board, something which I do not think is so important. The report is, however, very uninformative as far as its accounts are concerned and as far as the auditor&#x2019;s opinion on the running of the corporation is concerned.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I move the amendments so that the auditors can have power of investigation. Furthermore, having investigated they should be obliged to include in their report the matters set out in paragraph (4) of our amendment. I believe that if the hon. the Minister were to accept these amendments, it would lead to an improvement of the accounting and audit procedures of the corporation. I hope the hon. the Minister will therefore favourably consider these amendments.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have given the necessary consideration to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia. I would like to assure hon. members that I am just as interested as any person could possibly be in the fact that the SABC and SATV should be effective. I am also interested in all the other things the hon. member expressed about this service a moment ago. However, if one looks at the clause, one finds that the wording, almost to the word, is the exact wording as found in the principal Act and which has been in existence for ever so many years&#x2014;I believe from 1936. The auditing required in terms of the Bill has definitely been effective since 1936. It has provided for the necessary information and assurances. If the hon. member should want extra information in regard to accounts, then I can arrange with the SABC that it be made available. There is no doubt about that. I have already given this assurance during the Second Reading debate on this Bill. Why it should be necessary to change the wording of an Act that has worked very well since 1936, I do not know.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the SABC is not part of the civil service or responsible to the Auditor-General. As far as that is concerned, the SABC and SATV fall into a different category. This must not be overlooked. This is why clause 26 has been worded as it has been worded since 1936. The auditors of the SABC are, to my mind&#x2014;and I think hon. members will agree&#x2014;independent professionals who certainly are very capable of determining the system and method required. These auditors belong to a professional body which adheres to agreed and accepted standards. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment. I do not want to be difficult at all. I think I have proved beyond any doubt why I cannot accept the amendment. I will have another look at the previous clause and if arguments can be put forward why we should alter it in the Other Place, then I shall gladly do so. However, for <span class="col_5045-5046" refersTo="page_1205"/>the reasons I have advanced there is no necessity for the amendment of this clause moved by the hon. member for Constantia. I hope hon. members will understand my point of view. I will go out of my way&#x2014;and I promise this once again&#x2014;to assist as far as is humanly possible in seeing to it that the necessary information will be forthcoming to hon. members when they ask for it, including information in regard to the accounts.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not question for one minute the fact that the hon. the Minister will make available on request further information that we on this side of the House may require with regard to the accounts of the corporation, nor do I question for one minute the professional competency of the auditors of the SABC. However, I cannot see, now that we are passing a measure that sets out how the corporation shall be run and how it shall be controlled, why that measure should not be the best measure that this House can devise. To be a better measure than is contained in the Bill I believe that it should contain this obligation upon the auditors to investigate what we as members of the public are interested in as far as the SABC is concerned, viz. that it is being run efficiently and that the moneys that it is spending are not being spent in any way wastefully. It may be said that this is not an auditor&#x2019;s job and that auditors would be interfering unnecessarily if they poked their noses into such matters.</p>

<p>I do not believe that that is the case. I believe that in practice if auditors examine the possibility of waste, they will be extremely careful before they make a report that money is being wasted. If that report is made, it is one that could definitely be accepted and it is one that should be of great value to the hon. the Minister and to this House. We are not setting a new precedent in asking for this type of procedure. This type of procedure was included in the Exchequer and Audit Act which this House passed last year, and which permitted the Auditor-General to examine and investigate the functioning of State departments and incidentally also of statutory bodies to an even more intensive extent than is proposed in this amendment. Therefore, I would seriously ask the hon. the Minister to give this matter further consideration because I have no doubt whatsoever in my mind that if he accepted this amendment it would be an improvement on this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just briefly support the hon. member for Constantia in his appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment. The hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I accept his statement&#x2014;said that any information which was required could be obtained by way of a question. I accept that the hon. the Minister would honour that and that we would get as he said, any information which the public were entitled to receive. What is the situation where a question is asked about wasted expenditure when the Auditor-General&#x2019;s attention has not been directed towards the investigation of that particular matter&#x003F; The information would not be available. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether, if he looks at the proposed clause 26(5)(a), (b), (c) and (d), which relate to matters to which the auditor should draw attention, he will say that any of those is not in the public interest and that the public should not be entitled to information on matters of that nature. It is correct, as the hon. the Minister says, that this Bill is based on the 1936 Act. But that is like comparing an ox wagon with a Cadillac. After all, in 1936 we had crystals only in crystal sets, and not in chandeliers in the SABC building. There has been a great change between 1936 and the present time. The amount of expenditure, the amount of money involved, the licence fees, all justify the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Constantia. I do ask the hon. the Minister to consider and accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Amendment negatived (Official Opposition and Progressive Reform Party dissenting).</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 27:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 25, to omit all the words after &#x201C;broadcast&#x201D; in line 59 up to and including &#x201C;broadcast&#x201D; in line 62 and to substitute:</block>

<block name="quote">or televised, the name of the party of which he was the representative, the time <span class="col_5047-5048" refersTo="page_1206"/>allowed for the broadcast or telecast of the speech and the hour at which the broadcast or telecast</block>

<p>I should like to refer to clause 27(1)(g) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the name of every member of a political party by whom any political speech was broadcast, the name of the party of which he was the representative, the time allowed for the broadcast of the speech and the hour at which the broadcast took place;</block>

<p>That particular paragraph, in terms of clause 27(1), should indicate that these particulars are to be printed in the annual reports of the SABC. I understand from remarks made during the Second Reading debate that this particular provision which existed in the old Act has never or not recently been put into force. As far as we are able to establish, the information required under the provisions of clause 27(1)(g) has not in fact been provided. The object of my amendment is to ensure that not only shall this apply to broadcasting, but that it shall apply to television programmes as well. It would then mean that the report would have to indicate the name of the party of which a person was the representative, the time allowed for the broadcast or the telecast of the speech and the hour at which the broadcast or the telecast took place. Obviously, when the drafters of this new legislation went through the old Acts and drafted this particular Bill, they must have in their wisdom felt that this particular subsection had merit because they included it. I think that if I refer briefly to what the hon. the Minister said during his reply to the Second Reading debate, he will see that there is merit in my amendment to include television as well. There was a lot of discussion during the Second Reading debate on the question of political parties having time to broadcast or having time on television. I shall quote briefly from Hansard, col. 4354, to show what the hon. the Minister had to say. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Consequently I now want to tell those hon. members&#x2014;and they can quarrel with me as much as they want to&#x2014;that as long as I am the Minister of National Education, I shall do everything in my power to prevent the SABC and its television service from being used for political purposes by any group.</block>

<p>He said that and I believe that he was sincere when he said that. However, it is quite obvious that in the past there have been broadcasts made by members of political parties and I think that they feature in almost every newscast. Surely Cabinet members are members of political parties&#x003F; I believe that it is only equitable and just that this provision should not only include &#x201C;broadcast&#x201D;, but that it should also include &#x201C;television&#x201D;, and I ask the hon. the Minister to give favourable consideration to the suggestion embodied in my amendment.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to support the hon. member for Berea and I want to urge the hon. the Minister to look at this in a responsible way and with a balanced view. The hon. the Minister has adopted the attitude that there will be no party politics on television. Towards the start of this session the SATV was giving a balanced picture. It was presenting a Cabinet Minister introducing legislation and it was presenting spokesmen of other parties replying to it. Suddenly there was a complaint from the Government benches and the practice was discontinued. Now we have a provision here which requires that where members of political parties speak on the radio, it shall be reported, but television is excluded. Why should it be excluded&#x003F; The other night, Mr. Chairman, 11 Cabinet Ministers appeared on television. There were 11 of them in one night. It was sickening. The hon. the Minister of National Education himself was, I must say, the star of the show. He comes over like a performer, but some of the rest of them were nauseating to watch. If we are going to be subjected to this continual parade of Ministers, then let it be reported so that the public can see the absolute abuse of television in order to put across the views of only one political party in South Africa. Let the people then read about it; let it be reported. Let me say&#x2014;[Interjections.]&#x2014;yes, I have been on television as well, but then the hon. member for Boksburg complained. He stood up and urged the hon. the Minister not to allow the Opposition to be shown on television. Was this because the truth hurts and because some facts were getting through to the public&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_5049-5050" refersTo="page_1207"/>Since then the Minister has placed a ban on the Opposition appearing on television. That was the last time an Opposition member appeared live on television. Since the hon. member for Boksburg complained, not one member of the Opposition has appeared on television. What has happened, however, is that night after night and week after week we have seen nothing but this political picture gallery, one after another! After they had used nine of them once in the first newscast, they even switched four over so that new ones could be shown in the late news and, as I have said, we saw 11 of them in one night. Is this what South Africa is going to have to suffer&#x003F; Is the television news going to be a parade of Madame Tussauds&#x003F;</p>

Surely, he should have been pleased if I put up such a poor performance. However, I want to come back to my argument.</p>

<p>&#x2020;If, Mr. Chairman, we are going to have a Madame Tussaud display night after night, then let it be put into the Bill that this will be reported, and let the report say: &#x201C;On this night we had seven Ministers; on this night we had eight.&#x201D; Let them not hide behind this nonsense that Ministers talk on matters of State.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It is a very dark show sometimes. It is quite untrue to say that these are matters of State and that they are therefore not political. When Ministers get up and defend Government actions and praise Government actions and announce Government policy, that is a political speech. When a Minister announces Government policy, that is a political decision taken by the Cabinet. It is part of the political mechanism of government and therefore it is a political decision. Mr. Chairman, we will then be able to gauge the so-called impartiality of the broadcasting and television services. Therefore the amendment moved by the hon. member for Berea is essential. We do not want to test the sincerity of the Minister, because I accept that; he is a beautiful performer on TV. They used him three times one night. They used him at a bowls event, at some other sporting event, and they then showed him presenting something somewhere else. Three times in one night is not bad. We are not directing this amendment at the hon. the Minister, because I am sure he is sincere, but I am not so sure that whoever is pulling the strings is quite so sincere in presenting a balanced picture. We want South Africa to be able to know about it and therefore I ask the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I thought for one moment that paragraph (g) of subsection (1) was going to keep even one Cabinet Minister off the screen every night, I would support it with all my heart, never mind all of them. My problem with this provision, however, is that I do not think that it is going to help us to keep anybody off the television screen. I do not think it is going to help us keep the balance in this matter, because the problem is how one is going to establish what is a political speech. The provision refers to &#x201C;any political speech&#x201D;, and I think the point implicit in what the hon. member for Durban Point has said is absolutely valid. One Cabinet Minister after another appears on the television screen but I do not think any of that is going to be regarded as a political speech. It will merely be said that their appearance is in the broad national interest. [Interjections.] I really think that, if we have to have this provision, the amendment moved by the hon. member for Berea is absolutely logical, because if you have it for radio you have to have it for television. My difficulty, however, is that I believe that it is completely impractical. I do not see how this is going to be implemented. It is a provision which existed in the old Radio Act and it has been a dead letter for all these years. How in fact are you going to decide who is a member of a political party&#x003F; Will this be confined to official members of political parties&#x003F; Are the host of commentators <span class="col_5051-5052" refersTo="page_1208"/>that we have on radio night after night official members of political parties&#x003F; I do not know, but, heaven knows, they express a very decided party political point of view. I take it that they will not be monitored in terms of this provision. How are we in fact going to decide the name of the party of which a person was a representative&#x003F; It seems to me that the whole thing is completely pointless. If we thought that this could be implemented, that it was practical and that it would help to hold the balance between the parties, we would say, &#x201C;Yes, certainly&#x201D;, but under the circumstances it seems to me to be a completely pointless provision. I hope the hon. the Minister will see the purposelessness of it all and will withdraw it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a pity that what has just taken place was not recorded on television so that the public could see how the UP and the PRP have acted in regard to this amendment. The public would then have noticed that hon. members opposite do not know the legislation at all, because what the hon. member for Berea has suggested in his amendment is already embodied in this legislation, in that television is included as far as reporting back to this House by the SABC is concerned. I want to refer hon. members to clause 1(1)(ii), which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Broadcasting service&#x201D; means a telecommunication service of transmissions consisting of sounds, images, signs or signals which takes place by means of radio and is intended for reception by the general public.</block>

<p>In other words, when this is read together with subsection (2) of clause 1, it includes television. [Interjections.] Sir, now the hon. member for Durban Point sees what a big fool he has made of himself.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Clause 1(2) clarifies the position even further, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the purposes of this Act, the transmission of programmes by the corporation by means of cables or wires as contemplated in section 11(c), shall be deemed to be a broadcasting service and &#x201C;broadcast&#x201D; shall be construed accordingly, and any device used for receiving such transmissions and capable of reproducing them in the form of sounds, images or signals, shall&#x2014;</block>

<li>(b) be deemed to be a television set, if it can reproduce the transmission in the form of images or other visible signals, with or without accompanying sounds.</li>

</ol>

<p>*I do think the hon. member&#x2019;s request is a very reasonable one, but what the hon. member requests has already been embodied in the Bill and therefore hon. members will be able to obtain reports of Ministers appearing on television on various evenings. The fact that they appear so frequently, does indicate that the Ministers are very active. This is one thing the public is surely beginning to realize. Because hon.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member may put a question shortly. I just want to discuss <span class="col_5053-5054" refersTo="page_1209"/>this matter seriously for a moment. The question hon. members touched on is, of course, an important matter. Hon. members should not, therefore, think that I do not regard it as important. However, we should learn from what has happened in other countries. We should utilise television in South Africa in such a way that it really will be to the benefit of the country. All I meant when I spoke about this matter on a previous occasion, was that other countries found that it really was not in the interests of a country to conduct party politics on television. Many countries regret ever having allowed party politics to be conducted on television. We must and will guard against that, but that certainly does not &#x2026;</p>

<p>But surely that is what you are doing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, just give me a chance to make my point. This certainly does not mean that only Ministers should appear on television. It is undoubtedly essential that other members of Parliament of all parties appear on television at times. It is definitely essential, too, that the public should be properly informed on matters, and this will happen. That I said in my Second Reading speech. However, hon. members should remember that we are dealing with a new service here. Therefore, we have to make our way carefully. We should not like to make mistakes. Therefore, we would prefer to move forward somewhat slowly but surely, rather than do the opposite. I can give the assurance that we shall examine the matter carefully, because there certainly is such a thing as &#x201C;over exposure&#x201D; and, as we know, it can be very harmful to a person. I have asked that the senior officials of the SABC come and see me as soon as possible so that we can examine certain of these aspects thoroughly. We shall therefore discuss these matters on a suitable occasion. I therefore ask hon. members to exercise some patience as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that I am pleased for their part that the television cameras did not observe how those hon. members made fools of themselves today in connection with this clause because they did not read clause 1, which would have enabled them to realize that television was included in any case. It would certainly not have counted in hon. members&#x2019; favour if their speeches had been broadcast on television this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The South African Railways and Harbours have difficulties from time to time, on the short term, in handling the total amount of freight offered for transportation on our railway system or for handling in our harbours. Some doubt exists as to whether there is any legal authority in terms of which the Government may issue directions in respect of the creation of priorities according to which priority will be given to the handling of specific kinds of traffic in using the available railway and harbour facilities.</p>

<p>The State departments concerned with the matter have investigated this and have proposed that the National Supplies Procurement Act be suitably amended to enable the Government, if circumstances should require this, to institute a priority system for the various kinds of traffic that may be handled by the railway and harbour facilities available.</p>

<p>The Bill provides for the insertion of a section 2A into the National Supplies Procurement Act, and for certain amendments to section 18 of that Act, consequent upon the insertion of the abovementioned section. In terms of the proposed section 2A, the Minister of Economic Affairs, or any person authorized thereto by him, may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law contained, whenever the Minister deems it necessary or expedient for the security of the Republic or in the public interest, by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> or by notice in writing to the person or persons concerned, regulate, control or prohibit the use by any person or any category of persons of any transport service or any other service supplied by the State, or the transport of any goods by means of any transport service supplied by the State.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I must explain that, in accordance with existing rules of law, the Minister is required to evaluate honestly and objectively the circumstances in which he is to exercise his powers under both the existing Act and this proposed legislation. The decision to take action under any given set of circumstances would, therefore, lie solely in the discretion of the Minister.</p>

<p>However, whereas the connection between the security of the Republic on the one hand, and the preference granted to the transportation of any particular commodity which has no obvious strategic value on the other, could be remote, it would be open to doubt as to whether the Minister could in fact deem the granting of preference to the transportation of such a commodity to be necessary or expedient for the security of the Republic. In the circumstances, it is felt that the grounds on which the Minister may exercise his powers under the proposed legislation should not be limited only to conditions which may affect the security of the Republic. That is to say, it is now proposed that the Minister should be empowered to take action in the relevant circumstances on the gounds of the public interest as well.</p>

<p>*Section 18(1) of the National Supplies Procurement Act lays down at the moment that its provisions shall not detract in any way from, <i>inter alia,</i> the powers and activities of the Minister of Transport in terms of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act, 1957, and the Railway Board Act, 1962, nor from those of the Minister of Agriculture, the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the National Marketing Council in terms of the Marketing Act, 1968. The insertion of the proposed section 2A into the National Supplies Procurement Act will mean that section 18 of the latter Act will have to be suitably amended.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The proposed section 18(2)(b) of the National Supplies Procurement Act will provide <span class="col_5057-5058" refersTo="page_1211"/>that the Minister of Economic Affairs shall exercise his powers under section 2A of the Act in consultation with the Minister of Transport in so far as the exercise of such powers relates to a matter entrusted under the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, 1930, to the Minister of Transport, the National Transport Commission or any local transportation board; under the Air Services Act, 1949, to the Minister of Transport or the National Transport Commission; under the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act, 1957, to the Minister of Transport or the South African Railway Administration; and under the Railway Board Act, 1962, to the Minister of Transport or the Railways and Harbours Board.</p>

<p>*I want to emphasize that the State already performs certain activities in terms of the Acts set out in section 18(1) of the National Supplies Procurement Act. Consequently it would be illogical to introduce measures in respect of those activities in terms of the National Supplies Procurement Act. However, circumstances arise in practice which require the Government to take action when the powers in terms of certain of those Acts may be inadequate. It follows from this that when, as is provided for in the proposed amendment of the law which is before the House at the moment, the Minister of Economic Affairs exercises any powers in terms of the National Supplies Procurement Act which require him to enter into fields allocated to the Minister of Transport in terms of other laws, it is desirable that he should act in consultation with the Minister concerned.</p>

<p>I do not think there could be any objection to the principles of the Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the movement of goods round the country and in our harbours is an important aspect of our national life and the economic security of South Africa and ranks highly together with the country&#x2019;s military security. The National Supplies Procurement Act of 1970 clearly gives the hon. the Minister tremendous powers over our economic welfare, and also over the procurement of necessary goods and services for the security of the country. In the Act the operative words are that the hon. the Minister should be acting in the security of the country. He has explained in his speech today that he wants to go further than that, because of the fact that at certain times bottlenecks occur, certain priorities have to be established for the movement of vital economic goods, either by our transport services or through our harbours.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, in his capacity as Minister of Economic Affairs, may have to, in a certain sense, overrule, or certainly work in collaboration with the hon. the Ministers of Transport and of Agriculture in their specific fields. We are going to support this Bill because we believe that we are living in times in which the hon. the Minister should have what we regard as exceptional powers. The hon. the Minister has made it quite clear that in common law, as in this Bill and in the existing Act, he has to act in the best interests of the country and after due consideration to the circumstances ruling at a specific time.</p>

<p>Therefore we believe that in giving this Bill our support, we are acting in the best interests of South Africa. At the same time we hope and we know that the hon. the Minister will himself act judiciously and with certain circumspection, because we realize that certain vital interests can be adversely affected. There may be certain trading interests who may feel aggrieved from time to time, but having regard to the serious times in which we are living, where bottlenecks do occur due to transport facilities and other requirements being inadequate at times, we believe that the State should have the right to decide priorities in the national interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we therefore ask the hon. the Minister to act in good faith as he has indicated in his Second Reading speech. We have pleasure in supporting this measure.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on these benches are also going to support this Bill at the Second Reading. We have no problems with the phrase &#x201C;for the security of the Republic&#x201D;, and when the hon. the Minister should deem it necessary or expedient for that purpose. However, we must state that we have certain considerable reservations about the phrase &#x201C;or in the public interest&#x201D;, because we have heard from the hon. the Minister of Finance this afternoon that National Supplies Procurement Fund amounts to some R900 million. That is the value that is being covered by this particular piece of legislation. Obviously we would have thought that, by definition, <span class="col_5059-5060" refersTo="page_1212"/>that should fall under the security of the Republic. Therefore we have some difficulty&#x2014;though, as I have said, we support this measure&#x2014;when the hon. the Minister says &#x201C;or in the public interest&#x201D;. I do not believe that &#x201C;the security of the Republic&#x201D; is in all circumstances synonymous with &#x201C;or in the public interest&#x201D;. Obviously, if they were synonymous, the hon. the Minister would not have put them both into this legislation. Therefore we would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he would consider qualifying the powers he is taking unto himself under this legislation, to the extent that he must come back to Parliament in the normal way, which is within 14 days if Parliament is in session, or within 14 days after it reconvenes if it is out of session. We simply want the hon. the Minister to report to Parliament because, as I have said, he is taking extremely wide powers under both these headings. Indeed, under the first heading, I would have thought that it was a matter of such importance that it should be reported to Parliament. Under the second heading I find it even more difficult to accept that the hon. the Minister will have any problem in reporting back to Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I should like to thank hon. members for their support of this legislation. I agree with the statement by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens to the effect that this legislation makes provision for extraordinary powers for the Minister. However, I want to give the hon. House the assurance that I shall use these powers with the greatest circumspection. I shall do so in consultation with the other hon. Ministers who are involved and to whom I have referred and also, in all fairness, in co-operation with the private sector, the interests of which will also be affected by the exercise of the powers for which provision is being made in this legislation. I believe that this assurance will be sufficient. In any event, it appears at this stage that a specific system will have to be worked out in terms of which the powers in question may be exercised when necessary. It will probably be expected of me to discuss this, too, with representatives of the private sector, in the course of negotiations which take place from time to time between my department and the private sector. To the extent that I am able to do this without the security of the State being endangered, I shall do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to say to the hon. member for Johannesburg North that I understand that differences of opinion may occur with regard to the concept &#x201C;national or general interest.&#x201D; That is why matters should rather be left to those people who have to take the decisions and who, furthermore, have to carry them out in accordance with the common law responsibility which, in law, is given to members of the Cabinet by way of discretion of this particular kind. The hon. member for Johannesburg North asked whether I would not agree, in these specific circumstances, to decisions of this nature being reported to this House within 14 days. However, I want to request the hon. member to leave the legislation as it is for the time being. The fact is that when I have to take steps under this legislation, it will be known immediately. That is why a further statement, tabling or reporting of this matter will in fact be superfluous. However, I want to suggest at this stage that the hon. House accept the legislation under discussion in its present form and that I be afforded the opportunity to negotiate with the private sector with regard to the methods, the principles and so on which will be at issue when the legislation is applied. If, therefore, I find in the course of time that the suggestion made by the hon. member for Johannesburg North is, in all fairness, applicable, then&#x2014;I assure him now&#x2014;I shall in fact consider it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is true, of course, that when the hon. the Minister takes action in terms of this Bill, it will be immediately known. In some respects it may even be quite widely known. Presumably, however, the details of the action and various other aspects thereof will reach the vast majority of people by hearsay. Does the hon. the Minister intend to set forth a clear confirmation or promulgate the notice in the <i>Gazette</i> regarding such action&#x003F; Obviously, I appreciate that there are certain difficulties <span class="col_5061-5062" refersTo="page_1213"/>when one talks again about &#x201C;the security of the Republic&#x201D;, but when one simply talks about &#x201C;in the public interest&#x201D;, as opposed to the former phrase, part of our reservations will fall away, provided the hon. the Minister will undertake to set forth details of the priorities, will give reasons therefor, and will be prepared to receive representations from those who may be injuriously affected by the intended actions. However, I shall appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would confirm that we are correct in drawing this distinction between what is generally known throughout and precise details to third parties&#x2014;in the public interest, and not for public security&#x2014; who may suffer injury as a result of such actions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have already indicated during the Second Reading debate that the connection between the security of the State on the one hand and the preference that might be granted in terms of the powers in respect of the transportation of any particular commodity, might be very remote. Therefore I cannot accept the one principle only, viz. that I can use the power only for purposes of the security of the State in the narrow sense of the word. Therefore we take it a bit further and say it must also apply to the interest of the national public. What I have said is that I would&#x2014;and I trust that it would not be necessary to make use of this power&#x2014;timeously discuss the implementation of the Bill before circumstances arise where I have to use it with the private sector, organized industry, organized commerce, etc., to see how this could best be implemented to achieve the object of the Bill itself without disrupting the business world in general terms. I give the hon. member the assurance that we shall try to work in the closest co-operation with the people who will be affected by the Bill, except in certain circumstances&#x2014;which I do not envisage, but which might arise&#x2014;where I have to do it immediately for the security of the State. The hon. member will understand that I will then not have the time for consultation. I hope that satisfies the hon. member.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to get those assurances from the hon. the Minister. We can fully take the point that the public security goes much broader than the natural phrase. Our difficulty arises when one steps out of that much broader sphere and comes to what is simply described as &#x201C;the public interest.&#x201D; The public is served by the S.A. Railways and Harbours, various other organizations and they deal with their clients. If one takes the question of national security out, can the hon. the Minister tell us in what circumstances it can possibly be visualized that he would want to take these powers, in this restricted category of the public interest.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is very difficult for me because the hon. member will understand if I were to give him examples now, I would be saying in advance which circumstances were circumstances which could be anticipated. In the general interest, I should prefer not to do so at this stage. This legislation has certain connotations which, in fact, cause me to argue with my hands tied, but I am quite prepared to give the hon. member examples in private. It is difficult for me to give examples here in the House without spelling out possible contingencies which this legislation must provide for. I hope the hon. member will accept my <i>bona fides</i> in this particular connection.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The task of the Fuel Research Institute of South Africa is an important one, and in the present age of more expensive fuel and dwindling supplies of known fuel resources, the task of this institute becomes greater and more important almost every day. To give hon. members <span class="col_5063-5064" refersTo="page_1214"/>an indication of this I may furnish them with the figures regarding the reserves, production and exportation of South African coal in recent times. According to the report of the Petrick Commission&#x2014;which was recently published&#x2014;the exploitable coal reserves of the Republic amount to 25 milliard tons. The estimated maximum annual production figures are 66 million tons for 1974; 86 million tons for 1980; 179 million tons for 2000, and 70 million tons for 2070. Similarly, the value of coal exports has increased considerably and it is expected that at the present prices, the value of the exports will be R80 million in 1976 and R113 million in 1977.</p>

<p>The increase in the price of oil emphasized once again all over the world the importance of coal as a primary source of energy. In South Africa the sudden new interest in coal as a primary source of energy was not so dramatic because approximately 80% of the Republic&#x2019;s total energy is already being provided by coal. The great demand for South Africa&#x2019;s coal which has since developed abroad proves that the importance of coal as a source of energy in the place of oil has increased once again in Europe and elsewhere. Consequently it is essential for the Republic to devote more attention to the better utilization of its coal resources than merely burning them. For this reason, advanced research is essential with regard to the utilization of coal in a refined fluid form for the generation of energy and the provision of raw material for the plastics industry. This is a task which is receiving very concentrated attention, not only in South Africa, but in the rest of the world as well. Although no definite information is available, it is estimated that the USA alone has earmarked approximately R200 million a year for the purpose of reseach.</p>

<p>Against this background, the Government decided that certain steps should be taken with regard to the energy problem. The first was the building of the Sasol 2 project for deriving oil from coal; the second was the establishment as from 1 April 1975 of a mineral bureau to advise the Government in formulating a realistic policy which will ensure the optimum utilization of all South Africa&#x2019;s mineral resources, including coal; and the third step was that the Fuel Research Institute would expand its research functions in all spheres, which will mean that an experimental plant will be constructed at an estimated ultimate cost of R1,9 million.</p>

<p>For the information of hon. members I may mention that the institute will undertake a project for beneficiating fine coal and coal dust. It is known that the coal industry will produce large quantities of both small coal (6 x 0,5 mm) and fine coal (&#x2013; 0,5 mm) in the immediate future. In this way, for example, I may mention that only two of the coal mines involved in the contract for the exportation of low-ash coal will produce approximately 1 million tons of fine coal every year. This supply of fine coal will only be marketable if it can be beneficiated. If a low-ash export product is envisaged, it is estimated that approximately 300 000 tons could be produced every year without any additional mining of raw coal. Research has shown that South African coal cannot be purified by means of simple techniques and that relatively complex systems are required for this. Such an experimental system is presently being constructed at the institute at a cost of approximately R300 000, which is a minor expense compared to the enormous advantages this could hold.</p>

<p>In terms of the objectives of the Fuel Research Institute Coal Act, 1963, it is the task of the institute and its board to exercise control over the safeguarding of the supply of coal for public purposes by investigating and studying the Republic&#x2019;s fuel resources, to undertake the grading of coal for export purposes, and to undertake research concerning coal-mining and the utilization of fuel and by-products of fuel.</p>

<p>There is a need for closer consultation between the Department of Industries and the institute, for additional funds to be obtained for research purposes and for the Government&#x2019;s wishes in connection with this important matter to be stated to the Fuel Research Board on a more continuous basis. Clause 1 of the Bill proposes, therefore, that section 3(2) of the Act be amended to provide for the Secretary for Industries or his deputy to serve on the board <i>ex officio.</i> The initiative for this amendment came from the board of the institute and not from my department. The need was felt by the former body.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, funds for the financing of the activities of the institute are obtained in terms of the provisions of section 7 of the Act, which <span class="col_5065-5066" refersTo="page_1215"/><i>inter alia</i> empowers the State President to impose a levy on all coal sold by collieries in South Africa. Clause 2 contains three amendments, namely:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) It is proposed that instead of the State President the Minister of Economic Affairs, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, be given the authority to impose levies. The State President should not be burdened with matters of detail such as this, and while the Minister can perform this duty in accordance with the principle laid down by Parliament in more recent legislation in this regard, the proposed new procedure will save unnecessary administrative work. I think hon. members will agree with this.</li>

<li>(2) In terms of section 7(1) of the Act a levy may be imposed on all coal produced and sold in the Republic by collieries producing more than 10 000 tons per annum. The maximum amount of this levy remained static until 1973, when Parliament agreed that it may be increased to 1,1 cent per ton. In terms of this provision the actual levy imposed at present amounts to approximately 1 cent, leaving very little scope for further increases. Hon. members will agree that taken over a period of 46 years, the increases in the levy imposed were unbelievably small and having regard to the high rate of cost escalations which are being experienced of late, coupled with the growing demands on the Fuel Research Institute as far as research and the rendering of services to the South African coal industry are concerned, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the maximum of the levy that may be imposed be increased from 1,1 to 2,0 cent per ton.</li>

<li>(3) In terms of section 7(5) of the Act the Fuel Research Board is allowed to use the proceeds of the levies on coal in terms of section 7(1) for running expenses only, while section 7(5) also stipulates that any surpluses at the end of each financial year may be utilized for such purposes as the board may direct. This still leaves the board with the problem that also the reserves which are built up within reasonable limits may not be used for capital purposes. At present the latter can only be financed with moneys provided by Parliament, and as there does not seem to exist any valid justification for this limitation, it is proposed to amend the existing section 7 of the Act so as to empower the board, with the concurrence of the Ministers of Economic Affairs and of Finance, to utilize the levy funds in question for both running and capital expenditure.</li>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a commonplace these days that the survival of modem civilization depends on the maintenance of energy supplies. This has become very apparent since the oil crisis which occurred two years ago and I believe there is a growing consciousness throughout the civilized world that unless major research is done into fuel resources of all kinds, especially the fossil fuels such as coal and oil, Western civilization as we know it will, in fact, be jeopardized. During a visit to the Federal Energy Administration of America I have seen for myself the enormous amount of attention that is being devoted, and the very large amount of expert skill that is being applied, to the development of energy resources, including coal. The anxiety and the urgency of the matter go so deep and so far that even in countries like Britain, France and Germany as well as some parts of America where coal mines had been closed down because of the cheapness and availability of oil, the entire policy has been reviewed and attempts made at enormous costs throughout the Western world to reopen coal mines which had been regarded as obsolete and uneconomical. I believe that hand in hand with this effort to revitalize coal resources goes the need for finding new ways of utilizing coal. A lot of coal is not suitable for metallurgical or chemical purposes, but can, in special circumstances, be used through a process of burning in special devices to generate electricity, to produce gas and to be employed as a secondary means of providing energy in the form of heat and in other ways.</p>

<p>I believe that all these things need to be done in South Africa. We do have considerable reserves of coal, but not all of it is of a very high quality. Although we think we are fairly well served with fuels in general, the fact remains that our resources are not unlimited. There are many growing needs. I have very little time, but I would like to quote one such example. I would like to point out to the House&#x2014;I think it is also mentioned in the <span class="col_5067-5068" refersTo="page_1216"/>Petrick report&#x2014;that there is an enormous opening and rewarding possibilities for the development of gas from low grade coal in order to supply heat and light to many of our Black townships which, at the moment, as everybody knows, are enveloped in a cloud of smoke throughout the winter and a great part of the summer as well. The provision of fuel to our Black townships by means of gas instead of the highly smoke-producing coal could, in fact, make a major difference to the quality of life in our Black townships. These are the sort of things that need to be investigated.</p>

<p>I believe that the Bill before us is a consequence, possibly, of the report and the recommendations of the Petrick Commission itself, which recommends that the Fuel Research Institute should be given exactly these powers and the financial means to develop the kind of research which I have indicated. I believe that it is the purpose of this Bill to do precisely that. It is something which, as the hon. the Minister knows, I have pleaded for in many related respects when I have asked him to integrate the fuel policy. From this side of the House we therefore have the greatest of pleasure in supporting the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>
