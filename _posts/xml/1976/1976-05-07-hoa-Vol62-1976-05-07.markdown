<p>Vote No. 4.&#x2014;&#x201C;Defence&#x201D; (contd.):</p>

<speech by="#albertyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. ALBERTYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was speaking about the conditions under which sailors have to live at sea. They sleep on and among ammunition, their elbow-room is extremely limited, especially in submarines, and they brave the fury and storms of the open sea, knowing that the vultures of the sea, the man-eating sharks, will probably be first on the scene in the case of an accident. Communication is sometimes very difficult. I do not know whether the sailors receive adequate remuneration for this way of life, which involves so much sacrifice. I do not think there are many people who would like this sort of life. Let us look at the responsibilities of the commander of a boat. Let us look at the frigate. This is an important defence weapon with sophisticated equipment. A frigate costs approximately R60 million. There are 250 lives in the care of such a commander, most of whom are very highly qualified and therefore, in fact, irreplaceable, as the hon. member for Worcester indicated yesterday.</p>

<p>The sailor&#x2014;both officer and rating&#x2014;is dependent upon the three fundamentals upon which the Navy operates: firstly, the seaworthiness of the vessel. The hull must be of a <span class="col_6233-6234" refersTo="page_0447"/>quality capable of withstanding the sea at its worst for long periods and over vast distances. Secondly, there is the habitability of the vessel. These boats are not built for the comfort of the crew. They are warships and therefore the people live on machines for long periods. Thirdly, there is the striking power of the vessel, viz. its weapons and its communications systems. These three aspects largely determine the degree to which the crew will be happy, whether they will have self-confidence and faith and whether they will be motivated. Indeed, it determines the level of the crew&#x2019;s morale. The man himself&#x2014;his ability, his preparedness, his will&#x2014;is the greatest single factor and the most valuable factor in any defence organization.</p>

<p>Sir, it has been suggested in the past that the Defence Force does not belong under the jurisdiction of Public Service Commission. I wonder whether the time has not come to consider this suggestion once again. The Defence Force is professional. They have their own code and their own legal system. At present salaries are compared, and not responsibilities. The custom of the Public Service, to promote according to seniority rather than on merit, does not suit the Defence Force, for several good reasons, among which the working conditions of these people and their working hours. In Australia and Canada a distinction is even drawn between the Navy and the rest of the Defence Force in respect of salaries and benefits. Let me mention only one example. Our vessels visit foreign harbours from time to time. The commander is sometimes required to entertain people on board. He does not receive any entertainment allowance for this, owing to the fact that the Defence Force falls under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. F. VAN HEERDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, while one of the great world giants, the Soviet Union, is leaving no stone unturned to sow division in the West, create chaos and cast suspicion on Western institutions, and while it is using the communications media of the world to advertise its actions as a philanthropic rescue effort aimed at liberating nations, the other great giant, the USA, is hamstringing its executive. While the Soviet Union, in spite of the clumsiness and ineffectiveness of its economic system, is tightening its stranglehold on certain leaders in Africa and is taking subversive action against surrounding states, the USA is occupied with a witchhunt about the commission paid by Lockheed and some of its other large corporations. Furthermore, witchhunt is still being perpetuated with regard to its own secret service. While Russia is manufacturing and distributing weapons and expanding its influence in Africa, the USA is providing it with food to enable it to continue its programme of action unhindered. Sir, in such a world, with such a friend and such an enemy, South Africa must maintain itself. In such a world the continued existence of a nation depends on its will to survive. The will to survive has been particularly noticeable amongst our own soldiers over the past year. I should like to praise every man and woman in our Defence Force, from the lowest to the highest rank, people who have served South Africa so faithfully through their exceptional sense of service. I am also grateful that members of the public facilitate the task of the soldier. At De Aar a few thousand soldiers were entertained by the community. The soldiers who are waiting for train connections there, are entertained in the De Aar town hall by the community. All the churches there co-operate; there are also 12 women&#x2019;s organizations who co-operate. There is outstanding co-operation, and the letters from the soldiers who were there testify to the highest praise for that community.</p>

<p>South Africa is also proud of its national servicemen. When one converses with our young soldiers, one realises that these young soldiers of ours are very well motivated. Unfortunately there are, of course, the exceptions, too. A study of the training methods of the Defence Force shows that our national servicemen are among the best-trained soldiers in the world. They are soldiers who are not only prepared in the military sense; they are also spiritually prepared. Since our national servicemen represent a cross section of our present South African society, the Defence Force has to start really motivating some of them during their training period.</p>

<p>Therefore I am particularly pleased to hear that the theological students who have completed their studies and not yet done their national service will be referred to the chaplain service as from next year. These young theological officers can then be used to provide their fellows with religious guidance. <span class="col_6235-6236" refersTo="page_0448"/>In this way a very important contribution can be made towards the spiritual preparedness of our national servicemen. In order to help motivate our national servicemen, civil training is also included in their programme. I am particularly pleased that, over the past year in particular, civil leadership has been stressed. In this way an effort is made to breed citizens with inner strength and integrity, citizens who will have the right sense of values in life and who will have the right technical and spiritual schooling, citizens who will eventually be able to serve their country and fellow citizens to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>The fact that it is necessary for so much of our programme of spiritual preparedness to be left to the Defence Force to carry out is in my opinion an indictment of our whole community. I think that the time has come for us as parents and senior citizens to make a larger contribution towards the preparedness of our sons and daughters. We and our children have become too soft and easy-going. A spirit of lack of interest and lack of patriotism prevails among a section of our population. Perhaps it has been too long since we shed blood to preserve our fatherland. It seems to me that with us comfort comes first. We as senior citizens owe it to South Africa to be prepared ourselves. However, we must also see to it that our children are spiritually prepared. Let us, as the senior citizens, destroy root and branch the communal enemy, the spirit of decadence which gnaws at the heart of our nation&#x2019;s soul like a cancer. We as parents must not expect the Defence Force to make our boys into men. A parent must not expect that, since he is a problem parent, and is possibly sending a problem son to the Defence Force, the Defence Force should set him on the right track. We as parents must make our contribution. A parent must give his son to the Defence Force and South Africa in this knowledge: Here is my son, he is a motivated man and prepared to fight for what belongs to him by tradition. With a total spiritual preparedness like this South Africa will be able to maintain itself through its determination and the will to fight for what is his.</p>

<speech by="#mills">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. W. MILLS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the time available to me, I want to deal with a number of aspects of defence effectiveness. However, before doing that, I should like to extend my thanks to Admiral Biermann for his achievements in the Defence. Force and wish him a happy retirement. At the same time I should like to congratulate his successor, Lt.-Gen. Malan and to wish him and his chiefs of staff good hunting in the future. Further we express our concern at the fate of Major &#x201C;Horse&#x201D; Carter and Capt. Rossouw missing on an Albatross patrol. We hope that the search for them is successful and we convey our sympathy to their wives and families.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to refer to the effectiveness of cadet training. The latest figure I received from the Department of Defence shows that only 58 of the 625 South African schools are without cadet detachments. This, I feel, is a very good record. The hon. the Minister indicated last year when his Vote was under discussion that he hoped to introduce from 1 January this year an improved and more effective cadet system in the schools. He added that the plan would depend on consultations with the Department of National Education. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister concluded those consultations and if he would give us an appropriate report. From the number of cadet detachments existing we can see that teachers are certainly pulling their weight in this respect, but we must not ignore the fact that there is a shortage of male teachers and that the position is not improving. We feel that this will restrict whatever plans the hon. the Minister has in mind to improve cadet training. I should like to suggest to him to consider linking school cadets with the civil defence programme. I refer to first-aid classes and instruction in the use of fire-fighting equipment, radio and small arms. I feel that the people who as trained personnel are already providing the service, could provide it in the schools and at the same time remove the load from teachers who are already overloaded in their extramural responsibilities. In this way one can reduce the parade ground drill and one can broaden the scope of cadet training to more useful civilian skills. From conversations I had with Rhodesian people during the recess, I understand that the Rhodesian military planners are cutting back on cadet detachments. They find that army recruits very soon make up the experience which they did not have in the form of cadet training at school. They also save on the cost of uniforms and band instruments. In the final instance they are not very sure that there is much scope for utilization of schoolboys as cadets. I should <span class="col_6237-6238" refersTo="page_0449"/>like to know from the hon. the Minister what the annual cost is to supply cadet detachments in South Africa and what effectiveness rating he places on this training.</p>

<p>When these boys leave school, they go into the Army, do their national training and very soon learn that any army marches on its stomach. This, of course, was the great adage of Napoleon and was one of the reasons why his troops loved him. He always kept them well fed and happy. I have had reports concerning the chaps in the operational area that they would be happier if a couple of other brands of beer and cigarettes were more readily available to them.</p>

<speech by="#mills">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. W. MILLS</person>:</from>

<p>I hope that the South African Defence Force institute that does the buying for the troops in the operational area will spread the range of supplies. I feel that this will give a greater variety to the troops and that it will also avoid monopolies between competing business firms. I realize that these are small touches, but I am sure that the troops, which are already effective, will become more effective if they are content in their off-duty hours.</p>

<p>I should like to raise three cases that have been brought to my attention by the people in my constituency. I am sorry that these cases do not fit in with my theme of effectiveness, but I raise them in the hope that this will result in measures being taken to try to prevent their recurrence. The first case concerns the refusal by the exemption board to grant a deferment to a soldier in order that he might write his final examination. The man concerned is a branch manager and he is considered by his employers to be a key member of the personnel. He was called up in February for his three months&#x2019; training and the firm agreed to pay him his full salary during his absence. The firm put in a written request to the exemption board for his deferment in view of his final examination for the Institute of Administration and Commerce which is being written on 19 May. However, no deferment or study leave was granted, nor were reasons given when an official of the Defence Force phoned me last month to tell me of the board&#x2019;s decision. I find this very difficult to understand or to accept due to the fact that this man&#x2019;s future career will be placed in jeopardy by his not sitting for this examination.</p>

<p>The second case is one of death and injury through apparent negligence. I refer to troops that were being convoyed in northern Natal on 29 November 1975. These troops had earlier refused to get into the transport provided because the particular vehicle was unroadworthy in that the tyres were smooth and the vehicle had no brakes. Another vehicle was found and this was loaded with 32 instead of the regulation 21 troops. It was a rainy day; the road was muddy; the vehicle was going fast and it overturned. The result was that 12 were injured, 4 were seriously injured and one was killed. He was killed, incidentally, by a spare wheel which had been placed on the back of the truck&#x2014;it should have been placed underneath the truck, but the catch was broken. One boy had both legs shattered and might not walk again. Another trainee had a crushed spine and a third suffered a split liver. Worst of all, no compensation can make up for the life of the trainee who was killed. The accident, as I have indicated, occurred in November 1975. It is now May 1976, but to date I have seen no report of an inquiry into this accident. I feel that a reassurance is desperately sought by the bereaved mother. She is on her own since her surviving son is now doing his national service. I do feel, too, that the public is entitled to be informed of any steps that are being taken to avoid a repetition of this case of fatal negligence. I should like clarification from the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>

<p>A third case I should like to raise, is that of the treatment of soldiers wounded in Angola. I refer to one case in particular. It concerns a 26 year old married soldier who in clashes with Swapo lost a finger, his right ear and a portion of his left ear and whose back was sprayed with shrapnel. He was treated in hospital for three weeks and was then discharged, but his wound still worried him and he reported to a doctor, who examined him and made an appointment for him with a specialist. At that time the specialist was busy, but two days later he saw him and agreed to operate when a bed was available. The specialist said he would be telephoned. Two weeks later a sister telephoned him and said that a bed was ready. He reported to hospital but they would not admit him until they had received permission from Pretoria to operate. He was then informed that <span class="col_6239-6240" refersTo="page_0450"/>he should appear before the Pensions and Medical Board. If he passed, he would receive a medical card which would entitle him to free hospitalization and medical treatment and compensation for loss of pay. The man concerned went on to say in his letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have wasted several days sitting in hospital for permission to have treatment and I am not compensated for this loss. I am married and I have a wife and a daughter of nine months to support. I am paid by the hour and lose a great deal every time I have to report to the hospital. I am most dissatisfied at the way I am being treated by the army authorities and would like to know exactly what my position is. I am a crock now. I cannot play rugby any more. I cannot take part in any sport and I feel I should be properly compensated for what I have suffered and will continue to suffer in the future.</block>

<p>I should like the hon. the Minister to explain what the procedure is for medical treatment, why there are these delays and what compensation is provided for soldiers who have been wounded in service?</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to refer to reports on the front page of <i>The Cape Times</i> this morning concerning the incident that occurred in this House yesterday. I do feel that the hon. the Minister should be more responsible than to place temptation in the way of the hon. member for Yeoville. We all know he finds it difficult to control himself when he is provoked. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North must forgive me for not replying to his speech. However, I want to return to the speech which the hon. member for Yeoville made here last night. I believe that it is necessary, for the sake of the record, that certain things be set right. At the end of January 1976, the hon. member for Bloemfontein West, the hon. member for Cradock, the hon. member for Sea Point, the hon. member for Yeoville, the hon. member for Rondebosch and myself, as well as three members of the UP, made a visit to the military area at the invitation of the Chief of the Army. On our arrival there we were briefed by high-ranking military officers. At that briefing session that afternoon, only people who were concerned with the defence and security set-up in northern South West Africa were present. The hon. the Minister of Defence did not attend the information session. On that occasion, on the very clear understanding that it was secret, extensive and penetrating information was given to the members of the group. There was an opportunity to ask questions, and questions were asked. The same evening the members of the group, together with a number of other people&#x2014; civilians, officials of the Department of Bantu Administration and others; probably about a hundred people&#x2014;attended a reception. On that occasion the hon. the Minister of Defence was present. The hon. member for Yeoville was also present there. During that conversation, and in the hearing of whoever wanted to listen, the hon. member for Yeoville asked the question with which he was confronted yesterday. I can confirm that when we left the reception that night, it was already common knowledge to at least 50 people what question the hon. member had asked, what his standpoint was and what the attitude was with which he approached the action of the Government. Who is therefore the man who committed a breach of faith?</p>

<p>Is this the man who, for the sake of petty, short-sighted and momentary political gain, a minor point which he can win, links the ambivalence and the double talk of his party concerning the defence of the country with a secret and confidential briefing conference which he attended? This is the question which must be asked. Now I want to call attention to his double talk in connection with his patriotism. To begin with, I should like to tell him that avowals of patriotism are fine-sounding when they roll off one&#x2019;s lips in the form of lip-service. However, it is when one must start practising what one preaches that one&#x2019;s true patriotism comes to the fore. I want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville two things. In the first place, I want to tell him that one does not measure <span class="col_6241-6242" refersTo="page_0451"/>patriotism on a gold balance. In the second place I want to tell him that in my opinion, patriotism and party loyalty are of equal value.</p>

<p>I can visualize him, less than two years ago, testifying to his devotion, his loyalty and his patriotism towards the UP just as liberally, faithfully and self-confidently, as he now does towards South Africa. I do not question his patriotism.</p>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with respect, I am referring to what the hon. member said about patriotism.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another point and want the hon. member for Rondebosch to tell us today what the position in his party is. The hon. member for Rondebosch is known as the PRP&#x2019;s chief spokesman on defence matters. This is what he is known for, and he is also quoted as such in the Press. The hon. member for Yeoville has already spoken twice during this debate. Now I want to know from him or from the hon. member for Rondebosch whether the standpoints which he expounded in the House yesterday, are those of his party or his own. I also want to know who is the PRP&#x2019;s official chief spokesman on matters of defence from now on, because there is a very important and subtle difference between the standpoints of the hon. member for Rondebosch and the hon. member for Yeoville. The hon. member for Yeoville asked in Owambo why Luanda was not taken too; he was angry because this was not done. Therefore, in principle, he has no objection to the action of the Government in the military area in South West Africa. The hon. member for Rondebosch, however, said that nothing which he had seen or heard up there had changed the standpoint which he maintained before the time, namely that South Africa should not have become involved in Angola. How does one reconcile these two standpoints? This is what I want to know.</p>

<p>What is more: The leader of the hon. member for Yeoville left from there that Sunday night in our company. That Monday, or else on the Tuesday, he travelled by air to Gaberone to receive orders or something there. After he had returned from there, he, too, said that South Africa should withdraw from Angola. We now want to know who the official chief spokesman of the PRP is on defence matters. It is very important that we should know this.</p>

<p>One can discuss the PRP at great length, but I want to dispose of them by saying one more thing. The PRP&#x2019;s standpoint with respect to the defence of the country, a standpoint for the sake of propaganda and not a matter of conviction, has changed completely since the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year they voted against the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s motion of thanks to the S.A. Defence Force. I know why they changed their standpoint. They saw the reaction of the English-speaking students of the University of the Witwatersrand to Nusas. They also became aware of the reaction against the Student&#x2019;s Representative Council when it did not want to contribute towards the defence funds for the members of the Defence Force who were defending the country. This is where the PRP has been exposed and will be exposed as long as there is a Nationalist in the country. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deal for a moment with what the hon. member for Durban Point said about the dissatisfaction which supposedly prevails among voluntary members of the Defence Force as a result of the treatment which they received up North and that, after they returned, they considered resigning from the Citizen Force. I had the privilege of attending a function by one of the Citizen Force units in the Cape which returned from the border. I do not share the standpoint of the hon. member for Durban Point. The spirit of those men was a fine one. Their spirit was the spirit of the Defence Force as we observed it in the military zone when we were there. What is that spirit? It is a spirit of which one can be proud, a spirit of men of whom one may be proud: Fine, clean Afrikaners, and South Africans, English as well as Afrikaans speaking, who have only one thing in mind, namely service to their country. I should like the PRP to put their &#x201C;beardies and weirdies&#x201D; in the Defence Force for a while. Then they would sing a different tune.</p>

<p>We are proud of what the Defence Force has done in the military zone, not only in respect <span class="col_6243-6244" refersTo="page_0452"/>of the defence of the country, but also in respect of race relations and in respect of the manner in which they made themselves available for service in civilian matters. I have no fear that any of the members of the Citizen Force will resign as a result of the hardships they had to endure up in Angola. War and the defence of the country are not five-star hotel games. They are accompanied by hardships and loss of life. We should also always remember those men who gave up their lives on the border. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. VILONEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very grateful that the hon. the Minister is back with us again, that he is reasonably healthy and that all parts are in good working condition. To Admiral Biermann I want to say &#x201C;thank you very much&#x201D;, and to Lt. Gen. Malan I want to say: &#x201C;Hearty congratulations and all of the best.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Today I should like to draw attention to the role played by the South African Medical Service, or the Medical Corps. I should also like to refer to a few hitches which could perhaps be attended to. In view of the hermaphroditic tirade launched by the hon. member for Yeoville yesterday, I shall come back to the role played by the PRP and its influence on our defence at the end of my speech. I shall only devote a little time to this, because I do not think they are worth any more.</p>

<p>It would be ridiculous to argue about which division of the Defence Force is really the most important. The fact is that they are all important and that they are all essential. One important and essential division of the Defence Force is the Medical Corps. Not only does this corps play a vital role with regard to the health and physical preparedness of our men, but also with regard to the services it provides to the dependants, its welfare work and its role in regard to the wounded in wartime. It therefore plays an important role in building up the confidence and the morale of our people. Let me mention a few examples to hon. members. This service provides the members of the Permanent Force and their dependants with a comprehensive service. I do not have the time at present to deal with their service to the Citizen Force. This service includes the following: Hospitalization, house doctors, specialists, X-rays, laboratory tests, blood, maternity services, dental services, welfare services, psychiatric services, and so on. This costs our soldiers absolutely nothing, apart from the 50 cents per month which they contribute towards continuation services should such a member retire or die. These services are of high quality. For example, there are the three outstandingly equipped military hospitals. We are building two new ones in the place of two old ones at a cost of about R35 million. A very highly respected and prominent South African, Lt. Col. Robertson, who was the commander of the No. 1 military hospital during the previous war, said the following last month&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I Military Hospital has progressed to a highly polished unit capable of dealing with any crisis produced by modern-day warfare.</block>

<p>A service of this kind creates a high morale and it builds up the confidence of a people and its soldiers. Another example I want to mention is the fact that a wounded man receives immediate emergency treatment on the spot, with intravenal feeding, haemostasis and pain killers if necessary. The wounded man is then taken to a waiting helicopter by ambulance without delay and receives further treatment in the field hospital if necessary. He is then conveyed further by helicopter and within four to eight hours those wounded men are already in a military hospital at Voortrekkerhoogte where their next of kin can be with them. This is what builds up morale and confidence.</p>

<p>I could continue in this vein and refer, too, to the Central Medical Stores which provides drugs to 11 900 points: Provincial hospitals&#x2014;not only military&#x2014;sick bays and even forestry stations throughout the country. I may point out to hon. members that the cost per patient in our military hospitals is about R10 per day or less in comparison with a comparable provincial hospital, at which the amount is R30 to R40. This testifies to sound central control and outstanding administration. We are grateful for this and we wish to express our gratitude for the South African Medical Service.</p>

<p>However, there are a few hitches. The first I want to mention is that of the salaries of nurses. The principle in the Defence Force is that male and female receive the same salary for the same rank. However, there is an exception in the case of nurses. Then one gets <span class="col_6245-6246" refersTo="page_0453"/>less. I know that there are problems in this regard but I am of the opinion that these people carry out their work with dedication and a sense of vocation, but dedication, love and a sense of vocation cannot buy bread or clothing. I know that it is argued that the nursing staff must earn less than their equals in rank so that they may earn the same as provincial nurses in the Public Service. That argument does not hold water. It is now being maintained that if this were not so, there would be a drain of nurses from the other hospitals to the Defence Force. This is not so because the Defence Force as a whole has barely as many nurses as a large hospital like H. F. Verwoerd or the General Hospital in Johannesburg. Consequently there is no possibility of a drain occurring. Furthermore, the Defence Force trains its own nurses to a large extent, and when the new hospitals are established, it will probably be so to an even greater extent. However, my argument is that if the nursing staff in the Defence Force should receive less than, say, a welfare officer of the same rank merely because she is performing nursing work, it proves, not only that the nurse, the sister in the military hospital, is earning comparatively too little, but that this is so throughout the country. Let us, then rather rectify the matter throughout the country than prejudice the interests of that nursing staff in this way. I am not asking for better or preferential treatment; we are only asking for equal rights, and Heaven knows, they are worth it.</p>

<p>There is another point I want to mention briefly, namely the shortage of medical orderlies. We simply do not get sufficient medical orderlies from among the national servicemen and that is why I want to ask that our women be taken up into the Citizen Force to be trained for that purpose. There is a vast amount of administrative work, even such work as driving ambulances, and so on, which could be carried out by the female staff while the male orderly is in the front line. Then there is the housing problem, but flats are rented for other purposes. Therefore a flat can be rented to accommodate these women, too. For the moment I shall leave it at that. I have too little time to talk about this subject because I want to deal with the PRP.</p>

<p>They had their &#x201C;moment of truth&#x201D; as far back as 30 January this year, when the hon. the Prime Minister introduced his amendment. He made his amendment independent of politics, just as we want to make the Defence Force independent of politics. At that time the hon. the Prime Minister said: &#x201C;I do not want to ask for confidence in a party or the Government only; I ask that South Africa should speak.&#x201D; And in his five-point amendment he moved, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;(col. 356, Hansard)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This House in conclusion conveys its sincere thanks and appreciation to the Defence Force and all officers and men for the courageous and heroic manner in which they have acquitted themselves of their task in the operational area and expresses its deep sympathy with those who have lost loved ones in the struggle.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think there is any member in this House who will not be able to support this amendment. I am giving notice of my amendment in good time so that hon. members may consider it, and cast a considered vote.</block>

<p>Without batting an eyelid, the PRP voted against it. When I say &#x201C;without batting an eyelid&#x201D;, perhaps that does not apply to the hon. member for Yeoville. Not only did he bat an eyelid; he also &#x201C;battered&#x201D; his own soul. They act in that way to satisfy the leftists and the liberal elements in their party. No-one can tell me that was an unthought-out tactical measure, because three days later, after the weekend, we again conducted a defence debate in this House. The hon. member for&#x2014;I almost said Pietermaritzburg, but it has been many years since he was still such a person&#x2014;Rondebosch said that he could perhaps have voted for the amendment before, but he said (Hansard, col. 427)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Prime Minister introduced an amendment based on patriotism and the death of people&#x2014;which involves all of us &#x2026;</block>

<p>Those were his words, Sir. Where could one wish to find a better basis for such an argument than patriotism? I know how I felt when my good friend Johan Holm died on the border. My feelings on the matter prompted me to <span class="col_6247-6248" refersTo="page_0454"/>apply to the Minister and the Surgeon-General to go and do border duty. The Prime Minister said: &#x201C;Let us stand up and be counted.&#x201D; However, that hon. member states: &#x201C;If I ever plan to put my hand up in the future in support of such a motion&#x201D;&#x2014;which was based on patriotism and the death of our people&#x2014;&#x201C;in such circumstances I hope it will shrivel up and dry up in front of me&#x201D;.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before we begin to fight I just want to say that I am pleased that the hon. the Minister of Defence is back in the House and that he has recovered. Considering the way in which he attacked us yesterday, it seems to me that he has recovered fully. I also want to convey my best wishes to the Chief of the Defence Force who is going to retire shortly. I hope that he will enjoy a very pleasant retirement. I also want to express my personal pleasure at the appointment of Gen. Malan as our new Defence Chief. I have a very high regard for his personal qualities, and in the difficult times we are living in we can look forward to his leadership of the Defence Force with the greatest confidence.</p>

<p>Sir, we were rather surprised yesterday by the fact that the hon. the Minister of Defence chose to reopen the whole Angola debate again. What was not surprising was the way in which he did it. He again coupled South Africa and the Defence Force with the NP and then said that it was South Africa that had spoken. It was the Government&#x2019;s action, but South Africa and the Defence Force were then coupled to it without further ado. It is an old technique to couple it in such a way that any criticism is then nipped in the bud. Of course, the important point which is overlooked is that it is in fact possible for a Defence Force, and our Defence Force in particular, to act 100&#x0025; correctly in the military sphere and to do exceptionally well in the execution of a political decision which could have extremely harmful consequences in the long run. This is the crux of the argument. At no stage have we ever expressed criticism of the conduct of the Defence Force and the way in which they perform their task and I challenge any hon. member of the House to prove the contrary. However, we have questioned the consequences and the wisdom of the political judgment on which it was based. We reserve that right for ourselves. We shall continue to question the wisdom and the political consequences of that decision because, as we have said from the outset, we as a party consider the political decision&#x2014;seen in the overall context and in terms of what preceded our involvement in Angola&#x2014;to have been a mistake. This is the background of the pamphlet to which the hon. the Minister referred yesterday as a basis for his attack on us.</p>

<p>What does that pamphlet say? Basically, the point to which the hon. the Minister took exception was the fact that we said that the policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries had been violated. We stand by that. We are not going to run away from it. In fact, there is a long report in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> in this connection, and I wonder whether they, too, are now among the political cockroaches of South Africa. In this morning&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> the heading appears &#x201C;S.A. in Angola &#x2019;n fout, s&#x00EA; verslag.&#x201D; Where does this report emanate from? It emanates from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. This particular organization has referred to our hon. Prime Minister as a great statesman, but what do they say here? Let me quote from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Suid-Afrika se betrokkenheid by die burgeroorlog in Angola was &#x2019;n emstige milit&#x00EA;re en diplomatieke oordeelsfout, het die Internasionale Instituut vir Strategiese Studies gister hier verklaar. &#x201C;Die land se optrede in Angola kon sy ontspan-ningspolitiek die nekslag toegedien het&#x2026; Die ontspanningsbeleid is hoofsaaklik ge-grond op die beginsel van nie-inmenging in buurlande. Die gewilligheid van die Swart lande wat die beleid ten dele aanvaar het, is deur Angola &#x2019;n ernstige knou toegedien&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Well and good. It is a research organization which has in the past expressed very objective opinions on South Africa. But if that is not good enough, I want to quote what was reported in <i>The Argus</i> last night. The hon. the Prime Minister may deny it, but last night&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i> states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister, Mr. B. J. Vorster, has said in a Belgian television interview that the South African troop intervention in <span class="col_6249-6250" refersTo="page_0455"/>Angola had resulted in a severe setback to his policy of normalizing relations with Black Africa.</block>

<p>It is not we who say so, Sir. According to the report, it is the Prime Minister himself who said so. What, then, in such a blatant lie? This is our opinion in regard to what the consequences of our involvement in Angola were. The second point is that we did not say that it was the cause of the Russian and Cuban presence there, we said that it led to its escalation. According to last night&#x2019;s paper there are now not only 15 000, but 2 000 additional people there, and there are also references to satellite bases they have constructed there. Sir, I do think one can at least conduct a reasonable debate on the political consequences. After all, we are a political party that can say what the consequences are of political decisions which have preceded military action, without thereby expressing criticism of the Defence Force and the military service in general. We are not going to run away from a debate about this.</p>

[Interjections.] We say that this was a mistake. But let me come back to the hon. member for Waterkloof, who tried to make a point of the fact that the hon. member for Yeoville spoke first whereas I am only speaking now. The reason is very simple. The hon. member for Yeoville kindly agreed to speak yesterday in case I had not returned from a very important event which took place in Durban North. That is the simple explanation for this. The point which the hon. member for Waterkloof made is that there is now supposedly a dispute with regard to the Luanda story. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I did not interrupt the hon. member for Waterkloof. I am replying to him. The hon. member for Yeoville said that, seen in the overall context, it was a mistake to enter Angola. He said that yesterday, but he added that when they went in, they should have made a good job of it. He and I do not differ on that score, but as to whether it was a mistake for us to have gone in the first place, in view of the consequences that confront us, we are 100&#x0025; in agreement. I shall come back to the so-called arguments advanced by the hon. member for Krugersdorp. Sir, it is simple. Our objection to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s amendment was just that it was an amendment which was calculated to smother responsible political debate on Angola. We could not discuss the consequences and we believed that the consequences had to be debated. We believed&#x2014;and this was subsequently proved&#x2014;that it was an attempt on the part of the Government to smother criticism, and I can furnish a very cynical illustration of this. Senator Worrall launched his campaign in Durban North by saying: &#x201C;We knocked hell out of the Cubans&#x201D;, and he was rapped over the knuckles by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and, I should think, by the caucus, too, because subsequently he changed his tune. This has been denied, but the campaign in Durban North was concluded by a television production which showed &#x201C;how we knocked the hell out of the Cubans&#x201D;. Why could we not discuss that from the outset? That is precisely what the issue was as far as we were concerned, viz. that we did not want to permit this kind of double-talk. We refused to remain silent about this in the interests of South Africa because we believed that the people had to be informed with regard to the consequences of the political decision of the kind taken in Angola.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that as far as I am concerned&#x2014;I said that it was surprising that the hon. the Minister of Defence saw fit to reopen the Angola debate&#x2014;we shall argue about this if the Government wishes. I think we should leave Angola and learn from it. The most important lesson we have learned from Angola and our involvement, is how vital it is in South Africa for our effective preparedness to be based on the loyalty of all our people. To me this is the most important thing which Angola has taught us, and this is what the debate should really be about, and not personal attacks or the sowing of suspicion or the questioning of loyalty. This does not work. <span class="col_6251-6252" refersTo="page_0456"/>People do not believe it because they know that it is not true and the best proof of this is the fact that we have now taken over that seat, too, in spite of the most sustained campaign against us by other members of the House. In spite of that campaign against our loyalty and our patriotism, the people have perceived that we were prepared to discuss what we believed to be in the interests of the whole of South Africa, and we intend to continue to do so.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rondebosch referred here to certain news reports and based his speech on them. Once again this just goes to show how dangerous it can be when certain reports appear in our news media which are really of more danger than benefit to our country. This being so, I think it is necessary for us to bear in mind the agreement between the S. A. Defence Force and the news media as far as reporting is concerned.</p>

<p>Section 118 of the Defence Act lays down what the media may and may not publish. Basically, what it amounts to that nothing can be published about our Defence Force unless it has been approved by the hon. the Minister of Defence or his authorized representative. I should very much have liked to quote from this Act but it would take up too much of my time. However, I very much want to request the news media to study this Act once again. Owing to the fact that this Act is very strict and covers a very wide sphere, the news media take care not to get into trouble by contravening the Act. Therefore, to facilitate the task of the news media the Minister of Defence has concluded an agreement with the National Press Union. This agreement includes certain arrangements, and I therefore want to suggest that the news media attend to this.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister undertook, among other things, to establish a Directorate of Public Relations to serve as a link between the S.A. Defence Force and the news media. This link has been in operation for eight years now. Apart from this, the activities of the directorate have developed to such an extent that the three arms of the Defence Force, viz. the Army, the Air Force and the Navy, each employs liaison officers, too, in order to serve the media. I understand that these services are going to be expanded further in order to be of further assistance to the news media. I should appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could inform us how far this matter has progressed. I am told that with a few exceptions, relations between the Defence Force and the news media have been fairly good over the past eight years. However, during the Angolan episode, the relationship gave rise to tension between the Defence Force and sections of the news media for the first time. The hon. the Minister referred to this during the no-confidence debate. I do not want to repeat everything now because time does not permit.</p>

<p>However, what the problem amounts to, basically, is that in the nature of the matter, the news media want to publish as much as possible whereas the Defence Force, on the other hand, wants to release as little information as possible. Both parties realize that a compromise between these two extreme standpoints must be found. I believe that the majority of our news media are satisfied with the basis of co-operation that does exist. At this point I want to convey my thanks to this majority, which has made a positive contribution to our country by way of sound reporting. However, there are certain newspapers&#x2014;as mentioned by the hon. the Minister&#x2014;which did not want to co-operate. They must realize that we are living at a time at which it is not in the interests of the security of our country to release too much information concerning military matters and our involvement. By doing so we could only play into the hands of our enemies. Our media must take care that they do not become the tool of the Marxist propaganda machine. The cry should not have been &#x201C;What are our soldiers doing in Angola?&#x201D; It should have been: &#x201C;What are Cuba and Russia doing there?&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Our news media should have hammered on this theme day in and day out. Just as they have been criticizing our authorities ceaselessly, they should rather have devoted all their time and ability to exposing Russia and Cuba. They should have drawn the attention of the world to those two countries&#x2019; unholy and unlawful Angolan ploy. Why do some of our news media want to lay such extreme emphasis on the splinter in South Africa&#x2019;s eye, while the beam in the eye of our enemies is ignored? <span class="col_6253-6254" refersTo="page_0457"/>There is a tendency to call all our actions into question and this can only be to the benefit of our enemies. There are sections of our news media which have what could be called &#x201C;the death-wish&#x201D; for our country. Is their hate of this Government so deeply rooted that they want to subvert and eliminate South Africa and its security?</p>

<p>The statement has been made by certain newspapers&#x2014;this includes certain Afrikaans-language newspapers&#x2014;that we should not publish military information which may assist the enemy. They state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Al wat ons verlang, is dat die volk deur die owerhede in vertroue geneem moet word.</block>

<p>I ask how these people want this to be done. The hon. the Minister and his department have made various considered statements. Various considered statements by other spokesmen, too, have been permitted. There was even a mission of prominent businessmen and newsmen on the border. Now, apparently, they are asking that we furnish the newspapers with secret information and tell them: Publish it in the newspapers, but see to it that the enemy does not get hold of it. Apparently we must tell the SABC: Talk to our people on the radio, but please just ask them to close their doors and their windows so that no one outside can hear what is going on inside.</p>

<p>I say that we must have more confidence in our leaders. We can differ on many things, but when it comes to the security of the country, we must or ought all to stand together as one man. Every word that is said or published has a meaning, and a misplaced word here or there could allow valuable strategic information to get through to the enemy and this could cost thousands of soldiers their lives. It is our people whose lives are at stake and who are in danger. We must accept that the news media can strengthen or subvert the morale of a people. We must take care that confusion and distrust is not sown. The news media have a major responsibility to motivate our people positively. Irrespective or our political differences, South Africa remains our country; we have no other home. We must say nothing and write nothing which could harm our security. The threat to our Republic is not going to disappear and we shall have to learn to live with it, because it could last for years. Because modern warfare is concerned with the morale of the people and its motivation to fight or to capitulate, it is necessary for our news media to search their own hearts and ask themselves: Have I, in all honesty, done everything in my power to support South Africa and assist in defeating the enemy, or have my motives been &#x201C;publish and be damned&#x201D; because sensation and circulation statistics are of more importance than my country and my people? To conclude, I want to appeal to our news media to proffer their full co-operation to our Defence Force at all times, as in the past, because this can only be to their own benefit and to the benefit of every man, woman and child living in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Ladybrand raised the question of the news media, their motivation and the whole question of their relationship with the Defence Force. I think the hon. member is correct in referring to this, but when one looks at the recent past, one must also take into account that the media are also dependent upon sources of information. One of the tragedies of the Angolan situation was that reliable information was not available. Indeed, as I will show in the course of my few comments, there was total confusion in the statements which came from members of the South African Cabinet. In those circumstances it was understandable that the media would have great difficulty in finding the correct picture to present to the South African public.</p>

<p>The evidence that the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s amendment&#x2014;it never was a motion; it was an amendment to the motion of no confidence&#x2014;was a political trick, lies in the number of occasions on which the hon. members refer to this. If it was not a political trick, then they would have forgotten about it long ago. Let us for the sake of the record say that three days before that trick amendment was moved and long before the rest of the debate had taken place, I on behalf of the members of this side of the House spoke in the debate. I said (Hansard, 26 January 1976, cols. 97-98)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On behalf of us on these benches I would like to pay a tribute to young South Africa. We believe that they have risen to the occasion and that they will continue to do so in future. As those in times gone by, so <span class="col_6255-6256" refersTo="page_0458"/>these young South Africans too are a credit to South Africa &#x2026; We would like to express our sincerest sympathy to the parents and families of those who have lost their lives.</block>

<p>I went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would also, on this occasion, like to pay a tribute to those gentlemen who head our defence forces. In a critical time like this, South Africa is indeed fortunate to have at the head of our forces men who combine such a high degree of competence and integrity. Our confidence in them goes a long way towards offsetting the degree of lack of confidence that we have in those who head the political arm of Government. I believe that the defence force deserves the support of the people of South Africa.</block>

<p>That is our attitude and it will not change. We will certainly not become involved in the trick amendments we have heard; they were heard, as it turns out, for party-political reasons. Immediately after that, <i>Die Burger,</i> for instance, said that the amendment of the Prime Minister was an indication of total approval of what the Government did in Angola. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central went off to Magogong where he said that the United Party, in supporting this amendment, was giving its total support to the Government in its involvement in Angola. He said that in spite of the fact that it was in direct contradiction with what the hon. member &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>You are not quoting him correctly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then the hon. member can get up and quote it correctly. It was support for the Government and it was in direct contradiction with what was said by his bench mates on either side of him. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has certainly recovered. He has shown himself to be his old self again and, regrettably, the situation still obtains that this hon. Minister, try as he might to keep politics out of army matters or defence force matters, finds it an irresistible temptation to play party politics with military matters in South Africa. I want to say that I share the personal sense of shock expressed by the hon. member for Yeoville at the breach of confidentiality which took place in this House yesterday. When one reads Hansard, one sees that it was purely to score a political debating point off this hon. member. It had nothing to do with the merits of the case or of the argument&#x2014;it was plain party politics. I am totally unimpressed by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation or by the explanation given by the hon. member for Waterkloof. Whilst a part of that journey to the north consisted of a briefing session, I think that others who have any appreciation of military matters will agree with me&#x2014;perhaps my brief training as an intelligence corporal in a war taught me this&#x2014;what I saw at Ruacana and at Runtu, what I heard during the discussions I had with the generals and others, and the people I saw at Runtu and elsewhere, I accept as confidential. I am absolutely shocked that the hon. the Minister now says that whatever one saw or heard during that two-day visit to the north, including the discussions we had with South African military personnel, was not confidential. I am shocked that the hon. the Minister took a single statement, made by the hon. member, out of the confidential area purely in order to score political debating points across the floor of the House.</p>

<p>This is not the first time it has happened. I can recall that, two years ago when the hon. the Prime Minister started his d&#x00E9;tente exercise and when the hon. member for Rondebosch and I returned to South Africa after seeing Pres. Sir Seretse Khama, Pres. Kaunda and Gen. Gowon, this hon. Minister said that we were the people who were prostrating ourselves at the feet of those who were the friends of murderers and the rapists of our women. He has embarrassed the foreign ministry and the hon. the Prime Minister and I believe that with his statement yesterday he has embarrassed our defence forces. I say: Thank heaven for all of us in South Africa that we have gentlemen of the nature of Admirals Biermann and Johnson and Generals Rogers, Magnus Malan and others who, I believe, are trying desperately and, I think, correctly and successfully to keep party politics out of the South African defence forces. However, when the hon. the Minister reopens the Angola situation, when he complains that he has been misunderstood, that people are telling untruths and so on, I want to say to him that this Government has only itself to blame because to this very day <span class="col_6257-6258" refersTo="page_0459"/>the Government has not told the truth about Angola. I think it is a disgrace that, six months after our youngsters were involved in heroic battles, only now are we starting to hear the story. Fancy entering into a war secretly. Fancy it that youngsters who, having been engaged in a battle, are not allowed to tell the story and talk about the circumstances in which we became involved in this. I say it is a disgrace. I think the Government made a blunder in getting us involved in the civil war in Angola and not telling the people of South Africa, the parents and the voters, what was taking place.</p>

<p>There are three points that emerge very clearly, and this hon. Minister, having reopened the issue, has not yet told the truth. The first one is the nature of our involvement in Angola. According to all the evidence before us, we were involved in the civil war in Angola. The hon. the Minister can go on arguing, but until he can give the facts, until he tells the whole story, we have to believe that we were involved, that we did intervene, that we did break our consistent attitude of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries. We did become involved in Angola.</p>

<p>Secondly I want to mention the constant reference to the United States. Yesterday the hon. the Minister again did not come clean. He suggested that it was the United States that had given us certain assurances. He suggested it by a reference to President Ford and his criticism of the Senate, when it declined to pass legislation or give support to legislation for further involvement in Angola. I believe that the hon. the Minister owes it to South Africa, to the whole d&#x00E9;tente exercise and to our relationships with the Western world, to tell the truth about whether we had been promised military aid or not. I say this, because the only definitive statement made so far in this matter has not come from the South African Government. There has been a definitive statement from the U.S. Embassy in which it said in very clear and categorical terms, that what the hon. the Minister is suggesting is untrue. I believe this has to be resolved. I do not want a South African Government&#x2014;even if it is a nationalist Government&#x2014;to live on with a cloud of mistrust hanging over it. The American Embassy statement said quite categorically &#x201C;South Africa entered the Angola war on its own accord and to protect its own interests. This involvement was undertaken without either consultation with, or any kind of assurance from the USA.&#x201D; [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister should deal with this question. He should have done so yesterday. He alluded once again to President Ford and to the decision by the U.S. Congress. However, Ambassador Pik Botha surely told him repeatedly during that period that he could not expect any support from the United States Congress. I cannot believe that a competent ambassador sitting in the United States, could not have told this Government that, although it may be relying on support from the USA, it should know that Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives would not approve it.</p>

<p>The last question that I want to deal with is the question of whether we have achieved our objectives. One of the objectives was to prevent a MPLA take-over. The hon. the Prime Minister stated that it was to see that there were no Russians or Cubans there. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether&#x2014;if that was one of our objectives&#x2014;we succeeded in that objective. I have no doubt that as an operational exercise our military men acquitted themselves with distinction. However, I believe that as a political exercise this Government has committed a disastrous blunder. This is going to have an effect on d&#x00E9;tente and also on the defence of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this morning the hon. Leader of the PRP once again tried to overwhelm us with a torrent of words. However, what South Africa asks of that party is not just words. It is asking for deeds from that party. However, I now want to leave it at that because I should prefer to say something more positive about the S.A. Defence Force. However, I want to refer in passing to what the hon. member for Rondebosch had to say. He wants us to forget about the Angolan episode. At the same time, however, his party is dragging in the Angolan issue here in Cape Town by distributing a pamphlet about it. I believe that there is no longer place for double-talk of this kind in South Africa.</p>

<p>While the conflict in Angola was taking place, we made use of two categories of soldier. There were the career soldiers, and also national servicemen and volunteers from the commandos and the citizen force. In any <span class="col_6259-6260" refersTo="page_0460"/>future conflict here in Southern Africa we shall, for the most part, have to make use of those categories again. According to all the evidence those men, from both categories, acquitted themselves of their task with distinction. We are justly very proud of them. That, too, is why it was gratifying to be able to hear yesterday that consideration is apparently to be given to awarding medals to some of those men. I trust that the units involved in the fighting in Angola will also be permitted to display their battle distinctions on their colours. In both cases, however, sacrifices had to be made so that we in South Africa could be free today.</p>

<p>There is an important obligation on us today. There is an obligation on us to look after the companions as well as the next-of-kin of those who have perished. It is the least we can do. Looking at the dispensation as regards remuneration or general conditions of service of our permanent force staff, what do we see? Taking everything into account this remuneration is reasonably comparable with the salaries in the rest of the Public Service. However, we are continuing to lose people to the private sector. Why is this so? Money and salary do play a part, but in my opinion another very important consideration also applies. Nowadays our Defence Force men are very much sought after owing to the training they have received, but also, for the most part, owing to the discipline of the people in the Defence Force. They are very much sought after in the private sector. The private sector is prepared to pay good salaries to disciplined people. The initial salaries and benefits of permanent force staff could perhaps be improved. In my opinion we are losing too many people and getting too few.</p>

<p>Another aspect I want to refer to is the housing scheme of the Defence Force. Although it is very good at the moment, I do not think it is adequate. This is one of the most important advantages of a career in the Defence Force, enabling us to recruit and retain people for the Defence Force. I am aware of the problems in this regard but nevertheless I want to request the Government to make more money available for housing for members of the permanent force, if possible.</p>

<p>Today the permanent force really offers an adventurous and challenging career to any young person, a career in which any young man and any young woman can realize themselves to the full. We were happy to take cognizance yesterday of the promotion of a young man to the highest place in the Defence Force. I am convinced that there are few callings today in which a greater spirit of comradeship exists than in the South African Defence Force, where one really gets the feeling that one can physically serve one&#x2019;s country and one&#x2019;s people and where one can really express one&#x2019;s patriotism in practice in a tangible way, through deeds. Our young men will be very much at home and welcome in the Defence Force.</p>

<p>I also want to dwell for a moment on the care of the next-of-kin of soldiers who have been injured or have perished in the execution of their duties. As a typical example I want to refer hon. members to a 28-year-old member of the permanent force who is discharged from service or retired after 10 years because he is 100&#x0025; disabled as a result of injuries sustained while on duty. This person earned R4 800 per annum. By virtue of the fact that he contributes to the Government Pension Fund, he will receive an annuity of R4 461 and a cash gratuity of R15 000. In my opinion this will never be quite enough, but it is fair and adequate to live on. The widow of a member of the permanent force who has perished will receive an amount of R2 000 as an annuity, by virtue of the fact that her spouse had contributed to a pension fund, whereas in terms of the regulations applicable in his case, an amount of about R35 000 would be paid out to her.</p>

<p>Looking at the position of citizen force and commando soldiers who sustain injuries, one notes that their benefits are regulated by the War Pensions Act, No. 82 of 1967, as amended. I do not have time to give hon. members the full details, but a married person with one dependant who is 100&#x0025; disabled will receive a maximum benefit of R313 a month. In most cases, however, it will be far less. Hon. members will agree with me that an improvement ought to be effected here. However, the spouse and next-of-kin of a member of the citizen force or the commandos who perishes, are far worse off. The highest pension benefits a widow can receive in such a case are R149 per month and a gratuity of R264. I am convinced that in this case improvements must be effected as speedily as possible for our people. Although the War Pensions Act is administered and handled by a <span class="col_6261-6262" refersTo="page_0461"/>different hon. Minister and department, I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Defence to assist in improving the position of our soldiers and their next-of-kin in the circumstances mentioned. I do this in the interests of our soldiers who will have to do duty on the border again in the future, if necessary. In this connection I also want to mention the contributions made by the public to the various funds established to assist the dependants of soldiers&#x2014;this is really most deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>To conclude, I want to make one remark about the behaviour of our insurance companies. In spite of the clause in most of the policies taken out by our people to the effect that in the case of injury, no money would be paid if the injury was sustained in the course of war service, in all cases our South African insurance companies paid the full sum assured to the people. I think we can only take note of this with the deepest gratitude. It is with gratitude and appreciation, too, that we take cognizance of the new kind of insurance policies which are now being made available for this purpose.</p>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not wish to follow up the hon. member for Verwoerdburg&#x2019;s plea for compensation to dependants of injured members of the Permanent Force, except to say that I support his plea wholeheartedly. I believe it is extremely necessary that a review of the system be undertaken. I also want to express the hope that our missing airmen will survive and that they will be found. I wish to express my sympathy with their families. I want to convey our good wishes to Admiral Biermann on his retirement and to Lt. Gen. Malan on his new appointment. I should also like to express the appreciation of this side of the House for the fact that Admiral Biermann has accepted an appointment to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Advisory Committee. In this way his services and long experience will not be lost to South Africa. We are therefore extremely grateful to him for accepting that appointment. We would like to thank both these gentlemen and their senior staff for the excellent co-operation and assistance which we have, at all times, received from the Department of Defence. I want to thank them particularly for the trip we undertook to a military area earlier this year. We were extremely impressed by the quality of leadership and by the excellent morale of our troops. We regret that this visit has been abused by the PRP for its own political purposes. The hon. member for Sea Point was totally wrong when he said that the hon. the Minister had said that the information received during that trip was free and open. What the hon. the Minister said was that discussions at a public reception was free and open. I did not hear him say that all the information we received there was free and open. If one reads the publications of this party, one would think that the sole strategists of the whole Angolan operation were Genls. Schwarz, Eglin and Slabbert. If their behaviour is such as we see it now, after a military limited operation in Angola, I hate to think what their reaction would be if this country was suddenly involved in total war. There is no doubt that they would have absolute hysterics. I should also like to thank members of the Defence Force for their very frank briefing on the overall strategic situation which we received earlier this year. I want to give the assurance to the hon. the Minister and his senior officers that this side of the House will never use the information that we have received, for personal political gain. We would regard such action as a breach of good faith and, as such, not fitting an hon. member of this party.</p>

<p>We are also pleased that the hon. the Minister has given us information about some of the advances that we have made in modern conventional weaponry. I believe that this is something which the public wanted to know for a long time and we do not, in this dangerous world, expect him to divulge information about all our weapons. It would be foolhardy to make everything known to our enemies. As for the massive military display requested by the hon. member for Yeoville, what a foolhardy request! Can you imagine what the liberal Press of the world would say if we had to start with massive military displays in South Africa? That would merely add to all the insulting words already being used against this country. They would merely add the word &#x201C;militaristic&#x201D;. I believe that we should avoid this at all costs. Let us develop our Defence Force, expand our weaponry, train our men, but do not let us put it on show for all the world to see. I believe that would be totally wrong. The hon. the Minister has, during this debate, described our military capability as that of a medium military power. <span class="col_6263-6264" refersTo="page_0462"/>The controversial Secretary of State of the United States has recently said that we have enormous potential for chaos with the growth of the emerging nations who are full of resentment. The proliferation of nuclear weapons, the expansion of Soviet military strength&#x2014;all this has great danger. The former U.S. Secretary of Defence, James R. Schlesinger, in a recent article in <i>Fortune</i> said the following, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the gravest problem of the Western world is without question the loss of vision, of moral stamina and of national purpose. Mr. Schlesinger warns further that the West is clearly in disarray and within a few years it would actually be at bay.</block>

<p>Against this background I wish to make a suggestion, a suggestion to which the hon. the Minister need not reply of he feels it is not in the public interest to do so, but it is a suggestion that could at least take us to the status of being a mini super power.</p>

<p>We have some of the largest deposits of uranium in the world. Our scientists have evolved the world&#x2019;s cheapest method to enriching uranium. The plans for our first nuclear power station are well under way. We have the material and the capability to develop a nuclear capability. I believe that the time has come for us to devote time, money and manpower to the development of that capability, not to use it in the conquest of Africa, but as a deterrent to possible aggression in the dangerous world in which we live and as a protection for the peaceful and prosperous co-existence in Southern Africa. I believe that we should move in this direction, and I express the thought here. I believe also that we should move out with propaganda into the world and get the real South Africa to the outside world. I was grateful to see a cutting of <i>The Times</i> of Gloucester County, New Jersey, the other day. It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let it be realistic, South Africa is a civilized nation.</block>

<p>In this article&#x2014;it is a long one and I cannot quote everything&#x2014;Paul Johnston, a British socialist, is quoted as listing Soviet Russia as the world&#x2019;s most efficient tyranny. Then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Suppose then that somehow power were transferred to the Black African majority in South Africa. Does anyone at all doubt that South Africa will immediately become another Third World mess like all the others, not, may I add, because the Black South Africans are racially inferior, but because like practically all the Third World, they have not in the mass absorbed the traditions of civilization? &#x2026; South Africa is a Western nation, oppressive, yes, but also recognizably civilized in a variety of ways. In its foreign policy South Africa is Western-orientated, its strategic naval facilities at Simonstown are available for Western use and in the near future they are very likely to be vital to the US&#x2019;s strategic position in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. We have good commercial relations with South Africa. But if South Africa became another Third World mish-mash, all this would change. Some barbarian emperor or some Marxist out of the bush would be holding sway. The place would be swarming with Russians and Chinese, and you could forget about the naval base and the mineral resources of South Africa.</block>

<p>Then he concludes by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We really ought to begin to be tough-minded and even a bit arrogant about the difference between civilization and barbarism. After decades of indoctrination in liberal cultural relativism, however, we seem to behave as if all these cultures were somehow equal, barbarian and civilized alike. At the end of the road lies the heart of darkness.</block>

<p>Sir, I believe that we should avoid that heart of darkness by taking our South African image into the world in our defence.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. GREEFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, must pardon me if I do not comment on what he said. I am going to occupy my time a little with lofty and winged subjects. Before provision was made in the Defence Act of 1912 for the establishment of the South African Flying Corps, Gen. Smuts, who was at the time Minister of Defence, sent Lt.-Gen. Beyers abroad to England and Europe to attend army manoeuvres there. He was given specific <span class="col_6265-6266" refersTo="page_0463"/>instructions to ascertain what role the aircraft could play in future military actions. His second instruction, given to him by Gen Smuts, was also to obtain information in order to establish a military flying school in South Africa. Gen. Beyers returned and reported to Gen. Smuts in the following words: &#x201C;The aircraft is undoubtedly going to play an important part in future warfare.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, the limited time at my disposal does not allow me to relate the interesting events which I came across in the course of my reference work, but I do feel that I should like to mention the name of Compton Paterson, who at that time had a flying school at Alexander-fontein in Kimberley. He was instructed to train the first ten members of the South African Flying Corps. The First World War broke out afterwards, and when it was over the South African S.A. Air Force was established, with the then Col. Pierre van Ryneveld, later the well-known Sir Pierre van Ryneveld, as its first commander-in-chief. It is this Air Force which I should like to consider for a while, with, as the film has it, its &#x201C;magnificent men in their flying machines&#x201D;. Since its establishment the South African Air Force has grown into the most important military air force in the air space over the continent of Africa, and has definitely made a significant contribution to the stability of our country. During this time we have seen aircraft develop from the primitive bi-plane to the sleek, supersonic jets of today. The S.A. Air Force has kept pace with this, and its organization and nature, coupled with the proud achievements in times of war and peace, has truly justified the decision to allow the Air Force to exist as a separate Defence Force unit.</p>

<p>The battle honours of our Defence Force include place names over the entire continent of Africa, the Mediterranean area, deep into Europe, and in far-off Korea. Our country can boast of air crews of exceptionally high calibre, which may be attributed to their quick reactions, their ability to think fast, their courage and firmness of character, men inspired by an unequalled cameraderie and an imposing valour. In every sphere&#x2014;its aircraft, its training methods, its techniques and skill&#x2014;the S.A. Air Force is the equal of the best in the world, and it truly forms a mighty shield over the air space of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, let us for a while take a closer look at the Air Force. The training of air crews as well as ground staff is a lengthy and extremely expensive process for our modern high-performance aircraft. It is calculated that in order to train a Mirage or Buccaneer pilot it can easily take three years and cost an amount, in indirect and direct expenditure, of up to R1 million. In addition, then, he has to participate regularly in complicated flying exercises in order to retain his skill. It is therefore clear that a strong defence force of pilots should be maintained and that our pilots should be drawn from that pool. Our air crews are also subjected to strict physical and psychological tests, and it is imperative that they should be and should remain absolutely fit. They, too, receive training in the technical and administrative sections. In this way members of our Air Force undergo training and acquire proficiency in patrolling the borders of our country, in tracking down, identifying and pursuing foreign objects in good time. Through knowledge and experience our pilots are capable of becoming airborne within a few seconds, attacking calmly and purposefully, and destroying an enemy mercilessly. Reconnaisance work is done with patience and perseverance and by means of visual equipment and cameras. In this way enemy positions are quickly located and subsequent operational action is successfully carried out. In addition, I should just like to mention the role of our S.A. Air Force in interdictory operations, closer air support and maritime operations. In conclusion I should just like to mention the logistical organization of all these matters.</p>

<p>Sir, we must bear in mind, however, that a supersonic jet, diving and rolling gracefully without protest in the hands of a skilled pilot, is the culmination of a team effort, on the part of the ground staff as well, who have to carry out so much assembly and maintenance work and who have to ensure that radio and radar equipment is regularly serviced. Theirs is the honour of truly keeping our Air Force airborne.</p>

<p>I said last year during the discussion of this Vote that I would be the last person to object if the hon. the Minister of Defence asked for twice the amount of his budget. I want to repeat that sentence here today. We here in South Africa have grown accustomed to living in peace and quiet. We do not bear in mind that this is the result of a vigilant Government. But now that hostile eyes close to our borders <span class="col_6267-6268" refersTo="page_0464"/>are fixing their greedy gaze at our country, hoping to take it away from us, I feel that it is the duty of all of us, of every member of our population to give what they have now, and to make sacrifices and also to pay for the efficient defence of our country.</p>

<p>Sir, what is our duty to our country with a view to the future and particularly as far as the Air Force is concerned? Just this, that our Air Force must become bigger, stronger and even better equipped, and that we must extend the Atlas factory and equip it in such a way that more and more aircraft will roll off the assembly line&#x2014;literally roll off&#x2014;in that factory. South Africa has the competent, skilled and resourceful manpower. We have the necessary raw materials and the material, and new, sophisticated aircraft can be manufactured by us. I believe that we are in fact able to do so, aircraft which are better and faster than any others in the world. South Africa has already shown its strength in the past and we shall do so again in future. Our Air Force is already extremely well equipped with the fastest aircraft in the world, but &#x201C;extremely good&#x201D; must never for us become &#x201C;good enough&#x201D;. We must strive only for the best.</p>

<p>That, then, is the S.A. Air Force of today, an air force which through development and achievements has engraved its name indelibly on the pages of the military history of the world, and which in future, as in the past, will continue to guard inexorably over what is near and dear to us. Sir, I conclude by saying: Together with the S.A. Air Force we soar with faith and confidence into the blue unknown of the future, true to its motto: &#x201C;Per aspera ad astra&#x201D;&#x2014;through adversity to the stars.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to begin with I want to associate myself with the words of appreciation conveyed to Admiral Biermann and the words of congratulation conveyed to Lt.-Gen. Malan. I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate our hon. the Minister sincerely on the great honour which befell him of becoming probably the only person in Africa and definitely the only person in South Africa on whom the highest honour in military science was conferred by one of our universities. I think we are all very proud of the fact that a man such as this can be at the head of our Defence Force.</p>

<p>May I also be allowed to express just a single idea on the PRP. Every ounce of loyalty in me rebels utterly against the mere idea of in any way debating defence matters with those hon. members. I shall let that suffice.</p>

<p>I should like to express a few thoughts on the Special Defence Account, and the particular bottlenecks in regard to that account. The manufacture of armaments&#x2014;and I am referring now to modern armaments&#x2014;is probably the most difficult task one can find in the engineering industry. Apart from hand weapons all armaments&#x2014;tanks, ships, aircraft, missiles and rockets&#x2014;are today equipped with the most sophisticated electronic components imaginable. Let us make no mistake about this either; without these components a Mirage, for example, is worth almost as much as an ordinary, old-fashioned Piper Moth of 1910. With the acquisition of armaments there are two cardinal problems with which the Government and we in this House can be of assistance. These two problems are the problem of money and the problem of the time scale.</p>

<p>The great problem which we have at present in our entire defence set-up is that of time scales. The smaller a country and the more restricted its means for the purchase of armaments, the more important it is that the size, distribution and the time scale of those estimates should be watched very carefully. To be able to do this, there is one very important requirement, and that is the flexibility of financial arrangements.</p>

<p>Consequently we may justifiably ask: How flexible is this Special Defence Account of R897 million? Firstly we must consider Act No. 6 of 1974. In contrast to previous years, that Act now provides that any credits on that account, for whatever reason, may be carried over for spending in the next year. We also see that the concept of item budgeting, which requires Treasury approval for the transference of sums from one armament requirements item to another, has now fallen away. Therefore, we see now that within our defence forces there is an exceptional flexibility in respect of the distribution of funds. Since the purchase of virtually all armaments is a long-term project, which could extend over years, a long-term budgeting programme, as is at present being followed by the Department of Defence, is imperative because orders placed this year already impose a heavy burden on any budget <span class="col_6269-6270" refersTo="page_0465"/>which may be introduced the next year and in following years. In this way one can, by means of a budgeting programme, also control the size of one&#x2019;s budget reasonably effectively.</p>

<p>But such a long-term programme has two term legs. The first leg is in connection with the delivery period after the order has been placed. The second leg is in connection with the preparatory term before the orders are placed, in other words the period required to make studies and evaluations, which can take months and sometimes years. To carry out a study and make an evaluation in the same year in which the armaments funds are made available, is actually an impossible task. This means that studies and evaluations have to be commenced years before the time; to tell the truth, even long before any funds for the acquisition of such armaments can be appropriated. This creates two problems. Since men with the necessary knowledge of armaments manufacture are tremendously scarce throughout the world, the manufacturers are disinclined to allow such people to undertake study and evaluation if the possibility of a tender or eventual order does not exist. This is the first problem, and the second concerns the orders. To make effective deliveries possible, orders placed with manufacturers have to fit in with their production programmes. If an order is placed in such a way that it does fit in, the delivery of armaments can be brought forward by months. The fact that an order can only be placed when the necessary funds are available, makes it virtually impossible for orders to fit in with the production programmes of overseas manufacturers. If time allowed, I would have liked to have quoted a few examples from the past of cases where the delivery of armaments was delayed by many months.</p>

<p>In my opinion this problem can however be solved if the amount which is required for new armaments has already been approved for the ensuing financial year. Let me explain this. The funds which are required during the 1977-&#x2019;78 financial year, should already have been approved in our present estimates&#x2014;i.e. for the 1976-&#x2019;77 financial year&#x2014;but without the total appropriation for armaments being affected. The one exception should be that in this year&#x2019;s estimates authorization is only being granted for orders to be placed on the estimates for the ensuing financial year. The benefits which can flow from this, is that it will be far more convenient to cause orders to fit in with the production programmes. In view of the time problem which we are already experiencing at present, I should like to ascertain whether the hon. the Minister will be prepared to obtain approval during the present year already of an amount of approximately R150 million for spending on new armaments in 1977-&#x2019;78. Such an arrangement could obviate the limitations on the preparatory time for the studying and the placing of orders for new projects to a great extent. My plea is that, if it is not possible to obtain approval in the present year already for an additional amount in the 1977-&#x2019;78 estimates, he should consider the principle of all armaments estimates in respect of the Special Defence Account extending over two years in future, and that in the estimates for the current year an amount will be approved which may be spent on new armaments during the ensuing financial year. If this is done, the placing of orders over a longer period will be possible.</p>

<speech by="#snyman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. SNYMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if there were ever a time when the spotlight was clearly focused on our Defence Force, it is now. The Angolan situation clearly emphasized the essentialness of total Defence Force preparedness. In the time at my disposal I want to refer briefly to two aspects of the S.A. Defence Force. The Angolan situation brought the reality of conventional warfare on South African soil to our attention in very clear language. In fact, conventional warfare is being regarded, to an ever increasing extent, even by the Big Powers such as France, as still being the power-determining factor in the modern world. Therefore it is necessary in these times of threats and rumours of war, for us to look with critical eyes at aspects of even the S.A. Air Force, for example. I want to refer in particular to the Fighter Command Headquarters with its base at Pietersburg, which is the seat of the 85th Advanced Flying School. I can state without fear of contradiction that at this school, Air Force men are being trained, shaped and moulded in the best traditions of a famous Air Force, which compelled respect from friend and foe alike in the Second World War and in Korea, for example. I make so bold as to say that anyone who has had the opportunity of witnessing the real competence, the experience and the true mastery of our young pilots who are being <span class="col_6271-6272" refersTo="page_0466"/>trained there, will realize that we are dealing here with a young generation of Air Force men who are better than the best in the entire world today. These men are not only being equipped with the highest technical skills, but if one speaks to them, one gains the impression that they are inspired with such a measure of inspiring motivation that it puts one involuntarily in mind of a leopard lying in wait for its prey. The hands of these young men are itching to accomplish the object for which they joined the Air Force.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal pointed out the tremendous expense involved in training a pilot at the present time. If one takes this into consideration one can form some idea of the tremendous task resting on the shoulders of our training officers in the Air Force. Therefore it is good to see that, according to the particulars published in the 1976-&#x2019;77 building programme of the Department of Public Works, an amount of R1 165 000 has been provided for improvements to the Air Force base at Pietersburg. I want to tell the people of little faith and the faint-hearted in the far Northern Transvaal&#x2014;there are a few of them there, as there are learned people who wish to flee the country&#x2014;that this action on the part of the Government undoubtedly underlines the permanence of the <i>lebensraum</i> also of those of us in the far Northern Transvaal. As a result of the tremendous expense connected with the Air Force, it is therefore clear that we are dealing here with a highly sophisticated weapon for which highly sophisticated training is required, and that these men will, in the nature of things, be drawn primarily from the Permanent Force. Now, it is true that some of these men are being lost to the Air Force. I want to join the hon. member for False Bay in asking the hon. the Minister to give consideration in depth to the salary structure of the Defence Force, particularly when we are dealing with a Permanent Force element such as the one at Pietersburg where, on the same base, there are also members of an organization such as the Atlas Aircraft Corporation. These people mingle socially and as a result it is essential to eliminate any inequality in wages and other benefits completely. We should far rather make these professions so attractive that we draw only the best human material among our people to them. Even our enemies must realize that our Air Force is not only powerful for the moment only, but that there is also the necessary depth in our Air Force.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to refer briefly to the South African Medical Service. If there is one aspect of the South African Defence Force of which the support service is probably the most precious to it, then it is in fact the medical service. A soldier can only give of his best when he realizes that his welfare is being effectively looked after on the battlefield. Just the mere knowledge that there is a medical practitioner or a medical orderly in the vicinity has a calming influence on the soldier and enables him to offer greater resistance to battle fatigue. Experience has also shown that soldiers who are better motivated can offer greater resistance to battle fatigue or &#x201C;wound shock&#x201D; as it is popularly known. Therefore I also want to tell the parents of our young soldiers that those soldiers of whom the parents are also inspired with patriotism and encourage their sons and who are proud of their achievements on our borders, are undoubtedly more spiritually resilient than the others. They are far more positively orientated to war service. Our parents therefore have a bounden duty in this regard, a duty to contribute their share, in this respect as well, to the welfare, to the correct psychological orientation of our young soldiers who are issued with every possible item of equipment to be able to give of their best for their country.</p>

<p>However, I want to come to what I regard as the greatest achievement of the South African Medical Service. We are a small nation, but in spite of that we also have our quota of drug addicts among our young people, young people whose lives are being mercilessly shattered in order to destroy and demolish the spiritual and moral resilience of our people as a prelude to a calculated hostile take-over. It is alarming to hear that the vast majority of servicemen had acquired their problem at school. At school they smoked their first dagga cigarette, swallowed their first drug tablet. This is the fact of which we must take cognizance. Ours is a small nation and therefore we cannot afford to lose these young men. Consequently the Defence Force, under the guidance of Gen. Cocroft, has devised a plan to reclaim those young men for our Defence Force. For that purpose a full-fledged combat company of 4th South African Infantry Battalion has been established in the heart of <span class="col_6273-6274" refersTo="page_0467"/>the Bushveld with Greeffswald as its base. There, at one of our country&#x2019;s most beautiful natural bases, in the midst of the breathtaking natural beauty so unique to our Transvaal bushveld, great results are being achieved with the help of chaplains, psychologists and medical practitioners, which are unparalleled in the rest of the world. I say this without the least fear of contradiction. The success rate at that base is more than 60&#x0025;, while the accepted success rate in the world at present is only between 6&#x0025; and 7&#x0025;. Here life gains a new meaning for young men who have been dragged down into the abyss of drug addiction. Here a new love for their fatherland reawakens and they realize fully once again their involvement in a country and in a people. They realize anew that they belong to a country and to a people, and that, as a result, they also have an obligation to that country and those people. There reawakens the willingness to sacrifice everything, even their lives, to protect and preserve what is dear to them. Those men of the 3rd Combat Company of 4th South African Infantry Battalion indeed have nothing to be ashamed of. They form part of a comprehensive programme to reclaim precious young lives in South Africa and the whole of South Africa is indeed proud of them.</p>

<p>I should like to quote a passage from a group discussion which recently occurred there. One of these servicemen said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Al wat ek na afloop van my nasionale diensplig wil doen, is om teenoor my ouers te probeer vergoed vir al die leed wat ek hulle aangedoen het. Dit is my grootste en my enigste begeerte op hierdie oomblik.</block>

<p>In my opinion what emanates from this is a new spirit of a will to live and a determination in life. At Greeffswald useful citizens are being reclaimed, useful citizens, not only for the Defence Force, but for our entire country. This great task of the South African Defence Force is something which is also worthy of our praise and gratitude in this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are some of the things that the hon. member has said with which I agree. However, I first want to deal with a number of specific issues before returning to a broader issue. The first aspect I would like to deal with, is the question of the multiplicity of funds which is presently in existence in order to provide assistance to servicemen and their families, and to ex-servicemen. I believe that this multiplicity of funds, though it stems from extremely good motives, is in fact causing additional administrative costs, is in fact causing a wastage of manpower and women-power. The question I would like to pose is whether it is not desirable that, in the present circumstances, there should be a consolidation of the various funds which are in existence, and whether the time has not come that we should have a similar fund &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>What I am saying is that there should be a national fund and a consolidation.</p>

<p>May I now deal with the second point which I want to raise? This is a point which I raised yesterday, but to which the hon. the Minister did not reply, namely the issue of the <span class="col_6275-6276" refersTo="page_0468"/>continued control of the Army and the other arms of the services by the Public Service Commission. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to deal specifically with this issue in the light of the undertakings which he has given, because it is quite illogical that the generals of the Army and the admirals of the Navy should be put on comparative scales with people in departments with whom there is no comparison whatsoever. I can see no reason why the Defence Force should continue to operate under the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>A third point on which I should like to touch is the very large number of casualties which have occurred as a result of the action of mines which have been placed at various places on our borders. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us a little bit more, within the ambit of what he is able to do and not affecting security, of the vehicles that are being developed and have been developed to deal with this matter, e.g. whether these are available in adequate numbers, because it has been made public that these vehicles have been developed. We have heard very little about them and we continue to have casualties as a result of mines. I am not suggesting, of course, that the vehicles would solve the mine problem.</p>

<p>Another point on which I should like to hear the hon. the Minister is to what extent research is being done, and substantial research, to deal with the problem of mines, both from the point of view of detection and from the point of view of methods to deal with them. I would specifically like to refer the hon. the Minister to the fact that I believe there is considerable scope for research when it comes to dealing with the condition of roads and how one can treat and deal with roads when it comes to the presence of mines.</p>

<p>The next point with which I should like to deal is with regard to the exploitation of the situation in which South Africa finds itself, militarily for political purposes, the exploitation which takes place of the fact that South Africans must serve in the Forces and, thirdly, the exploitation that takes place with regard to the worries of parents&#x2014;all of this exploitation for political purposes. There is no better example of this than the poster which was put up all over Durban North and the pamphlet which was issued by the NP in terms of which it was said in so many words that &#x201C;There is someone&#x2019;s son somewhere on the border. Support him. Worrall Will&#x201D;. This is designed to exploit for political purposes the fact that we are all involved in this, that it is the sons of people in all political parties who are involved in this and it is being exploited for a petty party political purpose of which the hon. the Minister should be ashamed. I believe that the sooner people realize that the defence of South Africa is not something to turn into a political football, the better it will be for South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to return to the subject which was dealt with yesterday, a very serious one, namely the subject of the breach of confidentiality by the hon. the Minister. In this particular context I want to &#x2026;</p>

One cannot sort one little piece of this out and say that this is something one is entitled to disclose whilst other matters cannot be disclosed. But this is precisely what the hon. the Minister did. He knows, as well as everybody else who was there, that the confidential discussions during the trip were not restricted to the briefing session. The hon. the Minister knows it. He <span class="col_6277-6278" refersTo="page_0469"/>also knows that the discussion to which he referred yesterday was not a discussion which, as was alleged, was held in front of 50 or 100 people who had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Yeoville once gain indulged in an emotional attack on the hon. the Minister of Defence. However, in the process he failed to reply to the pertinent questions which were put to him yesterday. He hides behind an innocent pamphlet which the NP distributed in Durban. Is it such a terrible sin when a candidate declares in an election that he supports our sons on the borders and stands by them? It is, after all, the duty of all of us to do this, and it is the right of a candidate to express sentiments of this kind in an election. Will the hon. member for Yeoville get up and express the same sentiments? Why does he not get up and repudiate the allegations in the pamphlet distributed by his party? The hon. member has had a great deal of time in the debate to do this, but up to now he has not replied to the questions which the hon. the Minister put to him yesterday.</p>

<p>I should very much like to come back to another matter which is of great importance to me and to all of us. I think I can say that, in spite of criticism here and there, there is a very high regard for our Defence Force in South Africa today. However, the question arises whether we think sufficiently of the men forming part of the Defence Force. I am now referring to the man in uniform. Do we think about the fact that he is also a human being with needs peculiar to the human being? The hon. member for Pietersburg in his speech emphasized the auxiliary service rendered by the medical corps.</p>

<p>In the course of my speech I should like to stress another very important auxiliary service, i.e. the service rendered by chaplains.</p>

<speech by="#badenhorst">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Before the House adjourned for lunch, I said that I, in the course of my speech, should like to focus attention on the work which is done by our chaplains in the Defence Force. I am convinced of the fact that South Africa has brave men and we are assured that our young boys, in crisis situations, are among the best soldiers in the world. But in spite of the fact that one can handle weapons, is knowledgeable and ingenious, and wants very little militarily and physically, it is absolutely essential that there should exist a sound spirit from which must flow the will to fight and to be victorious. We are very grateful that the South African Defence Force appreciates this. This is endorsed by the fact that the chaplain corps, which was established in 1946 with only two posts, has since developed into a corps with more than 600 posts, 460 of which are occupied. In other words, the dispensation in our Defence Force is of such a nature that justice is done to religious and church matters. The chaplain service continues, everywhere where the South African Defence Force operates, to undertake the work of chaplain there and to provide our soldiers with religious guidance. The average South African is attached to his church and when the young serviceman leaves his home, it is the normal thing for him, as well as his parents, to ask how he can remain in contact with his church. We are pleased that the Defence Force replies to this question pertinently by telling the parents of those young men that no matter where they go, a full-time or part-time chaplain will be at their service. He will be able to see them at least once a week and the serviceman will have the right to consult his chaplain as often as may be necessary, by making use of the usual service channels. As far as tending the religious needs of the young serviceman is concerned, the parents need not have any concern whatsoever. On behalf of all the church denominations in South Africa and on behalf of the thousands of parents I should very much like to express our gratitude and appreciation in this respect towards the Defence Force this afternoon. We do not expect them to make angels of our sons, but we are very grateful that, on the part of the Defence Force, spiritual degeneration is also being counteracted. Approximately 92 religions are represented in the South African Defence Force. Through the co-operation of the Defence Force all church demonimations get the opportunity to maintain contact with their members. This is an opportunity the church is not so easily afforded by civilian life outside. Here the churches and chaplains have a wonderful opportunity every week to get together the servicemen for religious instruction. The chaplain is in a privilege position because he is able to participate in a purposeful and positive way in the spiritual preparedness of our men every week. We may pose the question: How do the chaplains perform their task? In the first place they perform this task through essential personal contact. During our involvement in Angola, the chaplains were there as well and they worked hard. I was told that they performed their work under the fine motto: &#x201C;As close to the front as possible and as informal as possible&#x201D;. Through its chaplains, the Church was in the trenches, in the tanks and in the battles and it remained there while the guns of the enemy were firing away. And there was no lack of evidence of the appreciation for this work. Where casualties occurred the chaplains had to convey this tragic news to the relatives and they shared in their sorrow.</p>

<p>Work is also done through the distribution of Bibles, religious literature and magazines as well as the showing of religious pictures. For this no money is voted, but the cost is borne by voluntary contributions from individuals and church denominations. It is our involvement in rendering our men spiritually prepared, and this is our share in the struggle which has to be waged. I also want to mention, with gratitude and appreciation, the performance of the church choir and concert group of the South African Defence Force. Their performances drew a flood of voluntary contributions. Our chaplains are trained and prepared through orientation courses and they know the place and the task of the chaplain in time of peace as well as under operational circumstances. The average South African comes from a religious home, and he is a person who places a high premium on the honour of his God and on his trust in the Almighty. The struggle in which we are engaged concerns the soil of South Africa and it concerns the survival of democracy in this country of ours. But, Sir, directly linked with that is also the faith in the Almighty and the public confession of that <span class="col_6281-6282" refersTo="page_0471"/>faith. Now, it is a fact that we have come up against the unholy and irreligious ideology and power of communism. What did we have to deal with in Angola, Sir? We had to deal with an unholy and a terrible Marxist threat there.</p>

<p>Military and physical preparedness, accompanied by spiritual preparedness, will enable us to be victorious. I say that this religious factor, this spiritual preparedness is the factor which binds the Church and the State in this country together in waging this struggle, because if the State is destroyed the Church is destroyed as well. It is this other mighty factor which will bring together White, Brown and Black in this country to be victorious in that struggle, because once the tide of communism engulfs this country, it is not only going to engulf the Whites; it is going to engulf Brown and Black and everyone&#x2019;s belief and church denomination. For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I want to pay tribute to our chaplains on an occasion such as this, and it is surely appropriate that we shall salute with gratitude and appreciation our chief chaplain, the Chaplain-General, and every individual chaplain. Let us say on this occasion that we know that they will persevere in this major task to prepare our men spiritually and, in this seemingly unequal struggle, to bring the message to our men we also find in those famous words of a great leader of the past, i.e. &#x201C;Glo in jou God&#x201D;. With this message they also convey the knowledge to our men, and to all of us, that this God reigns.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Oudtshoorn with regard to the spiritual state of our men on the borders, and not only of our men on the borders, but also of the population as a whole. I also want to associate myself with what he said with regard to the mighty weapon we had in our hands in the form of the Christian faith. It is something which affords us the opportunity of causing that faith to revive and flourish anew in the Western world as a whole, so that we may continue the struggle against communism, something which is imperative and indispensable if we and the Western world want to retain our position in the world and do not want to yield to communism. I may come back to this point later in my speech.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I wish to deal with a matter which arose in my constituency about a year and a half ago when I, as the local member of Parliament, and my member of the Provincial Council, were approached by prominent people in the Military. These men brought to our attention the fact that in our area, which is a large slice of Natal, the availability of trained and armed men at any one time was worrying. They were worried that there were not enough people there at any one time to cope with any type of terrorist activity that might arise, by reason of the fact that the local forces were on the border or were based in Durban or Ladysmith. In other words, they were worried about the fact that the Natal Midlands area was not adequately protected against the sort of activity which the terrorists have been embarking upon in Rhodesia. We went about in our area among the people with the result that there has now come into being, throughout the whole of my constituency, a commando organization under the control of the military which, I believe, is absolutely essential. I say so for two reasons: Firstly it is for the protection of the area, and let us understand that if ever it should happen that there are terrorist activities among us on the isolated farms it is the women and children and the Black people who will suffer primarily from the depredations of terrorists. That was the first point that concerned me, that we should have available among our own local people a force which would be able to respond and react to any such attack upon our people immediately. The second reason is that there now can be a disciplined response under the control of the Military. The thing which I fear more than anything else is that there should be a spontaneous but undisciplined reaction from people, from the farmers, who might be inclined to run around the country and take reprisals against totally innocent people. We know our own people, we know the farmers and we know how readily available shotguns are, but if that gets out of hand you have lost the war. The day that sort of thing starts to happen in your community, without a disciplined response under the control of the military, you will have more trouble than you can cope with, so I want to say I am very pleased indeed that this organization has come into being. I have one problem in connection with it and I wish to raise it merely in passing with the hon. the Minister. People who are <span class="col_6283-6284" refersTo="page_0472"/>attached to the S.A. Railways have approached me, people who want to undertake this sort of training but who have not been able to get leave from the Railways in order to undergo periods of training. I leave that with the hon. the Minister. It is not my business. It is the Minister of Transport who will have to give this kind of leave, but I do ask the hon. the Minister to take this up with his colleague so that everybody in that area should be enabled to take part in an organization such as this. Sir, the real point of what I want to say is that my people took what I regarded as the essential next step. In the Karkloof area, where I farm, they called together the kraal heads of all the Black population, those who are essentially the leaders of the families in that area. They were addressed by two members of the commando who speak fluent Zulu and who are farmers in that area. The speeches were taped, so that we have a record of everything that was said there. Sir, the interesting thing was the reaction of the Black people. Firstly, they said: &#x201C;This is the first time you people have ever come to us with your problems in regard to security. We understand&#x2014;you have told us and we know it ourselves&#x2014;that when trouble arises we will be the first people who will be intimidated and will be at the receiving end of a terrorist thrust into this area before you are.&#x201D; I think it is vitally necessary for us to appreciate that this is what those people feel; they know that this will be the result. They said further that what they would not tolerate is people coming into the area&#x2014;and they know about communism and the godlessness of communism, the point which the hon. member for Oudtshoorn made, that these are people who are set and intent on eliminating religion&#x2014;to eliminate the religious feelings and the attachment they have to their churches. I think this bears out very strongly&#x2014;from another aspect perhaps as that put forward by the hon. member for Oudtshoorn&#x2014;the concern the Black people have, the attachment they show, to their religion and their spiritual values, something which I think is very vital indeed.</p>

<p>At that meeting we, in a small way, and in our own local area among our own local people, have been able to bring home to the Black people what I have always said in this House, viz. that the alternative to White Power in South Africa is not Black power, but Red power. This is something I think we have to go out of our way to explain to our Black people, and in fact we made a point of explaining it to them at this meeting, why White men are arming. We told them that they would see men arming, holding manoeuvres, going about in their trucks in an organized fashion and organizing concentration points for our wives and children, but it is not intended against the Black people of the area; it is intended as protection for them as well as for ourselves.</p>

<p>I merely put it to the hon. the Minister that this is the sort of extension work which&#x2014;I cannot call them &#x201C;private military people&#x201D;, but people who are not in the armed forces on a regular basis, e.g. the paramilitary people&#x2014; can get hold of the imagination of the Black people in that area. As the hon. the Minister has said many times and others also, the local population is to the guerrilla like water to the fish. If we can do this sort of thing and carry it further, I think we will be going a long way towards achieving what we want to achieve, i.e. securing the lives of both White people and Black people in this country. I believe that my people have there taken an initiative which I very much hope is going to be followed by other people in other areas. It is already being transferred to other areas in my constituency. We have five or six different units, and meetings on this same basis are being called in all those areas. I therefore hope this is going to be something that will spread. I am certainly far more confident and happy&#x2014;about the security of our people in that area&#x2014;this time this year than I was this time last year.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank the hon. member for Mooi River for his positive contribution. I agree with him that we have the support of the vast majority of our Black and Brown people in South Africa and that they have a deep trust in the security forces of our country. We have no trouble in getting them to support our efforts to train them better. I mentioned yesterday that we a force of more than 500 Black soldiers voluntarily came forward to support us in the operational area. Hon. members are well aware of the steps we have taken in the Transkei and Okavango, and of the steps we are at present taking in Owambo to train Black soldiers.</p>

<p>Hon. members will also recollect that I announced a while ago that some of our commandos will be allowed to recruit a <span class="col_6285-6286" refersTo="page_0473"/>number of Black people for specific purposes in each commando area. I therefore fully agree with the hon. member, and am glad he made this positive contribution this afternoon.</p>

<p>I may also just mention that there had been a tendency, especially in the past few months, for the womenfolk of our country to join the commandos in very large numbers. I believe that a few thousand or more have already joined the commandos. In some areas we are even experiencing problems in coping with this large-scale enlistment.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I could always call upon the hon. member for his assistance. He is, after all, a well-trained officer.</p>

<p>I regret to say that to date there has been no good news about the possible loss of our Albatross. I am informed that the search parties will continue their operations till late tonight and that they will start again tomorrow morning, if necessary. I regret having to tell hon. members this but I am sure I can express the sympathy of all of us with the families concerned.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Durban Point asked me about the use of national servicemen in other capacities. We are using as many national servicemen as possible in the various categories of the services. For example, there are a few hundred national servicemen engaged in the anti-insurgency action at present taking place in Owambo and in Okavango, as the hon. member knows. Hundreds of national servicemen also serve as medical orderlies. They are well trained and have done good work over the past few months.</p>

<p>*Then there are the computer services in which&#x2014;so I have been informed&#x2014; approximately 300 national servicemen are engaged. A total of 23 of them are employed in the branches Finance, Audit and Administration. They are persons who have special qualifications enabling them to do this work. We are therefore trying to utilize these people in the fields in which they are qualified. In the Stores Administration Division there are almost 700, and they are doing good work. I think it is generally accepted that we are, as far as possible, using national servicemen who are suited to these purposes in specific directions within the Defence Force in positions for which we perhaps do not at this stage have the necessary permanent force members available.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Durban Point also raised the question of a bigger Permanent Force. I want to assure the hon. member that I am inclined to support this idea as far as possible. The hon. member knows that I went out of my way to try to create better facilities for and to encourage the recruitment of Permanent Force members. What is more, we also established the special unit&#x2014;&#x201C;die Verkenningskommando&#x201D;&#x2014;which forms part of the Permanent Force. I hope we will be able to build it up and to expand it, because we do need that type of unit under present conditions. Because the factor of professional leadership is most important, as is the principle of continuity in the Defence Force, we need a higher percentage of Permanent Force personnel in relation to the Citizen Force and the Commandos. In the Army the Permanent Force members constitute approximately 3&#x0025; while the rest of the personnel comprise Citizen Force and Commando members. I think that proportion is not satisfactory and we should have more Permanent Force members. However, if we do accept the principle that we should establish at least one brigade of Permanent Force members, then we must also accept the fact that it is going to cost the country between R50 million and R80 million per year extra. There is no question about it and because it was calculated a few years ago, I think it will now even cost more than that.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But at least there will be a saving as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There may be a saving, but there will not be a saving to such an extent. This does not mean to say, however, that I am not in favour of it.</p>

<p>This brings me at once to another matter which was raised, and which runs like a refrain through the speeches of hon. members, i.e. that I must remove the Defence Force from the control of the Public Service Commission. Let me state the facts at once. For inspection purposes and maintenance of the establishment strength, it is already the case that the Defence Force no longer falls under the Public Service Commission. The Defence Force only <span class="col_6287-6288" refersTo="page_0474"/>continues to fall under the Public Service Commission for the determination of conditions of service, i.e. the determination of salaries. As far as the Public Service Commission is concerned, a new dispensation is imminent and legislation will be introduced by the Minister of the Interior to give shape to it. I do not want to discuss that legislation. My standpoint is in any event that S.A. Defence Force members cannot be dealt with on the same basis as Public Servants when it comes to the determination of conditions of service. This has always been my standpoint, and in respect of certain matters we have already succeeded in having different bases applied. However, I am not prepared to anticipate the decisions of the Cabinet. In this regard I have a responsibility to my colleagues in the Cabinet. I shall state the case of the S.A. Defence Force, but then the case of the Police is at once relevant as well. I think that both services, as far as conditions of service are concerned, ought to be dealt with on a different basis. Whether this can happen all at once, time will have to tell. The financial implications of this must also be gone into properly. This is all I want to say in this regard. But I am in favour of the idea that the Police and the S.A. Defence Force should be dealt with on a different basis.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I can also inform the hon. member for Durban Point that later this year we intend instituting an investigation into the question whether we should not alter our national service system. I can tell the hon. member that I am prepared to consult with him again on this matter. We have already altered the system, but I think that as far as certain categories are concerned, we shall have to institute longer periods of service. This may lead to the period being shortened in respect of other categories, but there are the questions of permanency, continuity and of proper leadership which will have to be considered. We shall have to look into the matter again in the second half of this year.</p>

<p>The hon. members for South Coast, Pietersburg and Cradock spoke about the question of motivation. The hon. member for South Coast even went so far as to say that I must tell hon. members to motivate the country. That is going too far. The hon. member already heard the other day that I was accused of being an arrogant person. I am not going to take this responsibility on my shoulders. It is the duty of every member of Parliament to go back to his constituents and motivate them as regards national service and to instill in them a positive attitude towards our Defence Force and our other security forces. It is their duty to do that.</p>

<p>You must involve them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>What is more, it is the duty of every member of Parliament and of every member of the provincial council to check up whether the local authorities in their constituencies are taking the necessary steps as far as our civil defence is concerned. Civil defence is not only a military matter. It also has to provide other urgent services during, for instance, floods, fires or earthquakes. There was the earthquake in Ceres a few years ago and also the Gamtoos catastrophe referred to by the hon. member for Humansdorp. It is absolutely essential that our civil defence organizations should be up to date. There should also be co-operation on the part of members of Parliament, the provincial councils and also local authorities with our commando organization, which is a good organization.</p>

<p>*The misconception has sprung up among some people that civil defence relates only to military matters. That is not correct. Civil defence can become important in military situations, because emergency services have then to be provided, but civil defence must at all times be there to provide assistance in all other states of emergency as well. People confuse civil defence with military training. This must not happen. There must be a greater measure of participation, on the part of the available men and women in the country, in the St. John&#x2019;s Ambulance, the Red Cross, the Noodhulpliga and other women&#x2019;s organizations which are at the disposal of local authorities to provide these services. There has to be a proper plan, not an overall plan, but a plan in terms of which leaders can take the lead in times of emergency to help the public to do what has to be done.</p>

<p>Well, at present we are having consultations with the provincial authorities. A report was published on certain aspects of civil defence, as the hon. member knows. We have again consulted with the Administrators to see whether amending legislation should be introduced. We are considering this question at present and, if necessary, we shall come forward with the necessary legislation next year. The provinces will also take steps to make the necessary adjustments to enable local authorities to deal with this matter on a better basis. This matter is, therefore, presently receiving attention.</p>

<p>The matter of financing has got nothing to do with my department.

<p>But the law does not allow it at present.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is what we are intending to put right. We are at present negotiating with the Administrators in regard to the question of responsibility and with a view to amending the present legislation. I shall let the hon. member have all the particulars in due course.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Humansdorp was speaking from experience when he quite rightly referred here yesterday to the need for closer co-operation in the sphere of civil defence. The constituency of the hon. member suffered great damages in states of emergency. He therefore knows how the Air Force, the commandos and local authorities there had to team up to carry out a civil defence programme. I am pleased that he was able to make such a positive contribution here, from his own experience.</p>

<p>Other hon. members discussed a variety of matters. Unfortunately, it will not be possible for me this afternoon to provide detailed replies to their questions. It is my intention to do what I have done in the past, i.e. to have hon. members&#x2019; speeches read through and, in cases where I have omitted to deal with all the details, furnish the hon. members with written replies. They know that it is my practice. If I should therefore fail to reply to certain questions, owing to a lack of time, hon. members must please not take it amiss of me.</p>

<p>I want to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for their positive contributions on the Defence Force. The Defence Force is today a very large and extensive organization. The Defence Force does not refer only to the Air Force, the Army and the Navy. The Defence Force also involves a tremendous administration, large-scale medical services, between 60 and 70 sick bays, four hospitals and in addition to that large-scale health services. The Defence Force also involves the combating of drug addiction, as was mentioned this morning. The Defence Force is also involved in ministering to young people spiritually. All church denominations in South Africa are officially represented in the Defence Force. The Defence Force is therefore a tremendously large organization with wide ramifications. The positive attitudes displayed by hon. members here must be a source of inspiration to every member of the Defence Force dealing with these matters. On their behalf I want to express my thanks to hon. members.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Worcester, False Bay and Simonstown referred to the Navy. The hon. member for Simonstown referred to the problems of the town of Simonstown. The hon. member knows that we have taken certain steps. Investigations have been carried out.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I cannot say that I am satisfied with all the recommendations arising from the investigations that took place. I am fully aware of the problems of the local authority of Simonstown. There is the idea in some circles that, gradually, Simonstown should become a military base in the same sense that Voortrekkerhoogte is today. I do not know whether that can be done in a few years&#x2019; time. It will cost a lot of money. I think eventually the best solution would be to steer matters in the direction of Simonstown eventually becoming the same type of military base that Voortrekkerhoogte is at present. The problems that we have with the local authority today will then gradually peter out. Whether that is financially possible, I do not know. It is a matter for <span class="col_6291-6292" refersTo="page_0476"/>discussion and proper investigation. I would suggest that in due course we should, in co-operation with the other departments, see whether we cannot have a better and proper investigation made into all these difficulties in regard to Simonstown.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am aware of that, and I also know that if housing schemes are established, it will be possible to alleviate the transportation problem in Simonstown to a considerable extent. We shall have to put our heads together again to see whether we cannot take further steps, as we have already done in the past&#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, I shall include your head as well; I shall not have it chopped off.</p>

<p>The hon. members for False Bay and Worcester referred to the Navy and spoke with great appreciation of the Navy. I thank them for doing so. Our Navy is not a very large one. Over the past few years, however, we have accomplished a great deal with the establishment of Silvermine, of modern communications and also of a new submarine base. Although our Navy is not a large one, it is respected in many countries of the world, <i>inter alia,</i> for the type of work which is being done in the workshops at Simonstown. I know what I am talking about when I say that there is great appreciation in many countries in the world for the type of work and services which are being rendered at Simonstown. Whether the headquarters of the Navy should be transferred to Pretoria is a question which I will probably not deal with in my lifetime as Minister. It is a task which my successor will have to deal with, if necessary. The idea has been expressed that the headquarters should be moved, but I do not think that it is practical. What I do think is practical is that there should be greater co-ordination, on a high level, between the headquarters at Voortrekkerhoogte or in Pretoria, Potgieter Street, and the headquarters of the Navy. We have already begun to move in this direction and in the central organization of the chief of the Defence Force, under the control of Chief of Staff, the Navy is already strongly represented. Perhaps we could solve many of the problems along these lines.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, we are close to that. In any case we are not as doubtful as some Pentagons are.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words this afternoon about the Defence budget. The hon. member for Durban Point, as well as other hon. members, raised this matter. The hon. member for Hillbrow pointed out yesterday that a country&#x2019;s defence expenditure should be commensurate with its economic means. No one denies that, and therefore I agree with the hon. member. I have here a list of &#x201C;Comparisons of Defence Expenditure, 1971-&#x2019;75&#x201D; to which I want to refer. In this list the defence expenditure of countries of the Warsaw treaty, Nato countries and countries such as Iran and Israel are compared. I want to refer to one figure only. The per capita defence expenditure of a country such as Iran is &#x0024;314 per annum. In other countries the position is as follows: Israel, &#x0024;1 043; West Germany, &#x0024;260; and the Netherlands, &#x0024;215. There are many other examples which I could mention, <i>inter alia,</i> the USA and France, but I do not want to do so now. In South Africa the Defence expenditure in respect of the Whites alone is R324 per capita per annum. In respect of the entire population it is only R54,53. With reference to this I say that South Africa is not spending disproportionately on defence. I should like to point out the increase in prices in respect of a few items only. The price of a 35 mm anti-aircraft cannon has in only ten years increased by 155&#x0025;. The price of the R1 rifle has, over the same period, increased by 344&#x0025;. The price of a Mandrag radio set has increased by 513&#x0025;. The prices of certain types of aircraft used by the S.A. Defence Force have increased by 77&#x0025;, 132&#x0025; and 85&#x0025;, respectively.</p>

<p>The costs involved in training Navy and Air Force officers have also increased tremendously. In the same way the costs involved in <span class="col_6293-6294" refersTo="page_0477"/>the training of a submarine officer have increased by 42&#x0025; over a period of ten years. There has also been a tremendous increase in the price of ordinary military requirements. The price of tents, for example, has increased by 210&#x0025;. If one, in addition to that, takes into consideration that the rand has been devalued, and that prices have escalated as a result of many other factors as well, then one comes to the conclusion that South Africa has in reality, with the leaps and bounds it has taken in regard to defence expenditure, not incurred an exceptional increase in expenditure. Only increased expenditure which is unavoidable in the new situation has been requested in order to be able to keep pace with this. Therefore if we want to build up and strengthen our reserves&#x2014;and we must do this&#x2014;we shall have to do it ourselves. I am one of the people who believe that South Africa should look after itself as far as its defence is concerned, for other people will not look after it. Therefore we must have sufficient reserves, and the ability to hold our own if anyone should venture to attack us in an irresponsible manner. I reiterate that Parliament will have to prepare itself to spend more money on defence. This is not only in the interests of the Whites, but also of the Coloureds and the Blacks.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I said yesterday that all of them had said that they were against communism and that they did not want communist interference, i.e. Russian and Cuban interference in the affairs of Southern Africa. Whether we like it or not, they said the present order can only be improved by evolution and not by revolution. The first guarantee against revolution is a strong Defence Force and other security forces in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North raised a few matters. In the first instance I want to tell him that the Defence Force takes the responsibility for all permanent force members if they are wounded or fall ill. That is an accepted principle. As far as commando and Citizen Force members are concerned, initially it is the responsibility of the Defence Force through its medical services, but after that they are handed over to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. If the hon. member has problems in this connection, he must raise them with that department. My office, or the Admiral&#x2019;s office, will be prepared to help him to get in touch with the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. He can make his own choice.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point says that he must choose the Admiral. I do not care; he too is in the service of the Defence Force. The hon. member raised the matter of the accident which occurred on 29 November. There was an investigation by the defence authorities. They came to certain conclusions and the matter has now been handed over to the Department of Justice. It is at present in their hands. However, I am not prepared to take the matter further at this stage, because it has been handed over to the proper authorities.</p>

<p>*I think that I have now dealt with the matters which the hon. member raised in regard to the Budget. Only one or two other matters now remain. The hon. member for Rondebosch, who participated in the debate this morning, is an academic by profession. In other words, the hon. member must have the ability to be able to analyse a matter properly and to take the correct premises into consideration before he arrives at a conclusion. However, the hon. member comes to this House and says that <i>Die Burger</i> said this or that. When we exerted pressure on him it came out that it was simply a report which had appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> on what the Institute of Conflict Studies had said. He, as an academic, ought to know that there is a very big difference. However, I shall return in a moment to the hon. member and the Institute of Conflict Studies. The hon. member went further and said&#x2014;or was it his leader who said this; in any case, one of them said it, and I do not think it really makes any difference whether it was he or his leader; it is still &#x201C;His Master&#x2019;s Voice&#x201D;&#x2014;that the hon. the Prime Minister had allegedly said that our actions in Angola had prejudiced the principle of d&#x00E9;tente. Surely that is not what the hon. the Prime Minister said. The hon. the Prime Minister never said that, and I have the precise words of the hon. the Prime Minister here. If the hon. member had wanted to look up the words of the Prime Minister, he could have found them in the <i>Argus</i> of 6 May. What did the hon. the Prime Minister say? He said&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is interesting to see that from 4 to 10 April I have been repeatedly subjected to venomous attacks over Moscow Radio. [Interjections.] And it is interesting to note that the same attacks which are being made on me on South Africa are also being made on me by Moscow Radio. This brings me to the hon. member for Rondebosch with his Institute of Conflict Studies. Since he is so fond of quoting from it, I want to quote from <i>Conflict Studies</i> of January 1976 for his consideration. Here the problem of terrorism <span class="col_6297-6298" refersTo="page_0479"/>and guerrilla warfare in the world is discussed in the following vein&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Partly to compensate for their military weakness, their political minority status &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is why they avail themselves of certain tactics. Listen to this now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They find ready collaborators among the extremists of left or right to aid them on political and propaganda fronts. Such persons are always willing to cheer on enemies of the parliamentary system and despite occasional forays into electoral contests it is clear that they do not care a fig for the survival of democracy. More insidious, because less clearly recognizable, is the assistance rendered to terrorists by woolly-minded liberals who succumb easily to terrorist propaganda. These fellow-travellers of terrorism fancy that it is always progressive to be on the side of a rebel and are more ready to retail a terrorist atrocity story than to find out what really happened. They make set speeches about the evils of war, yet are prepared to justify murder and massacre by terrorists.</block>

<p>I am quoting this and I make a present of it to the hon. member. He can put it in his big pipe and smoke it, and it will do him good if he does so. For what are the facts now? It is strange that while we are adopting a standpoint against Russian and Cuban intervention, it is I who am being attacked. We resist terrorists who commit murder on innocent women and children in Southern Africa, but nevertheless it is I who am being attacked. I am trying to keep the S.A. Defence Force above party politics, and I have succeeded in doing so for ten years, but now the Progs are trying to undermine this. Over the years I have had criticism from the official Opposition but despite this they always treated me decently. I have succeeded in involving all the churches of South Africa in the upliftment work in the S.A. Defence Force, but nevertheless it is I who am being attacked by the Progs.</p>

<p>I have succeeded advancing the best officers in South Africa in the S.A. Defence Force, but I am being attacked by the Progs. Whose game is the Progs playing, and who are their friends? [Interjections.] It was a strange thing we saw this morning, when some hon. members asked for extra time. Why? Because the Progs felt that they had something to hide. Something which has never happened here before is that two of their speakers participated, and suddenly their leader came forward and also wanted to participate, the astonished leader. Sir, he is astonished that people have not taken any notice of him yet. That is why he presents the appearance he does. Sir, I am now going to tell the entire story here. We invited the hon. member for Yeoville, on my initiative, to the northern areas of South West Africa. He was the only member of his party who was invited. The hon. member for Sea Point and the hon. member for Rondebosch invited themselves. [Interjections.] Yes, it is true. The hon. member for Yeoville went and disclosed to the hon. member for Sea Point and to the hon. member for Rondebosch that he had been invited. Then they said that they also wanted to go and I agreed to that. [Interjections.] However, they did not have the right to send three people. Surely that party does not have the numbers to justify that, not among the electorate and not in this House either. Nor do they have that value. When we arrived there, I withdrew and said that I would not participate in the meetings between the officers and those members of Parliament. I had evidence to the effect that this is what I did. I stayed away and left the officers alone with those gentlemen. Nor have I said a single word in public about what happened there.</p>

<p>You told half the story yesterday.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I told this House at the beginning of the year that South Africa went into Angola and in the first instance took possession of Calueque. We did so to protect our interests and the interests of the Ovambo people. I also told Parliament that we had discovered that big arsenals of weapons and ammunition were being built up on our borders. We cleared that up. I told Parliament about that. I went further and said that we went into Angola on a very limited scale, with limited numbers and with a limited objective. After having achieved that objective, we decided to come back. We came back on the advice of our own military leaders. But we did not run away; we came back in order. What is more, we commenced consultations and deliberations, and only after obtaining certain assurances did we withdraw our troops from Calueque and the other side of the border. We therefore did not run away, and that is the truth.</p>

<p>I went even further and said that because of diplomatic and other reasons it was not possible for me to furnish all the particulars. As Minister I have certain responsibilities. I went further and said that towards the end of November and early in December I had made statements indicating that South Africa was not prepared to fight the fight for the Western world alone, to the very last South African. I have reports here of the speeches and the statements I made. When it became clear to us that we would be left in the lurch, we decided we would not fight to the last South African on behalf of the Free World, if they themselves were not prepared to fight.</p>

<p>*That is the whole story. What more does the hon. member want to know? Does the hon. member want to know something which, if I were to reply to it, may force me to say things which could mar sound relations. However, I also said that some of the countries which were present at the last meeting of the Security Council knew about our actions in Angola, and tacitly approved of them. Not only did they do so tacitly, but at that stage they also adopted a standpoint against the Russians and the Cubans in theory as well as in practice. After the disastrous decision by the American Congress an about-face took place in Africa, not again South Africa, but in the first place against America because a disbelief in America&#x2019;s ability to meet its obligations to the Free World arose. As far as I am concerned, three benefits have accrued to South Africa from its actions in Angola. The first benefit is of a military nature, for our young soldiers and officers were tried and were not found wanting. They also acquired valuable experience. The second benefit is that we proved in Africa that what we were prepared and capable of doing on a small scale, we would be able to do even more effectively on a larger scale. The third benefit was that we made friends in Africa who are still our friends today in spite of what is being said at public and international assemblies.</p>

<p>The hon. member attacked me for having said that people who protect terrorists are protecting murderers. Surely what I said is the truth. I did not only make that remark here; I also made it to African leaders to whom I have spoken. The hon. member is not the first person who has spoken to African leaders. They despise him and laugh at him behind his back because he comes to them wringing his hands, rubbing his hands together, and apologizing for what he is doing. He crawls around in Africa, but we drive around in Africa. [Interjections.] Long before he had even dreamt of going into Africa, I had already gone into Africa. However, I did not boast of it here in Parliament; I did my work as Minister of Defence, and I am still prepared to do so today. He is the last person I would allow to read me the Riot Act, he who is so astonished at his own presence in Parliament. [Interjections.] As far as the PRP is concerned, I want to content myself with the following: They, as a party, will have to reorientate themselves if they want to make progress in South Africa.</p>

We are defending a country in which Black and Brown people are being given a voice and an instrument to make themselves heard without revolution. We are defending a country which, in the economic sphere, is growing and manifests a potential growth which could be to the well-being of Africa. We are defending a country which is of the greatest strategic value for a self-respecting Free World. I have no doubt that the Free World will regain its self-respect.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The provisions of this Bill may be classified into three groups. The first group all comprise amendments to the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, and are aimed at effecting a shift of emphasis in this Act. The second group consists of a number of unrelated amendments to various Acts. The third group comprises the introduction of preventive detention measures which may be put into effect whenever necessary. I am going to deal with the three groups separately.</p>

<p><span class="col_6305-6306" refersTo="page_0483"/>The provisions which fall into the first group are to be found in clauses 1, 2, 3, 4(a), 4(b) and 8 of the Bill. All contain amendments to the Suppression of Communism Act, which was placed on the Statute Book in 1950 to curb the activities of the Communist Party of South Africa and of communists themselves. It is not necessary to explain the communist ideology here, for it is a well-known fact that the principle of perpetual revolution is inherent in that ideology. In fact, on platforms throughout the entire world the communist powers themselves boast of their own revolutionary zeal. In 1950 it was necessary to counteract communist revolutionary activities in South Africa, and this is even more necessary today. Over the years which have elapsed in the meantime the Act has been adapted from time to time to keep pace with the changes in communist strategies and techniques. They did not remain static, and we could not remain static either. Other security laws were added to make provision for particular types of situation, but the Suppression of Communism Act continued to remain very important, particularly for administrative action in the interests of security in respect of persons and organizations, and to a certain extent in respect of publications as well. This was the case because the communists, as arch-subverters, use techniques which are readily imitated by other subverters; because the communists like using others to do their work for them; and because subverters, of whatever persuasion they may be, are fond of acting in collusion whenever they want to subvert and take over a particular State. The one furthers the aims of the other, sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly, and in this way they all further the aims of the communists. This brings all of them within the provisions of the Suppression of Communism Act. In this way it was possible to take steps in terms of that Act, and steps were taken in terms of that Act against persons who were engaged in subversive activities, who were furthering the aims of communism without that necessarily being their own objective. Among them were people who were merely used as pawns and who were themselves unaware of the communist alliance and domination in which they had found themselves. Among them, too, were people who were in reality opponents of communism, but who, in striving to achieve their own revolutionary ideals, made common cause with the communists. This situation resulted in two kinds of problem cases. Firstly, steps were taken against people in terms of the Suppression of Communism Act on the grounds that they had furthered the aims of communism, while they themselves were absolutely convinced that although they were subverters, they were not communists. The second kind of problem case was those people who proclaimed themselves opposed to communism in public, or who, possible owing to their history and positions, were ostensibly not communists, but who participated in underground activities in partnership with the communists in order to achieve their immediate revolutionary aims. When steps were taken against them in terms of the Suppression of Communism Act, the man in the street was simply unable to understand this, and it also offered mischief-makers a very useful piece of propaganda material, material with which they were even able to reach and confuse our own people.</p>

<p>It is in an effort to eliminate these problems that the first group of provisions of this Bill has been drafted. An attempt is being made to shift the emphasis of the Suppression of Communism Act so that it will be clear that the Act does not simply deal with subversion by communists, but with subversion in general. All the existing provisions for the combating of communism are therefore being retained but with this Bill it is being made possible to take steps against subverters who do not necessarily have the furthering of communism as their ultimate object, without at the same time hanging a communist label around their necks. All communists are subverters, but all subverters are not communists and we should like to reflect this in the Act.</p>

<p>The first section of the principal Act which is affected is section 2(2) which empowers the State President to declare an organization to be an unlawful organization. The circumstances under which he may do so are set out in paragraphs (2)(a), (b) and (c). Paragraphs (d) and (e) deal with organizations which are associated with an organization that has already been declared unlawful, and are not relevant at the moment. All the circumstances under which the State President may take action, as set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are related to the furtherance of the objects of communism, as defined in the Act. Therefore a new paragraph, paragraph (cA), is being <span class="col_6307-6308" refersTo="page_0484"/>inserted in the principal Act by clause 1(a) of the Bill. In this way the State President will also be empowered to declare an organization to be an unlawful organization if he is satisfied that organization is engaging in activities which endanger the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. Basically, this is precisely what communist organizations are engaged in doing. But there have been and are still other organizations which engage in activities of this kind, and if this amendment is passed, it will be possible to declare such an organization unlawful without such declaration being linked to communism.</p>

<p>Another section of the principal Act which becomes implicated, is section 6. While section 2 deals with organizations, section 6 deals with publications. Once again the relevant existing paragraphs, i.e. paragraphs (a) and (d) make a prohibition possible only under circumstances in which communism is involved. Once again a new paragraph, i.e. paragraph (dA), is being inserted so that it will be possible to take steps in respect of a publication as well, without that publication being linked to communism as such.</p>

<p>Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to achieve the same object as the one in respect of section 9 of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Section 10 of the principal Act relates to the restriction of persons. Here, too, all the circumstances under which the person may be restricted are linked to the achievement of the objects of communism. For that reason a new paragraph (iv) is being inserted in section 10(1)(a) by clauses 4(a) and (b) of the Bill. The contents are in line with those of the insertions to which I have already referred above.</p>

<p>The last section of the principal Act which has to be amended in order to complete the shift of emphasis is section 19. This section contains the short title; that is, the name of the principal Act. It will serve no purpose to phrase the grounds on which action may be taken in such a way that references to the achievement of the objects of communism may be avoided in appropriate cases, if steps still have to be taken in terms of the Suppression of Communism Act, and therefore that name still has to continue to appear on the documents. The name therefore has to be changed as well, and this is being done in clause 8 of the Bill. The principal Act is being given the new name of the State Security Act. Consequently, this is what the principal Act will already be to an even greater extent after the amendments as contemplated in this Bill have been effected.</p>

<p>This brings me to the second group of provisions of the Bill, viz. the unrelated amendments of various Acts. In the first place there is clause 6, which has to be read in conjunction with clauses 9, 11 and 15. At present section <i>215bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, makes provision for the detention of witnesses under certain circumstances. This may happen when certain offences referred to in Part II<i>bis</i> of the Second Schedule of that Act are relevant. In part II<i>bis</i> a number of ordinary offences, as well as offences against the security of the State are mentioned. However, a contravention of the Terrorism Act, 1967, has not yet been included therein. This leaves a deficiency because in recent years contravenes against the security of the State have for the most part been charged under that Act. To rectify the matter a reference to contraventions under the Terrorism Act, 1967, may be inserted in section 215<i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act. However, since the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, is now being altered into a more general security law, it would be a step in the right direction to combine various security measures in that legislation. The provisions relating to the detention of witnesses in security cases is therefore being removed from the Criminal Procedure Act now and transferred to what will subsequently be called the State Security Act. At the same time a reference is being added to contraventions under the Terrorism Act. Because the same schedule in the Criminal Procedure Act also deals with release on bail in accordance with section 208<i>bis</i> of that Act, those provisions are also being transferred to the State Security Act in so far as they deal with security contraventions. At the same time, relevant provisions in the Terrorism Act are being deleted.</p>

<p>A further unrelated amendment is to be found in clause 10. In terms of section 3 of the Public Safety Act, 1953, the State President may in a state of emergency make regulations to provide for the safety of the public or the maintenance of public order. Section 3(3)(b), however, limits the penalty which may be prescribed in such regulations to a fine not exceeding R1 000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years. In terms of <span class="col_6309-6310" refersTo="page_0485"/>section 2 of the Act, however, a state of emergency may in fact be proclaimed if it appears that the ordinary law of the land is inadequate to enable the Government to ensure the safety of the public or to maintain public order. Therefore section 3(3)(b) is really not in keeping with the spirit of the Act in terms of which heavier than normal penalties might in fact be indicated. Practical experience has also demonstrated that a fine of R1 000 or imprisonment for a period of five years is not adequate for contraventions requiring the promulgation of emergency regulations. In addition draft emergency regulations have to be kept in readiness at all times so that when the emergency threatens there will be no delay in their promulgation. These draft regulations have to be suitable for use in terms of the Public Safety Act, 1953, or the Defence Act, 1957, as the case may be. The latter Act contains no limitation on the penalty which may be prescribed. For these reasons section 3(3)(b) of the Public Safety Act, and with it the limitation on the penal provision which may be prescribed in regulations under it, is now being deleted.</p>

<p>The last unrelated amendments are contained in clauses 12, 13 and 14. These clauses make the Riotous Assemblies Act, 1956, applicable in South West Africa and repeal the Riotous Assemblies and Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance of 1930 of that Territory. In this way obsolete statutory provisions in regard to riotous gatherings in South West Africa are being replaced by a law which is kept up to date and which is for that reason more serviceable. A particular problem with the Ordinance was that in all cases a magistrate in South West Africa could, in terms of it, prohibit a gathering in his district only with the special authority of the Administrator. Owing to the operation of the South West Africa Affairs Act, 1969, the Minister of Justice of the Republic exercises the powers of the Administrator in this case. This means that a magistrate in South West Africa must at present obtain the authority of the Minister of Justice if he wishes to prohibit any particular gathering. In states of emergency this is entirely unpractical. In addition the Ordinance contains no provision in terms of which gatherings in respect of areas larger than a district may be prohibited. Both these deficiencies, and others as well, will be rectified by making the Act of the Republic applicable to South West Africa as well.</p>

<p>As far as South West Africa is concerned, I want to point out that the constitutional conference which is engaged in working out the constitutional future of the Territory, expressed its concern as long ago as at its first meeting during September 1975, at attempts at violence and intimidation, and requested the authorities to take effective steps to provide the necessary protection. On 16 March of this year the conference requested the Government of South Africa to maintain law and order in order to afford the leaders of the Territory &#x201C;the opportunity to deliberate on the future of the inhabitants of South West Africa in a peaceful atmosphere&#x201D;. This is in fact what the Government is now contemplating with the application of this legislation to South West Africa. Whether the peoples of the Territory wish to retain or repeal it after finally exercising their right of self-determination, is their affair. But in the meantime the Government has to take action. As the hon. the Prime Minister stated in this House on 23 April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Until the peoples of South West Africa tell me that they have worked out their future, however, South Africa regards itself as being responsible for the law and order and security of the people of South West Africa. Therefore South Africa will not hesitate to take action or even to make laws to protect the public peace in South West Africa. There must be no doubt whatsoever about this.</block>

<p>&#x2020;The third group of provisions, those dealing with preventive detention, are to be found in clauses 4(c) to (f) and 5 of the Bill. The existing section 10(1)(a)<i>bis</i> of the Act empowers the Minister of Justice to prohibit a person, who has served a sentence imposed under certain Acts, from absenting himself from a prison, if the Minister is satisfied that person is likely to advise or defend the achievement of the objects of communism. The amendment of this provision introduced by clause 4(c) of the Bill will, when shed of its technical terms, empower the Minister to cause a person&#x2019;s preventive detention if he is satisfied that person engages in activities which endanger the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. In such a case the person concerned will not necessarily already be in custody, as he must be under the existing <span class="col_6311-6312" refersTo="page_0486"/>provision. It is, therefore, necessary to introduce machinery for his arrest. This is done by clause 4(d) of the Bill which is being substituted for the existing section 10(1)(a)<i>ter</i>, thus introducing authority for a member of the South African Police force to arrest a person against whom the Minister has issued a notice and to hold him until the notice has been served on him, but for not more than seven days. This must be read with the existing section 10(3) authorizing the removal of a person found outside the area to which he has been restricted, back to that area. The operation of the existing provisions was subject to yearly extensions by Parliament. Under the amendments contained in clauses 4(d), (e) and (f) of the Bill, the preventive detention provisions now envisaged, will be dormant until brought into operation by way of proclamation for periods not exceeding one year at a time.</p>

<p>Clause 5 of the Bill makes preventive detentions subject to the supervision of a committee of three under the chairmanship of a judge or a magistrate or an ex-judge or ex-magistrate. This committee must examine the Minister&#x2019;s action as soon as may be, but not later than two months after a person&#x2019;s detention and thereafter it examines the detention itself at least once every six months. For this purpose the committee considers all the facts and representations submitted to it in writing and in its discretion it may also hear verbal evidence or representations. On every such occasion the committee makes a recommendation to the Minister who is not obliged to give effect thereto. Should the Minister however not give effect to a recommendation that the detainee be released, he must within one month report that fact to Parliament. The committee&#x2019;s work is confidential and no court of law shall pronounce on the work or recommendations of the committee.</p>

<p>Preventive detention is used to deal with serious threats to the security of the State from within. But that does not mean that external factors are to be ignored when considering the introduction of measures such as these now before this House. It is unnecessary for me to describe in detail the constantly changing world political scene. We are obliged to take note of and prepare for the dangers inherent in an unstable Africa where recent events have again shown how swiftly threatening situations can arise and recede; how suddenly the international struggle for world domination can sweep right up to our doorstep. For many years big power violence has remained far from our shores, but the signs are there to show that no country, however far away it may be from the main scenes of international confrontation, can any longer assume that it will continue to escape the effects of armed intrusion into the area where it is situated. We have been compelled by events in Africa to give more attention to the defence of our borders. More men and more money will for the foreseeable future be tied up there. To keep our men there and to keep them well armed and provisioned, security at home and a stable economy become all the more necessary. Not only do we know this; our enemies know this too. We must expect them to intensify their efforts behind our backs and we must be prepared.</p>

<p>The fields in which we can expect more subversive activities if we should be confronted with an escalation of external threats are the same as those in which subversive activities are to be found now. Although we have great faith in the political good sense and stability of our students, our students will receive extra attention from those who would want to instill in them a revolutionary spirit and disloyalty to the South African cause. In particular activist politics will be stepped up on the campuses and the campaign against military service under the guise of conscientious objection will be intensified. In the labour area there have for some time been fully fledged underground political agitators and organizers in the field. There is in operation a centrally directed plan for the organization and the mobilization of the workers into a force to be used by underground politicians for the furthering of their own causes. Also in this area, the labour area, we must expect increased subversive activity in times of danger. It is an area particularly sensitive to large scale agitation and unrest and it is an area where much groundwork has already been done. Then there is also the exploitation of the multi-national situation in South Africa in the course of which national and language groups are incited against each other. This is done subtly and it is by no means confined to the Black Power Movement aimed at a Black-White confrontation. Xhosa is played off against Sotho, Zulu against Asian, English against Afrikaans.</p>

<p><span class="col_6313-6314" refersTo="page_0487"/>There are common factors recognizable in many countries plagued by political upheavals, social unrest and blatant terrorism. These are movements towards independence or recently obtained independence; communist involvement; and the presence in a single political entity of different nationalities, races, tribes, languages or religions. When seeking to undermine a country and to create troubled waters in which to fish for their own ideological or political benefit, experts exploit such situations. In Northern Ireland the most serious difficulties have arisen between two Christian groups even though they have a common nationality and language. In Guyana Negroes and Indians were involved. Many countries in Africa are vulnerable because of tribal differences. Even a modern Western democracy like Canada had a serious problem on its hands when difficulties over Quebec were brought to the surface between the French and English. Numerous governments all over the world have asked for and used special powers to deal with the results of communist intervention and the blowing up of group differences. During 1968 Indonesia had to keep about 150 000 people in detention. Malaysia needed its 1960 Internal Security Act. Pakistan used the Security of Pakistan Act. In 1971 the Government of Singapore had to resort to the arrest of communists under its Internal Security Act. India still depends on extraordinary powers to maintain public order. There is hardly a country in Africa where special security provisions are not in force. British Governments were compelled to act under the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act of 1922 and in 1970 the Canadian Parliament was obliged to pass the Public Order (Temporary Measures) Act.</p>

<p>Whereas elsewhere only one or two of the common factors that I have mentioned were present, we have every one of them with us in this country. South Africa has nations in various stages of evolution towards self-rule. She has within her boundaries a number of peoples speaking a number of different languages; varying from primitive hunters and herdsmen in remote regions to sophisticated big city businessmen and scientists; and adhering to most of the known religions as well as to many pagan beliefs. With such a combination of circumstances, possibly found nowhere else on earth, the peoples of South Africa can offer themselves to the world as an example to show that peaceful co-existence is possible if there is mutual respect and a mutual recognition of each other&#x2019;s human worth and of each other&#x2019;s rights to self-development and self-determination. But for this to be so, we must be allowed to work out our own destinies. We cannot leave ourselves wide open to the shock waves of big power aspirations towards world domination; to subversion inspired and directed from abroad; and to the irresponsible actions of ideologically motivated revolutionaries. And as I have shown, our circumstances render us exceptionally vulnerable to all these things. That is why we have in the past found it necessary to protect our peoples during these delicate stages of our development with extraordinary security legislation but no more extraordinary than that used in other less vulnerable countries than ours. And that is also why I am now asking approval for these preventive detention provisions to be put on ice for use in case of need. They are not aimed at a full-scale emergency. We have the means to deal with that. They are not intended for, and are not suitable for large-scale internment. They are intended for use in times when uncertainty on our borders may require more attention and thus make it no longer possible for us to afford the luxury of allowing a small number of internationally connected activists to bedevil the peace and order at home.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to stress that a judicial review mechanism has been built into these provisions. This is something the official Opposition has asked for from time to time. One such occasion was on 21 May 1971, when the late hon. member for Pinelands referred in this House to two specific examples where preventive detention was coupled with review bodies, namely in Guyana and Rhodesia. Hon. members of the Opposition serving on the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Organizations also called for such a body in their minority report attached to the fourth interim report of that commission. I hope the Government will now be able to rely on the official Opposition&#x2019;s support for these measures.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned last Friday, I had already explained that section 226 of the Act will, with certain exceptions, prohibit the making of loans and providing of security by a company to or on behalf of its directors or managers. In respect of these exceptions, it is now proposed that the annual financial statements of the company concerned shall disclose the amount and particulars of every loan made to, or security provided for, a director or manager during any particular financial year, whether or not the loan has been repaid or the security cancelled. If such a loan has not been repaid or the security involved has not been cancelled at the end of any particular financial year, the company concerned shall be required to furnish particulars in regard to the outstanding amount of any such loan or in regard to any such security not cancelled. If the company which had made such loan or provided such security is a subsidiary company, the said particulars shall also have to be reflected in the group annual financial statements of the holding company but when the loan or security refers to shares, debentures or other property, the said particulars may be furnished in the director&#x2019;s report. It shall be the duty of the auditor of the company to report to its members if the proposed requirements have not been complied with. A director or manager or former director or manager of the company, its holding company or fellow subsidiary shall also be required to furnish, on the request of the company or of the auditor, particulars in regard to any such loan or any such security provided, as well as particulars relating to the nature of his control over any company or body corporate involved in any such transactions.</p>

<p>In clause 26 of the Bill the substitution for section 296 of the Act of a new section is proposed in order to apply the same disclosure requirements relating to directors and managers as are contemplated in the proposed section 295 to directors or managers before their appointment as such in the company or in its subsidiary if the loan or security was still in existence at the date of such appointment, or if such appointment was made at any time during the financial year concerned.</p>

<p>*Clause 27 of the Bill will amend section 365 of the Act in order to provide that when the liquidation of a company has been ordered by the court, a director or former director of that company or the sessionary of such director or former director will have no voting right in respect of the nomination of a liquidator merely because he is a creditor of the company concerned by virtue of any loan given by him to the company or of any arrear salary, travelling expenses, allowances due to him from the company or any claims paid by him on behalf of the company. This amendment is proposed because a liquidator has to examine the affairs of a company in liquidation and in terms of section 400 of the Act has to report to the Master of the Supreme Court on the actions and conduct of the directors. It is felt to be undesirable for the directors of a company to have a say in the appointment of someone who is to examine their affairs.</p>

<p>In clause 28 of the Bill, an amendment is proposed to section 423 of the Act in terms of which the words &#x201C;or otherwise&#x201D; are deleted from the section. The way this section reads at the moment, it can be interpreted to mean that a member of the company has the right to hold a director or an official of the company accountable, by way of appropriate proceedings, for losses suffered by the company, without any guarantee that if the director or official concerned is not guilty, such a member can be held responsible for the cost of the proceedings. The Permanent Advisory Committee on Company Law believes that sections 252 and 266 up to and including 268 of the Act already contain adequate provision for legal aid to members of a company if its directors or officials should be guilty of irregularities.</p>

<p>In terms of section 435(2) of the Act, permission by existing creditors of a company under judicial management for preferential payments to be made to future creditors in order to enable the business of the company to continue must be given at a meeting of creditors at which the voting rights in terms of the provisions of the Act relating to insolvency are applicable. This means that the provisional judicial management cannot call meetings of creditors. For certain purposes of the provisional judicial management of a company it is essential that permission for preference be speedily obtained, especially with regard to leases. Consequently, clause 29 of the Bill proposes that subsection (2) of section 435 be <span class="col_6317-6318" refersTo="page_0489"/>suitably amended to authorize the provisional judicial manager, with the consent of the Master of the Supreme Court or the Court, to call a meeting of creditors in order to obtain the required consent.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment to section 441(1)(b) of the Act in clause 30 of the Bill arises from the insertion into the Act of certain provisions for which provision is made in sections 145A and 146A.</p>

<p>Clause 31 of the Bill provides for a substantive provision in terms of which companies which complied with the provisions of section 288 of the Act before it was amended by the Companies Amendment Act on 20 November 1974&#x2014;the date of commencement of the above-mentioned Amendment Act&#x2014;shall be deemed to have complied with those provisions of the section after it was amended. This provision is necessary because the way the Act reads at the moment, it requires a large number of companies which drew up annual financial statements before 20 November 1974 to draw up such statements again. This requirement is considered to be superfluous.</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House will support the Bill which is a highly technical one. In fact, it is a professional Bill. I think it is unfortunate that in the waning hours of a Friday afternoon debate in this House, the hon. the Minister should have been taxed with a Bill which has so much import to every sector of South Africa in so far as company law and the Companies Act itself are concerned.</p>

<p>I think we should view this Bill against the principal Act which was passed by this House in 1973. Perhaps we should go even further back because the 1973 Act was not only a most important piece of legislation, but was in fact heroic legislation. It was preceded by a decision of the Government as far back as 1962 to appoint a Commission of Inquiry into the Companies Act. The commission sat under Mr. Justice Van Wyk de Vries and it will be recalled that the commission carried out its work over a period of ten years. It resulted in the report of the commission, two further reports and also in the preparation and presentation of a draft Bill which was made available to all sectors of our economy whose interest were affected. I think that on the occasion of this debate one must pay special tribute to those professional people who must have spent many hours of tedious investigation and much arduous thought on the preparation of this Bill. I refer particularly to the officials of the department, the Registrar of Companies and his committee, and the special committee which has been delegated to give continuous attention to the requirements which necessitated the changes to be brought about in terms of this Bill. I refer also to the National Council of Chartered Accountants and Association of Law Societies. The Bill before us contains amendments to the Companies Act which were virtually foreseen when the original Act was introduced. In the many hours that were devoted to the original Act, it was foreseen that because the Act was so wide in its implications and application, professional difficulties would be experienced to which attention would have to be given by commerce and also at Government level.</p>

<p>In his introductory Second Reading speech, the hon. the Minister dealt at length with specific amendments to specific clauses. I want to pay tribute to him and to compliment him on having made the work of those of us on this side of the House that much easier. After all, we are dealing here with amendments to the Companies Act, which Act essentially affects every facet of our commercial life in South Africa. I has to do with the duties and responsibilities of the shareholders, the directors and the officers of companies. It also has to do with the responsibilities of the Registrar of Companies and with the Government itself. After all, the Government is perhaps the largest shareholder in every company in South Africa by virtue of the fact that it collects some 49&#x0025; of the companies&#x2019; profits by way of taxation. I think we can pride ourselves on the fact that the improvements which were made to the Companies Act of 1973 led to changes being effected over the years since the advent of original Companies Act of 1963, an Act which in itself was based on the British Companies Act. The improvements have shown that in the sophisticated era into which we have moved&#x2014;one can almost say that we have moved into the computer era, an era in which macro-economics play such an important role&#x2014;company law in itself, and the application of company operations and principles, have become so important that it is necessary for the Association of Chartered Accountants and the S. A. Law Society to have <span class="col_6319-6320" refersTo="page_0490"/>before them an Act which is fool-proof if they are to interpret the requirements of the Act as fully as they should.</p>

<p>I think every member of this House should be aware of the tremendous additional responsibilities which have been placed on the directors, secretaries, managers and other officers and also on the auditors in the preparation and signing of company accounts. These onerous responsibilities are so severe today and the penalties involved are so severe that unless these people have an almost perfect Act to fall back on, the position can herald trouble not only for the directors of companies but also for the auditors. On the other hand, the people most concerned, viz. the shareholders and also the creditors, have to be protected and that is what the amendments contained in this Bill seek to do.</p>

<p>I want to refer particularly to one of the safety valves in the principal Act. I refer to section 18 of that Act which envisaged the appointment of a standing advisory committee to ensure that the Act is maintained in an up-to-date form from day to day. In the changing world of commerce in which we live, it is essential, that an Act which covers some 422 pages and some 435 sections must of necessity be revised periodically. This Bill represents a major revision of the principal Act. I think that the work of this committee is most praiseworthy. I think that all members of the House and that all the members of the legal and accounting professions owe a debt of gratitude to the standing advisory committee for their continuous work. We believe that this Act will never be perfect because from time to time, as it is applied and interpreted, various amendments will be required. The very fact that there will be changes in company procedure as a result of the increasing size of companies, their increasing involvement and the growing responsibilities companies have to face, indicates that we must accept that there will be further amendments.</p>

<p>Coming more specifically to the amendments before the House at the moment, I think one can say that essentially this is a Committee Stage Bill. Consequently we shall reserve most of our comments for that stage of the Bill. Clause 1 introduces an interesting new conception. Because we were moving so fast in the field of the keeping of company records on such a vast scale, we are now moving into the age of the microfilm. It is humanly impossible for members of the Registrar&#x2019;s Office to maintain the volume of records for all companies in this big country of ours in sufficient detail and availability, unless we modernize the concept of how this should be done. As company accountants we are now working with the aid of computers, clause 1 introduces the concept that company records may now be kept by microfilm methods and that microfilm records will be admissible as evidence and, when necessary, for the interpretation of the Act. This is merely an indication of the times in which we are moving.</p>

<p>I close with the comment that we appreciate that the amendments that have been brought before us, are amendments of a technical nature, that they have been seen by the National Council of Chartered Accountants and by the Law Society, that they have received the serious and considered attention of the standing advisory committee on the Company Act matters. We therefore support the Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Z. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; supports this Bill on behalf of his party. As he correctly remarked, it is a technical Bill. We ought to thank the hon. the Minister as well for his very comprehensive Second Reading speech in which he explained all the clauses to us as clearly as possible. As the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens correctly remarked, the Permanent Advisory Committee definitely had a say in this Bill. The Bill contains clauses which are to a great extent a logical consequence of the recommendations made earlier by the Standing Advisory Committee. The general drift of this Bill is, of course, to facilitate the procedures in connection with miscellaneous matters, to cut down on the expense involved, and especially to protect the interests of shareholders <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> the management and the directors of a company to a more considerable degree.</p>

<p>In view of this I should like to take a closer look at a few of the clauses in this Bill and comment on the principle thereof. The first clause to which I shall refer, is clause 3. In <span class="col_6321-6322" refersTo="page_0491"/>terms of this clause it is no longer necessary to publish the former name of the company, together with the new name, for a period of a year. In this connection it is as well, therefore, to take note of the question whether sufficient protection is still afforded to creditors, for example, should it happen that the former name of the company be omitted. With respect to this question I should like to refer to section 44(3) of Act 61 of 1973. Here it is clearly expounded that the change of name has no influence at all upon the rights, privileges or claims of creditors.</p>

<p>A very important bottle-neck, a matter which has already caused many problems, is now being rectified in terms of clause 4, which provides that a further object may be added to the objects and powers contained in the memorandum of association. This corresponds, too, to the recommendations of the standing committee, which says the following on page 52 of its supplementary report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as objects and powers are concerned, there should be no limitation on the alteration of a memorandum and the minimum requirements should be by special resolution.</block>

<p>An important aspect which must be noted, is found in clause 7 of the Bill. The issue here is the &#x201C;rights offer&#x201D; which is now being defined. This &#x201C;rights offer&#x201D; is described as an offer made to the members of a particular company. It is not an offer to the general public. Therefore, under these circumstances, sometimes only an abbreviated prospectus is needed. The debenture holders and shareholders concerned still have a say in the internal functioning of their company. If they do not have this, they may acquire it in any event.</p>

<p>We find that clause 8 gives an explanation of how section 144 of the principal Act is going to be amended. It is clear from this that by definition, &#x201C;rights offer&#x201D; is not an offer to the public. Should an offer be made to the general public by way of a &#x201C;rights offer&#x201D;, if the rights offer is offered to persons who are shareholders of another company, then in my opinion, this would detract from the provisions of clause 8. In that case a full prospectus would be required. The prospectus is nothing wonderful, but the following is said in a light vein in the <i>South African Law Journal</i> of 1963, in connection with the requirement that a prospectus must be provided&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The legislature did not take away the citizen&#x2019;s inalienable right to make a fool of himself. But it only attempts to prevent others from making a fool of him.</block>

<p>One should therefore see the prospectus in this light.</p>

<p>In my opinion, an important principle is contained in clause 9, by means of which a new section 145A is inserted. It adds a new section to the Act and determines, <i>inter alia,</i> that no-one may distribute a letter of allocation unless such documents as are required and have been approved by the stock exchange concerned, accompany the letter. The question whether the provisions which are made by a stock exchange are in conflict with the content of some legal provision has always been a problem in the past, and this new section now seeks to clarify the matter. The problem is very well explained in the supplementary report of the standing advisory committee on page 133, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the purposes of the necessary perspective, we record the basic point that an issuer of securities or, in other words, a listed company, is on the one hand subject to the Companies Act, while, on the other hand, it is contractually bound by the requirements of the Stock Exchange which have no statutory force. It is submitted that, consequently, a requirement laid down by the Stock Exchange, in order to be valid and binding on the issuer, should not offend against the Companies Act or, for that matter, against the law in general. It follows logically that there should at all times be close connection and co-ordination between the company law and Stock Exchange requirements.</block>

<p>Seen in this light, this section now being proposed disposes of any possible conflict and is most certainly to be recommended.</p>

<p>In connection with the protection which the shareholder must enjoy <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> the director and management of the company, very important steps are being proposed in clauses 19, 25, 26 and 27, <i>inter alia</i> that certain &#x201C;loans&#x201D;, which are defined in the Act, are forbidden to directors and managers in certain cases and must in all cases be published in the annual statement. It even goes so far as to provide that <span class="col_6323-6324" refersTo="page_0492"/>a loan made by a person even before he became director, must also be published. These aspects have been a cause of concern for a long time, and this, together with the fact that a director will now no longer have a voting right in respect of the nomination of a liquidator merely on the strength of the fact that he has a loan account with the company, now gives a great deal of protection to the shareholder. Since our people are becoming more and more active in commerce and are participating more and more in the business economy of the country by making use of companies, all these amendments are, in my opinion, very welcome, and it is high time that they should be added to the principal Act. Therefore I want to compliment the hon. the Minister and his department on this and give it my wholehearted support.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on these benches will support this legislation. My colleague, the hon. member for Yeoville, will deal with the clauses, further on in the Bill, in regard to auditors, liquidations and insolvencies. There are certain clauses in this Bill which are indeed welcome as an improvement on what has gone before. There are certain clauses on which we have no comment. But, as the hon. the Minister is no doubt aware, we have put two amendments on the Order Paper because we would like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the implications of what is in this legislation.</p>

<p>The first of these amendments deals with the exclusion of a method of making a rights offer or a rights issue, a method which has been used in the past, also in the comparatively recent past, and which has served a useful purpose both to the general public, to the Stock Exchange and to the companies involved. This is now to be excluded in terms of the Bill and we feel that this is to the detriment of the parties which I just named. What is more, we are not aware of any good reason having been put forward for excluding a practice which has been used in the past. We suspect that it is due to bad drafting or an oversight. However, I would like to come back to the matter at a later stage and reserve our argument for them.</p>

<p>Our second amendment concerns a much broader objection to the legislation which is before us. It concerns the powers and the responsibilities of the Stock Exchange, <i>vis-&#x00E1;-</i> <i>vis</i> the companies whose shares are listed on that exchange. So far we have been talking basically about clauses 7 to 11 of the Bill before us. These clauses are concerned with the practice of making rights offers to shareholders of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Let me say straight away that in general we shall support them, as in effect they make it unnecessary, as has been mentioned, for a listed company to issue a prospectus when it makes a rights issue. That certainly in itself is to be welcomed. Clause 9 of the Bill provides for a new section 145A, reading <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) No person shall issue, distribute or deliver, or cause to be issued, distributed or delivered a letter of allocation unless it is accompanied by such documents as are required and have been approved by the stock exchange concerned.</block>

<p>This wording goes very far indeed and involves, as we see it, a matter of principle. The effect of the words &#x201C;unless it is accompanied by such documents as are required and have been approved by the Stock Exchange concerned&#x201D; is to give the judgments, the decisions and the rulings of the committee of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange the force of law. The hon. the Minister will be as well aware of it as I am that the composition of the committee of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, with the solitary exception to the appointment from the Government side&#x2014; which I think is the Registrar of Companies&#x2014; is comprised entirely of members of that Stock Exchange. Obviously, from time to time they change and are bound to change because there are electoral rules. Making every allowance one can for stockbrokers, they must as a section of opinion at times have a subjective approach, and there can be no guarantee that if this legislation is passed as it is now drafted before this House, that the interests of points of view of listed companies will be given the consideration they should when new requirements are introduced. There can be no guarantee either that they will be given the weight that they are given now.</p>

<p>Stockbrokers are no less infallible than the rest of us. The recent Fedmis case&#x2014;to which my colleague, the hon. member for Yeoville referred&#x2014;is sufficient proof of that. We find it hard to understand why the judgment of the committee of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange <span class="col_6325-6326" refersTo="page_0493"/>and their decisions are to be given the force of law. There is absolutely no restriction on the ambit of the wording which, as we have said, simply says &#x201C;unless it is accompanied by such documents as are required and have been approved by the Stock Exchange concerned&#x201D;. We should like to ask the hon. the Minister what is to happen if the Johannesburg Stock Exchange requires a company whose shares are listed on that exchange to give or publish information which in the opinion of the board of directors of the company would not be in the interests of the shareholders to have published. It is not difficult to visualize information which if published would be extremely useful to competitors. In this regard we are thinking of things such as costs, profitability, volume and the share on the market.</p>

<p>What is a company to do in such circumstances? Basically the board of directors has Hobson&#x2019;s choice. It must either provide the information, so that it can be published in the circular of the stock exchange knowing that it will not be in, but that it will, indeed, be against the interests of its shareholders or, ultimately, it is faced with the choice of being delisted by the Stock Exchange if it refuses to publish the information. The alternative choice is much the same thing, i.e. where one could choose to be delisted. Delisting in these sort of circumstances is not going to help its shareholders, it is not going to help the public and, indeed, neither will it encourage more people to invest in shares on the Stock Exchange and, ultimately, it is not going to help the Johannesburg Stock Exchange itself. We think that all the things we have said are likely to flow from this are negative while it is the opposite that should be encouraged.</p>

<p>As we have said, it cannot be denied that there is nothing to stop the committee of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in terms of the proposed section 145A(1), to demand more and more information from companies, demands against which the companies will have no defence or redress.</p>

<p>We know that representations have been made to the standing advisory committee on company law in regard to this question, more particularly representation on the question whether the decision of a body such as the Johannesburg Stock Exchange should have the force of law. What we want to ask the hon. the Minister is whether if he is not prepared to accept the amendment now, he give us an assurance that he will refer this provision with our proposed amendment back to the standing committee. Though it may not be possible, we should prefer that it be done before the hon. the Minister goes to the Other Place with this Bill. If it is not possible for the hon. the Minister to do this before he goes with it to the Other Place, it is going to be much more difficult in future, because then it is the law. This is not in any way to cast on the standing advisory committee; it is simply the way the thing will turn out.</p>

<p>What we find even more difficult is that in terms of the legislation all shares which will be subject to such an offer have to be listed. As things now stands, in terms of current practice the Johannesburg Stock Exchange lays down basic requirements which have to be met by all the listed companies which cover, <i>inter alia,</i> rights offers or issues and to which the committee of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange adhere very strongly. However, there have been occasions in the past where in particular or exceptional circumstances it has been possible to reach compromises or, after discussion, to devise a scheme which meets the points of view of both the parties concerned.</p>

<p>That to our mind is far preferable to what is proposed here. What is proposed here, basically, is to give the view of one side, namely the Johannesburg Stock Exchange or its committee, the force of law. We would much prefer the previous situation where there was flexibility in regard to meeting the news of the parties concerned. The circular and other documents which are presently required by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and are required in terms of a rights issue, are such that they are more than adequate to give, in all normal cases, the shareholder enough information to consider a particular offer. Therefore we again find it very difficult the reason which underlies this particular amendment and what we cannot follow why it is not better to leave matters as they presently stand. If the reasoning escapes me and if the hon. the Minister will not refer this back to the standing advisory committee on company law, then we would like to ask the hon. the Minister in view of the fact that, and this amendment in effect gives the Johannesburg Stock Exchange&#x2019;s decisions the force of law, at the very least to make it conditional on changes in the composition of <span class="col_6327-6328" refersTo="page_0494"/>the committee, because in all equity, surely then it should include representation of the companies whose shares are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Furthermore, Sir, if you want to be equitable about it, before a decision of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange committee is given the force of law, it should be necessary to have the approval of the representatives of those companies whose shares are listed on the Stock Exchange. If the hon. the Minister would not contemplate referring this back to the standing committee, or if the standing advisory committee would not contemplate changing the first amendment, then I hope they will contemplate this, that if they are going to give this committee&#x2019;s decision the force of law, then in all equity the companies whose shares are listed on the Stock Exchange should have representation on the committee. I would also be very interested to know what the reaction of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange would be to such a proposal. I do not know who has suggested to the standing committee that it introduces this amendment. I suspect, seeing that it is only in the interests of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, that it must have been that party. If so, it would be interesting to see which way they would go in relation to this second suggestion, because I do not think they should have everything for their own benefit, because if you start going down this road, as I am sure the members of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange will realize, it ends with the equivalent of the American Securities Exchange Commission.</p>

<p>Sir, there are only two other clauses on which I personally have comments to make. The hon. member for Yeoville, as I have said, will talk about the clauses which relate to auditors and to liquidation. The second clause I would like to refer to before I return to the question of rights issues, is clause 19, which completely redrafts what used to be the old section 2(2)(vi) of the Act. That section prohibits the granting of loans to directors or managers. There was an original draft, but this is not before us and we cannot, therefore, comment on it. However, we have no comments to make on this as it now presently stands, other than to welcome the additional exemption which allows the granting of loans to directors or managers for housing purposes.</p>

<p>The last clause on which we would like to comment at this stage is clause 7. Here we have an amendment on the Order Paper, an amendment which, by the way, must be one of the shortest amendments ever proposed in this House. However, it is not without significance, because what in essence this clause seeks to do is to define a rights issue. It says a &#x201C;rights offer&#x201D; means an offer for subscription, with a right to renounce in favour of other persons, to the members or debenture holders of a company, any of whose shares are listed on a stock exchange within the Republic or which is recognized by the Minister for the purposes of this definition by notice in the Gazette, of any shares (as defined in relation to a prospectus in section 1(1) of that company &#x2026;&#x201D; What it in effect says is that a rights offer covers an offer to the members or shareholders of a company. We have no objection to that in a sense, because it is by far the most normal practice. But what it does not cover, and what used to fall within the ambit of a rights offer and is now excluded by this definition, is the circumstances where an offer may be made to the shareholders of more than one company. The hon. the Minister will be as well aware as I am that in the early days of the Orange Free State goldfields a number of rights issues were made by new mining companies to the shareholders of other mining companies. But we need to go back to 1948 to the opening of the Orange Free State goldfields, or to other events that occurred in that year. Even more recently, in 1968, the East Driefontein Goldmining Company made a rights offer of its own shares to the members of the West Witwatersrand areas, to the Witwatersrand Deep, the Western Ultra Deep Levels and the West Driefontein Goldmining Company and in May last year Deelkraal, which is now a subsidiary of the Goldfields of South Africa, made a rights issue partly to Goldfields itself and partly to the members of Goldfields.</p>

<p>Similar offers have also been made in the case of Free State Saaiplaas last year and also in so far as Elandsrand is concerned. More particularly recently Greatermans made a similar offer. What we cannot understand is that the rationale of the present amendment is to exclude that. There is no difference to our mind. The shares are listed on the Stock Exchange and to simply say that you can only make a rights offer to the shareholders of your company, as opposed to making it to other companies at the same time when all other criteria are met, I hope the hon. the Minister <span class="col_6329-6330" refersTo="page_0495"/>will give us an explanation of why he wants to exclude something which we would have thought is to the benefit of all and certainly facilitates the raising of finance. It has proved of great benefit to the mining industry and, as I have said, also goes beyond the mining industry. I would have thought that, more particularly in these times, South Africa would want to have available to it, or would not willingly debar itself from any kind of method which in the past has proved itself and which meets the other criteria, to raise finance. Here again, if the hon. the Minister does not think it is possible to accept the amendment and on the assumption that he cannot convince me that it should not be excluded, we would hope that he would also agree to refer it to the standing advisory committee.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, like my colleague, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens, I welcome this Bill because I believe it makes a further contribution and is an improvement in many respects to the very excellent Act we have on the Statute Book today. The Bill follows very much the same theme which was presented to the House in 1974, namely that the public should be much more informed on what is taking place and that there should be as much protection for shareholders as possible. The Bill also goes further and tries to bring about a certain amount of streamlining and assistance to the activities in the registrar&#x2019;s office as well as making an improvement in certain respect to technical matters concerning companies, the auditing of companies, the position and the obligations of the auditor himself. Furthermore in respect of the company which goes into liquidation, the assurance that liquidators who are appointed to manage the affairs of a company liquidation makes it possible for the matter to be dealt with quite impartially, because there will be no interest in the election of that liquidator by people who are personally interested in one way or another, as is provided in the latter clauses of this Bill. Company law itself is one of the pillars of our commercial system today and plays a very important part in the disciplining of the commercial life of the community. Today it is one of the most highly technical phases of our commercial law. When we have amendments put forward in the House, one is very much encouraged by the fact that these amendments are brought forward as a result of discussion and investigation by a standing advisory committee on company law on which sit, some of the outs&#x0026;lt;u&#x0026;gt;tanding&#x0026;lt;/u&#x0026;gt; legal l&#x0026;lt;u&#x0026;gt;uminari&#x0026;lt;/u&#x0026;gt;es of our country. In that sense one must look back at the Act itself with a sense of gratitude that a provision of this nature was incorporated so that we can have, as the years move on, a steady and constant improvement in the light of the circumstances of the day, improvements brought about not by people who have an axe to grind, not by people who represent only one section of thought in the commercial community, but rather by people who are able to look at the matter as legal experts from a purely and completely impartial point of view. For those reasons one approaches a Bill of this nature with a great amount of interest and certainly with a much greater ease of mind than one might normally approach a Bill of such a technical nature and where one has to look at so many aspects of our law in order to be satisfied as to what the legislator intends to incorporate in the existing Act.</p>

<p>The first thought that passed through my mind when I read the Bill, was the very excellent provision in clause 1 dealing with microfilming. I think microfilming is very vital in the community today for the keeping of records. Provision is not only made to maintain records on microfilm, but also for it to be used in evidence as the best evidence. This is a very important departure from the normal rules regarding the best evidence, because evidence will not be brought in the form of the actual record, but in the form of a microfilm of that record.</p>

<p>The thought I would like to put to the hon. the Minister is whether steps are being contemplated with regard to producing, first of all, a master copy of the particular record that is being microfilmed and, secondly, what procedure will be established for the certification of such master copies which will remain for all time as the authentic original record of that particular document. I do understand from inquiries that I have made&#x2014;I can be corrected if I am wrong&#x2014;that the microfilm record will replace the original document, which will, in time, be destroyed. It is impossible to house the voluminous records that are constantly growing up not only in the Registrar&#x2019;s office, but also in other offices. For example, I understand that in Britain the company&#x2019;s office had to be moved out of London to another <span class="col_6331-6332" refersTo="page_0496"/>town where all their records are being housed, but in the London company&#x2019;s office the microfilm of all such records can be found. With the conservative approach of English Law and we share that peculiarity one can well understand&#x2014;that they do not intend at this stage to destroy the original documents. However, I gather that as far as we are concerned, it will be destroyed and that the microfilm will remain as the only record. That is why I raise the question as to what steps have been taken to provide a master copy and what form of certification will be used to ensure that the master copy remains as the authentic document from which a microfilm can be made when it is required for official purposes and as admissibility of evidence in any court of law. In order to illustrate how important this issue is, one must realize how many companies are registered year by year.</p>

<p>In 1971, for instance, 14 400 companies were registered; in 1972, 14 300; and in 1973, almost 17 000 companies. As a result of the Act of 1973 and the new problems that presented itself with the reshaping of the actual documents for registration, the figure dropped to 4 101. In 1975 the number of companies which was registered, amounted to 4 676. Nevertheless, it is an illustration of how an office can become cluttered up with thousands and thousands of records. One virtually has to erect buildings, large structures in order to house these documents, because if they are to remain as original records, they have to be housed fireproof and in such a manner that they can withstand any pilfering, break-ins, etc. One can well understand that the whole question of microfilming can almost virtually be regarded as an important principle of the entire Bill. It has brought into being something which is not only important to us when recording generally, but which is also going to spread to other institutions, like our deeds offices, our law courts and certainly to our lower courts where I know the volume of records is becoming almost impossible to look after and control. Factors like waste of manpower and of time should be taken into account if we want to streamline the process of maintaining satisfactory records.</p>

<p>In the Bill we do not find much to quibble about. I was interested in what the hon. member for Johannesburg North had to say about the Bill, because to the best of my knowledge certain of the requirements of the Stock Exchange are laid down in the Stock Exchange Act. I hope the hon. member will clarify this point during the Committee Stage. The Registrar of Companies does not serve on the committee of the Stock Exchange, but the Registrar of Financial Institutions or his representative serves in a permanent capacity on the committee in terms of the Act. The requirements of the Stock Exchange are regulated in terms of the spirit of the Stock Exchange Act. I think the danger, which was foreseen when the new Act was put on the Statute Book, namely that private information which does not concern the public may be exposed so that a competitive company can gain knowledge of another company&#x2019;s affairs does not exist. I am not sure that the hon. member&#x2019;s view is very sound, but I would very much like to hear what the hon. member is going to say in the Committee Stage in order to clarify this doubt which he has raised in regard to the manner the Stock Exchange committee will deal with the documents and information that it requires.</p>

<p>Another point which I would like the hon. member to explain&#x2014;I think it will interest us all&#x2014;is the question of the rights offer and some of the examples he gave us. When I read the particular clause, it struck me that this would be one way of ensuring that the members of the company would receive the allocation of shares with the right to renounce it in favour of other persons and so have an opportunity to subscribe and to provide the capital of which the hon. member talks. I may be wrong, but I would very much like to know, because it is a matter of concern to us. It seems to me that these clauses have been drafted in such a way as to ensure that the members of the company have the first opportunity to provide the necessary capital that may be called for by the company. As regards the question of the information required by the Stock Exchange, I think that the provision in the clause obviates the need to have even the attenuated prospectus in terms of schedule 3. This information, as I have said, is called for, but it has to a large extent been laid down and would be sufficient to acquaint the member of the company, who will already have seen other balance sheets in the past and who usually knows something of the company, with just enough information to satisfy him that everything that should be disclosed has been <span class="col_6333-6334" refersTo="page_0497"/>satisfactorily disclosed. That is how I see that particular question.</p>

<p>I want to refer to one or two other matters which interest me. Firstly there is the question of the loans. The provision in respect of the loans, I find very satisfactory indeed. I think, further, that the new provisions in regard to the auditor are very helpful indeed.</p>

<p>One could of course go into a lot of detail on the various clauses, because one could compare the situation as it was with the improvements which are now being proposed. However I feel that this Bill will largely benefit the shareholders and will further strengthen the security of the shareholders and the public and not leave them exposed to any of the ills which were formerly encountered and most of which, I think, were remedied by the Act, to which this Bill is an amendment. We know that many ills in years past have been a contributory factor in shareholders having their fingers burnt. With those few words I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the contents of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall say a few words about the speech by the hon. member for Johannesburg North at a later stage. I think that basically the hon. members of the Official Opposition support us as far as this Bill is concerned. At this stage I, too, need to say something in connection with this legislation. Actually, I want to say that today we have once again a product before us of the work of the standing advisory committee on the Companies Act. However, we are too inclined to give all the credit and the thanks to this standing committee without thinking of the Registrar of Companies, who played a very important role in this process. I am thinking in particular of the fact that the present Registrar of Companies, Adv. Schoeman, will shortly vacate this post in order to take over another. It is noteworthy that in the period in which he was Registrar of Companies, we have had the greatest change to the Companies Act, in the short period of three years. I am referring to the Companies Amendment Bill of 1974 and to the important Amendment Bill before the House today. When I thank Adv. Schoeman, I have no intention of derogating from the important work done for us by the standing advisory committee at all. It is so that the use in the business world of a juristic person, usually in the form of a company, has become very much more important today than it was a few years ago. It is a useful instrument to use when one is in the business world.</p>

<p>If we look at the history of the Companies Act and at the rules and regulations relating to this matter, we find that there has always been a certain degree of mistrust and misgivings about a company. That is why the rules and regulations have always been stated severely and strictly. In time we became accustomed to it and made more use of this instrument. Therefore it is gratifying for me to be able to deduce from the Amendment Bill before us today that a certain degree of confidence is once again being shown in the use of this instrument, and that as a result we can do away with some of the strict and severe rules and regulations. I think that in particular we are going to save a great deal of time and money as a result of this legislation, because certain things, which are not important because a situation of confidence has developed, are being eliminated.</p>

<p>This Bill is, of course a technical measure and a measure which probably lends itself to discussion during the Committee Stage. In that connection I immediately want to tell the hon. member for Johannesburg North that he has already made his Committee Stage speeches. All he did not do was to move his two amendments formally. That hon. member wasted our time by speaking in that way during the debate on the Second Reading. If he wanted to move those amendments, he should rather have waited until the Committee Stage. I just want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville, who is also going to speak about this Bill, that we expect a Second Reading speech from him and not a Committee Stage speech. But, Sir, since the hon. member for Johannesburg North has now referred to clauses 7 and 9, I just want to dwell on this and comment briefly on those clauses. It is very clear what the hon. member for Johannesburg North has in mind with the amendment to clause 7 which he wants to move. In that connection I agree with the hon. member for Jeppe. In the first place we must afford the shareholders of the company the first opportunity &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>As far as clause 9 is concerned, the hon. member is now very concerned about the stock exchange. Mr. Speaker, it is very important to remember that this House appointed a Select Committee to go into the whole question of the functioning of the stock exchange. That Select Committee reported to this House. The hon. member wants to make out that the stock exchange&#x2019;s committee may now set certain provisions and demands which will make it impossible for a company to comply with this, and which will retard the whole operation. The amendment which the hon. member is going to move, reads almost like a love story; there are a whole lot of words without any meaning. The hon. member is not making a positive recommendation. The hon. member must tell us whether he agrees, basically, with the principle&#x2014;and this is exactly what the Second Reading is all about&#x2014;that there should be a body which can lay down rules and regulations as to when such a letter of allocation may be sent out. If he agrees that there should be a body to do this, I want to tell him that under the present circumstances that body can only be the stock exchange and that the stock exchange must therefore obtain the necessary authorization in order to be able to do this. The stock exchange had this in the past. Why should we take it away from them now? If we look at the report on the stock exchange published by the Select Committee we find that many problems are identified, but also that one thing was ensured as a result of it, and this is that an attitude of confidence towards South Africa, the committee of the stock exchange, and the stock exchange as a whole, was brought about. The hon. member now wants the stock exchange to have that power no longer. Sir, I hope that the hon. the Minister is not going to accept these two amendments of the hon. member for Johannesburg North, because that would take the heart out of this measure. Sir, in conclusion I just want to say to the hon. the Minister that we in the business world are very grateful for this amendment Bill, which introduces flexibility to the procedures and facilitates the use of this instrument which is at our disposal to such an extent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member for Johannesburg North has indicated, we will support the Second Reading of this legislation. I think it is now fairly obvious that company amendment Bills are likely to be annual events. Although that has certain disadvantages, in the sense of creating a state of uncertainty about the law, the advantage of this procedure is that a piece of legislation is being kept under constant review and that abnormalities are continually being removed. As a result legislation is, in fact, improved. For that reason it is obviously desirable to introduce legislation of this kind as soon as faults in existing legislation are perceived. I for one do not object to the hon. the Minister coming with this type of legislation every year if the proposals are, in fact, of a constructive nature, as are the majority contained in the legislation before us.</p>

<p>Another procedure being adopted is also one of which we approve, and here I am referring to the fact that there is not only a standing advisory committee to deal with these matters, but also the widest possible degree of consultation taking place about these matters. Therefore, by the time the legislation comes before us there has been a very wide range of consultations, the matter has ceased to be contentious and the legislation is therefore such that all stages can be passed, even at such a late hour on a Friday afternoon, without anyone other than perhaps the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke becoming emotional about the issue. It is for those reasons that one feels one can support the Second Reading of this legislation.</p>

<p>May I immediately, however, respond to <span class="col_6337-6338" refersTo="page_0499"/>what appears to be a complete misunderstanding of the position about rights issues where rights accrue to a company other than the company in respect of which the shares are being taken up. With respect to both the hon. member for Jeppe and the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke, who has now disappeared and is apparently not taking up his rights, it is quite clear that there are instances where it is necessary to have the rights given to people who are not shareholders in the company concerned. For the benefit of these two hon. members, let me give an example. For instance, there are two companies quoted on the stock exchange; the one is Plate Glass and the other is Placor. If Plate Glass, which is a company in which Placor holds the majority of the shares, has a rights issue, either Placor can take up these rights or the shareholders in Placor itself could take them up, and if Placor has not got the means by which to take up the rights, it would be unfair towards the shareholders of Placor, whose sole interest is in shares in Plate Glass, of which this is a holding company, if the rights did not accrue to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>But they can renounce those rights in favour of that company.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>That is the very point I am making. They can do so, and that is why, when one has renounceable rights of this kind, they should also apply to other companies.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North referred to the Greatermans situation. There are two other companies that hold substantial shares in Greatermans, i.e. Gresham and Griffon. What is wrong with what Greatermans has just done in having an issue of shares and stating that the shareholders of Greatermans and the shareholders of Gresham and Griffon would be allowed to take up rights? To say, as the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke did, that this is a scheme for the easier take-over of companies, is just utter nonsense. All that the hon. member for Johannesburg North has said is that the shortcut that is being recommended and given here in respect of rights issues should also be extended to other companies where these rights can be taken up. It is as simple as that. There is no question of monopolies or the take-over of companies. All of that is utterly irrelevant to this issue and I do not know why it has been introduced into this debate, unless there has been a misreading of what the actual provisions of the law are. There is no question, of course, that rights issues to other companies are not going to be allowed. All that has been suggested by the hon. member for Johannesburg North is that this easier procedure in respect of rights being taken up in this form should also be applied to rights given to other companies.</p>

<p>Therefore, with great respect, the case that has been put by the hon. member for Johannesburg North, a case which I thought he had put quite completely and adequately without my having to get involved in this debate, I think is an unanswerable case.</p>

<p>I understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s problem and I realize that because he would like to get the views of other people as well, he has difficulty in saying immediately that he accepts the amendment. The proposed amendment will, in other words, be referred to the advisory committee and there will be consultation. We are quite happy with that, but this is the correct forum in which to offer such a suggestion.</p>

<p>I should like to make two other points. The first is that I, for one, am sorry that in this legislation there is not an amendment to section 37 of the Companies Act.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>I think it is both advisable and necessary that we have such an amendment. I think there is a further amendment which needs to be looked at. I think we should again look at the fourth schedule of the Act. I am of the opinion that paragraphs 25 and 26 in particular require to be amended. I think we need to deal with, for example, listed securities which are held for investment purposes and listed securities which are held for trading purposes in different ways, because amendments may be desirable. There are other <span class="col_6339-6340" refersTo="page_0500"/>aspects as well and we hope that we shall get further legislation next year in order that some of these matters may be put right.</p>

<p>May I now turn to a question which has not yet been referred to except in passing by the hon. member for Jeppe? I refer to the question of auditors. I believe that there is a considerable feeling in the commercial community that with the increase in the duties of auditors which is necessary in order to make sure that there are no abuses, there is unfortunately also a very substantial increase in costs. I think the hon. the Minister should himself pay attention to and ask his staff to pay attention to getting procedures which will give us the safeguards which are needed but which at the same time will keep the matter of costs under control. Exactly the same can be said in respect of the many secretarial services that now have to be rendered as a result of the amendments introduced by the Bill. I do not want to waste the time of the House at this late hour with giving full details, but, really, the increased cost of running even the smallest of companies is something to which the hon. the Minister should pay attention. It also applies to him in another capacity in dealing with his anti-inflation campaign, because this is in fact fruitless expenditure except for those who earn the fees which are involved. I really think that this needs some attention.</p>

<p>A further matter with which I should like to deal in relation to auditors is that the legislation to my mind quite correctly lays down that when auditors, for a variety of reasons, cease to hold office, they have to make certain reports and they cannot be removed from office until certain things have happened. Clause 21 which seeks to amend section 227 of the principal Act contains the following proviso&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that where an auditor has reason to believe that in the conduct of the affairs of the company a material irregularity has taken place or is taking place which has caused or is likely to cause financial loss to the company or to any of its members or creditors, and he has made a report thereon in writing to the directors of the company, he may not be removed from office &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, if he is aware of an irregularity but he has not yet made his report, he can be removed from office. I believe that is undesirable. I believe that, if he is aware of it, and he has not yet made his report, he should not be removed from office because he can still make his report. I believe that&#x2014;while I am not going to move an amendment on this because I believe legislation should not be delayed&#x2014;this is a matter to which attention should be paid. When one looks at clause 23 of this Bill, a clause which amends section 28 of the Act, it is interesting to note that, where there is a question of resignation, it is not asked whether he has already made the report, but whether he has the belief.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>I have been on the point all the time, old cock! Sir, may I just refer to clause 27? In this clause provisions are made that in &#x201C;any winding up by the court a director or former director of a company shall have no voting right in respect of the nomination of a liquidator on the ground of his loan account with the company or claims for arrear salary, travelling expenses or allowances due by the company or claims paid by such director or former director on behalf of the company&#x201D;. This might mean that a man who is a very substantial creditor might have no say in the nomination of a liquidator at all, but that can be excused if the company of which such a person is a director, is one that has gone into liquidation, because he should perhaps have seen to it that the company did not go into liquidation. I believe that is justifiable. However, subsection (b) of the clause reads that the same right applies to a person to whom the claims have been ceded. Many such claims are being ceded as security for debts, not for the purpose of liquidation or abuse. What may well happen as a result of this&#x2014;and I know this exists in respect of financial institutions where they take cession of the loan accounts as security for their <span class="col_6341-6342" refersTo="page_0501"/>debts&#x2014;is that they may well be deprived of the right of voting on this claim for the purpose of nominating a liquidator. They will then only be able to vote on their own claim. Where a claim has been acquired, this problem may arise. I want to ask the hon. the Minister again to investigate this matter in order to have this provision amended with a view to safeguarding <i>bona fide</i> creditors, and not merely nominees to which it has been ceded.</p>

<p>Those are all the points that I would like to make at this stage. I have made them now, because I shall not make them in the Committee Stage. We shall allow the Committee Stage to go through without debate, except for moving a few amendments we intend to move. We do this, because we believe that it is not possible, in the light of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude, to persuade him to accept any amendments now. Therefore, we support the Second Reading, and that is where we let the matter rest.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank hon. members for their support of this Bill. They will understand that I cannot react to their standpoints in greater detail at this stage. I only want to make a few general remarks and also to reply specifically to the amendments which appear on the Order Paper. I shall do so very briefly.</p>

<p>As our business life becomes more sophisticated, and since our business activities are conducted chiefly on a company basis, amendments to the legislation in question will naturally continue to be made. This is proved by the fact that we foresaw this when this Act was amended in 1974 to provide for a permanent committee to evaluate the necessary amendments from time to time. The draft legislation which is under consideration at the moment complies with three other basic principles contained in the Companies Act. The first of these is disclosure. The second is protection. The third principle arises mainly from the phenomenon that the management and ownership of companies often differ these days. This is a difference which is becoming greater and greater. Therefore there must be clear action to inform the owners, in other words the shareholders, of the way the company is run by the management&#x2014;who are not necessarily the owners. I do not believe that there is any hon. member in this House who will advance any argument to counter these basic principles, principles which underlie the present amendments as well. Therefore I shall not take the matter any further at this stage.</p>

<p>A second important element in the legislation under discussion concerns procedure. It is aimed at facilitating the procedure as far as it is compatible with the concepts to which I referred earlier. It also concerns the question of auditors. I am quite prepared to investigate the implications of clause 21, which concerns the removal from office of an auditor. This is one of the points to which the hon. member for Yeoville referred. I am also prepared to inquire into the fourth schedule.</p>

<p>Any hon. member who during the coming recess, discovers facets in this legislation to which they would like me to give consideration, is welcome to bring such problems to my attention. I shall be pleased to help them. I shall refer their inquiries to the permanent committee.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to clauses 7 and 9 and the amendments to them which have been moved. We must bear in mind that clause 7 provides for a shortened procedure in connection with rights offers. The proposed section 145A in no way prohibits rights offers, as the hon. member for Johannesburg North made out, when there is a full prospectus. This is the essence of the matter. Companies may therefore still make rights offers to other companies, but not through the shortened procedure.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Should I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, it would go very much further than what the hon. member for Yeoville is asking for. It would mean that the issuing of offers according to the shortened procedure would be applicable to subsidiaries as well. It could also lead to the issuing of offers to the public without prospectus. This I cannot accept, and the hon. member will understand why not. However, I am prepared to refer the matter to the permanent committee.</p>

<p>You have actually missed the point I made.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have not missed the point. I have indicated that there can be a share <span class="col_6343-6344" refersTo="page_0502"/>issue to other companies, but not through the shortened process provided for in the proposed section 145A. This does not prevent it. That is the point I am trying to make at this stage.</p>

<p>*I want to dwell on clause 9 for a moment. However, I shall not discuss it at any length. The hon. member will understand that we are dealing here with listed companies. The people who decide about the listing of a company are the people of the Stock Exchange, which is subject to the rules and provisions of the Stock Exchange Act and not to the one which is before us at the moment. I cannot understand the hon. member&#x2019;s problem. The same company which is making a rights offer with respect to the provisions we are dealing with, is now, according to the Bill, going to determine which documents should accompany the letter of allocation. Hon. members must remember that the company has already been listed.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that we must not take the hon. member&#x2019;s fears seriously. The Stock Exchange consists of stockbrokers, but these people are dependant on the number of companies listed on the exchange for their livelihood. The concept of the Stock Exchange Act, as also the concept of this Bill, is that facts should be published as far as possible, so that people may know what they are deciding about.</p>

<heading>PREVENTION OF ILLEGAL SQUATTING AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time. With effect from 2 October 1975 the State President entrusted the implementation of the Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act, No. 52 of 1951, except in so far as it confers and imposes powers and duties upon and entrusts functions to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, to the Minister of Community Development, after it had previously been administered by the Minister of Justice. Hon. members will agree with me that this was a logical step, for the prevention and clearance of concentrations of squatters are very closely connected with the provision of accommodation, which is a function of the Department of Community Development.</p>

<p>Like the poor, squatters have always been with us, certainly since the days of Jan van Riebeeck. It is assuming serious proportions, however, particularly in the Cape Peninsula and its environs, a tendency which cannot be freely allowed to continue.</p>

<p>The question may be asked: What is the extent of the problem, how does squatting originate, and where do the squatters come from?</p>

<p>Surveys by my department disclosed the following interesting facts:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Approximately 21 600 Coloured families are squatters or shanty-dwellers in the Cape Peninsula and its immediate environs, and more than 120 000 people are living in these shanties;</li>

<li>(2) Approximately 25&#x0025; of the squatters in certain concentrations of squatters came from the rural areas; and</li>

<li>(3) more than 60&#x0025; of the squatters in the concentrations of squatters in which a survey was made, previously lived in municipal scheme dwellings but moved away as a result of non-payment of rent or because they could not or would not accept the responsibility or discipline associated with the occupation of a proper scheme dwelling.</li>

</ol>

<p>We have heard of a sub-culture of poverty, but here we find a more specific phenomenon, where the way of life of the squatters also tends to degenerate into a sub-culture or custom out of which people are unable to extricate themselves. Consequently it is clear that the provision of housing alone is not the <span class="col_6347-6348" refersTo="page_0504"/>only answer, but that other control measures are also necessary.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are persons who encourage squatting, for example, the so-called &#x201C;squatter-mongers&#x201D; who lease a piece of land to a prospective squatter, relatively speaking at very high rentals, and then allow them to put up a shanty dwelling on that land. In virtually all cases no basic services such as water or sanitation are provided, but the lessor collects large amounts in rentals every month. Of course such a squatter-monger will not admit that he is allowing squatting and collecting rent. These practices must be actively curbed. In addition there are those who always take the part of the squatter who prefers such a way of life and in that way, for reasons which only they understand, encourage squatting.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that squatter spots create an extremely poor impression and are a discredit to our country&#x2014;and some of us are concerned about this&#x2014;they also constitute a danger to the safety and health of the squatter himself. The gastric fever cases at Mamre and Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass village a while ago testify to this. Such spots, particularly if they increase in size, are also breeding grounds for crime and vagrancy, and ought therefore to be cleared as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The solution to this squatter problem should be tackled in two ways. The first, and in my opinion the most important, is the provision of a sufficient number of proper dwellings with the necessary services in which existing shanty-dwellers can finally be accommodated. Secondly, there has to be strict control over the erection of new squatter huts. As far as the first and the positive stage is concerned, I should like to furnish hon. members with further information.</p>

<p>In order to deal the final death-blow to the squatter problem in the Cape Peninsula and its environs my department has reached an agreement with the City Council of Cape Town and the Divisional Councils of the Cape and Stellenbosch to launch a crash building programme according to which approximately 10 000 dwelling units for Coloureds will be constructed annually as soon as the building programme gets under way. During 1975, while the programme was still in the process of getting under way, a total of 4 546 dwelling units were completed, while 4 355 units were under construction by the end of 1975: At one juncture, therefore, a total of 8 901 dwelling units had therefore been completed or were in prospect. Not all the completed units are allocated to squatters. But since 1 August 1974 a total of 2 675 squatter families have been accommodated in proper houses. As from this year a considerable acceleration in the pace of the re-accommodation of squatters is being envisaged, and the housing programme has been phenomenally expedited. In Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain alone contracts for 12 000 houses will already have been awarded by August 1976, unless something very unforeseen happens.</p>

<p>In order to expedite the re-accommodation of squatters, my department reduced its 50&#x0025; reservation on completed dwellings for resettlement purposes to 25&#x0025; last year, and reached an agreement with the local authorities concerned to apply at least 37&#x00BD;&#x0025; of all completed dwellings for the clearance of concentrations of squatters. Centres elsewhere in the country where similar problems exist are also receiving preferential treatment of course.</p>

<p>Here I should like to elucidate what I have just said concerning reservation further. Approximately two years ago 80&#x0025; of the houses which were completed were utilized for resettlement, and 20&#x0025; for the purposes of local authorities, <i>inter alia,</i> to clear shanty areas and combat over-population. With effect from November 1974 it was decided that only 25&#x0025; of new dwellings would be used for resettlement and that 75&#x0025; of the dwellings would be utilized for the purposes of local authorities. Of the 75&#x0025; which local authorities obtain, half, i.e. 37&#x00BD;&#x0025; will be utilized only for the accommodation of squatters.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members will realize that in the present financial climate not even housing was able to escape the pruning of the estimates of departments. However, the Government allocated such a high priority to the provision of housing for Coloureds, <i>inter alia,</i> owing to the squatter problem, that funds for Coloured housing were pruned by the absolute minimum. Of the total amount of R112 million which was placed at the disposal of the National Housing Fund for 1976-&#x2019;77, more than 60&#x0025; has been allocated to Coloured housing only. This indicates a special concession with a view to the elimination of the backlog here and the termination of squatter conditions.</p>

<p>I should like to elucidate this aspect further. Last year an amount of R112 million was made available to the Housing Fund. Of that <span class="col_6349-6350" refersTo="page_0505"/>amount R60 million was employed for Coloured Housing, and of that R60 million an amount of R50 million was employed in the Cape Peninsula and Stellenbosch. Stated in another way, during 1974 a total of 3 339 dwelling units for Whites, 8 243 for Coloureds and 1 482 for Indians were constructed out of the housing fund. In 1975 these figures increased to 5 580 units for Whites, 13 172 for Coloureds and 1 650 for Indians. This shows how the Government and my department senses where the need is most pressing, and this applies in particular to the Coloureds of the Cape, which is where the squatter problem exists. I want to put this in another way as well, for if we want to conduct a fruitful debate on this matter, it is necessary that what we are doing on the positive side to deal with this problem should be known. In 1974 an amount of R44 million was spent on White housing, and although the Coloureds number less than half of the White population, an amount of R41 million was spent on them in this regard, and an amount of R12 million on the Indians. In 1975 an amount of R78 million was spent on White housing, R70 million on Coloured housing and R13 million on Indian housing.</p>

<p>Once again I want to put it in another way, because I want everyone to realize what is happening. Since the establishment of the National Housing Fund in 1920 one house has been built for every 61 Whites; since that time one house has been built for every 15 Coloureds, and one house for every 14 Indians. [Interjections.] I am doing my best to bring home the facts of the matter to hon. members. This just shows how the problem was neglected under previous Governments. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Just to indicate that the process is continuing, I want to point out a few aspects as far as the appropriation of funds for this current year is concerned, funds in respect of which we have been limited. Here there are a few interesting facts. In Johannesburg, an amount of R6 500 000 has been appropriated for Coloureds from this year&#x2019;s estimates for housing, and an amount of R500 000 for Whites. In the municipal area of Cape Town alone an amount of R24 500 000 has been appropriated for housing for Coloureds, and for Whites an amount of R345 000. In Durban&#x2014;and here the Indians come into the picture on a large scale&#x2014;an amount of R6 million has been appropriated for housing for Indians, R1 830 000 for Coloureds, and R260 000 for Whites. In Pretoria an amount of R420 000 was appropriated for Indians, R1 million for Whites, and for Coloureds&#x2014;there are not many of them&#x2014;R580 000. In Port Elizabeth an amount of R1 500 000 was appropriated for Indians and R3 500 000 for Coloureds. Apparently all the Whites in Port Elizabeth have houses, and it was not necessary to appropriate anything for them. In Pietermaritzburg an amount of R120 000 was appropriated for Coloureds, R40 000 for Whites, and R1 300 000, in round figures, for Indians.</p>

<p>It does not matter, therefore, how one looks at it. An honest person, a person who has respect for the problems of South Africa, a man who has insight into what is being done to deal with the problems, can only be grateful for and proud of what is being done, what is being done with dedication, enthusiasm and a true realization of the need to deal with this problem. However, we are constantly being told that those people who are consequently being &#x201C;resettled&#x201D;, already had accommodation. I stand by what I am now going to say. It can be proved. Although it will be difficult for some hon. members in this House to believe, I want to tell them this, because it is the truth. Resettlement in terms of the Group Areas Act is repeatedly being blamed for the shortage of Coloured housing and the squatter conditions, but the fact remains that approximately 90&#x0025; of all disqualified persons who are resettled, were previously living in dwellings which did not comply with health requirements and which had to be demolished in any case. They lived in slum areas which were unsuitable for human occupation. In practice the Group Areas Act has contributed more to putting an end to squatter and slum conditions than all the other measures put together. For that reason I, in common with my friends of the United Party, am pleased that we never voted against group areas in principle. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>A further encouraging aspect in regard to the provision of housing is that offers are received from time to time, from abroad as well, in terms of which private organizations wish to make capital available for carrying out housing projects in our country. Usually such a source of finance is consequently interested in participating in the construction contract or in undertaking the project itself. My department <span class="col_6351-6352" refersTo="page_0506"/>has investigated these proposals with enthusiasm and I find it very gratifying to be able to announce now that the Treasury has approved in principle that such foreign capital may in fact be utilized for the provision of housing, but on certain conditions.</p>

<p>The first is that the total amount involved may not annually exceed 10&#x0025; of the amount appropriated for the department in its estimates for the provision of housing to the public. Last year, for example, it could, then, have been R11 million which we could have repaid to people who lent money for housing in South Africa from private sources. In reality this means then that the R10 million which is available, is multiplied five, six, seven or eight times as far as the immediate provision of houses is concerned. The second condition is that the Treasury may at any time within the loan period make cumulative amounts indicated in the first condition available to the department. The third condition is that if the source of finance is interested in undertaking the construction work itself, it will have to tender against other people on a competitive basis.</p>

<p>There have been offers of this nature which are now being considered. At the moment we are giving our urgent attention to working out the conditions. As soon as the conditions have been finalized and, it is hoped in the present year still, put into operation, this will give great added momentum to the provision of housing in general and the re-accommodation of squatters in particular. For example the scheme will make it possible to make a start with between 6 000 and 8 000 additional Coloured houses in the Cape Peninsula in I976-&#x2019;77, apart from those which will be financed from the normal sources.</p>

<p>While I am on the subject of housing now, I want to avail myself of the opportunity to rectify a Press report on a speech which I made in the Senate and which was unfortunately taken over by other newspapers. The report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> which appeared in good faith in other newspapers as well, quoted me as having said that the housing backlog would be eliminated within eight years, and that I staked my political reputation on this in fact happening.</p>

<p>What did you say?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall explain in a moment. First I just want to point out that my political reputation does not belong to me, but to the public. Therefore it is not something I can wager, and I did not do so either. What I did say was that my department, in cooperation with the local authorities in South Africa, had with great difficulty and over a long period, created the machinery, the infrastructure in the building industry in particular, which could enable us to eliminate the housing backlog within eight years&#x2014;provided adequate funds were made available. I stand by this statement, because it is a fact that, on the initiative of the Department of Community Development, the machinery&#x2014;that is, the physical machinery, the manpower and the materials&#x2014;has been established to eliminate the housing backlog in South Africa within seven or eight years. What I said, was incorrectly presented, but the figures which I have quoted today are surely sufficient proof for any impartial person of the truth of my statement.</p>

<p>I can state the matter in another way as well. During 1975 13 000 houses were completed for Coloureds, with a further 12 000 under construction. Perhaps this does not appear to be many if one states it in this way, but it is difficult to picture to ourselves what 25 000 houses look like if you put them all together. Over against that only 32 000 houses for Coloureds were built in the whole of South Africa during the preceding 40 years, from 1920 to 1960. In those days they built 800 houses per annum, while we are now building 25 000 houses for Coloureds per annum. We are therefore building 30 times faster than in the years between 1920 and 1960. One should really be fair now and admit that this is a great achievement. It is only petty people who will fail to appreciate and who will belittle this:</p>

<p>Let us for a while consider the squatters in particular, their incomes and what can be done for them in particular and for accommodation in general, by employers as well. It has been found in the past that the incomes of many squatters were only just too high to allow them <span class="col_6353-6354" refersTo="page_0507"/>to qualify for sub-economic dwellings, but that they could hardly afford economic rentals. Hon. members will recall that I was able to announce at the opening of Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain that the sub-economic income limit for Coloureds had been raised from R100 to R200 per month to put it on a par with the White income limit. At the same time an interim interest rate of 3&#x00BD;&#x0025; for leasing purposes was also introduced in respect of the breadwinner whose income was between R200 and R250 per month. We introduced that rate as against the economic interest rate of 8&#x00BD;&#x0025;<i>.</i> With these concessions this problem of excessively high rentals for squatters and others ought soon, for the most part, to be something of the past.</p>

<p>In passing I want to say that some people were impressed last year with a kind of core house which was propagated and advertised here in our country. This core house was built at a low cost by the earthquake victims of Peru themselves, and according to newspaper reports this type of house was seen as a solution to the squatter problem. Those newspapermen were entitled to their opinion, but we attach more value to the opinion of experts. Consequently I asked the experts of my department to investigate this matter, and they came to the conclusion that this core house is little more than a shelter, and that it will not be suited to our weather conditions at all. The core house may mean something in the desert, but definitely not here. After all, if it does not rain, it does not leak. In the Cape Peninsula, it rains a great deal, particularly in the winter months.</p>

<p>The department is itself engaged in an investigation into the possibility of building an exceptionally cheap dwelling which will still be a proper, permanent house and which will meet the needs of that type of squatter and other persons who have a very low or no income. However, I want to confirm with great emphasis what the hon. the Prime Minister said at Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain, i.e. that the Department of Community Development will not allow inferior houses which could degenerate into slums.</p>

<p>Repeated appeals have been made to employers to participate more actively, in their own interests, in the provision of accommodation for their employees. Employers could for example be allowed to obtain land in the residential areas of their workers on a long-term lease basis and erect houses for their workers there. In addition there is a scheme in progress at Belhar, near Cape Town, in terms of which members of the Chamber of Commerce are making financial assistance available to their workers to construct dwellings on a joint basis. Other employers or employers&#x2019; organizations could also apply to set to work on similar schemes. I should like to request employers to make use of those schemes which are at their disposal and not always simply to look to the Government and local authorities for accommodation for their employees.</p>

<p>I repeat that we are very strongly opposed to the establishment of temporary squatter camps. True, there are certain advantages attached to this, <i>inter alia,</i> the regulation of uncontrolled squatting and the provision of basic services where these did not previously exist; but on the other hand there are disadvantages which weigh heavily against these, <i>inter alia,</i> the attraction of even more squatters, the incurring of fruitless expenditure in regard to the provision of services, and the tendency of temporary camps to become permanent, with all the evils which go with that. The hon. members who recently accompanied me on a visit to the housing schemes of the Cape Peninsula will recall that we also paid a visit to Elsies River. Elsies River was originally a site-and-service scheme. Perhaps it provided a need at the time, but Elsies River has tended to become permanent. Now matters have to be rectified, because it is a disgrace. Elsies River is a terrible disgrace. Today, however, it will cost us R68 million, just to clear that one slum area, a slum area which originated in accordance with the desire of people who thought that they should strive for temporary solutions. But those temporary solutions offered no way out of the real problem.</p>

<p>Far rather than perpetuating squatter areas&#x2014;and I want to emphasize this&#x2014;proper, permanent houses with the necessary services must be provided as rapidly as possible. The Department of Community Development is providing those houses as rapidly as possible, and sometimes even more rapidly than seems possible.</p>

<p>When my department reached an agreement with the City Council of Cape Town and with the Divisional Councils of the Cape and Stellenbosch on the launching of the crash building programme in respect of Coloured accommodation, it was decided that the <span class="col_6355-6356" refersTo="page_0508"/>erection of squatters&#x2019; huts which had been completed prior to 15 November 1974, would be condoned. However, hon. members must again listen carefully now. What I am saying here might compel some hon. members to change their speeches if they intend running after what I read in the newspapers from the mouths of certain so-called authorities, who, incidentally, know nothing about this problem. In addition to the decision that the construction of squatters&#x2019; huts which had been completed prior to 15 November 1974 would be condoned, it was also decided that any shanties which were established after that date would immediately be demolished.</p>

<p>Squatter control officers have been appointed by the abovementioned bodies, and wide publicity has been given to the matter in order to warn prospective squatters after 15 November 1975 that, if they continue with their squatting, they will immediately be removed. That publicity has already produced sound and good results.</p>

<p>The Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act&#x2014;as it reads at present&#x2014;cannot be effectively applied to combat illegal squatting, particularly in cases where an owner gives people his consent to squat on his land. Such owners are frequently squatter-mongers and lease land to squatters under undesirable circumstances, as I have already described. However, when investigations are made, they deny it. In order to cope with this problem an owner or a lessee of land is being prohibited in the Bill from allowing squatting to take place on his land. The Bill also states that, unless such owner or lessee of land proves the contrary there shall be a presumption that he allowed squatting on his land. If such an owner or lessee of land is found guilty he shall, unless the court orders otherwise, demolish the shanty or shanties on his land at his own expense within seven days after conviction.</p>

<p>As I have already mentioned, it is essential that the uncontrolled influx of people from the rural areas to the urban areas in the absence of proper accommodation should be counteracted. Of course formal influx control, except with regard to Bantu, does not exist at all. Moreover, I do not think that any of us would want to extend this to other population groups. At the same time people who occupy scheme dwellings or other proper accommodation have to be discouraged from leaving their dwellings and becoming squatters. In order to achieve this object the immediate demolition of newly-erected shanties is essential. If this is not done, dozens of other shanties spring up overnight in the immediate vicinity, something which could vastly aggravate the position. If it were possible to dispose of the normal legal procedures just as quickly I would prefer&#x2014;I can assure hon. members of this&#x2014;to comply with those procedures, but I am afraid that, in view of the unavoidable delays which are attendant upon such procedures, we would not be able to deal with the problem effectively. Consequently the Bill empowers the owner of land, or the local authority, or the Department of Community Development, or the Bantu Affairs Administration Board to demolish new shanties as they arise without a court order. It is the duty of the owner of the land in the first place to ensure that squatting does not take place on his land. My colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, feels just as strongly about this matter as I do. The measure concerned will enable an owner to meet his obligations in this regard. He will no longer be able to get away with excuses that it happened without his knowledge or consent. I do not expect that there will often be a need to use these powers. In fact, I do not think they will be necessary, for as soon as prospective squatters see that drastic action is being taken, it will prevent them from resorting to squatting. Then, too, owners will refuse to make their land available for this purpose. This has been our experience already, and is not merely an assumption.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the presence of a large percentage of squatters may be attributed to the fact that employers employ labourers from the rural areas although proper accommodation is not available for them. Some employers apparently prefer their workers to become squatters so that those workers are able to live cheaply and the employers are then able to pay them lower wages. Such cases are in the minority, but they do nevertheless occur.</p>

<p>Since influx control cannot be applied in respect of population groups other than the Bantu, the only way of dealing with this undesirable state of affairs is to require the employers, in such areas and in respect of population groups as declared by the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> to prove by way of a certificate from the local authority that their workers who are being brought in from <span class="col_6357-6358" refersTo="page_0509"/>elsewhere have been provided with proper accommodation or that the employers themselves will provide their workers with proper accommodation. Provision is being made for this in the Bill. Hon. members will recollect that I mentioned the possibility of the provision of housing by employers in consultation with, and with the assistance, of local authorities and my department earlier in my speech.</p>

<p>I hope therefore that hon. members will perceive that the clearing up of shocking conditions, such as these which have been to our discredit now for generations, require drastic measures, and I trust that the proposed measures in the Bill will receive general support from hon. members who really have the interests of these unfortunate people at heart.</p>

<p>The other clauses in the Bill are self-explanatory and I am therefore not going to deal with them, for we shall have sufficient opportunity to do so during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that we are facing the challenge of solving the squatter problem just as we were jointly faced, 20 years ago, with the challenge of clearing the deplorable slum conditions of the former Sophiatown and other shocking conditions in and around Johannesburg. Through the rapid construction of dwellings and the necessary control measures we succeeded in doing so. We can succeed in doing so with the squatter problem as well. I hope that in future all hon. members and all parties in this House will, together with us, be able to claim the credit of having had the courage to tackle the problem in a positive and firm manner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I get to the Bill and its implications I should like to deal with four matters which were raised by the hon. the Minister. Others I shall deal with in the course of my speech. Firstly, I agree entirely with the hon. the Minister when he says that a squatter problem has been in South Africa since the time of Jan van Riebeeck. I want to go further and say that the squatter problem is not unique to South Africa. It also exists in countries where there is a homogeneous population. I think some of us have seen them at various times outside Paris and outside other cities in Europe, apart from cities on the American continent. It is a problem which is universal and not restricted entirely in South Africa as the result of the composition of our racial communities here. In South Africa it is of course so that our White community is economically in a more privileged position than the non-White people and this places the responsibility for this problem upon us. I will deal with this later.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is that the hon. the Minister need not ask us to appreciate the work that has been done by the Department of Community Development, with the very valuable assistance of local authorities, in attempting to deal with the housing problem over the years. But this must not blind us to the problem as it exists today. Thirdly, I was very glad that the hon. the Minister&#x2014;there is no doubt that he was thinking of his predecessor and the year 1978&#x2014;took considerable time to ensure that he was not being pegged down unconditionally to seven or eight years for the solution of our housing problem in South Africa. I want to put it this way for the record so that the hon. the Minister will know exactly what we expect of him and of the Government. On 20 February 1976 the following question was put to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When is it expected that this shortage will be met?</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Within seven years if funds could be made available.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister is now sitting on a Treasury seat on that side when it comes to the asking for funds and we take it that he will see to it that adequate funds are made available so that he can fulfil this undertaking.</p>

<p>The fourth point I want to raise is in connection with the standard of housing. The hon. the Minister is quite right when he says we would all like to see everybody living in good and solid houses, with separate rooms, interleading doors, and all the other frills good homes have. From a scientific analysis of the position of the squatters in the Cape Peninsula, I gather that at least 25&#x0025; of them have a salary income of less than R60 per month. Seen in the light of this, one cannot talk of high-standard housing, unless it is to be free housing, and I am entirely against free housing, but I shall deal with that later. One <span class="col_6359-6360" refersTo="page_0510"/>cannot talk of a higher standard of housing and of denying something which is better than the &#x201C;Pondoks&#x201D; they are living in at the moment, to people who cannot afford to have it, because they are &#x201C;unhouseable&#x201D; even in the sub-economic group.</p>

<p>When one looks at the Bill, one realizes that it touches on a problem of large proportions and of various aspects. It is a problem that has been with us and will probably be with us long after the seven years have elapsed in so far as basic housing requirements are concerned. Basically it deals with the plight of people and their needs. I believe that the public at large in South Africa are not sufficiently aware of the circumstances of poverty and lack of hygiene in which large numbers of these people live. The public conscience is not sufficiently orientated to the responsibilities of finding a solution to this problem. For that reason I suggested in a previous debate in this House that SATV should be used to show people who are sitting in the luxury of their homes under what conditions other human beings lived in this country.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>One of his colleagues said that we must not display too much of the unpalatable side of life on TV. I believe we must not sweep these things under the carpet, but must show them to the public because I believe it will have a very good effect on the public at large to know what the problem is. It is a human and every-day problem we have with these people. It is a reality in the lives of these Coloured and these Black people which they have to survive. Certain questions have been put during this session and unpalatable facts have emerged from the answers given by the hon. the Minister of Community Development and his colleagues. I want to confine myself solely to the involvement of the Coloured people at this moment. It is, after all, the responsibility of this hon. Minister. The problem of the Bantu is the responsibility of the Department of Bantu Administration and my colleagues will deal with that aspect.</p>

<p>I am hopeful that in the course of this debate, because of the situation and the circumstances of places like Crossroads, the hon. the Minister or one of the Deputy Ministers of Bantu Administration will tell us what they see as the solution with regard to these Bantu people. I welcome the takeover of responsibility under the legislation dealing with squatters by the Department of Community Development from the Department of Justice, but when it comes to the position of the Bantu, we must realize that there are large numbers of Bantu persons in these squatter areas who are legitimately and legally entitled to be in the Western Cape. They are not people who are here without licence or without permit.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to a question, the Government&#x2019;s estimate of the number of Coloured squatters in the municipal area of Cape Town and the Divisional Council areas of Cape Town and Stellenbosch was 21 600 families, or some 108 000 souls. The hon. the Minister this afternoon put the figure a little higher. He mentioned a figure of 120 000 people. I accept this figure. It is obviously an estimate and cannot be accurate. These people have got to be housed. What are the housing needs at the present moment? The hon. the Minister, in reply to questions, said that during 1973 3 642 families, or 18 939 individuals, were moved in terms of the Group Areas Act, and that 11 690 families, or 60 788 souls, still had to be moved. Now, I welcome the announcement made by the Minister this afternoon. We have pleaded in the past that the allocation of 50&#x0025; of all new houses for removal purposes under the Group Areas Act be stopped. I think the hon. the Minister pleaded for it as well when he was on this side <span class="col_6361-6362" refersTo="page_0511"/>of the House, and now he is in the position to carry that out. I welcome the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that is now to be reduced to 25&#x0025;. I take it that 25&#x0025; will now be used for persons who are removed from slum areas, and not merely for persons who happen to be living in decent houses in the wrong position. And, Sir, may I say to him in passing that the best place where he can start with that is at Somerset West. He should see to it that those people stay there and that he does not make them take over new houses which could be available for squatters. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The Government estimates that there is a shortage in the Cape Province of 45 000 housing units. I will readily concede, as I have said earlier, that the department, with the financial resources available, has achieved a great deal in recent years with the aid of local authorities, and here I want to pay particular tribute to the present Secretary of this department for his enthusiasm in regard to housing. I know it is hoped, as the hon. the Minister has pointed out, to catch up on this backlog in seven years, but according to a figure he has just given us, they will be building 10 000 houses a year, with approximately 37&#x0025; being allocated to squatters. Sir, 3 700 houses per annum is not going to sort out the problem of the squatters. Amongst the squatters there is already a population explosion. They are growing up, they are getting married and new families are starting. If I remember the figure correctly, it has been estimated by the Divisional Council of the Cape that merely to deal with the population explosion within the squatter population, something like 3 000 to 4 000 houses a year will be required. I hope it can be done. But to think that this 37&#x0025; of the houses is going to solve the squatter problem by rehousing them in seven years, is stretching the hon. Minister&#x2019;s optimism a bit too far, and I know he is always optimistic about everything.</p>

<p>When discussing what has been achieved in regard to housing, we in this House must today&#x2014;and I wish to do so&#x2014;pay particular tribute to the Cape Town City Council for its work and drive in regard to Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. I may add that the council had to drive that department to approve of that scheme. There was great hesitancy on the part of the department to support that scheme, but I am very glad now that they had the glory of the opening day because they put up the cash. The success of this scheme was due to the drive and determination by the former city engineer, Dr. Morris, and by city councillors, and it is something of which all of us in this House can be proud of because of the small part we contributed to the success of the scheme in approving the Votes.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The second achievement as far as housing is concerned concerns the Cape Divisional Council, and here the hon. member for Moorreesburg always smiles, and I wish to refer to that council&#x2019;s achievement as far as Atlantis is concerned. I believe that it is a remarkable undertaking, an undertaking which has been received with great enthusiasm by the Coloured people. May I draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that, when he talks of housing, that I understand from the Coloured contractor who has the contract for the erection of the housing there, that he is able to sell three-bedroomed houses with the land for something like R12 500. This is an achievement which can be followed in other schemes which are being undertaken in other parts of the country. The hon. the Minister mentioned Elsies River. It is true that Elsies River was originally virtually a site-and-service scheme, but what happened in Elsies River was that it was allowed to drift on and on until it degenerated into a state where more than one family lived on an allocated plot. That was due to lack of control and not because the principle was wrong. The normal thing that can be done with any site-and-service scheme to obviate it degenerating into what happened at Elsies River, is an urban renewal scheme under which people&#x2019;s homes are renovated, rebuilt and improved where they are. They do not have to move from that locality to some other place. The scheme then becomes a better type of residential area.</p>

<p>The need and urgency of housing is particularly vital at the present moment and we have to deal with this problem on a far wider basis than saying that in seven years&#x2019; time we will have enough houses. I will deal with the Government&#x2019;s proposals as embodied in this Bill later. I want first to deal with what can be <span class="col_6363-6364" refersTo="page_0512"/>done and what is being done in the present circumstances without this legislation. I want to deal with what the Cape Divisional Council has done, and I wish to pay tribute to them for the way in which they have tackled this job. The Cape Divisional Council has established a squatter control unit. They posted a senior person from their engineers&#x2019; department to be in charge of a unit of 10 responsible men as inspectors and they set about dealing with the squatters in the divisional council area. The council resolved on 14 June 1975 that they would apply a policy of pegging squatters. Shacks erected after 1 August 1975 would be removed. The removal of shacks was effected and has been effected in terms of the council&#x2019;s building regulations in so far as they relate to unauthorized structures. They do not need this legislation. We know that every local authority has its building regulations which provide that buildings must be approved in some form or another in terms of the regulations and that if buildings are put up without approval they can be demolished by the local authority.</p>

<p>One could take these regulations further, at least in the Cape Province, and say they entitle the local authority to recover the cost of demolition from the owner of the property concerned. The council&#x2019;s squatter control section, which has special offices situated on the Cape Flats, deals with the whole of the council&#x2019;s area except certain areas in the north of Elsies River and Belhar. The section has not yet dealt with Grassy Park, but this is being undertaken at the moment. It does not deal with Crossroads either, as that is mainly a Bantu squatter camp. The total number of shacks in existence and under the supervision of the squatter control section by the end of April of this year was 3 176. Between 31 July last year and 27 April this year 523 shacks had been demolished and the families had been rehoused by the divisional council. Demolition takes place as the families go out. The shack is demolished and the material is put together and is available for the owner to take where he wants to and do with whatever he wishes. The shacks are not bulldozed, but are taken down in an acceptable way.</p>

<p>Why I say this is essentially a Coloured problem is because only approximately 204 of these 3 176 shacks are occupied by Bantu throughout this divisional council area. Re-housing, of course, goes on from day to day as the possibilities for rehousing present themselves. We went out to see members of the divisional council pegging shacks in a certain area. In the control office there are plans on which each shack is marked with its number. There is a file for that shack and the file contains a diagram of the shack indicating its outside dimensions.</p>

<p>A second phase of the operation was also undertaken. For every one of those shacks a social survey is done by the divisional council. The information obtained embraces the names and relationships of the people living in those shacks, their incomes, where they are working, what kind of jobs they are doing, etc. That can be done when one involves one local authority and they see there is a possibility of providing the housing to deal with the problem. That takes care of clause 1 of this Bill. We do not need clause 1 of this Bill because the powers are already there at the present moment.</p>

<p>When it comes to the other echelons and the intended imposition of compulsion on employers, might I remind the hon. the Minister of what is being done by the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce on a purely voluntary basis. They realize the need and they also realize that it is in their own interest to do something. According to the 1975-&#x2019;76 annual report of the Chamber of Commerce&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There were 115 conventional houses that were planned to be built under the Chambers&#x2019; Coloured staff housing scheme at Belhar, Bellville South. These have now been completed, owners have already taken occupation and full attention is now being concentrated on completing the grouped housing scheme, and it is hoped to give occupation to various owners before the end of this year. The Chamber has opted for grouped housing as it enables maximum advantage to be taken of the available land area. The unique feature of this scheme will be the provision of safe traffic-free areas and the creation of a more congenial living environment so essential to the health and happiness of the community.</block>

<p>This is being done. We therefore do not need the proposed new section 3B of this Bill. If one motivates the public, these jobs will be done by the people concerned.</p>

<p>A little bit later I shall come to the pondok farming to which the hon. the Minister <span class="col_6365-6366" refersTo="page_0513"/>referred. However, these actions do not help in the case of the Bantu.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I exaggerated when I stated the number of units constructed in 1975, because I now see that &#x201C;for legally authorized Bantu in the Western Cape&#x201D; the total number of residential units constructed during 1975 was 221. Those units were constructed in the three townships Langa, Guguletu and Nyanga. What is more important, when the hon. the Minister was asked what the housing need was, this reply appeared in Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Reliable information is not available.</block>

<p>We are now being asked to give powers to the department so that it can have control over squatters, but it does not have a clue as to what the housing needs of the Bantu in the Western Cape are. I see that there is one Deputy Minister present who deals with the Bantu. I refer to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development and I hope that he will participate in this debate because perhaps he can explain why there is no knowledge in the Department of Bantu Administration and Development as to what the housing needs are of Blacks &#x2026;</p>

<p>They are legally here in terms of section 10. Does the hon. member want to have section 10 repealed? [Interjections.] I want to know from the hon. member for Stilfontein where those Bantu will go if their shacks are bulldozed down. I suppose he will merely say that they should not be here and they should go somewhere else, because when I asked what the position was in relation to housing for the Blacks, he replied that they should not be here.</p>

<p>I now want to raise a matter over which the hon. the Minister has some say, at least in collaboration with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. In years gone by I attempted to obtain permission to finance a building to house a legally employed Bantu within one of these Bantu areas. However, I was told that it was not Government policy to permit that to be done. I was told that a scheme like that of the Chamber of Commerce could not be legally applied in so far as Bantu people were concerned. I believe that point of view is wrong and that it should be looked into.</p>

<p>In so far as the Bill is concerned, I regard it as something which is intended to apply some palliatives to a situation which we know is serious. We all accept that it is a serious situation and that it needs attention. However, the Bill provides no solution whatsoever. We can pass this Bill and apply it tomorrow, but there will not be one iota of difference in the situation of the squatters whom we find in Cape Town, Stellenbosch or anywhere else.</p>

<p>What appals me is that this Bill should have been introduced at all at this time. Surely, one of the subject matters which the Erika Theron Commission must have investigated is the socio-economic problems of the Coloured persons. I know that they have inspected the squatter camps and I know that they have been around to look at similar camps in various parts of the country. I know that they have been to Diep River and Johannesburg. However, here we have a Bill which deals with squatters before the Erika Theron Commission&#x2019;s report has been tabled. I believe it is a rather impolite act&#x2014;if I may put it like that&#x2014;towards the chairman and members of that commission that this legislation should be introduced before we have seen what their recommendations involve. Certain other hon. Ministers also have treated the commission in a similar fashion. We know that the hon. the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations, for instance, also found it necessary to declare all manner of policies before the commission had reported. It is also true that the hon. member for Vasco is sitting on a committee of his party to investigate what it is going to do about the Coloured population. This committee was appointed before it had seen the Erika Theron Commission&#x2019;s report. I wonder why the commission has been appointed at all.</p>

<p>But this is so; this is a fact. Because they are not palatable, the hon. the Minister says I should not raise certain matters. I know it is unpalatable to the hon. the Minister.

That is why I raise this matter; it is an important matter.</p>

<p>There are other people of good will who are trying to assist and who are investigating this problem and trying to find solutions. However, they have no opportunity of being heard in this House. I am speaking of people who are intimately concerned with this question. I think of organizations such as Cafda, Shawco, Sanca (the South African National Cancer Association), Kupagani and Nicro. These are not organizations to be ignored when we are dealing with a problem of this sort. Where have they an opportunity of putting their views before this House as to what attitude we should adopt on this Bill? They have made a number of proposals which have been published in the Press and which, no doubt, have been submitted to the hon. the Minister. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will tell me whether he has received this memorandum from the Cape Flats Committee for Interim Housing for Coloured People? These are people who are directly concerned with this sort of problem. I want to mention some of the proposals they make. These are proposals that need to be looked at, considered and weighed up to determine of what value they are. They suggest, for instance, that local authorities should continue to make available land where on the homeless may exercise their own initiative in creating temporary housing. They suggest further that shack-dwellers should be assisted to improve their houses. This is done in other countries at very low cost. Doorframes, doors, windows and window-frames are supplied so that the people can improve the dwellings in which they are forced to live because there is nowhere else for them to live. The hon. member must not shake his head. I have seen this myself in other countries and I know that it works well.</p>

<p>Yes, I accept that, but that has been going on for donkeys&#x2019; years. I spoke to Dr. Webb of the CSIR about this many years ago. The trouble with this cheap type of housing has been that the Government has not been able to make the necessary arrangements to level out the peaks and troughs of demand in the building industry so as to make it worthwhile for a company to undertake to provide a cheap prefabricated type of housing in this country. That has been the problem. I am sure the hon. the Minister knows that.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned, there is also the question of subsidization or providing material so that houses can be erected that are suitable for occupation. This can be done. I can tell the hon. the Minister that site and service schemes can work. If the hon. the Minister has time and has not been there yet, I ask him to go and look at the farm next to Crossroads where the divisional council, in an effort to alleviate the situation, has constructed a type of hard road and has supplied some water pipes and latrines. However, the divisional council was doing this contrary to Government policy. If one looks at the camp there, one finds it an entirely different place from the other squatter camps where none of these site and service provisions have been introduced.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is. Sir, I believe the hon. the Minister must look again in at the question of the site and service scheme. I really believe it is a scheme that works. I have mentioned in the House before that it is being applied in some of the developing Black African countries. In Malawi, for instance, they have provided an area with site and service provisions in their new Lilongwe township layout. They know that people will come to the towns. We know that the farmers in the Western Cape cannot go on and on <span class="col_6369-6370" refersTo="page_0515"/>building for, accommodating and employing the populations which increase year after year on their own farms. Those Coloured people must go and look for employment elsewhere. If they connot be employed on the farm next door, which may already be overcrowded, they will go and seek employment in the cities, which is quite a natural thing for them to do. This Bill does provide for emergency camps. Research that I have done, or tired to do, as to whether emergency camps have been provided by anybody since 1951, indicates that about half a dozen or more were established on the Orange River. Elsewhere, emergency camps have not been established. This Bill now empowers the hon. the Minister to establish emergency camps. It also empowers the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration to establish emergency camps. But who locates them? Does the particular local authority locate them? Does the hon. the Minister locate them? Does the Department of Bantu Affairs locate them? Who is going to manage them? Who is to finance them? These are just some of the questions that arise.</p>

<p>These are not only my own suggestions about these site-in-service camps. The same appears from the findings of the Chamber of Commerce. They too believe that this is a way in which one can deal with this matter. In fact, in their report they say that body has drawn the Government&#x2019;s attention to the seriousness of the situation and has asked them to make land and finance available for development by local authorities in properly controlled areas where small sites and basic services can be provided to squatters on reasonable terms, including some permanency of tenure. Has this really been investigated? This is what is being offered by people using the best brains they can to investigate these problems. They came up with this decision.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I agree entirely with the hon. member for Carletonville. What can happen, if one has site-in-service camps where one has some control of the situation of these people, one can start to see these people and to deal with them, through health visitors and other people, and also to deal with the problem of birth control and similar problems. One can, for instance introduce them to and educate them in matters of birth control. I am sure that this is another matter with which the Erika Theron Commission will deal. I am sure there will be something in regard to that, because this is a problem which is known to all of us in the Western Cape. However, we must now go on with this Bill before the Theron Commission has reported. When it comes to the other aspects of this Bill, I believe that, instead of site-and-service being rejected out of hand&#x2014;as the hon. the Minister has done&#x2014;it could be regulated. It could be dealt with under clause 4 of this Bill, for instance, which provides for emergency camps. Surely that is what is intended by an emergency camp. It is not a camp for refugees run by the Department of Community Development, I am sure. It is an emergency camp for homeless people.</p>

<p>What is better than to have that, properly laid out, properly controlled, with services which can form a safety-valve against infective diseases and other evils which can abound?</p>

<p>As I have said before, I believe that the control of erection and demolition, and the demolition of unauthorized structures, are sufficiently in the hands of the local authorities. They have inspectors, they have local knowledge. They know where these places are and they know how to deal with them. Is the hon. the Minister going to have a corps of inspectors who will have to find out where these &#x201C;pondoks&#x201D; are? The divisional council or the local authority knows what can be done. They have their inspectors going round. They have their health services. We do not need this legislation. It is not going to stop &#x201C;pondok&#x201D; forming either.</p>

<p>One of the other points in this Bill which I might just mention as one which is also not acceptable to us, is the restricted access to the courts. I noticed the embarrassment of the hon. the Minister when he referred to this. He said that, if the delays could be eliminated, perhaps this measure would not be applied. Of course, the hon. the Minister is embarrassed when he has to propose something of this sort. The sole, limited rights of protection which a person has when his home is to be demolished, is to go to court if he feels he has some legal ground on which to prevent such demolition. This Bill raises questionable presumptions <span class="col_6371-6372" refersTo="page_0516"/>against the accused person, presumptions with which we do not agree. Clause 3(c)&#x2014;whatever else the hon. the Minister wants to say about it&#x2014;imposes a form of influx control on Coloured people, and in a subtle way imposes control on the movement of people who are entitled to move freely anywhere in the country, or the Minister is trying to shift the responsibility for housing for these unfortunate people from the Government and local authorities to industry. The hon. the Minister knows that the president of the S.A. Federated Chamber of Industries has complained about the hasty nature in which the Bill has come forward. According to a report in <i>The Argus</i> of 5 May 1976&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. D. Bernade, president of the FCI said the FCI was not shifting its responsibilities, but members wanted more time to consider the Bill.</block>

<p>Obviously they wanted to make representations. The hon. member for Moorreesburg spoke about the Coloureds and the Whites, and I am quoting from a newspaper published over the weekend&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Saam kan die twee groepe vir hulle &#x2019;n opwindende nuwe w&#x00EA;reld skep. Daar moet gesels word oor allerlei rasse-ongerief wat veroorsaak kan word wanneer twee groepe s&#x00F3;, sy aan sy, bou aan &#x2019;n nuwe w&#x00EA;reld.</block>

<p>This is what must be done. It is not going to be done by ordering demolition or without taking into consideration the people involved when finding a solution to the problem. As I have said, the position as far as the FCI is concerned, is that they believe that they have not had ample opportunity to consider the implications of the Bill.</p>

<p>The Bill on the Order Paper has a few harsh provisions and some good provisions. I concede that to the hon. the Minister. There are some matters which can be expanded upon. What is meant for instance by an emergency camp? The hon. the Minister did not deal at all with what he meant by an emergency camp. I believe that there are some people who are seriously concerned with the problem and who would like to assist in dealing with it and that these should be given an opportunity to be heard.

<speech by="#van_breda">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall react in a moment to what the hon. member for Green Point said. To begin with, I should like to say that the hon. the Minister dealt so extensively with the whole problem of squatting in his introductory speech, including the background and to what degree it can be controlled by this legislation, that it does not leave a great deal to speak about. I want to compliment the department on the fact that, although the administration of the legislation was only entrusted to them in October 1975, they nevertheless succeeded in such a short time in submitting to the House the comprehensive legislation serving before us now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point elaborated on the Second Reading of the Bill for almost 40 minutes. At the start I experienced a great deal of difficulty to determine in which direction the hon. member actually wanted to move, and whether he is for or against the legislation. I listened to him with great sympathy. After last week I actually listened to him with great compassion, because he is certainly on the way to becoming a political squatter. That is probably why he was treading water a little about this matter.</p>

<p>I believe that other hon. members will react extensively to the question of Bantu squatters at Crossroads to which the hon. member for Green Point referred in passing. I can only tell him in passing that the question of the legality of Bantu squatters is an aspect which he is over-emphasizing completely, because the position at Crossroads is that there are <span class="col_6373-6374" refersTo="page_0517"/>approximately 541 contract labourers who are in the area legally, but are inhabiting Crossroads illegally. The situation is that the people have permission to work in the area and have single quarters in the Bantu residential areas in the Peninsula. What happens is that they bring their families into the Cape Peninsula illegally and then go and squat illegally in an area like Crossroads. The figures with respect to the women indicates this tendency very clearly. Today there are only 50 women in the area legally, while 1 341 are there illegally. One hundred and twenty children are legally in the area, while 3 723 are in that area illegally. This should give hon. members the whole pattern of the way of life of this so-called legal Bantu in a White area. Over the past year we did provide for Bantu housing requirements. For instance 183 housing units were provided in Guguletu and Langa and approximately 38 in Nyanga. The Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of Bantu labour in the Western Cape is quite clear. I do not think that it can be rightfully agitated that the existing housing facilities of Bantu in the Western Cape&#x2014;which is a reserved area for the Coloured population&#x2014;be expanded to a greater degree.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate the full extent of the squatting problem it is perhaps a good thing to note, for the sake of interest, where it originates and what it really involves. During the past war this problem began to assume alarming proportions. This resulted in War Measure 31 of 1944 being introduced to try and control the matter. The Government inherited that situation, to its full extent, in 1948, so much so that this war measure had to be incorporated into the existing legislation. The word &#x201C;squatting&#x201D; probably originated from the idea that the people simply squatted in a certain area. Today there are still a variety of reasons why people prefer to squat. On the other hand there are only a few reasons why they are forced to squat. Apart from other factors which lead to squatting, it is really an undeniable truth that a considerable percentage of the squatter families who cannot be housed due to economic reasons fall into a category which is not able to comply with socially accepted norms. In other words, they are the people who do not want to live under better conditions than squatting conditions. I think the hon. the Minister was quite correct when he said that this has become part of these people&#x2019;s philosophy of life. A disturbing fact which the hon. the Minister expounded, was that 60&#x0025; of the squatters had previously been housed in municipal housing schemes. They moved away from there because they failed to pay rental or because they did not want to or could not accept the responsibility and discipline of renting a home. I have already said so on a previous occasion that these people are the first exponents of the freedom cult. They can be compared with the Biblical concept of the lily of the field which neither spins nor weaves. The hon. member for Rondebosch spoke about this matter on one occasion. He made the statement that although these squatter camps look like rubbish heaps, for instance when they are seen from the air just before one lands at the D. F. Malan Airport, a social community nevertheless exists in those camps. He said that a community like this functions in a manner which we are unable to understand, and that the people there have a social system of their own. I admit that this may be the case, but the hon. the Minister did not introduce this legislation in order to demolish those squatters huts for whatever the reason may be while the people are still living there. He introduced the legislation in order to try and solve that problem in a positive way by means of an imaginative housing programme.</p>

<p>Sir, it is generally accepted that the natural growth rate of Coloureds in and around greater Cape Town is approximately 5 000 per annum. During 1975 approximately 4 546 dwelling units were completed in this particular area, while at the end of that year 4 355 dwelling units were under construction. The projection which has been made for the year 1976-&#x2019;77, indicates that the Cape Town City Council will complete 4 500 units, the Cape Divisional Council 2 500 and the Stellenbosch Divisional Council 3 000. This gives us a total of 10 000 units for the year 1976-&#x2019;77. For the year 1977-&#x2019;78, the projection is that the Cape Town City Council will complete 5 000 dwelling units, the Cape Divisional Council 2 500 and the Stellenbosch Divisional Council 3 000. This gives us a total of 10 500 for the year 1977-&#x2019;78. For the year 1978-&#x2019;79 the projection is that the Cape Town City Council will complete 5 000 dwelling units, the Cape Divisional Council 3 000 and the Stellenbosch Divisional Council 3 000. This gives us a total of 11 000 dwelling units for that period. In the last year in respect of which a <span class="col_6375-6376" refersTo="page_0518"/>projection exists, namely 1979-&#x2019;80, the projection is that the Cape Town City Council will build 5 000 dwelling units, the Cape Divisional Council 2 500 and the Stellenbosch Divisional Council 3 000. This gives us a total of 10 500 dwelling units for that year. Apart from the fact that the annual growth rate of 5 000 will be cancelled out by this, approximately 5 000 or more additional dwelling units will be erected. These additional units, if I may call them this, will, from the nature of the case, not all be made available to squatters. However, as the hon. the Minister indicated, at least 37&#x00BD;&#x0025; will be made available for the clearance of squatter concentrations in future. The general statement which is so easily made from time to time, i.e. that these Coloured houses are only being erected to comply with the Group Areas Act and that they are only used for resettlement, is in other words absolute nonsense. The department&#x2019;s own allocation for resettlement is only 25&#x0025; at the moment. I wish the hon. member for Green Point would reach the stage where he would accept that it is only 25&#x0025;.</p>

<speech by="#van_breda">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I can tell you from experience today, on the basis of the conditions prevailing in my own constituency, where group area resettlement is being carried out, that all the people who are resettled from those areas come out of the most miserable slum areas. From the projections I mentioned, it is clear that it will be possible to solve the squatter problem within the next few years, if the necessary funds are available to do so. However, there is a very explicit condition, which in my opinion is a very important one, i.e. that people will then not be allowed to flock to an area in an uncontrolled way and thus aggravate the squatting problem. People must not be allowed to squat further without any restrictive measures and aggravate the problem we are struggling with. Therefore the whole essence of this legislation is to restrict squatting so that the problem can be solved in a positive way, <i>inter alia,</i> by means of the provision of proper housing. The hon. member for Green Point mentioned some of the bodies which still want to be consulted. This is the reason why he recommends a Select Committee. The bodies charged with the immense task of housing, namely the local authorities, stated their case in no uncertain terms as far as this problem is concerned. The United Municipal Executive and the directors of local management of the various provinces have been consulted on this legislation and have given their full support to the legislation. These are the bodies which are important when the provision of housing is being negotiated. In the process of the solution of the squatting problem the Government has so far enjoyed the full co-operation of local authorities in and around greater Cape Town. Were it not for this co-operation, such significant progress could not have been made. Since August 1975 the further co-operation of local authorities has been obtained so that squatting has been frozen and new squatters are controlled. This legislation now grants the necessary powers effectively to apply the control which is now already being applied to a certain extent. The hon. member for Green Point knows this only too well. He knows that the measures which are now being taken by local authorities are effective to a degree, but that they cannot be applied to their full extent without the legislation before the House today.</p>

<p>The legislation basically involves four principles. In the first place people will be prohibited from simply allowing squatting. In terms of the existing Act as it reads now, action can be taken against people who squat without permission. However, if the owner of the ground has given permission, the authorities have no power to prevent squatting. It was this very loophole in the Act which offered the unscrupulous, the so-called squatter farmers of whom we have had such bitter experience, an opportunity in this respect. The second principle is that the owner, or the person who has control over the particular ground, must see to it that he demolishes the illegal structure or causes it to be demolished. The third principle is that bodies which are concerned with housing will now also be given the power to demolish structures. Fourthly, the entry of labourers into the area of the local authority may be regulated and controlled.</p>

<p>Over the past few years the problem has increasingly been experienced in the Peninsula that employers&#x2014;and here I am thinking of building contractors in particular&#x2014;go to the rural areas to recruit the necessary labour without making proper provision for housing for these people. In the light of the particular promises which are made to these people and <span class="col_6377-6378" refersTo="page_0519"/>the attractive city lights which are held out to them, they came to the Peninsula without proper provision being made for them. The advice which is always given to these people is that they should simply see to it that they have three sheets of corrugated iron because then they will have a house.</p>

<p>The legal implication of this statement lies in the fact that people are allowed to squat anywhere without anyone having the power to prosecute or remove such people without providing alternative housing. A family even squatted on the Parow golf course. The surest way of being resettled is to squat at the ninth hole. There is a special system of communication between squatters and aspirant squatters and because they knew of the deficiencies of the Act, they flocked in their thousands to the metropolitan area. However, once this legislation is in force, a person will think twice before moving from Calvinia to Cape Town, especially if he knows that there is no provision for housing for him and that a squatter&#x2019;s hut will immediately be demolished after it has been erected. The bush telegraph will quickly convey this message far and wide. To advance a plea under these circumstances for a site and service scheme, as the hon. member for Green Point and the hon. member for Rondebosch have done repeatedly, is simply to torpedo the solution of properly planned housing. This will result in permanence being given to squatters&#x2019; areas. After all, we have had the experience of the old Moroka scheme where squatters were allowed to squat with only the most essential sanitary facilities and welfare services of a kind under the previous Government. We have also had the experience of Sophiatown, Martindale and especially Newclare where 5 129 families squatted on 579 plots. This gives us an idea of the proportions squatting has assumed.</p>

<p>I now want to quote what the spiritual mother of the present PRP said on occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie sogenaamde gereguleerde plak-kerskampe is geneig om &#x2019;n permanente kenmerk van ons stedelike lewe te word en ek sien nie hoe enigeen met enige ver-antwoordelikheidsin daardie toestand met enige tevredenheid kan benader nie.</block>

<p>I want to agree with this lady that these conditions are inclined to become permanent.</p>

<p>These squatters camps are breeding grounds for evils. It is no use our elevating our squatters camps to something which they are not really. The greatest instigators who abuse these conditions, are at the same time enriching themselves at the cost of those poor Bantu or Coloureds. The children of those communities are brought up in crime.</p>

<p>The instigators are not the only people who abuse this situation. There are also other people who use this problem for their own ends. I take it the hon. member for Rondebosch will be the next speaker. When visiting squatters&#x2019; camps, he does so with the necessary grace, but also with the necessary contingent of newspapermen. Sometimes he even does so without a permit. The local Bantu Administration Board has always been very obliging towards the hon. member when he wanted to enter the Bantu areas on a fact-finding mission. One asks oneself automatically why he had to do it differently this time. He did so because he was not on a fact-finding mission this time. He was merely on a publicity tour when he visited those squatter camps. Did he participate in the Department of Community Development tour to which the hon. the Minister referred?</p>

<p>Then we had the opportunity also to see the positive things which were being done there in connection with Coloured housing. If the hon. member tells me that it did not suit him that day to accompany the tour, I may ask him whether there was a single member of his party on that tour? If they were there, they would have seen the immense achievements in the Coloured areas over the past year alone&#x2014;I am not speaking of years now. Then he could also have seen that a new community and residential area are in the process of being established from the old Elsies River shanty town. Originally, one was inclined to take note of hon. members like that hon. member, because, with his academic background, he could really make a contribution in this respect.</p>

<p>However, it is a tragedy that the hon. member, in accordance with the whole approach of his party, has become superficial in his approach to this matter, a superficiality which simply amounts to looking for publicity rather than proving that he wants to do something about the problem. Recently the hon. member had the privilege of undertaking journeys in Africa and I believe he also had the opportunity of seeing people trying to exist on <span class="col_6379-6380" refersTo="page_0520"/>rubbish dumps in the greatest misery in Lagos, Nigeria. [Interjections.] The hon. member apparently saw it but now I cannot see how he or any other hon. member can think that there is any other method of solving this problem except through proper legislation.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to express the conviction that the legislation should be so effective as a deterrent that, in practice, it will practically be unnecessary to implement it. As far as the closer details of the Bill are concerned, we can discuss them fruitfully during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened with interest to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech. I was particularly interested in the figures he quoted on housing. He referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the number of houses erected for Whites, Coloureds and Indians, respectively, by his Department. If I remember correctly the ratio was 1:61, 1 : 15 and 1 : 14.</p>

<speech by="#mcintosh">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>I think the point is that because Whites are materially more privileged than the Coloureds and the Indians, one could have expected his department to have erected fewer houses for the Coloureds and the Indians. However, the two latter population groups are fighting their way up in our community and I am convinced of the fact that the ratios which have been referred to will change considerably in the next generation.</p>

<p>There is a question I want to put to the hon. the Minister. He referred to the great success achieved by his department and the Government during the past 25 years with the removal of squatter areas and the erection of houses. However, he did not tell us why he suddenly found it necessary to introduce the Bill. The hon. the Minister suggested that they have already, by means of the bush telegraph which the hon. member for Tyger Valley referred to, indicated that they are going to deal more firmly with squatters. He added that some measure of success has already been achieved. If this is the case, why is the legislation necessary?</p>

<p>I am very glad to see that the hon. member for Tyger Valley did his homework because I see that he looked up the debate held in 1951 to see what Mrs. Ballinger, among others, had to say. What I find interesting is that the arguments which were advanced at that time, agree to a large extent with those the hon. member is now advancing. It was said that the places are the breeding ground of evils, that wont-works are living there, and that there are loafers, etc. It has already been proved that if decent housing is provided, the standard of the population in the majority of cases is increased. I am not referring now to exceptions such as the small group of people who will always be loafers. We know them and probably they include some of our friends as well.</p>

<p>The point is that it is no use disparaging these people and saying they are no good. They will not squat somewhere if there is no reason for them to squat. The main reason is that they are looking for work so that they can earn money with which to buy food. Another reason is that they want to come and live with their husbands.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think that we all forgive enthusiasts a lot and I think that we have a very enthusiastic Minister of Community Development. He is enthusiastic whatever cause he is supporting. I think that his staff are very enthusiastic as well. I think we forgive enthusiasts a lot. However, I really believe that the hon. the Minister and his department have perhaps become a little over-enthusiastic with this Bill. I think that the amendment moved by my senior colleague is an amendment we should support.</p>

<p>If we look at the history of this Bill, we see that the Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act was first introduced in 1951. It was introduced as a law because until that time a War Measures Act, No. 31 of 1944, had been used to control squatting. This was particularly due to the vast increase in industrialization in our cities during the war years. The then Minister of Justice who introduced the Bill and who is now a retired ex-State President, was at great pains to point out at the time that Bill was aimed at giving people more rights before the <span class="col_6381-6382" refersTo="page_0521"/>courts. He and a number of members of the Opposition agreed that a War Measures Act was not a suitable type of Act to keep on our Statute Book in a civilized society in times of peace. It is interesting that the hon. member for Brits, by way of an interjection in 1951&#x2014;he is still present in the House&#x2014; pointed out quite clearly that this Bill was a transition measure. If one looks at the context of that debate, one sees that what the hon. member for Brits meant by that was that Bill was only meant to meet a squatter situation that was regarded as temporary. Incidentally, the then member for the Trans-keian Territories mentioned by way of an interjection &#x00E0;<i> propos</i> of the developing problem of squatters in Umtata, how much Umtata had done to bring about a settled Black community by means of a sensible site and service scheme.</p>

<p>Since 1951 we have removed, rehoused and settled literally hundreds of thousands of Bantu in this country. Therefore squatters are nothing new in South Africa. At Ndabeni 60 years ago Black squatters were moved from there to Langa. In Cato Manor Black squatters were moved. Then we also moved squatters from Moroka where there was a site and service scheme which went to rack and ruin. Squatters were also moved in Sophiatown and Korsten. Why does the hon. Minister now suddenly come with this Bill when for 25 years we have been moving and rehousing people in an orderly and proper way?</p>

<p>Squatting is a fascinating feature of society. Today, when sociology has become a modern and fashionable field of study in our universities, the sociologists, like Columbus often setting out without knowing where they are going and, when they get there, not being sure where they are, have of course been attracted immediately to the squatting phenomenon because here one suddenly has communities of people thrown together who set out to organize themselves and have little trading places established. From an architectural and sociological point of view, this represents a fascinating establishment of community life. However, the same is experienced in any city in the world. In South America they have what they call the &#x201C;favel-las&#x201D;. In S&#x00E3;o Paolo and in Rio de Janeiro. The population in S&#x00E3;o Paolo has increased in the last five years from 5 million to close on 8 million people. Many of them do not even squat, but sleep at night under the freeways where it is at least dry when it rains.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Nationalist Government has endeavoured to stop the movement of Black people to the cities. They have failed miserably. [Interjections.] They have created tremendous hardships. They have encouraged bribery and corruption. They have created a vast bureaucratic network, but the position is that the Black populations of our cities have increased many times over, despite the attempts to keep them out by the most elaborate bureaucracy and with the largest attempt at control. Mr. Speaker, you will not stop people from coming into the cities to seek employment. I believe that this hon. Minister and his department have to understand that. The only way in which they can ever control it, is by having proper housing. To date our existing legislation has dealt perfectly well with the situation. The argument that has been advanced by the hon. member for Tygervallei and which has been hinted at by the hon. the Minister, is that we have a permanent hard-core collection of squatters who will persist in being squatter-dwellers.</p>

<p>I grew up as a student working in Winder-mere, running youth camps and Sunday school classes and a boys&#x2019; club. I know what an awful place Windermere was. Where is Windermere <span class="col_6383-6384" refersTo="page_0522"/>today? Does the hon. the Minister suggest that all those people who have been rehoused in Windermere, are still living in squatter camps? I doubt it very much because they know the difference between a wet cardboard house and a dry brick house. I am sure that they would, in most cases, seek to stay on in proper housing. We have in this Bill an attempt by the Nationalist Government to get away from one of the truths of South African society, and that is the urbanization of the Coloured people. These people do not suffer from any influx control. Therefore, they are free to move into the cities when they so choose. Now the crows are coming home to roost.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Berea has asked how many Coloureds are still going to be housed in Natal. The answer was 4 000. The hon. the Minister says 222 houses are going to be built and that in 1976, 602 dwelling units for Coloureds will be built at Marianhill.</p>

<p>At Marburg, near Port Shepstone, one has an influx of Coloured people from the Trans-kei, people who have been discouraged from remaining in the Transkei and who have been pushed right out as fast as possible. They come into Marburg, having nowhere to stay. A group area has just been declared for these people. They simply have to squat. They have nowhere to live. Now, we are going to have influx control because this Government has not been capable of providing the housing we have been telling them for 20 years they must provide. [Interjections.] We went on a very interesting tour with officials of the Department of Community Development. Let me hasten to say that, generally speaking, I believe this department does an excellent job. We went to a place called Albowville where flats are standing empty, very nice flats for people in the lower income groups. What is the conclusion which these gentlemen, these officials and the hon. the Minister came to? Their conclusion was that there was adequate housing for Whites. There are no Whites living in squatter camps. There may be a few hippies living in the bush because they want to be naturists, but most Whites are not interested in living in squatter camps because they have housing.</p>

<p>Until such time as there is ample housing for Coloured people in the Western Cape, the hon. the Minister cannot say that he needs a stronger and a bigger whip to enable him to deal with this situation.</p>

<p>We are always going to have people who cannot help themselves and we accept that. We are always going to have jokes about people who store their coal in the bath. One hears it everywhere; in Washington, Lagos and Cape Town. However, the responsibility of the department, our social welfare agencies and our churches is to train people to live under new circumstances. We accept that people are going to have difficulty in adjusting in their townships. That is why the Department of Community Development passed legislation last year to provide community facilities. Our responsibility is to encourage people to get decent housing, not to whip them in with a Bill which we do not even know is necessary. In fact, after 25 years we believe that it is not necessary.</p>

<p>The form of influx control which is being introduced here is one which particularly needs to be investigated by a Select Committee. The hon. member for Green Point has referred to a statement by the president of the FCI. It is an extremely dangerous precedent. Controls on freedom spread in a society, whether we like it or not. This first form of control on the movement of Coloureds is going to be the first step towards creating a whole process of influx control for Coloured people. We want to know what administrative measure is going to be applied. The local authorities, for example, are now suddenly saddled with the responsibility of providing certificates. Surely it is the Department of Community Development which should do it, because this department is now taking complete control. To control the Bantu we have had the vast bureaucracy. What are we going to have to control the Coloureds? How is an employer going to determine whether his worker is legally employed? Is he going to travel about the Cape Peninsula and to Stellenbosch and inspect where his employee is living? What about clause 3(c), which refers quietly to the fact that housing &#x201C;will be provided by the employer&#x201D;? Suddenly the employer has to provide his employees with housing. Where is he going to supply it? Is he going to be given land? Suddenly we have a completely new development. Employers are keen to support the hon. the Minister. The Chamber of Commerce in Cape Town, in Belhar is doing its best in this regard. However, this is higher income group housing.</p>

<p>There has been a tremendous attack on and a refusal to accept the principle of site-and-service by the Government. I can only conceive that it is because they always regard site-and-service as being a potential slum.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>With due respect, it is not properly applied there. I particularly want to mention that the Indian community is more than ready for this and, in fact, they are the sort of people who would make a real contribution to a good site-and-service scheme. I believe they would welcome any site-and-service scheme. This also applies in Natal. Although the department is about to launch what is an excellent scheme at Marianhill&#x2014;I was very pleased to see last week that all the tarred roads have been built&#x2014;the real need for the Coloured community in Natal is for freehold land, in other words a site-and-service scheme, where they can build their own property. There are hundreds of Coloured people with high incomes who are decent citizens and who want to buy and build their own houses and take that burden off the taxpayer. Why does the Government not make more site-and-service schemes available to these people? Only a fraction of the properties in the Marianhill development scheme is available for home ownership.</p>

<p>I believe this debate could be dominated by the Cape members of Parliament, because people seem to be only concerned with the situation of Coloured people and, more particularly, the Black people at Crossroads. However, the squatter problem is not confined to the Cape Peninsula. As I have mentioned, we have squatter problems at Marburg in Port Shepstone, in Marianhill, in Motalas&#x2019; Farm in Pinetown, on the edges of Kwa Mashu, in Clermont, at St Wendolin&#x2019;s in Shongweni and on the edges of Soweto. Here one has this kind of situation already existing. It amazes me that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development flits in and out of the House like a little butterfly when he should be paying attention to every word spoken in this debate. His department is after all arrogating to itself incredible powers.</p>

<p>I believe we should think seriously in terms of the Black man and his house. Some members of this House might have seen the play <i>Goodbye Johnny</i> which is on at the Nico Malan theatre at the moment. In that play there is one sentence in which the young White man says: &#x201C;Ag, ons kan sommer &#x2019;n semi gaan koop.&#x201D; This person is obviously of a low income group. How many Black men can ever look forward to owning a home of their own? If they can, it is only when they are grandfathers. In the Western Cape they certainly have no future at all, but they must provide their labour for 11 months out of 12 and under the most difficult circumstances. Can one blame their wives&#x2014;in fact I think they have very good wives&#x2014;for coming to live with their husbands to keep them from all the evil things that takes place in the hostels and everywhere else? Can one really blame human beings, women who care for their men, for coming to live with them where they work? I find it very difficult to blame them and I must say that I would not have been surprised had it been the policy of a Government which is not a Christian National. But here a Christian National Government allows this awful situation to exist. One only has to drive from Acacia Park to the Airport along the edge of Bonteheuwel to see all these people waiting for the labour trucks to fetch them. Almost every man most probably has a wife and children. Can one blame them? I cannot and I defy the Government to stop that from happening. They will irritate and upset these people by doing this. The Government may send these people back by train, but they will come back because some of them have a respect for the sanctity of marriage.</p>

<p>There is something else that worries one about the situation of our Black people. I happen to be able to speak Zulu reasonably fluently and often when I meet a Black man, I greet and speak to him in Zulu&#x2014;most Xhosas understand Zulu reasonably well&#x2014;and often one finds them acutely embarrassed. They refuse to reply to me in Zulu, but rather reply in Afrikaans. When I ask them if they are <span class="col_6387-6388" refersTo="page_0524"/>trying to pass as Coloured, they smile very ashamedly and tell me, in Xhosa, that I am quite right. Probably most of them knock out their two front teeth to make it more convincing. When I hear this, because here is a man who is denying his identity I am deeply stirred because he wants to get away from all the laws and systems which the Government imposes on them.</p>

<p>Coloured people could up till now come in freely, but now we have a new principle of influx control being introduced also for them. It will bring on them&#x2014;not to the same extent as the Blacks, but to some extent&#x2014;the horrors of the pass laws.</p>

<p>I believe this Bill ought to be reconsidered very carefully by the hon. the Minister. We have not been convinced that the hon. the Minister really needs this Bill, because for 25 years we have cleared up slums without it. In clause 3(c) the hon. the Minister introduced a very serious provision, which the Chamber of Industries&#x2014;which certainly is no political organization&#x2014;has extreme misgivings about. Furthermore, we have here a return to the provisions of the War Measures Act of doing away with access to the courts for a demolition order. Incidentally, the Minister of Justice described this as a fascist measure in 1951. He wanted to counter that by introducing access to the courts. I do not want to suggest that this Bill is a fascist measure, but it is returning us at least halfway to the War Measures Act of 1944. I do not believe we want this to happen, because in this House we like to go forward and not backwards. I trust that the hon. the Minister and members on that side of the House&#x2014;I can see the hon. member for Tygervallei is almost convinced&#x2014;will agree that this matter ought to go to a Select Committee as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have just seen that typical old 1910 UP model, just as we have been seeing it all these years. It is still the same model, except that it is now dilapidated. Its wheels have gone flat. [Interjections.] I shall come to that hon. member in a moment, because his timing in that old model is out. The octane of the present-day petrol is too high and that hon. member cannot keep up with the problems of the times. Typically, as we know that old crankhandle model, their attitude is still &#x201C;let things develop&#x201D;.</p>

<p>What have we heard from the hon. members of the UP so far? They admit that we are dealing with a major problem, not only here in the Western Cape, but in Natal, too. However, we have not heard one positive suggestion from those hon. members aimed at the solution of this real problem. I want to tell the hon. member for Pinetown something which he probably will not know, because it happened long before he was riding a tricycle. I should just like to remind him that it was the UP itself that initiated influx control, because the problem had become too great. The Black people flocked in their thousands to the growth points in the country, and particularly to the Witwatersrand. They are the people who initiated those control measures, in an attempt to find a solution to that problem. It is a problem which coincides with the squatting problem. The hon. member is now asking why legislation should be introduced at this stage. Sir, as a problem grows, surely one is going to try and solve that problem. If one cannot have that problem solved in an orderly way by reasoning with people and asking for their co-operation, then one must force it upon them by means of legislation. The years have taught us that legislation is the only method by which we can solve a problem of this kind. Hon. members on the other side, however, have only one solution to this problem, and that is that there should be sufficient housing. Their attitude is that if there is not sufficient housing, we are going to have squatters. I want to agree&#x2014;and this is the only point in respect of which I can agree with them&#x2014;that if we have sufficient housing, there will not be a squatter problem, but now I ask them in all reasonableness to mention to me one single place anywhere in the world where there are so many houses that a house can stand open for someone when he moves from place to place. Do they know of such a place? Do they think it is possible that there could ever be such a condition in South Africa?</p>

<p>This problem of squatting involves responsibility, a sense of responsibility which we must cultivate and which is lacking among those squatters at the moment. They are people who simply trek. Sir, what responsible person simply takes to the road with his family and his few articles of furniture, to go and establish himself at another place without first ascertaining whether housing is available for him there? I immediately want to tell the hon. member <span class="col_6389-6390" refersTo="page_0525"/>who spoke about influx control, as well as the PRP, who have announced their attitude in advance by means of newspaper reports and meetings, that this legislation is not going to apply to Coloureds only. Nor will it only apply to Indians and Bantu. This Bill is just as applicable to Whites, if necessary. They must not, therefore, bring up their usual old story once again that this Bill is merely a discriminatory measure. If the causes of squatting are investigated, I should say that in the first place it is due to the irresponsible behaviour of the head of the family. Possibly one can simply teach some of those people a lesson from nature and the animal kingdom. What bird does not first build its nest so that the little ones which are hatched, will at least have protection and safety? Therefore, it is also time for us to teach these squatters responsibility and also discipline them to a certain degree. The hon. the Minister said that a quarter of the 21 000 squatters came from the platteland, but these people do not come from rural squatters&#x2019; camps. They are people who had housing and were employed somewhere and simply left their work and housing and went off in an irresponsible way to the city lights. Then hon. members on the other side still expect that a house should be ready and waiting for them.</p>

<p>But this is not the point. Even if one changes one&#x2019;s job, no responsible person moves around like that. Perhaps I can quote a simple example for the hon. member. When I came to this Parliament in 1966, I could not find accommodation for my family. I then left my family behind and came here alone. I did not have the means&#x2014; and very few of us do&#x2014;to spend R250 000 on a house, like the hon. member for Randburg, and the hon. member for Johannesburg North. Perhaps they should think about the way in which they spend their money here while they are temporarily employed, and whether that money could not perhaps be applied in another way. I leave the matter at that. However, it is shocking that 60&#x0025; of the squatters previously had accommodation. The hon. the Minister said this and hon. members had the opportunity to dispute the 60&#x0025;. This figure was ascertained after an inquiry by the department.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister also said, an inquiry was made and 60&#x0025; of them said that they came from existing housing schemes. These are people who fight shy of making payments, people who do not want to accept their responsibility, or subject themselves to discipline in any way, people who prefer to live in hovels and under the most unhygienic circumstances rather than in better housing which is provided for them by the State. On 29 March the Department of Community Development arranged for members of this House to go on a tour together with the hon. the Minister. The department did not take hon. members just to show them the fine projects. They also took us to the squatters&#x2019; camps, where the most terrible conditions prevail, and I want to admit that it fills one with aversion to see the circumstances under which these people are living. But where was the PRP? Not a single member of the PRP took the trouble to go along or even apologize for not attending.</p>

They visit the squatters&#x2019; camps on their own, together with enemies of South Africa, <i>inter alia,</i> the English newspapers who take photographs which are sent out to the world to sully and besmirch South Africa&#x2019;s name. But when they have the opportunity to go and ask the officials in a responsible manner what the problems are there and to discuss solutions in a reasonable way, they are conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>Therefore I say that they did not want to go because they did not want to see what a gigantic task has already been carried out by the department to solve the immense squatting problem there. They did not want to go and look at it, because nothing positive has ever come from the PRP. They have never said anything positive and have never spoken with appreciation about anything done for the non-Whites in South Africa. If those hon. <span class="col_6391-6392" refersTo="page_0526"/>gentlemen want to be reasonable now, they will have to ask themselves whether this Government has already done something to solve the problem, and they will have to agree that a great deal has already been done. They could have seen proof of this if they had had a look at what has been done in Elsies River. This was surely one of the worst slum areas in the whole of South Africa. They could have seen what has already been done there as regards the buying out of properties, the construction of roads, the provision of services, the construction of dwelling units and other gigantic tasks which have already been carried out, to such an extent that in one year, from 1 April 1975 to 31 March 1976, 1 389 dwelling units were erected in Elsies River while 1 460 have already been planned for the following year. Is this not something which can be spoken of with appreciation? Those hon. members, however, do not do so. They do not even try. Nor do they want to pull their weight in any respect. Furthermore, the rent of the houses erected there, is as low as R23 per month for a sub-economic dwelling unit. Where in the world can one find cheaper than that? However, one still has cases where people leave those houses and establish squatter camps of their own accord.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, children are seen but not heard. However, I should like to indicate what else has been done. Anyone can see what has been done on Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. Over 40 000 houses are planned, exclusively for the Coloured community. At Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain 298 houses have been completed so far, but at this stage one finds that a garden has been laid out in front of every house. There are also tarred roads, a fine park has been laid out and sports grounds and a stadium have already been developed. In all reasonableness, where in the world will one find a residential area, whether White or non-White, where so many facilities have been provided before the first person has moved in? Where is another place like this to be found? Just look at Atlantis on the West Coast. The same holds for Atlantis as far as this is concerned. There is a modern sports stadium for rugby, cricket, athletics and tennis, whereas only 150 families have moved in so far. Where else in the world will one find a residential area with all those facilities already available?</p>

<p>Can those who are so quick to condemn the Whites and this Government here in South Africa, tell me where else in the world a scanty 4 million people, like the 4 million Whites here in South Africa, have provided so many facilities, luxuries and privileges to more than 20 million people? I challenge that PRP, that is so quick to condemn, to mention one other country in the world in which a scanty 4 million Whites have done as much for 20 million people as has been done here in South Africa. [Interjections.] Why then was such a fuss made in advance by the PRP about this legislation before us? When the legislation was laid upon the Table, they immediately held a protest meeting and stated how they would oppose the legislation. However, I shall say why they oppose it. They oppose it because the PRP is against the creation of order and has always indicated that they want no law and order in any community.</p>

<p>I challenge them to show us a single measure which they supported and which was aimed at the maintenance of law and order. Sir, do you know what they always plead? They always say that action must be taken against the Police and the officials in our Prison Service, those people who must maintain law and order. I know of no case in which the PRP wanted to maintain law and order in South Africa. I think that the Department of Community Development has really gone out of its way and displayed the greatest degree of tolerance concerning the squatter problem. On 15 November 1974 the department had marked every one of the squatters&#x2019; huts.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry. On that date each one of the huts was provided with a number. The department even went so far as to provide a temporary water supply and drainage in some of the camps.</p>

<p>The only other thing envisaged by the Bill, is to eradicate the squatter farmers. Actually they should be called &#x201C;squatter parasites&#x201D;. I do not know why the PRP is so keen to protect the squatter parasites and their interests here. <span class="col_6393-6394" refersTo="page_0527"/>After all, the squatter farmers are out to exploit unscrupulously those very people whose cause the PRP is championing. The squatter parasites do not care in what unhygienic conditions the squatters there have to live, nor do they care whether enteritis epidemics break out amongst the squatters as happened in the case of Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass Village or Mamre.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the Bill provides unreasonable measures against the squatters. Those people are left as they are at the moment until proper accommodation is obtained for them. I also believe that to judge by action in the past when something was tackled and by the rate at which houses are being provided, the Government and the department will solve the housing problem.</p>

<p>How is the influx of squatters to be controlled? The hon. members opposite must come up with something positive. If they can suggest an acceptable solution, I believe that the hon. the Minister would be reasonable enough to accept it. I invite them to make an acceptable suggestion, because I believe that they agree with us that there must be control somewhere. Do the hon. members not want control? They need only answer in the affirmative or in the negative. I cannot hear anything from the other side. They do not want to tell us whether they want control or not. We are not concerned to limit the movements of the Coloureds. They will still be able to move freely from one town to another and from one province to another. It has never been the policy of the Government to apply influx control to the Coloureds. The Bill is merely envisaged as a temporary measure until such time as the housing problem is solved. In any event, it will not be applicable throughout the country. It will only be applicable to defined areas. I think that all that is being done, is to exercise control over the employer, in that he will only be able to employ people who have the necessary accommodation. Apart from that it also imposes a duty on the employer to turn first to those people who have provided for housing for themselves and have incurred commitments in this respect. They are people who are settled in the Cape with their families and do not travel around from one place to another. I believe that the Bill is welcomed by those who want law and order to be maintained. I believe that the Coloured community will also welcome this measure.</p>

I found it astonishing that he should have continued with his attack and said, for example, that no responsible person would take to the road with his family without knowing whether he would be able to get accommodation. Is he, then, ignorant of the history of the Afrikaner? Has he not read Van Bruggen&#x2019;s <i>Ampie</i> trilogy, the most well-known trilogy in Afrikaans?</p>

<p>Ampie was one of thousands. He was not irresponsible. He had no choice. He had to go and seek work.

In that report it was explained that owing to the unemployment and lack of land on the platteland, the Afrikaners migrated to the cities in their thousands, although there was no accommodation for them. They stayed there in squatter camps. Surely it is irresponsible of an hon. member of his years to come along and talk as he has about squatting and people who take to the road without having accommodation. I should like to come back to the Second Reading speech of the hon. the Minister.</p>

Mr. Speaker, I found it striking that two things were lacking in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech. The one was the fact that he paid virtually no attention to the problem of Bantu squatting. I can understand that this does not fall entirely within the scope of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. However, I want to say that I suspect that this legislation was really motivated by the problem of Bantu squatting rather than by the problem of Coloured squatting.</p>

<p>I think that this, among other things, was a very important consideration. The second point is that one thing is particularly striking when one listens to the speeches emanating from that side of the House. Reference is made to the housing programmes. The hon. the Minister referred to them very proudly. He feels proud about it and I think that real and serious efforts are being made in this connection. It is said that proper housing is the solution to squatting. However, the question that has not been answered is this: What becomes of those squatters before they have proper housing? They are chased away. That is what this legislation is there for. If they were to return to the platteland or to the Transkei, what would they go and do there? [Interjections.] I realize that the hon. the Minister referred to the freezing of certain squatter camps.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Since 15 November. The point I want to make is that if we want to conduct a fruitful debate on the problem of squatting, we must see the phenomenon in the context of an industrial society. It is in that context that squatting is a problem. The reason is that it is a symptom of unequal economic growth. There are stronger growth points in the urban areas, whereas the rural areas are unable to accommodate the surplus labour. That is the one problem. The other problem that faces us is the issue of the increase in population. Where a squatting problem is experienced in urban areas, then, particularly in the sphere of the underdeveloped, it is coupled with a high increase in population. This is always the case. In the third instance there is the issue of distorted migration patterns. In other words, it is cases of over-urbanization that make it necessary for large-scale unproductive capital expenditure to be incurred in the short term in order to provide housing, basic services, etc. These are processes, factors, which are operating in our society and in any other society in Africa. That is why we are going to have to contend with squatting in the future. Even though squatting was frozen on 15 November 1974, there are nevertheless going to be squatters. I know that this is a deterrent measure which the hon. the Minister is taking. It is a deterrent measure based on the Act of 1951, which only provides for the introduction of stricter punitive measures and the addition of new provisions. In general the problem of squatting will continue to exist. I do not want to blame the squatting problem on the Government. Nor do I want to blame it on any other Government saddled with similar processes in its society. These are problems facing everyone. I do not believe that we differ with regard to the diagnosis of the problem. We differ about the prognosis. <span class="col_6397-6398" refersTo="page_0529"/>What is the solution? What are the steps which must be taken to contend with these problems. We shall have to institute an investigation into squatting in South Africa.</p>

<p>In South Africa it is a fact that the vast majority of squatters are either Bantu or Indians or Coloureds. It is also true that those who have been entrusted with the responsibility for dealing with and administering this problem are Whites. That is why, wherever the phenomenon of squatting occurs in South Africa, immediately one is concerned with the issue of race relations. Whether we want to accept it or not, this is so. It is the White man who has to deal with the problem, and to a large extent it is the Black man who causes the problem through his presence in urban areas.</p>

<p>Because squatting is different for the various population groups&#x2014;particularly in the sense that different acts and regulations apply, for example, to Indian and Coloured squatters on the one hand, and Bantu squatters on the other&#x2014;it is impossible for me to cover the whole field. Some of my colleagues will deal with some of the other aspects of squatting. I should like to say a few words about the phenomenon of Bantu squatters in South Africa.</p>

<p>We shall not be able to understand the phenomenon of Bantu squatting unless we see it against the background of the increase in population, the demand for labour and the existing housing shortage. The hon. the Minister did not&#x2014;I say this with respect&#x2014; have a great deal to say about these aspects. In my opinion this is really the responsibility of the hon. the Minister or the hon. Deputy Ministers of the Department of Bantu Administration. They ought really to react to the points I am going to mention.</p>

<p>As far as the issue of the increase in population is concerned, Prof. Lange, formerly of the University of the Orange Free State, found that the increase in population among the urban Black man was 63&#x0025; higher than the world&#x2019;s average population increase. He also found that since 1904 &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I am talking about the Bantu. Since 1904 the increase in population among the urban Blacks has always been higher than that of rural Blacks. Here we already have a phenomenon which proves that these people are not going to become fewer. They are going to increase in number. The increase of 63&#x0025; per annum higher than the world average is independent of migratory tendencies.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but it is independent of migratory trends in rural areas, which are therefore not taken into account in the calculation.</p>

<p>Looking at the labour question, we find that the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s economic adviser, Prof. Stefan du Toit Viljoen, recently wrote in the <i>Financial Mail</i> that in the year 2001 there would be 16 million economically active labourers in the South African economy. Of those 16 million, 36&#x0025; will have to be skilled labourers. He then makes a calculation based on present trends and finds that if all the Whites were skilled labourers by the year 2001&#x2014;a doubtful supposition&#x2014;there would be three million skilled labourers from the ranks of the Whites. Consequently there would still be a shortage of 3,5 million skilled labourers. In this one can immediately note the economic drawing power of the urban areas. These people will be attracted to the urban areas. The third aspect is the housing shortage. Here I am referring specifically to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, because their housing problems are different to those of the Department of Community Development. The Bantu Affairs Administration Boards are responsible for the administration of the urban Bantu areas. They have to mobilize the necessary finances themselves from among the ranks of the urban Bantu themselves. The greater part of their revenue derives from the sale of alcohol, chiefly Bantu beer, but White beer as well. This is the basis on which they have to finance their activities. Against this background one can see that in terms of the present pattern of <span class="col_6399-6400" refersTo="page_0530"/>State expenditure, contending with the shortage of accommodation for the Bantu is a hopeless task. In fact, I foresee that the issue of Black urban housing is going to be the cause of a grave situation developing in South Africa in the future. If this is the case&#x2014;and I do not have the slightest doubt that it is going to be the case&#x2014;the problem of Bantu squatting around urban areas is going to become more rather than less serious. That is as far as the general aspects of Bantu squatting in South Africa is concerned.</p>

<p>If we turn the telescope around and aim it at the Western Cape, what do we see? We see, among other things, that about 100 000 plus Bantu are living in Nyanga, Langa and Guguletu. Of these, 34 000 are accommodated in single quarters. There are about 500 people&#x2014;rather more than less&#x2014;on the waiting list for family accommodation in these three areas of the Western Cape. Not a single family unit was built in 1975. I obtained this information from the hon. the Minister in reply to a question I put to him. I also asked him how many houses were being planned for 1976. I was told in reply that no housing was being planned for 1976, but that matters were being investigated. I then asked where the people who were entitled to houses, but did not have them, were living. The department told me that they were living with those people who already had houses. Here, therefore, we have a case of concealed squatting. This is one of the biggest problems in Soweto. It is not the visible squatting one gets at Crossroads, KTC or Nyanga East; it is people who are within the established residential areas and who stay there with people who have houses. It is calculated that about half the population of Soweto is accommodated in this way. One could almost say that these people are squatting legally in our urban areas.</p>

<p>I now want to refer specifically to the position at Crossroads and KTC. The issue here is the lives of 11 000 people&#x2014;about 10 000 at Crossroads and about 1 000 at KTC or Nyanga East. What are the general characteristics of these people? The vast majority of the men are in these areas legally. They are allowed to stay in single quarters. But they have been here legally for some time and will remain in these areas legally for some time. On the other hand, the vast majority of the women are in the area illegally in terms of the Urban Areas (Consolidation) Act. The women say that they come with their children to stay with their husbands. The men say that they are unable to find accommodation for themselves in the areas and also, on top of that, provide for their wives in the Transkei. The wives say that there is no work for them in the Transkei. The Government now says that the women and children must return to the Transkei and the men to their single quarters in the areas where they live. However, the women and children refuse to return. That is how simple the situation is. It is against this background that the Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act of 1951 has been implemented thus far. This Act provides that fines and penalties may be imposed if these people do not want to leave. The fine is reasonably light. A court order, too, may be requested. One had first to obtain a court order before one could send the people back to the Transkei. I now want to come back to the remark I made earlier to the hon. the Minister. It was when it was found that the Act of 1951 did not work efficiently because a court order had first to be obtained and the fines were reasonably light and it therefore had no effect on the people, that this new legislation was piloted through. The fines are being increased and the obtaining of the court order is no longer necessary. You now change the rules of the game. The rules are being changed so that the situation may be approached from a different angle. That is what is happening here.</p>

<p>The rules of the game are being changed because it is no longer necessary to obtain a court order.</p>

<p>I mean it in a metaphoric sense and not as a joke. In fact the hon. the Minister can accompany me to the areas and he will see that it is not a joke. I use the comparison in a metaphoric sense. The Minister is now changing the rules of the game because it was not possible to solve the problem by means of the old measures. Listening to the way in which the hon. the Minister is fitting it in, this particular piece of legislation is being served up most attractively against the background of an impressive building programme. However, the issue here is not the building programme, but the <span class="col_6401-6402" refersTo="page_0531"/>implications of the legislation in question and why it is essential. While the hon. the Minister was reading it, I thought of King Rehoboam. One finds this in the Bible, in 1 Kings, 12. Rehoboam was Solomon&#x2019;s son. Solomon imposed exceptionally severe taxes to build the temple for Israel. When he died, Rehoboam succeeded him. The old men of Israel went to Rehoboam and asked what they should tell the people, because they were complaining about the heavy taxes. Rehoboam then consulted the young men of Israel, took their advice and told the people: &#x201C;My father made your yoke heavy and I will add to your yoke: My father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.&#x201D; This is what is happening here. The hon. the Minister is chastising these people with scorpions. The previous legislation did not work, and therefore he is making the punitive measure more severe and causing disruption among these people in the urban areas. All the problems which cause housing shortages and squatting are ignored in this legislation. All that the legislation envisages is the suppressing of the phenomenon as such. I am not suggesting that there are no building programmes, but I am suggesting&#x2014;this is the point the hon. member for Boksburg also made&#x2014;that I have the strongest misgivings as to whether the building programmes will ever catch up with the problem of squatting, particularly as far as Bantu squatters are concerned. I cannot see this happening.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I shall get to that if you give me the chance to do so. Even as regards the problem of Coloured squatters the tempo of housing development would have to be stepped up. However, I think that the most spectacular progress has been made with regard to Coloured squatting. However, we have only begun to tinker with the problem of Bantu squatting and the problem has only begun to manifest itself in South Africa.</p>

<p>Another effect of this legislation is that it places the onus of assisting with the combating of squatting, on the employer, on the one hand, and on the lessor or the owner of the land, on the other. I want to repeat that the concrete relations situation one finds is that a White man goes to a Black man and tells him that he must leave and that he may not live there. This is a race relations situation and I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that particularly as far as Bantu squatting is concerned, this is going to cause conflict and problems on a vast scale. There have already been reactions in regard to Elsies River. One gets the feeling that these quite ordinary people are now being politicized, that they are becoming angry and that they are seeing that there is no further reason for their problem to be found.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Tygervallei referred to the fact that I had discussed this problem of squatting with senior officials of the Department of Bantu Administration. These people received me in a very friendly spirit and openly explained to me what their difficulty was. Their difficulty is caused by the implementation of the policy of separate development with regard to the urban Black man. I went to the squatter camps and I tried to understand what the difficulty was as far as they were concerned. Their problem is simply that the women want to be with their husbands and children. It does not matter if every man has ten or 20 wives. On the one hand we find the primitive urge of man to maintain his family life, and on the other, the political policy which must be carried out. There is a total lack of communication between these two groups. It is into this situation that legislation is now to be introduced in terms of which people are literally going to be forced to incite race conflict. What are employers and owners or lessors of land really becoming? As far as Bantu squatting is concerned, they are becoming agents of the Bantu administration boards, in order to solve the squatter problem.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>To conclude, I want to concede that there is no easy, clear-cut alternative to the problem of influx control or squatting. The hon. the Minister asked for a fruitful debate. I am not criticizing him as if I have in my pocket the ultimate solution which will end squatting throughout Africa. However, there are a few fundamental principles which, in my opinion, one must bear in mind. Firstly, if a man is able to find work, one should not restrict him from going <span class="col_6403-6404" refersTo="page_0532"/>to work. Secondly, once he has found the work, it must be possible for him to live with his family, for the simple reason that if he does not live with his family he will be an unstable personality in the urban centre where he is employed. The third basic guide-line I want to suggest is that if he is there with his family and he has employment, and the State is not able to provide him with accommodation at that stage, and he is prepared to construct his own accommodation, then, rather than put obstacles in his way, he should be assisted. Sir, these are standpoints of principle. They are guide-lines in terms of which the Government can implement a system of influx control which will differ dramatically from the one which exists at present.</p>

<p>The principles I have just mentioned are calculated to promote stability in our urban communities. In terms of this system we shall have more or less stable communities which cannot be the source of crime or unrest in our urban centres. One of my gravest objections to this legislation is the fact that all measures adopted thus far, particularly as far as Bantu squatting is concerned, have promoted, not stability, but instability. They disrupt those communities. They chase them around like a lot of guinea-fowl. I have seen this for myself. They move around from divisional council land to municipal land and then to the Bantu administration land. Some of them have moved as many as six or seven times. They do not form a stable urban community. In fact, they are now becoming angry and upset. They do not fully understand the dilemma in which they find themselves. The one thing they cannot understand is why they cannot live together as man, wife and children. I want to suggest that if the Government, and particularly the Departments of Bantu Administration and Development and of Community Development, were to consider these three principles or furnish us with clear reasons why they do not want to accept them, we should at least be able to conduct a fruitful debate. Until that happens, and so long as we get this kind of reaction, we must simply accept that the aims of legislation such as this are chiefly to get the phenomenon of squatting out of sight, so that one can say, &#x201C;what the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve over&#x201D;. The ultimate question is still: What becomes of those people? Where do they go to? What accommodation do they get and what employment is there for them at the place they are going to? If there is no accommodation or work for them there, then we are back with the original problem, and that is the drawing power of the city, the question of labour in the city and the attractiveness of the city. Throughout the industrial world this is the cause of urbanization and of the migration of the rural population groups to these areas. Rather than introduce legislation aimed at simply suppressing that problem, one might as well push a cork into the sea and hope that will stop the tides. Therefore, because this legislation as it reads at present, is exclusively a punitive measure which does not even begin to envisage alternative solutions to the problem of squatting&#x2014;not the problem of housing but only the problem of squatting&#x2014;and because we are of the opinion that the consequences of this legislation could be very explosive for all of us in South Africa, particularly as far as Bantu squatting is concerned, we are unable to support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. ALBERTYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Rondebosch has now let the cat out of the bag by saying that his party is not going to support this legislation. This is more or less what we expected would be the case. Right at the beginning of his speech the hon. member for Rondebosch mentioned the example of Ampie. Sir, the hon. member really should know his history better. Surely Ampie was only a phenomenon amongst the Afrikaners. After all, he was not a typical example of the Afrikaner of that time. The comparison which the hon. member tried to draw between Afrikaners and squatters does not, therefore, hold water. By doing so, he completely lost his self respect as an Afrikaner. Ampie was merely a phenomenon. [Interjections.] There is a similarity in so far as both the Afrikaners and Ampie were poor, but to compare those poor Afrikaners with the squatters, the conditions in which they are living and the way of life which they accept, is almost sacrilege. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member tried to make a very important point of this by saying that they recognized squatting. But we also recognize squatting as a process which takes place under certain conditions. This is the case, and we are not trying to restrict or put a stop to influx completely by means of this legislation. <span class="col_6405-6406" refersTo="page_0533"/>However, we are at least going to try to regulate and control it.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke of Bantu squatting and said that this would increase rather than decrease. I want to make the statement that it will increase rather than decrease as long as that party and others of their ilk continue to prompt Bantu squatters who are in White areas illegally, to remain there. What I said about this, when I spoke about the conditions at Crossroads and that party&#x2019;s share in the circumstances there, is on record in Hansard. The hon. member is an academic. He found that the number of Bantu squatters would increase rather than decrease. I now want to ask him if he also ascertained how many Coloureds there are in the greater Peninsula area who do not work at all or do not work regularly, and to what extent those data are responsible for the presence of large numbers of Blacks in this area. I shall be obliged if he would arrange things in such a way that one of his fellow party members could give us an answer in that connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member added that the men are here legally and that they also want their wives and children here. This is the case, and I, too, have dealt with that point in another speech. However, the point which the hon. member did not answer and which they overlook every time, is the fact that the Bantu who is here legally, concluded an agreement when he was recruited as a labourer in the White area, that he would come here as a single person for a certain period of time and under certain conditions. He accepted that agreement and now, in spite of that agreement, he brings his wife and children here illegally. He moves out of the accommodation with which he is provided, and which is being paid for in any event, and goes and squats at Crossroads and other places. However, the hon. member for Rondebosch and his party say nothing about this. They gloss over the fact that these people are law breakers; they overlook that.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member says that relations are disturbed if a White man has to go to Black people like these and tell them they have to go back. This is true, but it is made even more difficult when one White man tells the Black people that they are there illegally and have to move, while another White man tells them: &#x201C;You are here illegally, but I shall provide assistance. I shall provide legal advice. You must plead extenuating circumstances when you are placed before the court. Remain here as long as possible, because a transgression of influx control is only petty; it is not a serious offence.&#x201D; I repeat, Sir, that it really becomes difficult when one White man explains to those Black people that they must go away, while another encourages them to remain, even if they realize that they are there illegally.</p>

<p>I should like to ask that hon. member whether he is totally opposed to influx control. He qualified his standpoint to a degree by saying that if a Black man had work in a White area, he should be admitted, together with his family, However, the fact is that at least 500 men are in the area illegally at Crossroads alone. He says nothing about them, however. Should they, too, remain here?</p>

<p>The hon. member did not refer to them. He only said that when he went to Crossroads and asked the people what their problem was, they told him that they wanted their wives and children here. Sir, I have already challenged the hon. member in this connection in the past. The hon. member should also come and report to us what he says to those people. We do not only want to know what they tell the hon. member, but what he tells them, as well. He must tell us whether he encourages them to remain here.</p>

<p>I want to leave the hon. member for Rondebosch for a moment and return to the hon. member for Green Point. I am really disappointed that the hon. member for Green Point asked that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee. This request has already become a symptom of disease with the UP. Every time that party does not see its way clear to adopting a firm standpoint on a matter, they hide behind something else; in this case behind a Select Committee. They even dragged in the Erika Theron Commission.</p>

<p>Naturally I am interested in the commission&#x2019;s report. After all, that commission was not appointed to work so that we could sit and mark time here in the meantime, while everything simply has to carry on as it is. Surely we have to continue <span class="col_6407-6408" refersTo="page_0534"/>with our work and deal with the problem. The hon. member says that we do not need this legislation, because the existing Acts are quite adequate to deal with the problem. However, I want to tell you that the existing Acts are not adequate and I want to quote to you what Senator Brian Bamford said. I quote from <i>Progress.</i> I do not know if the hon. member for Green Point knows about this little newspaper. This is what appeared in the September 1975 edition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Senator Brian Bamford issued a statement warning that the board &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the Bantu Affairs Administration Board of the Western Cape.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; could face criminal charges if it demolishes squatter shacks in future without a court order. In future, to obtain a court order to demolish a shack, the board will have to prove, amongst other things, that the structure was illegal, a danger to health, and that the occupants were living in the area illegally &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is how difficult it is now to obtain a court order. I want to read to you from a letter dated 1972. I do not think this document was meant for public distribution, but I do not think that the Cape divisional council will take it amiss of me if I say that their findings were the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kragtens die Wet besit &#x2019;n plaaslike owerheid die bevoegdheid indien hy oortuig is dat die toestande en omstandighede waarin plakkers op grand woon, sodanig is dat tensy hulle verwyder word, die gesond-heid en veiligheid van die publiek oor die algemeen of van enige klas of klasse persone insluitende die plakkers self, in gevaar mag verkeer &#x2026;</block>

<p>Senator Bamford based his statement on the existing Act. He said that it would now be virtually impossible for the court to issue a demolition order. I have thousands upon thousands of squatters in my constituency and I shall give you the figures in a moment. After all, I know of court cases which magistrates threw out because they said that they were not worth the trouble. The magistrates wanted to know how the people could be kicked out since they had nowhere else to go. The hon. member now says that we do not need the Act.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that we should spend a little money to improve the shanties. The hon. member for Johannesburg West previously made a speech about new wine in old bottles or something of the sort, but the suggestion by the hon. member for Green Point consists of new patches on old bottles and this has not worked anywhere up to now, not even in Biblical times, nor will it work today, either.</p>

<p>His other suggestion was in connection with the &#x201C;site-and-service&#x201D; scheme. Lourdes Farm is also in my constituency and if this is the sort of community which that hon. member wants to approve and see multiply in order to combat this problem, then I want nothing at all to do with this. I often drive past there&#x2014;it remains a mess. At the moment there are 693 shacks on Lourdes Farm, and if this is the future which he wants to create for squatters, he must not <span class="col_6409-6410" refersTo="page_0535"/>speak about the squatters with sympathy; he can speak about them in another spirit.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. ALBERTYN</person>:</from>

<p>Wait, I am coming to that, the hon. member for Jeppe must excuse me in the meantime. As far as the hon. member for Pinetown is concerned, I must say that I could not follow his speech. The only thing I could deduce from his speech, was that he was aware of the situation and the problems connected with the situation. However, he has no solution; indeed, he refuses to solve the problems because he wants to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> I wonder whether he agrees with the hon. member for Green Point that a commission of inquiry should be appointed to investigate the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also mentioned the provision of housing for Bantu by employers. It has been the custom for years that employers of legal Bantu employees in the White areas are allowed to provide housing for their employees on both a family and a single basis. Naturally this arrangement is effected in consultation with the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards and according to an agreement with those boards. If the hon. member for Green Point does not want to believe me, I can tell him that according to the information available to me, this practice is already being applied by Iscor at Vanderbijlpark and also by De Beers at Kimberley and at various other places in the Western Cape.</p>

<p>One really gains the impression that the PRP and the UP are talking about squatting conditions as if they are looking at the situation through a pair of binoculars. They are looking from a distance and their attention is focused on the bad aspects. They do not take note of our resettlement projects and the solutions with which we are occupied. They look at this problem with blinkers and create the impression that matters should rather remain as they are.</p>

<p>I think we have all agreed that squatting is a worldwide phenomenon. Other honest people also admit that most African States experience the same problem, namely that people move from the poor rural areas to the apparently preferable life of the city. Some African States deal with this problem far more drastically than we do here in South Africa, but without the emotional consequences and without the exploitation by the humanists and the political vultures. Here the influx has been given a strong racial connotation and cannot therefore be handled without emotion. The focus, therefore, is always directed at action as well as at the conditions.</p>

<p>I want to ask a question: What moral claim does one have on society if one gives up a house and one&#x2019;s job and, as the hon. member for Boksburg said, packs one&#x2019;s donkey cart and gives notice at the farm or does not even give notice and then simply moves to the city? This also applies to the Bantu who has a farm in the homeland and simply turns up here and squats under the bushes. What moral claim does such a person have on society if he gives up his home and job and simply comes and squats in another area where he is not allowed to be? What does society owe those people? I do not believe society owes them anything at all. By squatting, they are living off society as parasites.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. members on the other side, those who criticize us so sharply, to look at the example of Prof. H. W. van der Merwe, as a result of what he wrote in <i>Die Burger</i> at one time about Crossroads, in order to realize that we have here a political policy and Acts which must be implemented. This House is the place to criticize them and attack them and they are free to do so. However, I think it is wrong that politicians and other bodies influence the Blacks who, in many cases, are ignorant of the laws of the country, to break the laws. One confuses them, one does them an injustice and one gives them bad, faulty advice and misleads them. You arrogate to yourself the right to condone illegal influx and squatting. The persistent disregard of the laws of the land and obstruction of the law by the squatters of Crossroads is a sign that they are influenced. The question of who influences them is no longer a problem to us.</p>

<p>I also want to ask of that party in particular, whether it is not the same people who are continually telling us about &#x201C;the rule of law&#x201D;? I want to ask them what has happened to their respect of the law if they influence those people to break the law, or does one use and discard this &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; to suit one&#x2019;s own purpose? Are these not the same people who are always reminding us of the large numbers of Blacks in the so-called White areas? In the meantime they are influencing those <span class="col_6411-6412" refersTo="page_0536"/>people&#x2014;we have learned this from the hon. member for Rondebosch&#x2014;to come along. Every person who can possibly qualify must come here with his family. In the meantime they are exerting themselves to make the whole country black, at the expense of the Coloureds as well. This is their proud record of service to South Africa: The subtle intercession for the cause of resistance to law and order and the resultant ploughing under of White and Brown and the bedevilment of good relations between White and Black.</p>

<p>I do not think that party has counted the cost involved in what they are doing, nor do I think that they can control the consequences. They want to alleviate the lot of the squatter by telling him how bad the law is and how cruel the system is. They tell these people that they are guilty, but that they will see to it that they will get off lightly. They also provide them with legal advice and arguments. This is the advice they give, but they do not tell the squatters to return to the homeland and that they will help them to get there in the easiest way. They give the squatters the impression that they have a right to break the law. Then, if the court finds him guilty and he has to be sent back, there is disillusionment and disappointment for the Black man. In this way resentment of the White man and the system is born. Is this, now, due to the law or to the system? Surely it is due to interference with the execution of the law. And who causes the hate? The one who has acted firmly from the outset or the one who appeased without explaining the true situation? Whose fault is it? The one who implemented the law or the one who was mistakenly sympathetic? The hon. member for Rondebosch quoted a text from the Bible here. I have also brought one along and refer him to Proverbs 24 : 24, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He that sayeth unto the wicked, thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him.</block>

<p>We believe that prevention is better than cure, and basically, this legislation is going to be preventive in practice.</p>

<p>Another hon. member of that party, the hon. member for Sandton, is unfortunately not here today. However, last week, in another debate, he made interesting allegations. He told us about a place called Alexandra where 38 500 Blacks were living legally, but 12 000, too, were living illegally. In another Black area near Sandton there is a population of over 17 000 who are apparently there legally, and approximately 8 000 who are there illegally. I now want to quote the hon. member (Hansard, col. 5585)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are therefore discussing a community of some 75 000 people, of whom fully one third live there outside the bounds of the law of South Africa.</block>

<p>He went on to say that the place was developing into a place of evils and although the population was decreasing, crime was on the increase, that is to say, violent crimes like robbery and theft. He told us that there had been an increase of 8&#x0025; in the crime rate over the past three years. He said that the number of assaults had increased by 18&#x0025; and dagga offences by 20&#x0025;. Then he says, and I am quoting once again (col. 5588)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What I want to say is that in respect of this demotivated, decaying township, it is time that this hon. Minister made up his mind that &#x2026;this Government must take urgent steps to salvage from the forgotten ash heap this community which lives in squalor and which lives without much hope.</block>

<p>These are the words of the hon. member for Sandton. He asks for action and a decision. A proposal by the hon. the Minister of Community Development is now before the House to do precisely what the hon. member for Sandton asks, but now the hon. member for Rondebosch says on behalf of his party that they do not agree with this legislation. In other words, here the problem is identified; everyone agrees on it, but the solution which they asked for, a decision, a proposal, viz. vigorous action &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, he just says that they oppose the legislation. However, he now has a whole night to work on the amendment.</p>

<p>There are two possibilities in respect of these 20 000 illegal Blacks to whom the hon. member for Sandton referred. Firstly it must be established whether they are unemployed. We must also combat the loafing. The increase in crime, of which he told us, indicates that many of them are unemployed. Since they do not work, they do not have money and therefore they cannot buy food and other things. This is the state of affairs throughout the squatter community. For this reason they steal, assault, and in the process, maim people too. This is why they smuggle dagga and have shebeens. This evil of loafing, work-shyness and laziness when it comes to regular work for five or six days of the week must be eradicated completely. It is time that the public are protected against these parasites who batten on the community and endanger the health of all with whom they come into contact through their squatting and unhygienic way of life. The public must be protected against these people who have to steal, thieve and in the process even murder merely to be able to exist, these people who also terrorize and threaten people of their own race, assault and maim them if they will not hand over all or part of the money they have earned by the sweat of their brow. If this legislation is going to be implemented strictly, it could be the key to the solution of the &#x201C;skollie&#x201D; problem, the loafing and the laziness. However, the hon. members of the PRP are opposed to this, while hon. members of the UP say a commission of inquiry must first go into the matter. I am sure that if we see to it that people work, our crime rate will drop, our rate of inflation will drop and our productivity will increase. Then everyone will have the money to afford the rent of a decent house, even if it is a dull little house. Then we would not have to hear that 60&#x0025; of the people who are now squatters, come from municipal schemes because among other things they could not pay the rent. Then the forgotten ash heaps to which the hon. member for Sandton referred, could be cleared and the people who are living in filth, would then be able to have decent housing.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure whether proof that such a person has a job, is sufficient. I have already referred here to a master builder in Parow who informed me that the absentee rate among his Coloured labourers is as high as 22&#x00BD;&#x0025;. Last week an industrialist from the Strand informed me that the absentee rate among his Coloured labourers was 30&#x0025;. Under such circumstances the cost of living and inflation must surely rocket. Therefore I believe that an initial proof that a labourer has work and as a result qualifies to be here, is perhaps not sufficient. There will have to be a check whether such a person works regularly, because if he does not work regularly, he will not be able to pay the rent of the house. The person will then be evicted and become a squatter once again. The whole procedure will therefore be repeated. We already have experience of this phenomenon in practice.</p>

<p>I have already said that the one possibility is that the people may be unemployed. However, there is also another possibility, namely that they may indeed have work. If this is the case, I believe that it is a matter of honour that they must be accommodated and the squatting conditions be cleared. I do not believe that we differ on this. Employers and the owners of land on which people are living illegally, must accept joint responsibility for orderly coexistence and help to ensure that people can live decently. Those who have in the past refused to help or to accept joint responsibility, those who allowed the slum conditions and ways of life of the slum to arise, which became a danger to peace-loving and well-meaning people will eventually be dealt with and forced to accept joint responsibility.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has already dealt with certain figures and although I cannot improve on them in the slightest, I should like to add that according to the figures at my disposal there is a total of 27 000 squatters in the False Bay constituency. I know that when one speaks of numbers of squatters, one must allow for a variation in percentage, but I believe that it can be accepted that in my constituency there are most probably 27 000 squatters who are not properly accommodated. I sometimes gain the impression that hon. members of the Opposition <span class="col_6415-6416" refersTo="page_0538"/>wear blinkers when they speak about squatters. We see them every day, we live among them and we grasp the problem. We do not hate, nor do we bear a grudge against the squatters, but we realize that the prevailing conditions simply cannot remain as they are. Something must be done and we believe that the legislation is the key to this.</p>

<p>On 31 May 1974 the Stellenbosch Divisional Council said that illegal squatting was one of its biggest problems in spite of the fact that only 1 300 shanties remained in its area after more than 500 had been demolished the previous year. The Cape Divisional Council mentioned in its report for the year 1974-&#x2019;75 that they calculated that there were 100 000 squatters in their area. The areas of these two councils lie in the form of a horseshoe around the Cape Peninsula. This is the point of arrival of those who come from the rural areas and is the last refuge of those who are moving out from the centre of the city. They usually squat with the permission of the owner.</p>

<p>We must make no mistake; there are Coloured owners, too, who allow squatting. In the agricultural area in the vicinity of Phillipi there are two Coloured owners and as far as I know, the properties of both are squatter towns. Apart from the squatters&#x2019; shanties, stables, chicken coops and pig sties are converted for human occupation. No approved building plans exist for these things. There are no sanitary services and water is not laid on. The squatters have to pay rent and are often exploited. There must be plans which have been approved by the local authority concerned for a pig sty, but no approved plans exist for many of the structures in which those people are living.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point asks that a commission of inquiry should be appointed first while the hon. member for Rondebosch says that he wants nothing at all to do with the clearing of such conditions. The squatters are allowed to live in structures for which there are no building plans. Once they have moved in, they cannot be evicted unless alternative accommodation is provided. Since the courts have already given such rulings, the police no longer want to take action. They say that they are wasting their time; why should they pay attention to complaints of that kind? The owner has first to complain, but usually he does not. The result is that nobody bothers the squatter or the owner of the land. The squatters erect their shanties and move overnight, but usually move in on a Sunday. When one goes to have a look on a Monday morning, they are there.</p>

<p>The Bantu who are here legally must be provided with approved accommodation. This is a requirement which must be complied with before permission is given for them to be here. The Coloureds, however, are even allowed to live in pigsties. Surely this is not right; why should it be so? To me the important point with respect to this legislation is that individuals and local authorities here and there, too, allowed squatting to develop. That was the start. It began on a personal level. However, the process snowballed and developed into a situation which must be condemned. Although we sympathize with the man in need, we were wrong to pity him. Exploitation and even enrichment followed. The consequences of squatting have not been on the personal level for a long time. It has become a community problem and therefore the community must be protected against the bad effects and malpractices caused by squatting. This Bill takes the responsibility back to the starting point, viz. the owner of the land. The onus of proof will rest upon him and, in my opinion, this is correct. He is the responsible person. This is another good reason why this piece of legislation is essential.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should give hon. members two descriptions of what a squatter situation looks like. The Cape Divisional Council states the following in its report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These people, euphemistically referred to as &#x201C;squatters&#x201D;, live under the most appalling conditions. Lacking even the most fundamental essential services, their living conditions are deplorable and constitute a grave menace to health. The problem has been aggravated by the unhampered influx of new squatters.</block>

<p>This is what the divisional council had to say in last year&#x2019;s report. They said that new squatters were always arriving. <i>The Cape Times</i> had the following to say in 1974 about a certain squatter community&#x2014;I really cannot improve on this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a hodge-podge of filth and dilapidation. There is no electricity, no proper sanitation and plenty of flies. The presence <span class="col_6417-6418" refersTo="page_0539"/>of goats, mangy dogs and scrawny, battle-scarred cats is hardly helpful to the halfhearted attempts at maintaining basic hygiene, and everywhere there is the sand, the dirt and the rubbish.</block>

<p>This article was written as a result of the complaint of the UP Senator, Senator Piet Swanepoel, who complained at a public political meeting that certain NP representatives had not done their duty in respect of these squatters. Only now, two years after this type of problem was pointed out, does the hon. member for Green Point ask for a commission of inquiry to do something about this problem.</p>

<p>On 22 January last year a letter written by a Coloured clergyman appeared in <i>Die Burger.</i> Sir, I hope you will allow me to read sections of his letter here. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is waarlik onrusbarend om die groot aantal gesinne se eksodus uit die platteland, die plase ingesluit, na die stad gade te slaan. Dikwels het hierdie mense net &#x2019;n vae idee van wat die stadslewe is. Baie min is goed voorberei om hulle by die stadslewe aan te pas en verwag die hemel op aarde. Vir baie wat daar &#x2019;n groot ontnugtering. Daar is probleme van die stad waarop hulle baie min voorbereid is en wat hulle moet oorbrug. Die grootste daarvan is die probleem van huisvesting. Daar is selde vooraf gedink oor die vraag: Waar gaan ons woon? Verder kom hulle na die stad sonder enige waar-borg van &#x2019;n vaste betrekking of seifs net werk in &#x2019;n nuwe woongebied. Die gevolg hiervan is dat plakkersdorpies ontstaan waar die mense eenvoudig onwettig aanbly.</block>

<p>This is a responsible standpoint. This Bill will have the effect that people will not move to the city impulsively in search of mere expectations.</p>

<p>This law is not being passed so as to escape our duty towards the squatters. Surely there is ample proof of that. The person who is here legally, the useful person, is welcome. There is proof that a person like this is properly looked after. We are not simply pulling down shanties, we are also building thousands of houses, even though some of them are drab. The hon. the Minister furnished us with more than sufficient proof of this. We know from experience that when there need only be a rumour going around that a housing project for non-Whites, for squatters, is being started, for there to be an accelerated movement into the area. Due to this experience we have to take preventive measures. That is why the Government has introduced this Bill which, we trust, will close the loopholes once and for all. Therefore we take pleasure in supporting the Bill and hope that it will come into operation very soon.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. I assume that they did not support the Bill. However, I would like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister and this hon. House to a resolution which was moved by 800 to 900 Coloured people who met at a special rally to consider the implications of this legislation for the Coloured people themselves. It has been suggested earlier by an hon. member on the other side that the Coloured people themselves support this move. But I want to make it very clear that, in terms of this resolution, they do not. They believe&#x2014; whether they are correct or not, is beside the point&#x2014;that the implications of this Bill for a great number of Coloured people living in the Western Cape, is the introduction of influx control for the Coloured community of South Africa.</p>

<p>No, I was not. Were you there? I should imagine some of your people were there. Secondly, this resolution was taken because they believe that this legislation will restrict the free movement of the Coloured community. Thirdly, they believe that this legislation aims at gaining a better control of farm workers by preventing them from finding work in the urban and industrial areas of South Africa, and that this legislation will give unfettered control to local authorities over the property of Coloured people. They, therefore, condemn this proposed legislation in the strongest of terms and will fight its introduction and its implementation with all the powers at their command. They further appeal for assistance by responsible people in this House through voicing their objection to this Bill. We have looked at this legislation with care. My colleague and I, and other hon. members on both sides of the House, have visited a number of the squatter communities over the last two years. We have talked to the officials and to the hon. the Deputy Minister, as well as to the people living there. We have tried to assess the various reasons as to why people are actually squatting, how many there are, what their future is, what their position is and what they would like to see happen, if at all possible.</p>

<p>It is clear that there is an enormous squatter population throughout South Africa, but in particular here in the Cape Western region. They form a semi-circle around the more affluent areas, using unused scrub lands in the main, or rented plots in urban areas. According to my calculation, there are at least 7 000 squatter settlements in the Cape Town municipal area, 12 000 in the divisional council area and 3 000 in other municipal areas, making a total of well-nigh 23 000 structures, housing at least 120 000 people. I believe that it is very much higher and I am trying to be as conservative as I possibly can be in regard to the figures. It is probably about 180 000 Coloured people and approximately a further 15 000 Blacks.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>On what do you base that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>On actual calculations by people who have gone into the areas themselves, people from very responsible bodies, people at the University of Cape Town who have taken surveys, the Chamber of Commerce and Prof. S. P. Cilliers against whom, perhaps, the hon. the Minister might have something as well. <i>The Cape Times</i> completed a survey on 9 June 1975, after having contacted various people who had been <span class="col_6421-6422" refersTo="page_0541"/>working with this problem over many years. We accept that it is not a new problem. They suggested that there are about 200 000 people who are living as squatters. This means that at least one in five of the Coloured population are living as squatters and that one out of every seven of the Bantu population live in these squatter areas. I simply outline the magnitude of the problem. I am well aware that the hon. the Minister and his colleagues are equally aware of the magnitude of the problem. That is the only point I am making so far.</p>

<p>Another question is why people live in this way. This has arisen during the course of the debate and various suggestions have been made. The most simplistic reason that has been suggested is that these people like it there. Of course there are a few people in every kind of community who will not fit into society and will not adapt or adjust and who will take the easiest way out. It is not the way you or I, Sir, would like to take, but nevertheless it is taken.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, but I cannot answer the hon. member&#x2019;s question at the moment. I am trying to develop a point, but if I have time at the end I shall be glad to answer the hon. member&#x2019;s question. The question I want to try to grapple with is why these people are actually in squatter camps right now. If we are trying to reach a solution to the problem, it is of the essence to really understand why they are there at all. Are they merely unhousable people who come to annoy the city fathers and make a nuisance of themselves, or are there other more complex reasons and circumstances which lead to this problem? Certainly some of the squatters are unhousables without a regular source of income. However, my submission to the House is that the majority of those who are squatting at the present time are not Something of the order of about 25&#x0025; of the Coloured squatters are immigrants from country areas who have come to Cape Town to seek work. There is a lack of farm work because of increasing mechanization. In any case, many of them in interviews conducted by the university suggested that they had come here in the hope that they would be able to increase the inadequate wages where they were working, and that they would earn a better wage in the towns. This is a natural phenomenon which has been taking place ever since the industrial age dawned in the world. People have come towards the cities, towards the bright lights. They have often been disillusioned, but the fact of the matter is that they have been so attracted as have many Whites in the past in South Africa.</p>

<p>According to my calculations most of the rest of the squatters are people who were born in Cape Town and who would like to have a house in the housing estates, but are unable to find accommodation there. Anybody who goes to these housing estates cannot deny that they are hopelessly overcrowded. At Bonteheuwel, for example, a place I have visited many, many times, there was a reasonably roomy situation until what is called the &#x201C;infill&#x201D; scheme was undertaken and a single-storey house ended up with a double-storey house in its back-yard, leading to crammed conditions without even minimal privacy. The tiny houses at Netreg, another community, are very crowded and smaller than many squatter dwellings. People live cheek-by-jowl in these estates, and yet there is not enough room.</p>

<p>The Cape Town City Council has announced that the waiting list contains at least 2 000 families needing housing and that the minimum waiting period is five years. This is a very real problem. It is not merely a question of people wanting to escape from their responsibilities and wanting to go and shack somewhere under the bushes in the rain. That is not the real reason. The real reason is that there happen to be&#x2014;and this is confirmed by these figures given to me by the City Council itself and are not my own figures&#x2014; 20 000 families needing housing while the minimum waiting period is five years. Where do these people live for those five years? They cannot simply disappear, but have to find some place to live. The situation is deteriorating all the time because of the population explosion. Of course attention must be given in this direction as well. Consequently many Coloured families, especially newly-married families who have been brought up on these estates literally have nowhere else to go. I am convinced that there are members in this House who have had young Coloured people coming to them asking for help, decent young people saying that they want to get married, <span class="col_6423-6424" refersTo="page_0542"/>but that they have nowhere to say and that the housing list is a mile long. Both in Johannesburg and in Cape Town these representations have been made. What do these people then do? They should get sympathy and not severe legislation which makes it impossible for them to exist. Most of them, therefore, have very little option but to turn to squatting for five to seven years, the time it takes to get to the top of the waiting list. These people do so out of desperation. For each family turning to squatting another will choose to live in established housing schemes in conditions of overcrowding and lack of privacy that are hardly superior to a squatter&#x2019;s life.</p>

<p>There are also some families who choose to leave the housing estates&#x2014;that is quite correct. Apart from the lack of control over their personal environment consequent upon living in public housing there are also serious crime problems in many of the estates. This is a problem not merely found in the squatting areas; it is also a very serious problem in the estates. Despite the housing shortage the Kreefgat houses, for example, were closed down a long time ago. Gang activity is one of the reasons for this. I see the hon. the Minister is shaking his head.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I shook my head because your argument is ridiculous.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, all right, but one of the reasons stated in the report about the Kreefgat houses was that gang activity made it well-nigh impossible for people to live there. This is not my observation; it is in an official report concerning those houses.</p>

<p>There is another problem. Many squatters with regular wages have incomes below the poverty datum line and cannot afford even to pay sub-economic rents for council houses. Some can afford to pay these rents, but choose not to do so. Squatting is cheaper and in view of some of the facts just mentioned, sometimes better value. We should acknowledge that. One has to accept that there are some people who have decided to opt out of municipal housing schemes because it is cheaper to squat and because they do not want to have all the responsibilities. However, that accounts for only a small percentage. If one looks at the income levels of the people who are squatting one finds, according to a histogram produced by a professor at the university, that 20&#x0025; of the squatters in Kensington and Athlone earn less than R50 per month and that 55&#x0025; earn less than R100 per month. This is a vast socio-economic problem. We simply are not going to solve it by introducing more and more and more legislation. We will make it more difficult for people to find even inadequate housing. I concede that the shanty-dwellers are not all people of this kind. 9&#x0025; of them earn more than R200 per month which, in this kind of community, is quite a respectable salary in the lives of many people.</p>

<p>Is this lack of housing for the Coloured people simply because of a high birth rate and a slow building programme, or are there other causes operating as well? The fact of the matter is that one of the greatest problems or factors that has contributed most to the Coloured housing shortage is undeniably the Group Areas Act.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not ignorant at all. If the hon. the Minister cannot take criticism, then he should not be where he is. This and related legislation has worsened the situation in at least three ways. The hon. the Minister will have an opportunity to react, but let me put three suggestions to him. Firstly, no option is given to families created by mixed Black and Coloured marriages as there is a complete lack of housing for them in Black townships and they are not allowed to live in Coloured areas. I defy the hon. the Minister to give me an answer to that. This is the fact of the matter. It is for this reason that these people have to squat. Secondly, it has enormously restricted the land available for Black and Coloured housing, thereby slowing down building programmes and pushing up the cost of building in usually inconvenient and inaccessible land. It has created a shortage of readily available and suitable land for Coloured housing. Thirdly, removals which have taken place under the Group Areas Act have led directly to a large loss of housing which was previously available to the Coloured community. When one tries to discover what has happened to the houses which were once owned and lived in by Coloured families, one finds that many of these houses have been <span class="col_6425-6426" refersTo="page_0543"/>renovated and added to the White housing stock. They now form very pleasant White suburbs. Some houses such as the labourers&#x2019; cottages at Kirstenbosch have simply been left to stand empty. The hon. the Minister is welcome to go and have a look at them. They are standing there empty. Similarly, some Simonstown flats formerly housing Coloured dockyard workers have been unoccupied for years and have been allowed to decay. Many more of the old Coloured homes, those at Kommetjie for instance, have simply been demolished.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you very much. If the hon. member for Carletonville does not believe me I want to ask him to give me a convincing answer about what has happened to District Six. The current plans for redevelopment in this area are aimed at providing convenient housing and amenities for which group? It is, as always, for the White group. Some of the houses in District Six were undoubtedly slums but it is not only the loss of prime land and the destruction of their community that has been a heavy blow to the Coloured community; they have also lost their housing stock itself, even if some of it was in a bad condition. This has had very serious consequences, because at least 15 000 Coloured families lost their homes in the greater Cape Town area because of the provisions of the Group Areas Act. This figure could well be as large as 20 000 or 25 000. This means that the Act has played a very large part in causing a shortage of Coloured housing and the immediate consequent development of squatter townships. Of course squatting has been here for a long time. Of course it is found in many other parts of the world, but I am suggesting that the policies of the Government have aggravated the situation and therefore they have a major responsibility for it. [Interjections.] Hon. members can deny it if they want to; they can shout if they want to, but the fact of the matter is that it is true and there are many hon. members on that side of the House who know it.</p>

<p>What are the future prospects for the squatters? What are they going to do about the situation they are in? The official programme has several aspects. Firstly a crash housing programme is being undertaken, particularly at Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain, south of the D. F. Malan airport. Very large sums of money are being invested in building good quality housing. In parenthesis I just want to say, in case some hon. members missed what I have just said, that the Government is engaged in providing good quality housing, and that a great deal of money is being spent. I think it is tremendous.</p>

<p>I am glad hon. members have received the message. It is anticipated that these people will move to Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain, which will enable squatters to be housed by filling the vacancies created in these housing estates. Another large scheme is that of Atlantis near Mamre. Coupled with this building programme is a policy of strict control of shacks. People are constantly being moved to official camps. Recognized shacks are numbered and recorded and unauthorized shacks are demolished. Now, we find this piece of legislation before the House. The previous demolition procedure was either to use a bulldozer or to attach a cable from a tractor to the shack and then pull steadily until the whole lot caved in while the resident watched impotently. The real question this House should be debating.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, this is it. The question is whether this policy package of new buildings, strict control and group area evictions will solve the squatter problem. I believe it will not. Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain suffers from two major disadvantages. It is far from the major sources and areas of employment and therefore repayments of high quality home ownership houses are so high that insufficient people may be prepared to move there from the various housing estates in which they find themselves now. Then of course there are the Government cut-backs which have already been referred to. Various groups have made proposals and I am sure the hon. the Minister must have received copies of various schemes which are trying to cope with the squatter problem in a responsible manner. I have tried to suggest a few steps. They may be quite useless, but I think this House needs to hear every point of view in attempting to solve this very real problem. First of all, I would suggest that emergency steps should be taken to improve the health situation in all squatter areas which are expected to remain for more than 12 months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>How?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>If you do not even know how to introduce health measures, then you are even worse off than I thought. However, I shall spell it out for the hon. member. It would include a clean-up, a regular rubbish removal, adequate provision of water and adequate toilet facilities. I am sure the hon. the Minister knows of a place called Ferebos. Residents there, according to my information and after having spoken to some of the residents, are engaged in just such a health improvement scheme in conjunction with the Cape Flats committee for interim accommodation. This is a temporary move to improve conditions in these areas until more permanent arrangements can be made. I think this is one of the first steps that ought to be taken in an emergency plan.</p>

<p>Secondly, I believe that some squatter areas have the potential to be upgraded into satisfactory permanent living areas. Some of these do exist and provision of services is one of the necessary elements in achieving this. Most of all, there must be community backing and participation in the scheme, plus sufficient security of tenure to enable the people to feel adequately secure so that they can participate in the kind of development which can and will be necessary. The way in which a squatter shanty can be transformed by the owner&#x2019;s efforts alone, if he has sufficient security of tenure, can be seen in this way. The owner is utilizing his own energy and money to turn his home into a satisfactory permanent structure. This should be encouraged. However, to enable this to happen, community participation is absolutely essential. Building by-laws will have to be adjusted to allow the interim accommodation legal status. Given the correct conditions which reinforce community structures, much satisfactory housing can be developed in this way at a minimum expense.</p>

<p>The third step which should be taken is the development of new areas to house squatters whose homes are not suitable for upgrading. Here the whole concept of a core-house concept can be utilized. It has been developed in other parts of the world and it has been developed in some parts of this country for other communities, including White communities. The core-house begins in a very small way and additions are made possible as the man&#x2019;s income allows for it. Given a reasonable site enabling the provision of housing and the provision of work to be integrated in a satisfactory way, such housing could be successfully provided within the means of the lower income groups. There is no reason why a squatter house could not be incorporated satisfactorily into existing housing stock. The energies which have led to this kind of development could surely be harnessed in a carefully planned core-house scheme.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. the Minister, when he made his Second Reading speech, with some care, and I have had the benefit of a copy of the speech itself. In that speech he dealt with the problems facing Africa and the rest of the world with a wealth of detail whereas, by comparison, he elaborated upon and explained the details of this Bill with such an economy of language that one wonders whether his heart is really behind it. You see, Sir, we are dealing not merely with a Security Bill, but with what is in effect an extension of the Suppression of Communism Act of 1950. It has been transformed from an Act merely to deal with communism and things associated with communism into a piece of legislation dealing generally with security matters. Whilst I do not wish to go into detail in so far as the Suppression of Communism Act is concerned, I think it is relevant that I summarize very briefly the attitude of this party to that legislation when it came before the House in 1950. There was a reasoned amendment moved by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Strauss, in these terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, whilst convinced of the necessity of combating Communism by legislation, declines to pass the second reading of the Bill because, in seeking to combat communist totalitarianism, it creates a Fascist despotism in that it clothes the executive with unnecessarily wide and despotic powers, fails to provide for full and effective access to the courts, and makes intolerable inroads upon the freedom of the citizen, including the power to violate the sanctity of his home&#x201D;.</block>

<p>If one studies that debate, and particularly the speech of the Leader of the Opposition on that occasion, one sees that in the alternative Bill proposed by the United Party, a number of factors received prominence. Firstly, there was the desire to have the offences, the mischief which one was trying to deal with and bring under control, clearly and specifically defined and, secondly, to try as far as possible to deal with offenders against that legislation through the process of the courts or judicial procedure as opposed to executive action by the executive. Those matters came out clearly in the debate which took place in 1950.</p>

<p>In his brief explanation of the present legislation, the hon. the Minister dealt briefly with matters and ended with perhaps the most difficult and objectionable part of the Bill, that part dealing with preventative detention&#x2014; which in other language is internment. I was surprised, having read the Bill, not only to hear from the hon. the Minister a clear exposition that this Bill considerably widens the scope of the power of preventative detention, but also to see the Minister attempting to give it the flavour of being an improvement on the existing position. It rather suggested that these clauses were an improvement on the existing position because of the institution of a review committee proposed on clause 5. I hope to show in the course of my arguments that, far from being an improvement on the existing position, it is a retrogressive step, firstly, because it widens the scope of preventative detention; secondly, because it widens it in terms of ill-defined language; and, thirdly, because of the danger of the responsibility in that regard being displaced from the shoulders of the hon. the Minister, where it should rest, to a review committee headed by a judicial officer.</p>

<p>Clause one of the Bill widens the ability of the Minister to declare an organization as unlawful, not only as it exists at the present time, where it is in some way related to <span class="col_6431-6432" refersTo="page_0546"/>communism or the achievement of the aims of communism, however widely stated, but also when it engages in activities which endanger the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. I do not think that the hon. the Minister will deny that the terminology &#x201C;endanger the security of the State or the maintenance of public order&#x201D; is very wide indeed. It goes without saying that to exercise this power and to make such a declaration requires a subjective decision by the hon. the Minister. I say &#x201C;the hon. the Minister&#x201D; although one knows the legislation provides for the State President&#x2019;s decision, which in practical terms means a decision of the Cabinet, but in reality I have no doubt that it will be done on the advice and after study of the situation by the hon. the Minister of Justice. That is the way I think the procedure will normally work. We are handling here a subjective decision by the hon. the Minister on a report, presumably from the Security Police. A file will be placed before him, presumably by the Security Branch, and it will be a matter in respect of which the hon. the Minister has no personal knowledge. There is a narrow line and there is a difficult line&#x2014;I am the first to concede it&#x2014;between the maintenance of a free society and allowing freedom to those who wish to destroy a free society. I appreciate fully the difficulty of drawing a line between a free society and all that entails, e.g. a free Press, freedom from arbitrary action and process through the courts&#x2014;and generally I believe that South Africa has a free society&#x2014; and allowing freedom to those who wish to destroy the system we call a free society. I am the first to concede that allowing freedom to potential subversives is endangering freedom itself. A careful and exact appreciation of that difference and distinction is to be found as the hallmark of the approach of the UP throughout the history of this party as far as any matter dealing with the security of the State and of the people is concerned.</p>

<p>This party could never, throughout its long history, be accused of adopting an attitude regarding security matters which has been reckless or ill-considered. [Interjections.] Indeed, this party has sometimes been criticized for adopting a somewhat cautious attitude in matters dealing with the security of the State. I believe there is merit in caution when dealing with matters of this kind, because it is so easy either to fall on the side of authoritarianism, which destroys freedom itself, or on the side of egalitarianism, which could itself destroy freedom.</p>

<p>There is a great difference when it comes to an objectionable organization, operating in the political field, which could be left to the good sense of the electorate or to the people generally to deal with. I believe that Nusas is an example of that. When once the facts relating to that organization were made known, the pressures within the English-speaking world took over and in almost every university in the country it is either no longer operative or there has been a disaffiliation by the universities themselves.</p>

<p>What does Japie say about that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I say at once that in my view there was no reason at all for the executive action that was taken in that regard. The trouble with the definition we have here, which I have read out to the House, is that it encompasses both aspects. There are numbers of attitudes in the political world which, if subjectively approached, could be said to be endangering the security of the State, e.g. attitudes adopted in the policy and philosophy of both the Government and the PRP. In both there are attitudes that could be said to be endangering the security of the State.</p>

<p>Let me deal firstly with the Government. To prevent a settled urban community from owning its own homes and having family life could be said, according to a subjective view, to be endangering the security of the State because it could build up such a tremendous pressure of resentment in due course that it becomes dangerous. I specifically use the word &#x201C;could&#x201D;. In the same way the attitude of majority rule could fall into the same category. I am using these examples to illustrate the point that where one uses language to define a situation as ill-defined and as wide as this, one lays oneself open to endless difficulties. Nobody suggests that either the Government or the PRP should be declared an unlawful organization in terms of this legislation. <span class="col_6433-6434" refersTo="page_0547"/>Nobody suggests that. I have merely used those examples to illustrate that such a decision could be taken in terms of this legislation. Where in the nature of things the decision is a subjective one by a Minister concerned&#x2014;that is the nature of this particular piece of legislation&#x2014;then you want to define the scope within which he is to operate as clearly and as concisely and as narrowly as possible. Indeed, were I the Minister, I would seek to be operating within powers as narrowly and clearly defined as possible, because then I would be immune from criticism. The wider the definition, the more the hon. the Minister subjects himself to criticism.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister will say that this cannot be done. However, I do not accept that. I want to use as an example the type of language which is used to define the terms of reference of the United States Committee on Internal Security in regard to what it should look into. I use this merely as an example of how, if an attempt is made, a situation can be clearly defined even if the nature of it is complex. One finds that the committee on internal security must make investigations into the extent, character, objectives and activities within the United States of organizations or groups whether of foreign or domestic origin, their members, agents and affiliates. This is the language to which I want the hon. the Minister to listen&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which seek to establish or assist in the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship within the United States or to overthrow or alter or assist in the overthrow or alteration of the form of government in the United States or any state thereof by force, violence, treachery, espionage, sabotage, insurrection or any other unlawful means.</block>

<p>That is widely defined and gives one a clearer impression of what that committee is to inquire into than does the language in which the hon. the Minister has to operate within, in terms of this clause. One can also look at the second paragraph of the terms of reference of that internal security committee, and I shall read only the operative part&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which incite or employ acts of force, violence, terrorism or any other unlawful means to obstruct or oppose a lawful authority of the Government of the United States in the execution of any law or policy affecting the internal security of the United States.</block>

<p>I use that to show that it can be done. I am quite sure that with some attempt and some effort a more precise definition of the mischief&#x2014;one accepts that there may be mischief&#x2014;which is sought to be encompassed by this, could adequately be dealt with.</p>

<p>The carrying out of democratic government and the maintenance of a free society in the world of today, particularly in the Africa of today, is a most skilful exercise and requires the most careful use of power in terms of precisely defined authority. It is the easiest thing in the world to govern in terms of blanket authorities which are so widely cast as to enable a Government to obliterate any and all of its opponents. That is the easiest thing in the world, but it is not the skill that is required in a democratic and free society. It is not the sort of government that we are used to and it is not what one expects in South Africa.</p>

<p>I believe that South African democracy is unique in Africa. Virtually nowhere else on this continent is there a system of government which is deliberately designed to enable an opponent of a Government to displace it. That is the parliamentary system under which we work. It is unique on this continent, in so far as I can understand, to have a system which is deliberately designed to enable the opponents of a Government to displace it and to take the seat of power. I believe that we can be proud of the fact that we are preserving this system here on a continent to which it is largely alien. Virtually everywhere else on this continent such a system as we have&#x2014;I repeat, a system where you openly allow your opponents to kick you out of government&#x2014;is looked upon very often either with distaste or with ridicule.</p>

<p>To us it is normal and it is accepted. However, it is a game in which the opponents of government and the Government itself are expected to play according to the rules. Otherwise, both in respect of government and opposition to government, it breaks down. Where opponents of government are prepared to use means&#x2014;I talk of &#x201C;government&#x201D;, not &#x201C;the Government&#x201D;&#x2014;which are not legitimate and which are designed to break down the very framework within which our free society operates, this side of the House will support proper measures that are introduced to control <span class="col_6435-6436" refersTo="page_0548"/>it. Our history in the past has shown that is the case. However, any such controls, viz. controls designed to deal with those who wish to break down the free society in which we operate, require precision in their drafting, they require to be definite, because otherwise they will break down the very framework within which a free society operates. That, in short, is one of our main objections to this Bill.</p>

<p>It is not only the extension of the various aspects of the Act, e.g. the extention of the power to declare an organization to be unlawful, the extension of the power to restrict a person to a particular place, the extension of the power to prohibit publications and the extension of the power to detain a person as a preventive measure without resource to a trial in a court, but there are also other aspects by which this change of definition widens the scope of the principal Act. I think of the powers in terms of section 7 of the principal Act for instance, viz. the powers of search, of investigation and of the invasion of a person&#x2019;s privacy and home if it is suspected that he or the organization to which he belongs is endangering the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. Therefore, the ramifications of what appeared to be simple amendments to enlarge the scope of the principal Act, is much wider if one sees the principal Act itself.</p>

<p>The argument I have dealt with in respect of clause 1, applies equally to clause 2, which deals with publications and the Minister&#x2019;s power to prohibit them, and to clause 3 which deals with persons and the Minister&#x2019;s power to prohibit their attendance at any gathering. There is a further point I wish to make in regard to clause 3. The terminology there is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever the Minister is satisfied that any person engages in activities which are furthering or are calculated to further the achievement of any of the objects of communism or which endanger the security of the State &#x2026; he may by notice under his hand &#x2026;</block>

<p>do certain things in the form of prohibition or restriction. The important words are&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever the Minister is satisfied that any person engages in activities &#x2026; which endanger the security of the State.</block>

<p>Does the hon. the Minister want to tell me that there is no legislation in terms of which offences are created whereby persons, who are engaged&#x2014;that means, doing overt acts or being actively engaged&#x2014;in activities which are a danger to the security of the State, can be charged in court? If that is the case, the hon. gentleman is not doing his job because if there is such activity taking place&#x2014;there may well be in these times&#x2014;the first duty of any Government is to frame offences and apply penalties to enable the police to bring these people before the courts. Clause 3 and the other clauses do not, in themselves, create any offences for which a man can be charged, tried and sent to gaol. Nowhere is there an offence created here. The extension is merely in respect of arbitrary action by the hon. the Minister. People, apart from that action, go unpunished. The offences in terms of the principal Act are to be found in section 11. That is where the offences and the penalties under the Suppression of Communism Act, which we are amending, are set out. Nowhere in the Bill is there an amendment to widen the scope of those offences or to increase the penalties applicable. Nowhere in section 11 of the principal Act has the hon. the Minister introduced offences commensurate with the executive powers he is taking for himself.</p>

<p>If one reads section 11, where the penalties are laid down and a court of law can send a man to gaol for a term of years for activities endangering the security of the State, one sees that the penalties are all tied to the organization of communism&#x2014;all of them. The hon. the Minister told us in his opening address that one of the problems that he was having, was that so many of these people who are engaged in subversive activities, are not communists. To use his own words: They accept that they are &#x201C;ondermyners&#x201D;, that they are subversive. They accept that they are subversive, but they say quite blandly&#x2014;and apparently this is the truth&#x2014;that they are not communists, nor are they attached in any way to the Communist Party. If that is the case, one would not only expect an increase, a widening of the scope of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s executive powers of banning, restriction and so forth, but one would expect him to widen the scope of the offences, the criminal offences and the penalties, so that these people can be tried in a court of law and be properly punished for being engaged in activities which are a danger to the <span class="col_6437-6438" refersTo="page_0549"/>State. That illustrates again one of the fundamental approaches of this side of the House.</p>

<p>The attitude&#x2014;and it is unfortunate that one has to say it&#x2014;of this side of the House is not that subverters should be allowed to go free. The attitude of this side of the House is that subverters should be made subject to the criminal law of South Africa and be punished severely, if that is the appropriate punishment for what they have done. I am astonished&#x2014; and I believe it is a great defect of this Bill&#x2014;that not only, as I have said, is there nothing commensurate by way of amendments to the criminal sanctions of the Act, but also nothing commensurate with the civil sanctions, the executive sanctions, which the hon. the Minister is taking in terms of this Bill. That is another principal objection which we have to this Bill.</p>

<p>Either the hon. the Minister has not created an offence&#x2014;which I believe is the case&#x2014;or, if he says that they are covered by the existing penalty clauses of section 11, he does not require the executive powers which he is taking. Either way the hon. the Minister is caught. I believe he is caught, because he has not investigated the criminal aspects of these matters.</p>

<p>Clause 4 deals with preventive detention. Preventive detention previously existed&#x2014;as the House will remember&#x2014;where persons had been convicted of offences under certain legislation. The way it worked was that where a man had been convicted under the Public Safety Act of 1953, or the Riotous Assemblies Act, or the Acts relating to sabotage and terrorism&#x2014;I am speaking now from memory&#x2014;at the end of serving their sentences, the hon. the Minister could issue a notice which required them to continue under detention after they had served their sentences, having been convicted in a court of law. That was the way it used to work. I think it was known as the Sobukwe Clause. That has been altered and the requirements for a conviction in terms of one or other of the security legislation, as a prerequisite, falls away. It is now merely the ability to detain, or intern, persons who, in the opinion of the hon. the Minister, engage in activities which endanger the security of the State or the maintenance of public order.</p>

<p>This side of the House has always been against preventative detention without trial, except in times of war or national emergency, and then only under safeguards. It is set out with absolute clarity in the minority report to the fourth interim report of the Schlebusch Commission. It is true that in terms of clause 5 of the Bill a new principle is introduced, the principle of a judicial review. In short we therefore have a situation where, in terms of clause 4, the hon. the Minister has considerably widened the field within which he can intern or place in preventative detention. I may say in passing that it is done in a most quaint way by a notice from the hon. the Minister on a person that he may not absent himself &#x201C;from any place or area which is or is within a prison&#x201D;. The quaintness of the language does not however detract from the severity of the reality of the clause. It constitutes a considerable widening of the ability to detain without trial.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, both in his speech and in terms of the Bill, but particularly in his speech, attempts to soften the blow and attempts to make it acceptable to the Official Opposition by the fact that a review committee has been introduced. The review committee, in so far as it goes, is an improvement. We have asked for a review committee on many occasions. However, a review committee introduced in respect of a provision which is so widely defined as to make it unacceptable, is not an adequate sugaring of the pill. The review committee itself&#x2014;I will not go into it in any great detail at this stage as it will be discussed later&#x2014;is to be presided over by a judge or a magistrate, or a retired judge or a retired magistrate. I may say immediately that I should like to see any review committee being presided over by a judge, simply because in the minds of the public a magistrate, rightly or wrongly, is seen as subject to the control of the Minister&#x2019;s department whereas a judge is seen to be independent of that control. In my view, therefore, if one is to have such a committee, then the person presiding over it should be a judge.</p>

<p>The committee is required to report to the Minister if it disagrees with the further detention of an individual, and the hon. the Minister is not bound by the recommendation, but he is required to lay on the Table of the House a report stating the recommendation, the name of the person detained and the fact that the hon. the Minister has disagreed with the recommendation of the review committee. But this is no remedy at all while the powers of <span class="col_6439-6440" refersTo="page_0550"/>detention themselves are virtually unfettered. It indeed has the danger, which I have indicated earlier, for the hon. the Minister, taking a subjective view&#x2014;as he is obliged to do in the circumstances&#x2014;more easily to detain persons whom he reviews and whom he views as subversive, and to leave the final onus to the review committee to go into the matter in great detail and take the final decision with the careful weighing up of the pros and cons which are necessary in a case of this kind. As I said earlier, the responsibility in this regard should be with the hon. the Minister and not with any judicial officer, because that is not his function. Our basic objection is that the clause is far too wide and that there is no statement with any clarity at all, no definitive statement, as to the type of mischief which the hon. the Minister wishes to do away with.</p>

<p>Clause 6 deals with the power to arrest accused persons and with the power of the Attorney-General to prohibit the release on bail of an accused person, which is, in effect, a requirement which enables him to be detained under arrest until the conclusion of his trial. It also makes provision for the power to detain witnesses under a warrant issued by the Attorney-General. These are not new clauses although they are new as they appear in this Bill. They were introduced in substantially the present form in the legislation of 1965. At that time this side of the House supported the ability of the Attorney-General, in certain cases, to object to an accused person being released on bail. That still has our support for the reasons we gave then, namely the apparent preparedness of persons in this type of case, backed by large sums of money from unknown sources&#x2014;as often is the case&#x2014;to estreat their bail and not face their trial. We believe it is legitimate in the limited cases set out in the Schedule, for that power to be retained.</p>

<p>In so far as witnesses are concerned, we are opposed to the clause. The argument seems to be that if witnesses are not put in gaol pending a trial of an accused person in cases of this kind, the witness will be done away with. I am the first to accept that there might well be witnesses, in cases of this kind, who would wish for protection because those against whom they are required to give evidence may be ill-disposed towards them. We all know of the conditions in some of the townships in this regard at the present time. But the danger to the witness does not only exist up to the time of the trial; it also exists after the trial to the same extent. The then Minister of Defence assured the House&#x2014;as I read the debates&#x2014;that they were able to protect these persons after the trial. There were methods of protecting people who had given evidence in such cases. If I have to accept that, then such protection can also be given to witnesses prior to the trial and during the trial. I am referring to those witnesses who do not wish to be taken into custody for their own protection. If there are witnesses who desire protection and who ask for one or other kind of protection, the hon. the Minister will no doubt be able to give it to them. But to give a blanket power of detention to persons who are not accused of anything at all, but who are merely assisting the State by giving evidence, is an undesirable power. In the circumstances of the debate which took place in 1965, this is on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own say so, unnecessary. Consequently we on this side of the House are opposed to that part of the clause.</p>

<p>The rest of the Bill deals merely with incidental matters such as the long and short title. It also deals with an amendment to the Public Safety Act whereby the ceiling of the penalties is done away with. That has our support. For the rest the Bill deals with consequential matters and with the extension of the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 of the Republic to South West Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I have tried to summarize our appreciation of the delicate situation which any democratic Government has in trying to maintain a free society when there are subversive elements at work. I have done that, firstly, because I believe it is necessary to an appreciation of measures of this kind and because it underlines&#x2014;I hope&#x2014;the responsible attitude which this side of the House takes to the Bill and has also taken to measures of this kind.</p>

<p>The best way in which a Bill of this kind can be dealt with, in our view, is for it to be referred to a Select Committee &#x2026; [Interjections.] You know, Mr. Speaker, bearing in mind the arguments of blandishment which came from that side of the House in regard to the value of committees of this kind not so long ago, one wonders how they can have the temerity to adopt the attitude which they are adopting today. Nevertheless, I believe that this is a field in which a Select Committee can <span class="col_6441-6442" refersTo="page_0551"/>properly operate, and because that is so, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the order for the Second Reading of the Promotion of State Security Bill be discharged and the subject of the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report, the Committee to be instructed to bring up a more comprehensive and effective Bill which, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must say I have been caught on the wrong foot a little this afternoon since I now have to reply to the speech made by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, because I expected the hon. member and his party to support the Bill which is now before us. I admit that I have to make an impromptu speech this afternoon, because the speech which I prepared proceeded on the assumption that party would support us today in regard to this legislation. [Interjections.] Sir, I shall try to indicate, during the course of my argument, that it was not such a ridiculous idea after all to assume that side of the House would support us. In the first place I want to say that since that party, through the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, has moved an amendment of this nature, it is strange that they have found that they required the time since this legislation appeared on our tables in this House until 12h40 today to decide what their standpoint on this legislation will be. I state categorically that it is very strange that they took so long, and I should like to hear from hon. members on that side of the House why it took them so long to adopt a standpoint. The hon. member for Houghton adopted her standpoint on this Bill immediately, because she knew what she wanted to do, but those hon. members took a very long time to come to a decision. As secretary of our justice group on this side of the House, I want to say that those hon. members did not even keep their promise to me by telling us how many members on their side were going to participate in this debate or what their attitude in regard to the legislation was going to be. I am still waiting for that side of the House to give this information. I also want to say that, if it were at all within their power to adopt a standpoint, that side of the House could certainly have had the decency to furnish us with a copy of a motion such as the one which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana introduced today. [Interjections.] This is not far-fetched. When a Bill is before the House and any of the parties in this House intend referring a Bill of this kind to a Select Committee, there ought to be the rudimentary decency of at least notifying the hon. the Minister that the party intends to direct such a request. However, we did not get this from that side of the House. I should very much like to take a closer look at the amendment of the hon. member, for at first glance it seems to me as though what the amendment actually amounts to is what was debated during an earlier debate in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants the legislation to become the subject of an inquiry by a Select Committee. I want to ask the hon. member whether, if the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Prime Minister would be prepared to refer the Bill to the proposed Internal Security Commission, the hon. member would be prepared to have the commission take a closer look at the Bill. I am putting this question to the hon. member, and he can simply say whether he thinks it is possible for the Bill to be examined by a commission of this kind. It is very important that the hon. member should tell us this in any case because those hon. members said that they could not support a <span class="col_6443-6444" refersTo="page_0552"/>commission which had anything to do with the investigation of an organization. However, in the amendment moved by the hon. member today he states that the Bill should become the subject of an inquiry by a Select Committee, and that Select Committee should also, possibly by way of a definition, investigate organizations which could be acting subversively against the State. If this is the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude, then surely he is admitting what we said in earlier debates and what the Opposition should spell out to us today. The Opposition must spell out what the hon. member for Mooi River has already said, namely that the Internal Security Commission may also investigate organizations. The fact of the matter is that the commission or a Select Committee may not come forward and make any recommendation in respect of any proposed legislation or in respect of any definition which might mean State security, nor may a commission or a committee of this kind say what an organization means if it is subverting the security of the State, if one does not also investigate the aims of that organization as well and consequently investigate that organization. After all, it is far-fetched to think that we should go to a Select Committee or a commission today to say that security legislation should be prepared while we are unable to indicate what problems we see and what such an organization should look like. Since I do not have the amendment before me, I have to limit myself to a spur of the moment idea or an off the cuff remark on the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. Apart from that I believe we shall be able to have a fruitful debate on the motion of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. I should like to tell the hon. member that I expected far more from him today. I think the hon. member underestimated the intelligence of this hon. House by reading out the Bill clause by clause. We did our homework and it had not been necessary for us to hold a caucus meeting for five hours before we made our decision on the matter public. The hon. member also told the hon. the Minister of Justice that the only powers which the hon. the Minister wishes to have in terms of this legislation, is the extension of his administrative powers, and that he is therefore bluffing the House when he includes a provision in the legislation to establish a review committee.</p>

<p>These hon. members should now tell us in very clear language where we stand with them, with the official Opposition, with regard to any proposed legislation dealing with preventive action, in other words action which prevents the security of the State or law and order in the country from being endangered. How may the hon. member come and tell us that the legislation which is before us today, is not an extension of the provisions of the Suppression of Communism Act and the Terrorism Act? In neither of those Acts is it stated as clearly as in this legislation that what is at issue is the endagering of the security of the State and of law and order. Here we are dealing with an endangering of the security of the State and an endangering of law and order. Surely this is the case.</p>

<p>Hon. members on that side themselves admitted&#x2014;as the hon. the Minister also said&#x2014;that not all subverters are necessarily communists, but that all communists are always subverters in any case. Surely the hon. member knows that this is the position. As early as 1971 that side of the House proposed in regard to the whole matter of preventive detention&#x2014;from the former hon. member for Pinelands on 21 May&#x2014;that we, under the circumstances in which we are now living, should reconsider legislation of this kind, and that it was necessary for the hon. the Minister to pay attention to the fact that where preventive detention has to take place&#x2014;I stress the words &#x201C;has to&#x201D;&#x2014;there should be a review committee. Hon. members can look this up for themselves in Hansard. The hon. the Minister of Justice referred to it. It was in 1971 that we heard that note being sounded by the former hon. member for Pinelands. However, we have since had many debates on this matter.</p>

<p>I am personally very grateful that I asked for the introduction of consolidating legislation with regard to our security legislation during the debate on the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Justice last year. I should like to say a few words more about it later.</p>

<p>What is very interesting, is that the hon. member is in fact addressing two objections to the hon. the Minister now. He maintains that only an extension of his administrative powers is taking place while, in reality, this is not the case. We are not afraid to say on our part that we are extending the powers of security legislation, for we know the circumstances and we are concerned about them. We are in no way afraid to say that we are extending powers <span class="col_6445-6446" refersTo="page_0553"/>which this Parliament is conferring upon the Government of this country. We are not afraid to say this. We shall have to extend them even further in future, for the sake of South Africa. I state categorically that we are extending the powers of the Government and we are not in the least ashamed of saying this to the world. If we say, as this official Opposition and the hon. members of the PRP do, that we are part of Africa, and we know that our position in the West may only be secured to the extent to which we are able to maintain and strengthen our position in Africa, we shall have to extend our rights and powers. To be able to maintain itself and to be able to maintain its entire machinery of Government, Africa has had to extend its powers and privileges. If Africa then has specific African problems and we have to reach the West through Africa, why are we not also entitled to deal with our specific African problems through the extension of our powers?</p>

<p>However, the hon. member went further. He accused the hon. the Minister of not having put enough sugar coating on the lollipop&#x2014;the review committee. However, it is in fact those hon. members&#x2014;and it is no longer even a debating point, because the hon. member admitted it here this afternoon&#x2014;who admitted in the so-called minority report to the fourth interim report that they were interested in such a review committee consisting of judges. However, I want to go even further. In that debate which took place on this report, from my bench&#x2014;the very last back bench at that time&#x2014;I, personally put the standpoint that a case could be made out within Nationalist Party thinking and policy for review work in respect of administrative action of this kind. The hon. member for Green Point then rose to his feet in this House and complimented me.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I could give the hon. member the precise references in Hansard.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that he hoped the Government would pay attention to the standpoint which we adopted that day. Today we now have that position. However, it is also true that it extends much further today than the hon. members are trying to imply is the case. We should see what the hon. members are implying. They are now trying to suggest that we have done nothing about the review committee to establish what they in fact had in mind. They maintain that we simply coated the matter with a little sugar. Let us have a look at the facts of the matter. I want to go back to the minority report which was the alpha and the omega by which that party stood and fell, and fell further than they thought they would fall. In fact they fell completely past Durban North. However, they still think the reason for their fall was the fact that they adopted a constructive attitude. The whole problem is that if the UP had incorporated preventive measures in their standpoints at an earlier stage, there would not have been a party like the PRP in the House today. In the minority report the hon. commissioners on that side went far out of their way to explain certain attitudes. I am now quoting from the Fourth Interim Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Organizations, paragraph 20.5.7.2., page 518&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Relationships between individuals are regulated by a code of conduct in both the common and statutory laws of the country which regulate the conduct of the individual and provide sanctions by way of penalties where one individual violates the personal and property rights of another.</block>

<p>Paragraph 20.5.7.3. reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Relationships between the individual and the State are more complex and require attention to be given specifically to&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) those acts of individuals which constitute common law and/or statutory crimes;</li>

<li>(b) those acts of groups of individuals, either internally or externally, which violate the maintenance of law and order;</li>

<li>(c) those acts of groups or individuals which subvert the authority of the State in an endeavour to achieve change through violence in complete disregard for the normal constitutional processes in a democracy.</li>

</ol>

<p>Furthermore the commissioners stated in paragraph 20.5. 7.7.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6447-6448" refersTo="page_0554"/>Preventive action to forestall contemplated acts not constituting an attempt to commit an offence, but which threaten the security of the State or to subvert the authority of the State is the responsibility of the Government acting through the Executive Cabinet.</block>

<p>They then furnished a whole series of reservations to which the hon. member also referred. The paragraph continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To this end the State&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) maintains an adequate Defence Force;</li>

<li>(b) maintains an intelligence service charged with the responsibility of keeping the Executive informed of individual or collective actions or preparation for overt action directed against law and order or to subvert the authority of the State;</li>

<li>(c) takes such Executive action as is authorized by Parliament.</li>

</ol>

<p>Further on in the report the commissioners furnish an explanation and in paragraph 20.5.7.9. stated, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To ensure that there is no injustice done to the person or persons concerned, it is necessary to consider what steps should be taken to evaluate such evidence, independently of the security agencies, for the benefit of the Minister and to provide for an appropriate Tribunal for review of Executive action.</block>

<p>Today the hon. member for Umhlatuzana maintains that he is not completely satisfied that, although they requested in the past that the executive action of the Minister should be reviewed by a review committee, we had gone far enough. In fact he went so far as to say that the Minister is now, by means of the review committee which is being created by the Minister, trying to transfer his authority to the review committee. The hon. member says that anything of this kind is unfair to the review committee.</p>

<p>I should like to know what the hon. members are doing; what do they really want to tell us today? We want to establish this review committee precisely because we realize how drastic a step such as preventive detention is. Because we realize this and because we know that the vast majority of people who support that party opposite, share this standpoint with us, we know that we are acting correctly when we establish a review committee by means of this Bill. We cannot understand how the hon. members opposite can adopt the standpoint they are now adopting, viz. that this Bill should be the subject of the investigation of a Select Committee. Surely those hon. members literally served for years on that commission. The commissioners on that side of the House did that work. I do not believe that the UP can walk away unscathed with this standpoint of theirs that, as they are trying to imply, they are really in earnest about co-operating with us on this side of the House in matters affecting the security of South Africa. The hon. members of the Opposition and other hon. members intimated that they were in complete agreement with us. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana said it again today. However, we come to the point every time where we on this side have to say that party opposite is a real &#x201C;yes, but&#x201D; party. They always say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; when they can ride the wave with us which can give them popularity in South Africa, but as soon as we have to do things in the interests of South Africa which are really necessary and which are sometimes unpopular, then they say &#x201C;but&#x201D;. Then they can no longer say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. What I should like to see is that we take a close look at the motion of the hon. member viz. to refer this matter to a Select Committee. Without committing the hon. the Minister, I want to say that I think it is absolute nonsense to come to this House today and ask that a Bill such as this should be referred to a Select Committee.</p>

<p>I want to make the hon. member a present of one thing. I have already mentioned that I personally requested a Bill of this kind. I want to make the hon. member a present of it that I should like to see the commission which the hon. the Prime Minister is to appoint, receiving terms of reference to investigate all the security legislation of South Africa. The hon. members opposite, and especially the hon. members of the PRP, should not derive so much pleasure from the matter, because I think we have not gone far enough with the Bill, which is before the House today. When we <span class="col_6449-6450" refersTo="page_0555"/>consider all the things which the Schlebusch Commission dredged up and which have proliferated, I believe it may perhaps become necessary for us, in our security legislation, to put the emphasis not so much on the political aspects of State security only but that we will probably have to give serious attention to economic aspects for example. Hon. members on this side of the House will discuss this further at a later stage in the debate. I am simply mentioning it in passing. Furthermore I want to say that it will even be necessary for us, in this country where I am standing before you today as a professing Christian&#x2014;I assume the vast majority of the members in this House are professing Christians&#x2014;also to consider and develop a definition of what the Christian security of South Africa consists of or, stated negatively, what the un-Christian insecurity of South Africa is.</p>

<p>The normal procedure in this House is that if one votes against the Second Reading of a Bill, one votes against the principle of the Bill. This is what I am talking about. The UP voted for the Second Reading of the Bill containing the 90-day clause. Today they are taking objection to the extention of the Sobukwe clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>We voted against the Sobukwe clause during the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not interested in what they did at Committee Stage. The principle of a Bill is decided on at the Second Reading, and they voted for preventive detention in 1963, when they supported 90-day detention and the Sobukwe clause, both of which were in that Bill. Two years later they voted against the 180-day Bill. Then, in 1967, they voted in principle, at Second Reading, for the Terrorism Act, which embodies detention without trial. So, as I say, now they are on and now they are off. One could have run a very successful betting shop in trying to decide what attitude the UP is going to take to Bills of this nature. I shall not go any further, save to say that they were for the Schlebusch Commission and against Piscom. But let us leave it at that.</p>

<p>This Bill, as far as I am concerned, is merely another Bill in the series of self-generating measures which the NP Government has introduced in this House since it came with the original Suppression of Communism Act of 1950. That Act has since been amended more than 80 times, and each time the hon. the Minister has taken unto himself&#x2014;or his predecessors have&#x2014;ever greater arbitrary powers. Each time, I might say, the reason given is much the same. If it is not well-poisoners, it is saboteurs. If it is not saboteurs, it is communists. If it is not communists, it is terrorists, but &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; always greater and greater powers are taken. We have had one measure after the other, e.g. the Unlawful Organizations law which banned the ANC and the PAC, the Sabotage Act and the 90-day law. We have also had the 180-day law, the Terrorism Act and so on. I might say that, together with these measures, we have also had a large number of measures over the years which have limited the right of association, curtailed the right of processions and gatherings to be held and stifled protest. We have also had BOSS, Schlebusch and Piscom. Slowly, but surely, South Africa has acquired the trappings&#x2014;not all, but certainly some of the trappings&#x2014;of a police state. We have not yet all the trappings, but the process goes on slowly, but surely. As the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke has told us, the process will surely continue to go on. As I have said, these measures have sometimes been supported by the Official Opposition.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at the Bill we are considering today. In the first place it replaces the title of the Suppression of Communism Act by a much more up-to-date and trendy sort of title. It is now called the &#x201C;Promotion of State Security Bill&#x201D; or the &#x201C;SS Bill&#x201D;, as the Press happens to have called it. It widens the class of person who can be subjected to arbitrary treatment by the hon. the Minister of Justice. And, of course, it is not only persons, but also organizations about which the hon. the Minister has taken far wider powers. He can now declare them unlawful and restrict and place under house arrest all persons who now fall within a much wider category, viz. those people whom the hon. the Minister, not the courts, is satisfied take part in activities which endanger the security of the State or the maintenance of public order.</p>

<p>By the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own admission, this quite clearly means that the Suppression of Communism Act has indeed been used&#x2014; this is an accusation I have frequently made in the House and for which I have always been jeered at&#x2014;against people who were never communists, not even within the very broad definition of the Act. The hon. the Minister now comes along and scraps the title of the Suppression of Communism Act and inserts a far wider description of the type of person or organization he wishes to control. I maintain that this Bill is aimed not only at communists and at people plotting subversion, but can in fact be aimed also at people who are working for peaceful, non-violent change in South Africa, because the Bill contains no definition whatsoever as to what constitutes the endangering <span class="col_6453-6454" refersTo="page_0557"/>of the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. It is what the Minister is satisfied will do those things that will count. I might say that some of the examples we have heard in the House&#x2014;one was given only the other day by the hon. the Minister of Information when he referred to a cartoon and others which the hon. the Minister of Justice has given&#x2014;show how widely he intends interpreting the clauses of the Bill. He has mentioned students, and students are always useful scapegoats, students who are activists on campuses. He also mentioned people working in the labour field. I know that there are people working for peaceful change in the labour field and that they have already received the very intense attention of the Special Branch. I am talking of people who are, for instance, working to try to assist Black people in the formation of trade unions and to teach them what their rights are as far as the Wage Board and other such bodies are concerned. These people have already enjoyed the attention of the Security Branch. I believe that this is very ominous indeed.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister not only widens the category of people against whom he can act; he very significantly broadens also the actions he can take against them. He can now not only restrict them or prohibit them from attending meetings or have them placed under house arrest; he can also have them interned without trial. The hon. the Minister said that this Bill was not intended for wide-scale internment. He said that it was not suitable for large-scale internment. Is it, however, suitable for small-scale internment? He is the person who used this kind of term. In simple terms, stripped of legal verbiage, that is exactly what clause 4 means. It means that we are going to have internment camps in South Africa. That is exactly what clause 4 enables the Minister to do, viz. to shut people up, imprison whom he likes in any area defined as a prison. This might well be an internment camp. Unlike the Sobukwe-clause, which was, in all conscience, bad enough&#x2014;people then had to be in gaol before they could be kept in prison after the expiration of the sentence imposed on them by the courts of law&#x2014;people now no longer even have to be found guilty of an offence under the particular schedule. One could, of course, say that this could happen in South Africa anyway under the Terrorism Act, but the hon. the Minister, or in any case the police, could keep people indefinitely in solitary confinement without a trial.</p>

<p>I believe that the provisions of clause 4 of this SS Bill in a subtle way go even further than section 6 of the Terrorism Act. Although under the Terrorism Act a person can be held by the police for an indefinite period in solitary confinement for purposes of interrogation if suspected of being a terrorist or of having information relating to terrorists, or of offences under the Terrorism Act, the inference is that once the interrogation is over, the person would ultimately be charged or released. That is how I have always understood the Terrorism Act was implemented. It is true that the police can, and indeed have, held people indefinitely. There are many people who are still being held under the Terrorism Act. They have been held by the police for months. But surely the inference is that since they are being held for purposes of interrogation, to see whether they are terrorists or whether they know anything about terrorist activity, that as soon as the interrogation has been concluded to the satisfaction of the police, they will either be charged or released. That is not the case under clause 4 of this Bill, because the possibility of a trial is irrelevant. The hon. the Minister does not contemplate a trial in this instance. The pressure to charge or release has been removed in this instance and I think it is an appalling prospect, because it means that there can be unending internment in either a prison or a camp until the hon. the Minister is satisfied, by some purely subjective decision or test of his own, that the person is no longer going to engage in activities endangering the State or public order.</p>

<p>This hon. Minister has been very modest and humble when giving interviews over the media about using the powers which he will acquire under clause 4 of this Bill. He wants them&#x2014;a paraphrase of course&#x2014;&#x201C;just in case&#x201D;. I have heard similar undertakings from other hon. Ministers acquiring unnatural powers in this House. I was not in the House when some of them were made, but I certainly know that when the then hon. Minister of Justice, Mr. Swart, introduced the Public Safety Bill, and the &#x201C;Whipping Bill&#x201D; of 1953, he said:</p>

<block name="quote">It is my fervent wish and also the fervent wish of the Government that it may never be necessary to apply this measure.</block>

<p><span class="col_6455-6456" refersTo="page_0558"/>When the house arrest clause was introduced in 1962&#x2014;I certainly was in the House then&#x2014;the then Minister said that it would be used most carefully and only after warnings had been given to the persons concerned. Yet I know of people who have been placed under house arrest without warning. A more recent example of ministerial assurance that their powers would only be used in a limited way&#x2014;many members in the House will remember this&#x2014;was the assurance given not by the then Minister of Justice, but by the then Minister of Police when the Terrorism Act was introduced. He assured the House that it would only be used against terrorists in the bush. Well, I do not need to remind the House that the Terrorism Act has been most widely used by the Police and not only against terrorists in the bush. It is true that clause 4 of this Bill has to be reproclaimed each year by the State President. When translated into practical terms, this means the Cabinet, more particularly the hon. the Minister of Justice. The Sobukwe clause had to be re-enacted year after year by this Parliament&#x2014;not by the State President or the Cabinet, but by this Parliament. Even that was no deterrent. It was re-enacted six times, to my knowledge, and Sobukwe was kept in gaol for six solid years after the three-year sentence, imposed on him by the courts of law for defying the pass laws, had expired. The re-enactment of the 90-day law also had to be done by this Parliament, and that was no deterrent either, because until that law was suspended&#x2014;which was round about 1965&#x2014;there was no difficulty in re-enacting it. Therefore there is going to be no difficulty either in reproclaiming clause 4 of this SS Bill year after year by the State President. It is also true, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana mentioned, that clause 4 &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Why should I be ashamed of myself? I did not introduce this Bill. The hon. member should be ashamed of himself. Clause 4 of this Bill is subject to review, in terms of one of the paragraphs contained in that particular clause, if the State President thinks fit to appoint such a review committee. I do not intend to go into the question of the review committee in any detail. One of my colleagues in these benches will do so at a later stage. I shall simply confine myself to saying that it is a colossal bluff. It is bogus and it is not worth the paper it is written on. Other members on these benches will deal with further objectionable clauses, such as the no bail provision, the provision dealing with the 180-day detention of witnesses, and the provision extending the Riotous Assemblies Act to South West Africa.</p>

<p>I simply sum up this measure, then, as being part of the Government&#x2019;s policy of taking emergency powers without declaring a state of emergency. That is what is at the back of all of this. The Minister wants to have the powers, but he does not want to have the repercussions of a state of emergency, and that can only happen in a country which has no respect for democratic principles. I want to say that I at one stage, in my innocence, actually believed that with the Terrorism Act we had reached the end of the Government&#x2019;s long list of laws which destroy the accepted principles of the rule of law, and that we had satisfied the Government&#x2019;s greedy lust for arbitrary powers that exclude the courts of law. Of course, I was wrong. I had forgotten that the more one eats, the more one wants to eat. I had forgotten that the more power one has, the more power one wants to have.</p>

<p>Sadly enough, as I have observed before in this House, the South African electorate has become punch-drunk as measure after measure of this nature has found its way on to the Statute Book and as assault after assault has been levelled on our civil liberty. I believe that the threshold of tolerance of the South African electorate has risen with each measure, and we have now reached the unhappy state where, basically, in terms of this law the freedom of every individual in South Africa is dependent on the opinion of the Minister of Justice. That is what it has come to. <i>Habeas corpus,</i> as far as security legislation is concerned, is as dead as the dodo in South Africa. There was a time, only 15 years ago, when our Department of Information proudly put out 10 000 copies of a pamphlet in which it proclaimed that in South Africa no person could be imprisoned or detained without trial. There was a time in South Africa, further back in our history, when members belonging to the party opposite objected to detention without trial in internment camps during a declared state of war. Many passionate speeches were made from the benches occupied by the National Party in <span class="col_6457-6458" refersTo="page_0559"/>those days by men like Dr. Malan, Mr. Blackie Swart and others, against depriving a man of his freedom without due trial. That is not the case any more, Sir, alas; not today. And yet South Africa is not only not in a declared state of war; she is not only not in a declared state of emergency. She is in a peaceful and stable position, as we have heard Ministers announce in this House. [Interjections.] Earlier this session we had members on the Government benches exhorting us as good South Africans to project a favourable image of South Africa when we go overseas. I want to know how on earth, when one goes abroad and one pronounces that South Africa is in a peaceful state and that there is no crisis in South Africa, one can justify a law of this kind being passed in South Africa today. Israel is in a state of perpetual difficulty with terrorists. She is in a state of declared war, and undeclared war, very often, but she does not have a law like this. England is menaced by IRA terrorists. Over 1 000 people have lost their lives and 10 000 people have been injured, but she does not have a law like this.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<p>There is preventive detention.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is preventive detention, in terms of the British Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary) Act, but it is temporary indeed. Nobody can be held for longer than seven days, and the Act has to be re-enacted every six months by the British Parliament. There is none of the secrecy that is attached to the laws which we pass in this House. There is access to legal advice and, indeed, the court may examine the implementation of that law. It is therefore very different indeed from the Act which we already have and the law which we are discussing today. The hon. the Minister did not tell us about this, but quoted very curious examples of countries that have used preventive detention. He told us that Indonesia used these measures in 1968 and that Malaysia used it in 1960. He also told us about Pakistan, Singapore, India and Guyana. However, none of these countries happens to be a Western democracy as we purport to be. [Interjections.] Of course he did mention Canada in passing, but Canada had very temporary preventive detention laws and these were immediately removed as soon as the emergency was over, a declared emergency as it was in this case. The example that was most relevant of course, the hon. the Minister did not give us, i.e. the example of communist Russia and the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Those countries do have preventive detention as anyone who has read the brilliant books of Solzhenitsyn will know. Those countries have it&#x2014;communist Russia and the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Nazi Germany had preventive detention as well. In those countries people disappeared and were not seen again.</p>

<p>I want to say how ironic it is that 26 years after the first far-reaching measure to stamp out communism was introduced by this Government, Parliament is still legislating to achieve that object. We have had law after law after law passed in this House for the main purpose of stamping out communism, but that course of action has failed. One would have thought that the lesson was clear for all to read.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has so many powers that he can act against any front he likes and put it out of action. He could have done it even without this Bill: he could have banned, house-arrested and put people away. He could have done anything he liked. These measures are, however, still apparently not sufficient. And the message from that is clear, namely that harsh laws like this are not the answer. If you have communists, if you have subversives and if you have people who preach violence, the courts can deal with these persons and the courts should deal with them. We on these benches are in favour of people suspected of preaching or practising violence, revolution or subversion being brought before a court of law and if found guilty they must be punished and prevented from acting further. We do not believe, however, in giving powers to ban people and organizations to that hon. the Minister or to any hon. Minister. Such powers belong with the courts. If you want to stamp out communism the lesson is clear: It cannot be stamped out by coming back to this House year in and year out, with a dreary monotony, introducing laws that take more and more arbitrary powers. The lesson is that you have to look to the underlying grievances <span class="col_6459-6460" refersTo="page_0560"/>that promote subversion and communism and violence in this country and you have to do away with these grievances. They have to be put right. That is the only way to give lasting security to this country.</p>

<p>For these reasons and because we do not believe that this is the way to fight subversion and to ensure security in this country, I wish to move as a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think that this afternoon we have once again had one of the reasons for the need to have a Bill like this one before the House. It is people like the hon. member for Houghton who make it necessary for us in South Africa to take steps like these to promote the security of the State. The speech she made here this afternoon, is an incitement for many people in South Africa to threaten that security further. That is why this Bill is necessary today. We have often heard this speech of hers in the past. Among other things, the hon. member referred here to &#x201C;internment camps&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I do not mean that they did so on purpose, but that it could perhaps incite other people who interpreted the speeches wrongly. [Interjections.] This afternoon the hon. member spoke here about &#x201C;internment camps&#x201D;. These are words which are regarded with horror throughout the world. This is one of the reasons why many people have seized upon these words of hers and think that South Africa has now become a police state.</p>

<p>It is very close.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#herman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This can also incite people to commit crimes here. The worst of all, however, is the fact that the hon. member called this Bill the &#x201C;SS Bill&#x201D;. This Bill is not a &#x201C;State Security Bill&#x201D;. The Bill&#x2019;s title is clearly the &#x201C;Promotion of State Security Bill&#x201D;. The term &#x201C;SS Bill&#x201D; is an incorrect connotation which she is attaching to this legislation, a legislation which we in South Africa need in order to protect people like her, her party and her party supporters in South Africa. I do not want to dwell much longer on what the hon. member said. Of course, she came along with her usual story here, referring to &#x201C;unnatural powers&#x201D; vested in the hon. the Minister, as if the freedom of people is being threatened in South Africa. She spoke about the freedom of every individual in South Africa which was supposedly going to be assailed again by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I just want to deal briefly with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. We have not yet had an opportunity to study this amendment, but I notice that the hon. member asks that a Select Committee go into new offences of and punishments for people who threaten the security of the State. However, it is very clear that the hon. member, and perhaps other hon. members on his side of the House, too, have not studied this Bill thoroughly. If they had studied it thoroughly and done a little research, they would have realized very clearly that it would not help merely to lay down further punishments. We are living in a time of change. New methods and philosophies to threaten the safety of the State are always coming to the fore, and it is pointless, therefore, merely to apply the old methods. We must provide for the new methods which increase from day to day and curtail these. He also spoke of the freedom of individuals. It seems to me that those hon. members want to return to the old point of discussion which we have had over and over in this House, namely the rule of law. It seems to me as if they feel that we are threatening the freedom of people in South Africa, the freedom to go to the courts and stand trial there. This is anything but the truth.</p>

<p>I see the hon. member for Umhlatuzana also mentions the fact that the Bill &#x201C;provides for the protection of witnesses&#x201D;. However, this Bill is not only there for the protection of witnesses who need protection. Many of those witnesses are themselves a danger to the State. This is why it will also be necessary to restrict them from time to time and while their cases are being concluded or further inquiries made. <span class="col_6461-6462" refersTo="page_0561"/>I think we can reject the amendment of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana with contempt. I agree with the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke that the hon. the Minister will not even pay attention to the amendment in terms of which it is moved that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee.</p>

<p>Both hon. members on that side who spoke before me, have lost sight of the fact that an Act which was necessary in 1950, the Suppression of Communism Act, perhaps no longer complies with today&#x2019;s requirements. That Act was placed on the Statute Book 26 years ago. Have hon. members forgotten that we have had certain episodes on our borders? Have they forgotten about Angola and Mozambique? Are they unaware that there are problems at the moment in Rhodesia? Do they not realize that the problems which are being experienced in Rhodesia are moving closer to South Africa? Have they lost sight of the ideology of communism? Do they know nothing about the African ideology? Have they lost sight completely of terrorism and its consequences for South Africa? I think hon. members must begin to realize very quickly that every Government&#x2019;s greatest responsibility is the creation and maintenance of order and security within its country. Our security is being threatened from various directions. We know that communism is threatening our security. Direct and indirect terrorism is just such a threat. It has already been mentioned that indirect terrorism is manifesting itself in the fact that our economy and religion are being threatened. Permissiveness, and everything which accompanies it, are also forms of indirect terrorism. We are also being threatened by means of sabotage and calls to violence and rebellion. There is also treason and sedition. All these factors which I have quoted have nothing to do with armed conflict from across our borders. This afternoon we are not even talking about armed conflict, because this falls within the province of another department. I say it is every government&#x2019;s duty to combat the threats we are experiencing in the form of the factors I have mentioned.</p>

<p>We often speak of the infrastructure of a country having to be expanded. However, do we realize that the most important form of infrastructure which can be expanded in the country is specifically the security and progress of the people of that country. I think that in order to ensure State security, attention must be paid to two aspects. On the one hand there is the urge of communism to dominate the world and with that goal in mind, agents are sent even to our country in order to carry on subversive activities. State security must be protected against such actions. On the other hand, there are also internal factions which threaten State security. This fact must also be taken into account.</p>

<p>It is a fact that no nation wants to be dominated by another nation. In South Africa there are approximately 25 million people of different culture, language, religion, philosophy, etc. If we had to lump all these people together into one group, it would cause friction and discord which would result in the security of the State being threatened. To lump them together would therefore simply not work. We must guard against the security of the State being threatened by something like this. In is true, nevertheless, that many people want everyone to be lumped together in spite of the fact that anything of the kind would have disastrous consequences for us in South Africa.</p>

<p>During a debate which we conducted in this House in February this year, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that they were also in favour of the promotion of State security. However, he indicated that they wanted to utilize other methods in order to achieve this. By means of the Bill which is now before the House, we once again afforded hon. members of the UP the opportunity to prove their <i>bona fides,</i> I must say that they failed hopelessly to prove their <i>bona fides</i> towards South Africa. In the course of his speech, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana pointed out a few times that they wanted to move slowly. They always want to adopt an attitude of caution, but what has that attitude of caution done for them over the past 27 years? It has meant that only a few of them are able to sit here. It also gave them Durban North. This caution of theirs has cost them their constituencies. They continue to cling to the old policy of Gen. Smuts: &#x201C;Let things develop.&#x201D; Well, &#x201C;things&#x201D; have developed for them, and to such an extent that they are where they are today. The time has come for them, too, to look to the interests of South Africa, and not only to the interests of their own party. This Bill includes precautionary measures. The powers contained in this Bill will be exercised absolutely judiciously. The hon. the <span class="col_6463-6464" refersTo="page_0562"/>Minister himself said that he would keep these measures on ice and only use them when necessary.</p>

<p>One should ask the Opposition whether Angola and similar episodes have not yet convinced them that communist imperialism is gathering force throughout the world. Do they agree that apart from the threats on our borders, there are also internal threats? Do they agree with this or not? Do they agree that these threats can only be combated by ordinary measures, or are extraordinary measures perhaps also necessary to combat these threats? Are they aware of the communist methods? It does not seem to me as if they always are. They are in a centuries old sleep and the sooner they wake up, the better it will be for them. Leaders of the Communist Party, Stalin, <i>inter alia,</i> said that they would even call on Satan to further their goals.</p>

<p>This Bill also aims at helping the Government to prevent preparations for an internal attack. I am referring to the onslaught of individuals and groups who work underground, behind fronts which sometimes sound and look very innocent. These enemies of South Africa hide behind front organizations and wait for the opportunity to instigate revolution here. They work outward from within in order to realize their aims here in South Africa, bur particularly to bring about the collapse of law and order in South Africa. By their stubborn behaviour, the non-members of the UP and the PRP are strengthening those subversive front organizations in South Africa.</p>

<p>This Bill is a serious one. On 26 February this year the hon. the Prime Minister invited the Official Opposition for the umpteenth time to co-operate in respect of State security. To emphasize the seriousness of the matter, the hon. the Prime Minister said that the safety of South Africa was more important than his own position. This Bill once again emphasizes the seriousness of the situation. If we look at the report of the Department of Justice on internal security, we shall realize that we are faced with a serious position and steps to counteract the threats must be considered. One cannot wait until the deed has been done because then it is too late, and when it is too late, everything is irrevocably past. Then the UP and the PRP will have to bear the responsiblity for what they have done to South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to ask both Opposition parties whether they have forgotten about the terrorism which has been experienced in South Africa in the past. Have they forgotten about the bloodshed there has been? Have they forgotten about the ANC and the PAC with Sobukwe at the head? He seceded from the ANC precisely because, according to him, there were too many white communists in the ANC and he wanted to make it more of a Black militant movement. Have they forgotten about Poqo, the militant wing of the PAC? Have they forgotten about Umkontho We Sizwe, the militant wing of the ANC? Have they forgotten about the Paarl riots? the hon. member for Houghton need not look askance at me, because she even defended this by saying that the people were dissatisfied with the hostel facilities which were established for them there. Thirty-four people were killed in those riots. Have hon. members forgotten about all these things? The hon. member says we are living in a country of security. Where is the security and the peace of the country if this kind of thing is experienced? Have they forgotten about the horrible murders at Bashee, in the Transkei? Have they forgotten about the Rivonia episode? Mr. Speaker, it is time for these people to call these things to mind once again. Have they forgotten about John Harris, and the station bomb episode in Johannesburg. Have they forgotten about the innocent child who was so horribly mutilated there?</p>

<p>Have they also forgotten about the student processions in Johannesburg, processions by people who tried to undermine the security of the State? Have they also forgotten about the disturbance close to here, in front of St. George&#x2019;s Cathedral? Do they not think for a moment of all the non-Whites who are smuggled out of the country to undergo training in communist countries with the aim of committing terrorism in South Africa? Do people not think of these things any more? Do they approve of it? I should very much like to hear what they have to say, and that includes the hon. member for Rondebosch who is looking askance at me. [Interjections.] Let him tell us whether he approves of it. Apparently he has forgotten about these things. At that time he was not yet a member of this House. Apparently he was also too young when these things happened, <span class="col_6465-6466" refersTo="page_0563"/>but he can just as well go and do a little research to refresh his memory.</p>

<p>The security of the State can be threatened in various ways, as the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke said. It can take place in the economic sphere, as well as in the cultural sphere. Just consider the present-day spirit of permissiveness. The security of the State can be threatened in the political and religious spheres. Therefore preventive measures must be taken in time. I should like to repeat what I said in a previous debate. When we visited Mozambique two years ago, the leaders of that country told us that the aims of communism were to destroy the existing culture in Southern Africa. They are starting in Mozambique, Rhodesia and Angola, and when they have achieved their aims there, they will concentrate on South Africa. Acts of terrorism are committed in each of the mentioned areas.</p>

<p>Whenever I look at the hon. member for Houghton, the hon. member for Sea Point and the hon. member for Yeoville, I automatically think of the three famous monkeys who close their ears, their eyes and their mouths. They do not want to see these things. It simply passes them by. The hon. member for Yeoville is unfortunately not present now. In a debate in this House, on 25 February of this year, he said (Hansard, 1976, col. 1946)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let me analyse what I believe are the four principles that need to be considered in respect of this piece of legislation. The first is: Is there at present a threat to internal security?</block>

<p>According to him people are striving to attain equal wealth, equal opportunities, equal political aspirations. This is correct. There is nothing wrong with this. The people are striving for this; we grant them that. We, too, are bringing these things about for them. There are several laws on our Statute Book by means of which the aspirations of these people are being catered for. If the hon. member would only look up the debate on the Bantu Administration Vote which was held during the Committee Stage of the Appropriation Bill in this House, he would not what development has been effected there, due specifically to the stimulus which has been created to satisfy the aspirations of those people. However, the hon. member goes on to say (col. 1946)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many who attempt to do this &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the people who try and undermine the security of the State&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; may well be motivated by objectives entirely unconnected with the aspirations of the people they purport to be assisting.</block>

<p>This is quite correct. We grant him this. However, he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that there are security risks, but also that such risks cannot be met on the long term only by seeking to neutralize or remove so-called agitators. Something with a far greater depth of purpose needs to be done.</block>

<p>The hon. member said something similar this afternoon. However, they are guilty of a serious error of reasoning when they fail to say what the &#x201C;something bigger&#x201D; that we have to do is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville said that we maintained that the threats emanated from idealistic students or inept philosophers. However, it does not emanate from them only. It does indeed emanate from them, too, but the threats also emanate from other sources. These are the threats which we must deal with. He is still philosophizing about something very much more serious and deadly. Unfortunately he still sees it at a distance. He is unable to see it next to us here. He does not see that it has already come close to us.</p>

<p>However, it is not only the PRP that sometimes acts in an un-South African way. We often see this in our daily papers, too. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of last Sunday I read that they called the Bill &#x201C;a Draconian Bill&#x201D;. They say the following about the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The new one is chillingly more direct &#x2026;</block>

<p>They use the word &#x201C;chillingly&#x201D;, in other words, they consider it to be a deterrent. The report goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but since the Suppression of Communism Act as well as its ugly sister, the Terrorism Act&#x2026;</block>

<p>They call it the &#x201C;ugly sister&#x201D;. They continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6467-6468" refersTo="page_0564"/>The Bill is another serious and unnecessary assault on what remains of the rule of law in South Africa.</block>

<p>This is really a disgrace. Before my time has expired, I should like to say a few words about the rule of law. The rule of law about which people make such a fuss and about which more will be said later in the debate, is actually a doctrine which dates from the previous century. It was the British philosophers and lawyers&#x2014;Prof. Dicey had a great deal to do with it&#x2014;who formulated the rule of law. When it was formulated during the previous century, however, the world was a completely different place. The position at that time was completely different to what it is now. The British Empire was a mighty world power. The British form of government was practically unassailable. Their system was one of the best one could find at that time. At that time there was no terrorism or communism as we know it today. There were no hijacks, no double standards, boycotts or permissive societies. The world was a completely different place and the rule of law worked 100&#x0025; at that time. This was very fine and it was essential at that time. With the coming of the 20th century, however, the position changed. Times changed. New requirements arose, and we had to adapt ourselves to them. Doctrines like communism, humanism and liberalism began to take over the world and threaten democracy. The continued existence of nations and peoples, of communal interests, had to take precedence over individual interests. This started to become urgently necessary. The communist ideology and the rule of law do not go hand in hand. On the contrary. They are sworn enemies. Drastic action had to be taken against communism&#x2019;s new methods, as well as against their agents and organizations. No love was lost between communism and democracy. Then the time came for us to choose our weapons and take steps in order to combat these things.</p>

<p>However, a Government has a responsibility and a duty towards its citizens. The PRP must give us one case where the Government abused the powers it has taken upon itself. The hon. member for Houghton referred scornfully to other places in the world which had the same type of legislation, but which do not take such stringent action. I want to refer her to a book <i>South Africa and the Rule of Law.</i> On page 39 she will find that the USA&#x2014;she asked that we mention a Western country&#x2014;has had an Internal Security Act since 1950 which is specifically aimed at combating these things and which, according to her, would violate the rule of law. Apart from that, India also has legislation, the Preventive Detention Bill of 1950, in terms of which they adopt the strong standpoint that we sometimes shall have to deviate from the rule of law. They maintain that it cannot be applied in all cases, especially not in these times. Another Western country, namely Northern Ireland, also has its own form of security legislation which is at present being piloted through.</p>

<p>It is recognized policy that, in times when it is necessary, extraordinary measures are not only justified, but essential. The continued existence of any nation demands this. South Africa&#x2019;s security measures are insignificant compared with what exists in other countries at the moment. We must ask ourselves what the PRP envisages by giving up with all resistance to this subversion. In this way they are indeed engaged in the eradication of the White man here at the southern tip of Africa. We must ask them what they prefer: murder of innocent civilians, or effective steps to prevent the loss of human life? What is really happening is that the rule of law is not being violated, it is being strengthened by this legislation in order to protect the individual in this country and to ensure his continued existence here. I want to tell the PRP that the time for picknicking in this country is past and that serious steps will have to be taken to combat the undermining of State security with all the ways and means at our disposal.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Potgietersrus unfortunately devoted most of his speech to making party political propaganda in relation to a matter which I believe is far too serious to be approached in that manner. I do not think there is one of us in this House who is not conscious of the growth of lawlessness, violence and the contempt for law and order generally throughout the world at the present time. We read about it in the Press and we see it on TV night after night. The motivation for this violence and lawlessness differs from centre to centre. It may on occasions be merely personal motivation and due to the blatant lawlessness of an individual. On occasions it may be <span class="col_6469-6470" refersTo="page_0565"/>motivated by religious or political ideologies. I want to say quite clearly from this side of the House that there is not one member here who is not prepared and willing to subscribe to necessary and adequate action and legislation to contain and prevent activities which endanger&#x2014;I use the wide phrase which is used in the Bill&#x2014;the security of the State or which threatens to disrupt public order. I am using that in the wide sense, i.e. the necessary action and legislation to contain such lawlessness and disorder. The argument I want to put to the hon. the Minister, is to what extent this Bill is necessary and to what extent it in fact, in its definition and in its content, will help towards the maintenance of law and order. I want to remind the hon. the Minister and the House that we on this side of the House have consistently over the years been prepared to put country interests before party interests in matters which are of common concern. I need only remind hon. members that we as a party&#x2014;back in the days of Dr. Malan&#x2014; offered to try to deal with the Native question by taking it out of party politics and to find a solution. Since then, we have consistently made similar offers, but they have all been rejected. From this side of the House, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and others, have consistently suggested to the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs that there should be a committee, as there is in the Parliaments of other countries, to deal with foreign affairs on a non-party basis. That has been rejected as well. The hon. member for Durban Point has consistently and persistently suggested that the time has arrived for a defence council or Standing Select Committee on defence matters. That has been rejected. We have consistently made these suggestions, and I have personally explained to this House why we on this side of the House were prepared to take part in the investigation of certain organizations.</p>

<p>But, Sir, the Government always wants to go it alone, without an opportunity for proper and careful consideration of views which possibly do not conform directly and in all circumstances to their own views. We have in South Africa a country which is substantially peaceful. During this session the hon. the Prime Minister and others have said how fortunate we are in South Africa to have a country which is substantially peaceful. Visitors from overseas, both official and private, remark on the absence of police in Adderley Street and other streets. That is because we are basically a law-abiding nation. Sir, there is also at this stage a consensus between the PRP, the Government and ourselves that discrimination on the basis of colour must be removed. The question of how, where and in what manner and at what time may be debated, but the principle is accepted. But, Sir, we also have amongst us&#x2014;and we realize this&#x2014;those who would destroy the very circumstances of peace and order which we enjoy at the present time. There are those people in this country who would like to destroy these circumstances, and those people are both White and non-White. We are involved at the present moment in a conflict on our borders to repel terrorists attempting to enter into South West Africa, and we in this country find ourselves in the situation where we have to keep a balance between personal liberty and the restriction of that liberty in the interests of State security. That is the problem with which we are faced. Mr. Speaker, I make no excuse for quoting again something which has been quoted often in this House. In 1973 I quoted these words of Pres. Truman in dealing with communism, and I wish to repeat them. Pres. Truman said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall fight Russian communism on the march, first by strengthening our own military defences and reinforcing those of other free nations, secondly by working at home to strengthen our own democratic institutions, thirdly by moving quietly and without hysteria against communist subversion and to do this within the framework of our liberties. We are not going to turn the United States into a right-wing totalitarian country in order to deal with a left-wing totalitarian threat.</block>

<p>That is what we have to guard against. I am not going to use extravagant words to suggest that this Bill in its entirety is turning South Africa into a totalitarian State by nature of its contents, but that is what we have to guard against. We must see to it that we do not go too far in our enthusiasm to contain what we believe is a danger, and create something which is worse and more harmful to the interests of our country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton said that the Suppression of Communism Act has been <span class="col_6471-6472" refersTo="page_0566"/>used to contain people who do not fall strictly within the purview of the Act in that they were not in fact communists or furthering the interests of communism. I agree with her that has been done. I want to quote what the hon. the Minister of Community Development said when he spoke in this House on 27 February 1973 in connection with the actions that were taken against the students as a result of the findings of the Schlebusch Commission. This is what the hon. the Minister of Community Development said (Hansard, Vol. 42, col. 1509)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We can substantiate that they are doing things which are dangerous to the public&#x2019;s safety and which may tend to subvert good order in South Africa and even our State, as I will show in a minute. But we could not find that they were guilty in any way of furthering the ends of communism or that they were communists in any way; &#x2026;</block>

<p>Nevertheless, this Government, in the opinion of the hon. the Minister of Justice, used the Suppression of Communism Act in order to ban the students. Those of us on this side who sat on the Schlebusch Commission have made our attitude perfectly clear and it is there in print for all to see. I wonder how many of those hon. members have read the minority report. That is my problem, sometimes, when I address the members opposite; I do not know whether they have understood what is contained in that minority report. The hon. member for Brits smiles, but I wonder when he last read the minority report or studied it. There, as far as we are concerned, we explicitly stated the views which we have in regard to the problems which arise in dealing with subversion. In the first instance we recommended that there should be a redefinition of actions which are regarded as threatening the security of the State. These actions must be specifically defined. There again I wish to call to mind what was said by the hon. the Minister of Community Development when he spoke on this subject as well. He and I spoke at the tabling of the first and second reports of the Schlebusch Commission. On that occasion the hon. the Minister said (Hansard, Vol. 42, col. 1566)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If, on the other hand, the law of South Africa is such that people cannot be found guilty of crimes, even when, as shown in the evidence before the commission, they are endangering the safety of the State and even acting treasonably, seditiously, the Government should have come to Parliament with legislation to put matters right, and provided the proposed legislation clearly defined the crimes it was intended to deal with and gave people to be charged under that law an opportunity to defend their innocence before the courts, the Government would have had the co-operation of the Opposition &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is our attitude today but, what do we have in this Bill? We have a wide net in which we can catch anything from a sardine to a whale, if I can use a fishing metaphor in this matter. It is a net that is so wide that one does not know for what one is setting out to fish. That is the problem that we have with this whole Bill and this problem can be traced right through the Bill. One of the problems that we have is this definition which cannot be interpreted objectively by any person who merely reads the Act.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville asks me a question which shows that he does not understand the situation. He should realize that this Bill does not have one principle only, but that it involves five or six principles. Secondly, the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana that the Bill should go to a Select Committee before Second Reading is not an acceptance of the principles of the Bill. That is obvious, and I wish the hon. member would try to understand <span class="col_6473-6474" refersTo="page_0567"/>this. It is a Bill that should go to a Select Committee in order that a problem which we accept does exist in South Africa may be dealt with. We accept that we need to deal with subversion, but we need to deal with it in a way which has been outlined, as I have said, by the hon. the Minister of Community Development. We believe that this problem does exist and I call to witness members of the Government who sat on the Schlebusch Commission. We called the Government&#x2019;s attention in our report three years ago to the fact that there were things happening in South Africa which apparently could not be dealt with under the laws of the land. We also believed there were activities such as the rejection of the ballot-box and that kind of thing, the overthrowing of the democratic form of government we have here, or at least incitement towards those ends or an advocating of those ends, these not being defined as crimes which could be punished in South Africa. The Government has done nothing to deal with those aspects. Has any hon. member on the opposite side of the House, in the Government benches, applied his mind to the point endorsed by all the members of the Le Grange Commission, i.e. that attention should be given to the seriousness of citizens of this country advocating economic and arms boycotts against this country? Has that been given any attention whatsoever? Has it even been thought about, rejected or accepted, or brought before this House so that we could debate the matter? No, the Government has gone on to utilize a situation, which affects every citizen in South Africa, for purely party political propaganda purposes so that they can say that no one else in South Africa is a patriot except those sitting in the NP.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the question of executive action. I hope I do not have to remind the hon. the Minister of Justice of what is contained in the minority report. The principle that executive action may be taken by a government in times of war or emergency is an accepted principle because in the final analysis the security of the State in times of war or emergency is the responsibility of the government. What we have said is that if one wants to take executive action or have the power to take executive action, there must be a clear definition of the circumstances in which that executive action can be taken and for what reason it can be taken.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>There was no definition like that during the war.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am now coming to my next point. The hon. the Minister will also appreciate, as I do, that there can well be circumstances of armed conflict without a declaration of war, because in the future there will probably never be a declaration of war. We have dealt with this matter in relation to the Defence Act. Well, then, let us state this in the Bill. Let us state in the Bill that if we are involved in armed conflict, which is the term for modern war coined by Anthony Eden, under such specified circumstances executive action can be taken.</p>

<p>I now want to come to another point. I am grateful for the fact that the Government has introduced into this Bill a judicial committee of review, but it has been restricted to only one form of executive action, to what I might term the internment clause of this Bill. Why has the hon. the Minister not extended this to all the executive action he can take under the Suppression of Communism Act? I believe a Select Committee should look at situations where the hon. the Minister uses the powers he now has to act in terms of restricting persons, banning unlawful organizations and prohibiting publications. Why is he so shy about letting those also come under review by a review tribunal? This is a point I believe the hon. the Minister should concede. I only regret that there has been so much of a delay. The Government commissioners said there had been a lot of talk about the need for a tribunal, but they did not think they should make any decision. I am very glad the hon. the Minister has virtually done word for word what we in the minority told him to do. The only difficulty is that he has not extended this far enough. For example, he has not quite extended it to cover the composition of that judicial tribunal. I believe that a definition of what we consider to be actions threatening security should be given in this Bill.</p>

<p>I want to refer again to what was said when the first and second reports were tabled, because we have shown a consistent attitude. I myself said on 28 February 1973 that if the findings of fact which we had in the reports before us did not justify a criminal prosecution for an offence under the laws of South Africa, I believed, with the hon. the Minister of Community Development, the then hon. <span class="col_6475-6476" refersTo="page_0568"/>member for Yeoville, that there was something very wrong with the laws of our country. I did not suggest that we should prosecute those persons <i>ex post facto.</i> If what they were doing was not punishable, there was something wrong with the laws of our country. I also want to add a further reminder of what we said at that time. The hon. the Minister of Community Development dealt with the question of the defining of crimes and said that the UP had always resisted executive action which deprived people of their liberty. He added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The party has also stood and still stands for the right of people to be heard by impartial courts if the State has reason to believe that they should be deprived of their liberty under the law.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister said in any case the internment clause of this Bill would be put on ice. The point is, however, that in a Select Committee we shall have the time to go through all the measures which deal with security matters. I am now not referring to the other commission which the Government has seen fit to establish. A Select Committee of this House appointed to deal with security legislation will be able to find definitions which will describe these circumstances clearly, so that the whole country and every individual will know exactly what the position is. In connection with the powers of internment I believe that a Select Committee will be able to investigate and define the circumstances in which the State President could declare the provisions of the Bill applicable in some area or another.</p>

<p>It was made quite clear by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana that we cannot accept the Bill in its present form and with the principles it contains. However, we do realize that we as responsible citizens must see to it that machinery is available to deal with subversion and threats to the security of the State. We want to believe that such machinery does exist. It can be argued and it is argued that we have such a string of security laws that we do not need any more.</p>

<p>The hon. member says we have Boss. Well, there are also others and it may well be that the time has come&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke mentioned it&#x2014;for us to have a consolidated law in regard to security matters. I think it is a very good suggestion which the hon. member has made. In fact, I think it is an ideal matter for such a Select Committee to look into. There must be a code of conduct by which those who transgress will be judged. They should not be judged in the office of the hon. the Minister, but before a court of law. I do appreciate that there are certain exceptions when they cannot be brought before a court. Such an exception will be when circumstances are such that security interests make it necessary that certain matters be investigated <i>in camera.</i> That is where the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s tribunal will come into the picture.</p>

<p>Basically we want the hon. the Minister to spell it out whenever he wants to stop an action which he believes is against the interests of the State or which may subvert law and order in South Africa or may affect the security of the State. He should spell it out so that everybody will know it is there and so that, if a man is taken into custody to be charged, he will know for what offence he will be charged. The hon. the Minister has referred the House to the definition which applies to the American security committee. There were recent amendments to the terms of reference of the committee and its <i>modus operandi.</i> The American security committee provides us with guide-lines; the Americans have a definition of the type of action which is believed to threaten the security of the State.</p>

<p>We cannot accept the Bill as it is at the moment, but if the hon. the Minister accepts the amendment in which the appointment of a Select Committee is asked for, we shall obviously be prepared to play our part in such a Select Committee appointed to deal with legislation which will eventually be laid before this House. We have made that attitude clear over and over again. We also made it clear when the question of the Security Commission came before us. We are prepared to play our part as Parliamentarians to deal with legislation in this House.</p>

<p>May I say to the hon. the Minister that this is surely not the time for the Government to adopt an obstinate attitude. This Bill has taken some 2&#x00BD; to 3 years to germinate and to see the light of day in this House. I do not believe the hon. the Minister is justified in blindly <span class="col_6477-6478" refersTo="page_0569"/>rejecting the amendment that was moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana in which he suggested that this Bill should be looked at in more detail by a Select Committee. This could ensure an acceptable basis for the maintenance of law and order. I believe that the Government could go to such a Select Committee to show its sincerity. In this way it could show that it is sincerely seeking an acceptable basis for combating subversion. When I say &#x201C;acceptable basis&#x201D;, I mean a basis which is understood and respected by every person in every walk of life in our country. When all the people in the country realize the necessity of such a law, that law will be successful. I may add that such a Select Committee would also be a test of the sincerity of the Official Opposition and of the PRP as to the extent to which they are prepared to contribute to finding an acceptable solution with regard to security matters. If that were done, we would be able to determine a basis on which we could go ahead in South Africa with the maintenance of law and order within the limits and practices of law and the enjoyment of personal liberties to the maximum extent permissible without affecting the security of the State. I hope the hon. the Minister will accept the suggestion which has come from this side of the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Green Point went to a great deal of trouble to try to indicate that a Select <span class="col_6479-6480" refersTo="page_0570"/>Committee was the real solution, and to try to paint a picture of a United Party which feels as strongly about internal security as the National Party. Neither the NP nor the PRP nor the Press nor the voters of South Africa will accept that the UP&#x2019;s efforts to refer this Bill to a Select Committee at this stage are anything other than a political fig leaf behind which the UP is trying to conceal the problems it is up against, as well as its problems surrounding this Bill. [Interjections.] They are trying to argue that there are many principles in this Bill and that there can be no question&#x2014;as the hon. the Minister asked by way of an interjection&#x2014;of accepting the principle of the Bill. I want to ask the hon. member for Green Point what new principle there is in this Bill which has not already been debated time and again. The hon. member himself quoted comprehensively from previous debates, debates which were conducted on legislation to which this Bill was a supplementary measure. I maintain that there are only two fundamental principles in this Bill. In view of its earlier statements, I fail to see why the United Party has any difficulty in accepting them. The first principle is that it is being conceded in this Bill that there are also other dangers threatening the security of the State than merely the dangers which stem from a purely communist source. What it boils down to in other words is that there are other people as well, not necessarily communists, who are able to or want to take subversive action against the security of the State and against public order. I fail to see how the United Party can experience any problem with regard to the acceptance of that principle. I also fail to see how it can be difficult for them to accept that there will be legislation by means of which it will also be possible to clamp down on non-communist actions which are a threat to public order or the security of the State. I cannot understand how this can give them any problems.</p>

<p>The second principle which I distinguish in this Bill simply boils down to the possibility of a situation arising in which powers are required for the detention of people&#x2014;without any crime actually having been committed&#x2014; for the prevention of some or other crime, and that such situations can arise without a general state of emergency necessarily having been proclaimed. These are the two new principles which I perceive in this Bill. I fail to see why the United Party should experience any problem in accepting them. I should like to ask the next United Party member who rises to explain to this House what other principles they perceive in this Bill, principles which differ fundamentally from those contained in existing legislation or from those which I have just stated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point even hurled several unrelated accusations at the Government. In the first place he said: &#x201C;The Government wants to go it alone&#x201D;. That hon. member, after the debate on the Bill which was aimed at the establishment of a permanent internal security commission, can make that statement, that he can allege that the Government wants to act on its own&#x2014; specifically with regard to the maintenance of internal security&#x2014;while the United Party refused an offer to serve on a body which has in fact been established to deal with these matters, I find completely unacceptable and incomprehensible. The hon. member went on to say that the Government should not deprive people of too many rights, because the balance between the freedom of the individual and the security of the State was disturbed in that way. Of what rights are people being deprived by this legislation? Is it the right of the individual to threaten the security of the State and to disturb public order? Is it the right for the preservation of which demonstrations ought to be held? I do not believe that was the hon. member&#x2019;s intention. I also believe that he was trying to conceal the embarrassment of his party behind that statement.</p>

<p>The hon. member submitted that his party had argued long ago for the establishment of certain measures, but that the Government had done nothing about it. What about the legislation on the Parliamentary Internal Security Commission, something to which I have just referred? What about the Affected Organizations Act? What about the present Bill? These are all, directly or indirectly, results of debates and of investigations which took place in the past. However, everything which has emerged after the Schlebusch Commission presented its report is being opposed by the United Party. Now they are reproaching the Government with not having done enough. To hurl such reproaches at us borders on the absurd, particularly since this comes from a party which is not prepared to give its co-operation.</p>

<p>Before I comment in general on the attitude of the two Opposition parties and the attitude <span class="col_6481-6482" refersTo="page_0571"/>of this side of the House to the Bill, I want to refer to a few aspects raised by the hon. member for Houghton. In the first place she drew an absurd comparison between this legislation and the legislation and actions of the old United Party Government with regard to the internment of South African citizens for refusing to support the war effort and actively speaking out against it. That is an absurd comparison. In the present legislation we are referring to the security of South Africa. We are referring to the preservation of the democracy of the Republic of South Africa. We are referring to subversive elements that want to stir up unrest within the borders of South Africa and to change the existing order outside the existing democratic channels. What was at issue at the time, however, was a war in Europe, not a war in the then Union of South Africa. We were not being attacked. Therefore there was no war in South Africa in the true sense of the word. A party split on that issue. To compare the present situation to that situation is unworthy of the debating ability of the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member took her argument further and said that Ireland, England and Israel also have problems, but that they did not have the same powers as we had. I can begin by telling the hon. member that she differs with the opinion of a person for whose opinion she probably has more respect than for mine, i.e. Prof. John Dugard. He once said, during a debate on the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s security laws go as far as the emergency laws of Israel and Northern Ireland.</block>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. member agrees with him or not. She will simply have to thrash out the matter with him personally. However, I want to ask the hon. member whether she does not think that Ireland and Israel should have had some of our powers which we have in this country, or, if they did have them, should have applied them. I want to ask her whether she does not think that it is better to have legislation such as this legislation of ours, instead of having to cover the windows of all the restaurants in the country with wire mesh because one can no longer enjoy a meal in peace because of the bombs which are being thrown? The hon. member could tell one of her junior members to furnish replies to my questions. I want to ask the hon. member: Would she prefer to have a situation such as the one which is prevailing at present in Ireland and Israel without our legislation or prefer to have us apply legislation with the resultant peace, order and safe democracy which it entails for us?</p>

<p>The hon. member also drew an indirect comparison between the National Party Government and the communist powers of the East by implying that the legislation should rather be compared with that which is being applied in totalitarian countries such as the communist countries. Is it the intention of the hon. member to present South Africa to the outside world, through the newspapers that are going to report her, as a country in which there is no respect for the freedom of the individual, in which democracy does not exist, in which unfair action is taken, in which imperialism is an integral part of the ideology of the Government, in which the freedom of the individual who wishes to do well and live an orderly life, is being threatened? What individual is the hon. member able to show us, who lives a decent, normal life, does his work from day to day, is active in any political party&#x2014;except a communist party&#x2014;and exercises his political rights to the full, who is affected or threatened by this legislation, or upon whose freedom this legislation has made inroads in the past? I maintain that in this country every individual who believes personally in the maintenance of public order and who accepts that if one wants to bring about changes in South Africa, it should be done in an orderly, lawful manner and through the many existing channels, is safer in South Africa than in most other countries of the world. The hon. member need not hold up legislation to the outside world to the detriment of South Africa and as an oppressive measure. This legislation is a liberating measure. Liberating to whom? It is liberating to 99,99&#x0025; of all inhabitants, White, Brown, Black and Indian of South Africa who want to solve their problems in a peaceful manner here, by any methods except revolutionary, violent and disorderly methods.</p>

<p>This is what this Bill and all our other legislation is aimed at, and this is how it is being applied in practice. The fundamental differences between the NP, the UP and the PRP are best illustrated by the tenor of this debate up to now. The NP emerges from this <span class="col_6483-6484" refersTo="page_0572"/>debate as a party which is prepared to face up to the challenge of our times, to take unpopular action, and to do something which it does not itself like doing, which is to maintain discipline for the sake of peaceful solutions in South Africa. We do not like, as little as the hon. member for Houghton does, introducing legislation which, as she puts it, restricts the freedom of the individual so extensively. We also believe in the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. The hon. member does not have the sole right to say that she believes in it, but that we are violating it. We also regard our legal system&#x2014;of which the rule of law, as an ideal, forms a part&#x2014;with the same great respect as she does, but we are prepared to face up to the challenge of the times and to say that we are living in times, and in a situation, in which firm action has to be taken, that this is being done and that we shall bear our responsibility in this regard.</p>

<p>Against this the UP has a concept of the difficult balance between the security of the State and the freedom of the individual. However, they are not prepared to do something in respect of the problems of our time. Their solution is that we should investigate them again. [Interjections.] I shall return to the United Party again in a moment.</p>

<p>The PRP are guilty of absolutizing the right of the individual to do and say anything at the expense of the security of the State.</p>

<p>I got the feeling that the debate up to now has been enveloped in a haze of unreality. The UP, which is fighting for its life, spoke with one purpose only through the competent hon. member for Umhlatuzana and the hon. member for Green Point, and that purpose was to keep their party together. Of convinced, direct adopting of a standpoint there was little or nothing. There was something of a conservative statement of standpoint when they said that they were in favour of preventive detention, but then, for the sake of their left wing, they hastened to add, &#x201C;only if there is war or a national state of emergency is prevailing and has been proclaimed&#x201D;. On the positive side there was, from a few hon. members whom we could mention by name, a definite statement that subverters should not get off, but then they again hastened to add for the sake of the left wing, &#x201C;but there are reservations; they must go to court before any steps can be taken against them&#x201D;. This is an old standpoint of theirs. It is no new standpoint.</p>

<p>Sir, let us come to the crux of the matter which is at issue in this Bill. This standpoint offers no answers to the particular situations which the Bill foresees and seeks to prevent. The Bill makes provision for situations which are not a national state of emergency; let us accept that, for there is existing machinery to deal with a national state of emergency. This Bill makes provision for the situation which nevertheless makes action necessary because it constitutes a threat to the security of the State. Surely it is not unreasonable to ask hon. members to admit that such a situation is by no means improbable in the world of today. Surely they will admit that problems may arise in a specific sphere which are not the equivalent of a national state of emergency, but which may nevertheless constitute a serious threat to State security and to public order. In such a situation the UP&#x2019;s answer of a state of emergency is not good enough, for it is not a general state of emergency. Now we ask the UP what we should do in such situations. Why cannot we do what this Bill is proposing? The question before us is that simple. Surely it cannot be asked that we should, in such a situation, declare a general state of emergency in conflict with the national interests, for it would do the country no end of harm if we proclaimed a general state of emergency unnecessarily. We are therefore asking them: What do they propose we should do in a situation which is not a national state of emergency, but which nevertheless constitutes serious threats?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_klerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, their answer is a Select Committee. Our answer is a Bill and they have not yet told us what is in fact wrong with this Bill. They have only told us that they should like to talk about it at a later stage, and they repeated their old standpoint on security legislation. However, the hon. the Minister tells us that a situation could arise in which he would require these powers. Hon. members opposite are not denying that such a situation could arise. They are saying that it is a good thing that there are powers to forestall situations, but they are not saying why these powers are too wide or in what respect they fall short, except to attack the definition. Sir, if they had wanted to attack the definition, they could rather have devoted the weeks they have now been holding caucus meetings to the formulation of a proper definition.</p>

<p>The PRP proposes an absolute rejection of the powers contained in the Bill. I want to say that we are entitled to infer from that they are opposed to the executive being vested with powers to take preventive action. That is their standpoint. Their standpoint is that the executive should not be allowed to take preventive action, and that the courts should adjudicate upon the matter when that case is brought before the court Now I want to ask them this question: Are they then prepared to make it a crime for any person to have a plan to overthrow the existing order and then to set to work on that plan? Such a person might not yet have done enough to enable a person to charge him with, let us say, attempted high treason, but he has the plan and you have sufficient proof that he is already beginning to convert that plan into action. The question to which they have to reply is the following: Should we then wait until such a person has gone a little further with his plan? Should we then wait until he has made the bomb before we are able to catch him, or should we lock him up, in terms of these powers which the Minister wants to obtain, before he makes the bomb? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The NP does not shrink from this, as I have already said. Hon. members opposite are concerned about the definitions of the existing order and of what constitutes a threat to State security. Sir, surely all of us know the pillars on which our existing order rest, and however strenuously we debate across the floor of this House, surely we all agree on these matters. Surely we agree that the preservation of democracy is important for us. Surely we agree that we are proud of our legal system and that we want to preserve our legal system with its reputation for independence and its reputation for fairness, and that we want to place our courts of law on a lofty pedestal. Surely we all agree that we want to preserve sound inter-group relations. We differ on the recipe but we agree that we want to maintain sound inter-group relations. We also agree that the recognition of human dignity is important, of which the maintenance and preservation of individual liberty is an important subdivision. We agree that law and order is important and that a well-ordered and disciplined community which is able to settle its differences in a peaceful way among its own numbers is our common aim. This is what all of us are striving to achieve, and we believe that we are preserving it. This is all we want to protect. We do not want to protect the NP&#x2019;s majority with this legislation or with other security legislation. Hon. members in fact have a full and free opportunity to wage election campaigns with or without the Press&#x2014;for some parties still have a Press and some do not&#x2014;as they also did recently in Durban North. We are not bringing this Bill to Parliament to benefit the NP. All that is being contemplated in this Bill and in all the other security legislation is merely the protection of the right of all peoples in South Africa to find solutions to our problems in a peaceful manner. The forces which are mustering against South Africa do not want a peaceful solution. They are seeking a violent solution; they are seeking a disruption of public order. The right which we are depriving people of in legislation such as this is the right of any person to seek and to further violent solutions in South Africa, and the party which cannot agree with that, will to an increasing extent be called to account to the electorate. Such a party will not be able to get away by dismissing the questions which are being put to them as suspicion-mongering on the part of the NP. Sir, when I put these questions to them and when I ask them whether they are opposed to it, I am not trying to cast suspicion on them. If they are opposed to it, they should tell us what effective measures they want to recommend in its place. <span class="col_6487-6488" refersTo="page_0574"/>The only reply we receive is: &#x201C;All your laws are wrong; take them to court&#x201D;. [Interjections.] Sir, they have further opportunities to speak; we are waiting for the replies to the questions we have put to them. We believe that this Bill is a positive measure which is aimed at the interests and the protection of the security of the whole of South Africa, with all its people, White, Black, Brown and Indian.</p>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am happy for once to follow the hon. member for Vereeniging and not to have him follow me. In the past I have found him to be a very able debater, but I am somewhat surprised that he is able to support this Bill. He has clothed his message to this House in words of reason and in words of moderation, and yet his message is one of support for a measure which is one of the most draconian which South Africa has yet had to endure. His very first point is that in this Bill is to be found a major advantage in that it covers aspects not only related to communism, but also related to activities which in the opinion of certain people might endanger the security of the State or the maintenance of public order. I want to say that in making that statement he misunderstands the very point that we are trying to make. The point that we want to make is that by broadening the scope of the Bill, the Bill itself is more dangerous, more pernicious than ever it was before. He asks this party for answers that will satisfy his concept of law and order in South Africa. He will, however, wait for many years before he gets the sort of answers that he wants to hear from us. The reason is that in terms of philosophy, of policy and the concept of the rights of man, we are poles apart, so far apart that our very ideas relating to the security of the State are different in themselves. In a reasonable voice the hon. member pleads for more powers in the hands of the executive, power of detention in the hands of an individual, in respect of unspecified deeds, committed or alleged to have been committed, deeds which will be an offence in the opinion of an individual, a member of the Government. Let us, for instance, say that there is a law in South Africa making it illegal to be un-South African and that it is in the power of the hon. the Minister to decide who is un-South African and who is not.</p>

<p>There are many of us who say that the activities of the Government are not only un-South African, but also anti-South African in many of the things that they do. We say that it ought not to be in the power of an individual to decide who is un-South African and who is not, but that it should be in the power of the judiciary, through the courts, to find a person guilty of an offence, and if a person is found guilty of an offence, the courts should be empowered to take the necessary action. The hon. member asked who has been wrongly affected by these laws that have been passed in this country over the years. Over the years hundreds of people have been restricted, detained and banned without trial, and very few of those people have been brought to the courts of South Africa and convicted of any offence whatsoever. Many of the people who have in fact been brought to the courts have been found not guilty. I allege that there are hundreds of South Africans who have been wrongly treated in terms of the security laws of South Africa.</p>

<p>It is correct that it is our view that individuals should not have the power to take executive action relating to any particular person or organization. The hon. member asks how we can deal in the normal course of events with such offences as are contemplated by this legislation. An attempt to commit an act of sedition, an act of treason, an act of violence or revolution, is in fact an offence in itself, and incitement to commit such an offence is an offence in itself. A conspiracy to commit such an offence is an offence in itself. That offence will remain an offence and will remain a crime, but it should be proved before an independent judicial body before people are arbitrarily dealt with in any way.</p>

<p>The hon. member, and I am sure many hon. members on that side of the House, will say that my party is to the left of the road. I believe that the party of the Government is on the right of the road. I believe also that it is far more comfortable being either on the left or on the right of the road than all over the road, as is the case with the UP. When you are riding all over the road, <span class="col_6489-6490" refersTo="page_0575"/>you are in danger of being involved in accidents, collisions and you may suffer casualties. While opposing this Bill &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Houghton says that party was indeed run over in Durban North last week. While opposing this Bill, and opposing it in the manner that it has done, the Opposition has satisfied, as has been mentioned by the hon. member for Vereeniging, its left wing. It is not a total opposition, not an absolute opposition. They deny the principle of the Bill at this stage, but open the door to a discussion at a Select Committee and in doing that there is sufficient of a carrot being held out to the right to keep them in line.</p>

<p>I hope, and I think South Africa deserves this from the United Party, that we will hear in this debate from the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and from the hon. member for Albany and from the hon. member for Simonstown. I want to ask those hon. members, who are still in the United Party, whether they are against the principle of this Bill. Are they against the principle as enunciated in this Bill, or will they remain again silent? Will they remain silent again on this important issue, fearful to express publicly what they say and believe privately?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Potgietersrus spoke a little earlier and said, as I understood him, that the rule of law, in his view, was obsolete. He said that times had changed, that a modern society had meanwhile developed and that the rule of law had no application in the modern society of today. That is perhaps correct in so far as this Government in this country is concerned. Certainly the 20th century has brought new exigencies, new dangers and new problems which have to be coped with by a Government of today. Certainly adaptations are necessary and acceptable to the old principle of the rule of law. When powers are placed in the hands of subjective individuals over other individuals, however, denying those individuals redress to the independent courts, then the rule of law has not been adapted; it has been raped. That is what has happened to the rule of law in South Africa. The hon. member quoted many countries where there was this sort of law as we are debating today. I venture to suggest he will find that these laws are not prevalent in Great Britain and certainly not in the United States, where <i>habeas corpus</i> is a very integral part of the law. Neither will they be found in any democratic European countries as I know them. But those very countries upon which we try to model ourselves, those countries which we say we back, they have their bills of rights enshrined in their constitutions. In Britain, in France, in the United States and Canada are bills of rights which protect individuals and which protect groups against the breaking of the rule of law which we have been talking about.</p>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Speaker. The Bill of Rights in Britain arose as a result of the battle of the Stuarts with Parliament, and Parliament negotiated the Bill of Rights with the then king, incorporating the rights of Parliament and its sovereignty. That Bill of Rights is part of the British legislation today.</p>

<p>I wish to put a question to the Government, a question which has not as yet been answered at all. The question is: Is there a crisis in South Africa at the present time, or is there not? In this particular matter the Government itself is all over the road. We have heard the hon. member for Potgietersms telling us that we had the Poqo dangers, that we had all sorts of dangers over the years. He was in fact sketching a picture of crisis. Yet when the PRP talks of a crisis in race relations, what is the result? We are vilified by members on that side of the House, we are abused for saying that South Africa is in a crisis situation, we are threatened by members on that side of the House and we are subjected to accusations that we are blackening South Africa&#x2019;s name abroad. In this atmosphere the Government does all it can to dispel what it calls an atmosphere of doom. Everything, we are told, is under control. Are we then the alarmists? Yet this Government comes to this House in a mild, polite, reasonable and disarming manner <span class="col_6491-6492" refersTo="page_0576"/>and asks for new, extra horrific powers for the executive. The Government cannot, however, have it both ways. Either there is an urgent need for these powers or there is not.</p>

<p>Let us look at both possibilities. If South Africa is in grave danger, the Government should spell it out and tell us of the dangers, why these powers are required and against whom they are to be used. In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister mentioned various countries that have these powers, for example Malaysia, Guiana, Indonesia and India. He significantly omitted to mention Paraguay which is one of the countries well-disposed towards us.</p>

<p>These countries&#x2014;certainly Indonesia&#x2014; adopted executive powers at times of open insurrection and in times of war. Is that now the case in the Republic? The only war I know of in the Republic was the recent war when the hon. the Minister of Defence sent our forces into Angola to fight certain battles and then withdrew and subsequently left the field open for the communists, the Cubans and the Russians, to take over the whole of Angola.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>That is the only war I know of. If we are in a state of war in the heart of South Africa&#x2014;in the Transvaal and in the Western Province&#x2014;it is the Government&#x2019;s duty to inform us of the fact and it is also the Government&#x2019;s duty to tell us how and why they seek the powers which they do.</p>

<p>Israel and Northern Ireland have been mentioned in the debate by one of the hon. members who spoke a short while ago. Is there any actual comparison between the trouble in Northern Ireland and the situation in Cape Town, Bloemfontein or Johannesburg? Is there any comparison between the embattled Israel and the situation in which we find ourselves in this country today? If there is, we want to know about it. In any event, is this Government proud to compare our system of government with the system of government of Guiana, for instance? The hon. member for Johannesburg North spoke about some South American countries a few weeks ago and was crucified by hon. members on the other side of the House for comparing South Africa with countries overseas. Is it therefore fair for South Africa to be compared with some of the countries the hon. the Minister has mentioned? Yet the hon. the Minister uses those examples with impunity.</p>

<p>Passing mention has been made of the subversion of students and organized agitation of labour. Let me quote from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech on 7 May&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In particular activist politics will be stepped up on the campuses and the campaign against military service under the guise of conscientious objection will be intensified. In the labour area there have for some time been fully-fledged underground political agitators and organizers in the field. There is in operation a centrally directed plan for the organization and the mobilization of the workers into a force to be used by underground politicians for the furthering of their own causes.</block>

<p>It is stated further that much groundwork has already been done to fight this. These are very serious allegations, and if they are true, why has the Government not already acted to curb these activities relating to a central organization to subvert the labour movements of South Africa? The Government has vast powers at its disposal. If infiltration is taking place, and if the Government has not already acted to bring such persons or organizations to justice, this is a gross dereliction of duty on the part of the Government. No, Mr. Speaker, this is not good enough. It claims enormous and frightening powers over individuals and groups, but fails to motivate properly or or at all why it needs these powers. South Africa is being told that all is peaceful and rosy in the garden and yet this Government is arming itself with the weapons of despair. That is what they are: They are weapons of despair. They are part of the armoury of despair. I believe that in asking for these extraordinary powers to be found in very few Western democratic States, the Government has despaired of its will to govern by consent. That is what has happened: The Government has despaired of holding its power, in terms of normal democracy after 28 years of rule to govern effectively and peaceably. It has despaired of the goodwill of all the peoples of the Republic. Finally I believe it has lost faith and confidence in the <span class="col_6493-6494" refersTo="page_0577"/>strength of South Africans to protect for themselves that which is near and dear to themselves. It has despaired of democracy and it has despaired of the fact that a just society is the ultimate weapon and protection for civilized administration.</p>

<p>To say that these powers might not be used is, I believe, to ask this House to be even more gullible than the hon. the Minister believes it to be. Such powers are not taken in jest. Surely their utilization is contemplated. It is calculated, and I believe that its targets are probably even defined.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister a question. What in fact can we not deal with specifically without this legislation? Whom can we not deal with without this legislation? We already have powers to restrict, to ban, to detain, to silence by decree and even to hold witnesses for long periods. These powers have been used. By way of an interjection the hon. the Minister said that the communists and other types of persons who wish to subvert the State are being protected. When he said that, he looked across at the Opposition benches in general and he added that they are protected in the highest of places. I want to say that, too, appears to me to be a very serious allegation. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I am not challenging the hon. the Minister; I am asking him, because I believe that sort of interjection can only sow dissension, suspicion and trepidation amongst all sorts of people.</p>

<p>If we are confronted by a crisis of subversion and violence, then we want to know about it. If we are not confronted by a crisis of subversion and violence, then I believe the Government has no right at all to ask for these powers which in peace time appear to me to be the final declaration of war on democratic standards of government. It seems to me that they are the final obituary to the already embattled principle of the rule in South Africa. The rule of law is not an obsolete principle. It is a principle which states that no person should be convicted except for a specific offence. It states that no person should be imprisoned until found guilty. It also states that no person should be found guilty until tried in a proper court of law. That being the case, this Bill heralds in a new era of authoritarianism, of control by executive decree, aimed&#x2014;I believe in all sincerity&#x2014;at preserving a society which, the NP seems to be convinced, has little or no appeal for the masses of the South African public. It is an admission of defeat of the message, the philosophy and of the very way of life of separate development.</p>

<p>What amazes me is that the hon. the Minister seems to feel that the inclusion of clause 5, which provides for a review committee, gives sufficient protection to ensure Opposition support. How na&#x00EF;ve! The review committee as envisaged by the Government is of limited worth, in fact almost of no worth at all. Let me stop for a short while at the provisions of clause 5 to look at this new creation. The proposed new section 10<i>sex</i>(l) provides that the State President shall appoint a review committee which shall consist of a judge and certain other persons. The other persons need not necessarily be qualified persons; they could be any persons. Knowing the propensity of the Government to appoint politicians to positions which should be judicial positions, we may find that the two other persons may be the hon. members for Waterkloof and Parys. If those two members are appointed to that committee, there will be absolutely no confidence at all in it. Such a committee should in fact consist of judges, and judges alone.</p>

<p>Subsection (2) stipulates that certain matters shall be investigated at intervals of not more than six months. A lot can happen in six months. What is more, an investigation should be in advance of action and not after the action has been taken. Again, this very provision loses sight of the plight of people who may be decimated by being put in prison against their will and without being confronted with any offence they have supposedly committed.</p>

<p>Subsection (6) states that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister need not give effect to any recommendation of the review committee.</block>

<p>This makes a laughing-stock of the whole review committee. The Government appoints a judge and two other persons who then go to great trouble to investigate a matter. They see people and take evidence&#x2014;it is all set out here. Let us say that they then lay before the <span class="col_6495-6496" refersTo="page_0578"/>Minister a motivated report in which they make certain recommendations. If that does not suit the Minister, he simply discards the recommendation. That is all. What is the purpose of this charade? That is all it is, a charade. The Minister has made provision for this committee in this Bill in order to get the support of the Official Opposition. That is the only reason. However, the hon. the Minister failed even in that attempt. This amounts to granting the trappings of justice, but without teeth, without real meaning. It is a futile gesture.</p>

<p>Subsection (7) relates to a recommendation not being accepted. It states that fact shall be reported to Parliament.</p>

<p>Order! Let us listen to the hon. member in silence.</p>

<p>It is not the reasons that have to be reported to Parliament, but simply the fact. Consequently, Parliament and South Africa will be none the wiser on the question whether the Minister was justified or not justified in not accepting the recommendation of the review committee. This is no way in which to instill confidence in a review committee or even in a system of security legislation.</p>

<p>Subsection (9) states that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The review committee&#x2019;s deliberations and recommendations shall not be disclosed, except to a person whose duty it is to deal with the subject matter of the disclosure.</block>

<p>Neither the report, nor the recommendations, let alone the deliberations, are to be disclosed. Therefore no meaningful debate is possible. No meaningful weighing up of an issue by Parliament is possible. What is more, in terms of the subsequent subsection, no person is to be allowed access to the records. Neither Parliament, nor even the legal representatives of people who may be incarcerated in terms of this Bill will be allowed access to the records. The only exception is an official serving the executive. This makes informed criticism and a redressing of wrongs absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>Finally, the proposed new section 10 <i>sex</i> provides, predictably if one bears in mind the rest of the section, that the courts are excluded from redressing any wrongs at all. In fact, the courts are even excluded from adjudicating in any way on issues involving the interests of individuals. What is the result of this? The result is a toothless, emasculated committee which will submit a secret report, a report which can be discarded at the whim of the Minister. This provides no protection and is certainly no justification for supporting this measure. In any event, the committee&#x2019;s scope is far too limited. What is needed today if the hon. the Minister wants to appoint a review committee, is a judicial review committee with teeth, a committee that will review all ban-nings and all restrictions that have taken place as well as all executive action over the years, and not just the limited action taken in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>There are two further points I should like to make briefly. The first is the reaction overseas to a Bill of this sort and the second is the reaction of the people in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>We do not take any notice of overseas reactions. We go our own way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>We are often accused by the Government of bedevilling South Africa&#x2019;s international relations. We reject that accusation with absolute contempt. I want to say that the Government&#x2019;s discriminatory race policies, coupled with authoritarian measures such as this Bill, do more to alienate Western countries and Western Governments from this country than any pronouncement any member of the Opposition has ever made. These laws, these policies, are the true enemies of South Africa. Concerning the reaction of the South African people, I want to say that we all value our homes and our families; we all refuse to exchange peace for anarchy; we all refuse to exchange security for revolution. However, we maintain that, if a law is to be honoured, it should be a law which is deserving of respect. On promulgation this Bill will be an Act forming part of our Statute Book and law-abiding citizens will be bound by it, but it will cause more shame than attract respect. Security for all of us&#x2014;Black, White, Coloured and Indian&#x2014;is to be fostered by a sympathetic, by a democratic Government offering equal opportunity to all its citizens, offering all <span class="col_6497-6498" refersTo="page_0579"/>citizens a stake in society. Where, even in these circumstances, there is subversion, practised by the few, security measures will be backed, provided they are administered through the judiciary and with real protection for individuals.</p>

<p>Confidence in, and loyalty to the system of government and the administration of justice are the prerequisites of a peaceful and happy society. I honestly believe that this Government fails in regard to both those points.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened attentively to the speech made by the hon. member for Sandton. It was particularly striking how almost passionately he spoke of the so-called rule of law. Now, I find it strange to hear that particular hon. member speak in this way, for if I remember correctly, the voters of Sandton acted as judges on 24 April 1974 in order to elect a representative for them in this hon. House. On that occasion, the voters of Sandton decided to elect a member of the UP as their representative in this House. [Interjections.] In that case, too, the voters of Sandton acted as judges in deciding between the various parties. However, when it suits the hon. member, he is prepared to disregard that elementary rule. [Interjections.] I shall refer to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech again later on. I just want to refer briefly to the allegation he made towards the end of his speech, when he maintained that legislation of this kind made it difficult or impossible for the Western world to support us. When we look at the behaviour of the Western world in relation to our neighbouring state of Mozambique, it is strange how some Western countries vied with each other in supporting that particular State. Would the hon. member conclude from this that the Western world, or those particular Western countries, are prepared to support Mozambique because the rule of law is upheld there?</p>

<p>As far as this particular legislation is concerned, there are three groups in the country who have expressed their opposition to it. In the first place there is the English Press. I should prefer to refer to it as the &#x201C;Progressive&#x201D; Press, because I believe that I would be doing the English-speaking electorate of South Africa an injustice by describing the English Press in South Africa merely as an English Press. The English Press definitely does not represent the broad opinion of English-speaking people in South Africa any more. It is a &#x201C;Progressive&#x201D; Press to the core today.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to refer to the attitude of the UP. If two of the UP&#x2019;s frontbenchers will forgive me for saying so, I want to allege that they were almost apologetic and excessively modest this afternoon in expressing their opposition to this Bill. We know that the distress in the UP is great indeed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#page">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. W. B. PAGE</person>:</from>

<p>How do you know it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#uys">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. UYS</person>:</from>

<p>We know it, and we can only infer that the UP is asking for this Bill to be referred to a Select Committee because they see in such a step an opportunity whereby they may be afforded temporary relief in their distress. Although I do not consider it necessary to do so, I should like to say to the UP that we have problems in the field of security in our country. They themselves have conceded that this is so. If we have to weigh the distress of the country against the distress of the UP, then I am afraid that we are unable to give attention to the distress of the UP this afternoon. At this stage we must do what is in the best interests of the country. I want to concede to them that the legislation which is before the House is probably not infallible. The Act can be reviewed at a later stage. The Government has provided for this by appointing a permanent commission on which the UP can serve and contribute its share when the legislation is reviewed.</p>

<p>However, the UP has gone further than this in the debate this afternoon. Both speakers on the UP side who have spoken this afternoon have argued about it and conceded that generally speaking legislation in this connection needs to be updated. To tell the truth, the UP speakers went so far as to accuse the <span class="col_6499-6500" refersTo="page_0580"/>Government of having neglected its duty in not having updated legislation in this connection. I want to state that the Official Opposition also has an obligation to South Africa. If it was the opinion of the UP in the past that legislation in this connection should be updated, surely they had more than enough time and opportunity to submit proposals in this connection to the House.</p>

<p>The Government has not submitted this legislation to the House without careful consideration. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of circumstances in Africa and in South Africa in particular must be aware of the fact that the assault on our country and on the existing dispensation in our country will increase in intensity day by day. Therefore it is necessary and we dare not hesitate a day longer in placing this legislation on the Statute Book, and in giving the Minister the powers, if necessary, to enable him to put a stop to the iniquitous activities of subversive elements and prospective subversive elements. In this connection I want to tell the UP that it is no use paying lip service. It is no use saying, &#x201C;We also want to safeguard our country, but &#x2026;&#x201D; To the Official Opposition I can only say in the words of an Afrikaans poet: &#x201C;Die man wat sy deelname weier, is die man wat sy nasie vermoor.&#x201D; I want to make a serious appeal to the UP. Because we believe that they have South Africa&#x2019;s interests at heart, the UP must settle the differences in its own ranks and join forces with us in caring for the interests and the security of South Africa.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the PRP and to refer to their attitude. They are the ones who waxed particularly eloquent in the debate in referring to the rule of law. I do not like the expression &#x201C;the rule of law&#x201D;. English law is not the only one which believes in the sovereignty of the law. Our law too, an ancient law, knows the concept of &#x201C;regsoewereiniteit&#x201D;. We expected to hear that slogan from their side. We have also heard the slogan being advanced in opposition to the legislation by prospective revolutionaries, by the communists and by all like-minded people. It is a slogan which is heard time and again against any legislation of this nature, because every time the allegation is made that the Government in particular is violating the rule of law time and time again in its desire to take more and more powers upon itself. Are the members of the PRP unaware&#x2014;I do not think they are&#x2014;of what is happening on our borders? Are they unaware of the fact that people are preparing in an illegal manner to cause a revolution and anarchy in South Africa? I think they must be aware of this. Is the PRP prepared to extend the protection of the law to the people who are working for the violent overthrow of the existing dispensation in South Africa?</p>

<speech by="#uys">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. UYS</person>:</from>

<p>Is the PRP prepared to coddle the prospective saboteurs and their instigators? Are we to put off taking action in South Africa until the day when such people have completed their evil work and their revolution has actually started? Is it not in the interests of South Africa and in the interests of orderly development in South Africa for preventive measures to be taken in advance to check these people before they can complete their evil work?</p>

<p>During the Defence debate, the hon. member for Yeoville made an unusual proposal. He said, amongst other things, that in the times in which we live&#x2014;this is how threatened the hon. member feels&#x2014;South Africa should organize a big armaments exhibition to show the people who want to attack us that we have the military strength required for resisting attacks. This is not what South Africa needs at the moment. What South Africa needs is to build up an image in the outside world of people who have the will to check subversive elements and communists in South Africa in their attacks on this country. This is not the message we got from the PRP this afternoon. On the contrary, the PRP&#x2019;s message to subversive elements in South Africa and to people who threaten the security of the State was that they could continue without feeling alarmed because the protection of the law is guaranteed them so that they can abuse it for achieving their evil objectives. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What is the view of the NP? I readily concede that anyone on this side of the House, and especially any hon. member with a legal background, does not like to have restrictions placed on the freedom of an individual. This is contrary to the nature of the training received by lawyers. At this stage I want to come back to what the hon. member for Sandton said. He tried to give a definition of the so-called rule of law. He is not the first person in the world who <span class="col_6501-6502" refersTo="page_0581"/>has tried to do so. I must honestly admit that I have heard many better definitions of the rule of law than the one which the hon. member attempted to give this afternoon.</p>

<p>I want to allege that there has not been a single lawyer in the history of law who has been able to give a proper definition of this concept. I want to go so far as to say that as far as I am concerned, the supreme law is what is in the interests of the people of South Africa. This is the supreme law and this is the criterion which the NP uses in deciding which measures to take in order to protect that supreme law. If it should become necessary, as it has become necessary today, to take measures to restrict the freedom of movement of individuals and to remove their access to the courts under certain circumstances, then it is in the interests of South Africa for this to be done. We make no apology for it. This party and Government would be neglecting their duty to South Africa if they were not to give these powers to the hon. the Minister of Justice. I think that we in this House and the country outside would wait in vain to hear a single word of condemnation from the PRP concerning the people who subvert and sabotage South Africa. It has not happened in the past and it will not happen in the future. I once asked hon. members on the other side to tell us what they say to some people, of whom they are so fond, when they have discussions with them. We have not yet received a reply to that question. However, the PRP has told us this afternoon what they say to those who propose to subvert South Africa, i.e. that they will afford them all legal protection to which they are entitled. South Africa will eventually discover what to do with such a party.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that as far as the UP is concerned, we shall just have to accept now that they will have to endure their sufferings to the bitter end. I think we may take it that this party has chosen the way of surrender and that the feeling within its ranks is probably much worse than this. The NP and the Government are not prepared to repudiate our past and we are not prepared to betray our future. If it has become necessary for South Africa to pass legislation such as this&#x2014;and it has become necessary today&#x2014;the NP and the Government will do so time and time again.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt that the hon. member for Barberton, who has just sat down, spoke with great sincerity, but whether a lot of what he had to say had any specific reference to the Bill, I have some doubt about. In a sense I am a little disappointed with the course of this debate because I think the hon. members sitting on our left tended to play party politics to some extent. In respect of this Bill which, I would imagine, the hon. the Minister has brought to the House with some earnestness, it would have been much more appreciated had they directed their attention to the contents of the Bill, its effects, its purposes and the reasons why they are opposing it, rather than being simply critical of the attitude of the UP in this matter. Our attitude has been made very clear in the course of the addresses by the two hon. members on this side of the House who have already spoken. There is no necessity for the hon. member for Barberton to make an appeal to the UP with regard to its interest in the security of our country. I think it was made clear from what we have said that our objective here is to appreciate what the hon. the Minister has said, namely that he finds that in certain respects there are some gaps in his legislation, which he wishes to rectify. Therefore, we have directed our attention to the reasonableness of that demand.</p>

<p>It is because of that point of view that we too approach this Bill with earnestness, but we make it particularly clear that we are doing so because we are very concerned indeed about the security and safety of our country. However, we do not believe there is any sense of urgency at this particular stage. The hon. the Minister has many powers which he can use if any emergency exists of which he alone might know and of which he might perhaps think it inadvisable to apprise this House. I want to remind the hon. the Minister of the Public Safety Act, for instance, and other statutes of a similar nature such as the Civil Defence Act, the Riotous Assemblies Act, the Act that deals with sabotage and the General Law Amendment Act of 1970. In these Acts there are many provisions which enable the hon. the Minister to take immediate action should that be necessary. What this side of the House is concerned about are the principles which are embodied in this Bill. We do not believe they should become law in this country at this stage. We believe emphatically that we must preserve the right of the individual consistent with the conditions existing in the <span class="col_6503-6504" refersTo="page_0582"/>country and in a manner that will not only retain our traditional sense of justice and our traditional sense of democracy, but preserve in a way which is consistent with what is required from this House. The hon. member for Vereeniging explained this to some extent. This side of the House made its position abundantly clear in the minority report attached to the fourth report of the Schlebusch Commission. This side of the House made its position abundantly clear when we dealt with the Bill which the hon. the Prime Minister brought before the House earlier this session. We made our position abundantly clear in regard to executive action and the granting of absolute power to the executive without any opportunity for any person whose freedom is affected by such executive action to be brought before the courts on any specific crime, because the action which is contemplated in this Bill bears no relationship to any contravention of the Act. If the hon. the Minister will have a look at the Suppression of Communism Act, he will find that any contravention of section 11(c) relates specifically to section 3(1)(a). The amendment in this Bill relates to subsection 2(2). The amendment that is sought in this Bill to extend the application of the Suppression of Communism Act to contraventions other than those which exist at present, is not related to contraventions in respect whereof a person can be charged before the courts.</p>
