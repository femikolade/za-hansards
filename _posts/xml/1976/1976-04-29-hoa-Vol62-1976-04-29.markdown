<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, now that this debate is drawing to an end, I think it is fitting for the question to be asked: Can the Transkei exist as an independent state after 26 October? There is a second question, namely: Have new influential and decisive dimensions shifted to the primary level over the past decade to afford new backing and new support to the NP&#x2019;s concept of separate development as an alternative to the UP&#x2019;s policy eventual power-sharing and the PRP&#x2019;s policy of eventual Black majority government? That question can be answered with a resounding &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. This &#x201C;yes&#x201D; is based on three aspects.</p>

<p>The first is that within the concept of separate development we have established the component of a geo-political line. When I refer to the establishment of a geo-political <span class="col_5653-5654" refersTo="page_0157"/>line, then we are on firm ground and we have history on our side. The geo-political line implies far more than a geographic abode. A geo-political line implies political power. It implies the free right of every people, on its own initiative and without being restricted, to develop and mobilize its own hidden, latent and potential creative physical and mental powers. By establishing a geo-political line we are not defying history; this is <i>realpolitiek</i>.</p>

<p>The whole political drama that has taken place in Africa over the past two decades has been intimately bound up with the decisive and important role played by the geo-political line. Without the geo-political line the awakening and the development of nationalism would have been impossible throughout history. I refer to Cyprus, to Scotland, and to the conflict between Russia and China with regard to geo-political lines. The old conflict between the Kashmir and the Punjab in India has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that no political development can escape the significance of the geo-political line. I merely put the question whether, in our efforts to normalize our relations with the Coloureds, we shall ever succeed in ignoring the significance of the geo-political line.</p>

<p>The second aspect on which this resounding &#x201C;yes&#x201D; is based, is a new dimension which, like a new heavyweight, has appeared on the world scene over the past two decades, namely economic interdependence. This is a <i>force majeure</i> which has woven worldwide interstate relations into totally new patterns. Economic interdependence has given the Third World and the Fourth World their significance and their present form. Resources and raw materials, of which South Africa and the Transkei have an inexhaustible arsenal, make of economic interdependence a mighty dimension, a decisive dimension, within this new inter-state relationship which will come into being after 26 October 1976 with regard to the Transkei. Economic interdependence, the possession of resources and the sharing of those resources among states has virtually neutralized the significance of old historical instruments of power.</p>

<p>If you reach for the weapon, then I reach for the raw material. If you reach for economic power, then I reach for oil. It converts virtually every conceivable raw material into a powerful political weapon. We in South Africa have inexhaustible energy resources. We have untapped technological resources. We have raw materials. We have manpower. We have food. We have everything. We have an arsenal from which we can draw. And that arsenal cannot be exhausted by the Transkei or by <i>us</i>. These resources are our guarantee that behind that geo-political line both can exist, one on this side and one on the other. These resources and this economic interdependence will convert the geo-political line into a permanent border of peace.</p>

<p>The third basis&#x2014;and I want to let this suffice&#x2014;is the new stream of technology which is flowing across geo-political borders. This will contribute towards our taking the heat out of those problems which will still exist after the independence of the Transkei. I have in mind more rapid transport and the emotional garb in which migrant labour is clothed today in this country and elsewhere. We shall strip it and restrict to a minimum the evils which migrant labour involves. Our economy is not the only one which makes use of migrant labour. At this moment there are more than 2,1 million migrant labourers in West Germany from various parts of the world. Let me conclude by saying that the pressure of the Bantu on the Whites in the White areas is lessening. The pressure is becoming less. In 1960 there were 3 million more Bantu than Whites in the White area. In 1974 it was a little more than 1 million, viz. 2 million fewer Bantu in the White areas than was the case five years ago. [Interjections.] The figure is correct. That hon. member must go and see for himself and not rely on my brains. Sir, I see a strong two-way stream between the economy of the White area and that of the Transkei after 26 October and I predict a drop in temperature with regard to the problems we shall still be facing. Sir, I am once again dreaming dreams; I dream because if one stops dreaming, then one is like the United Party; they cannot dream any more and when one can no longer dream, one is finished. I am full of courage and I have great faith in the fact that our policy of separate development, as it will come to fruition on 26 October in the form of the independence of the Transkei, is a remarkable and scientifically well-founded policy which will be capable of standing the test of time.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I may hurriedly reply to the speech of the hon. <span class="col_5655-5656" refersTo="page_0158"/>member for Carletonville, I simply want to say that he merely confirmed what I had suspected, which is that he is indeed living in a dream world and is not facing the realities of the matter. I should be glad if the hon. member for Carletonville could spell out to us once and for all what he has in mind with geo-political lines in the case of the Coloureds. It is no use his venturing a shot in the dark and simply leaving the matter at that. He should tell us exactly what his views are with regard to the Coloureds and the geopolitical lines he wants to draw.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>We are not dealing with the Coloureds now, but with the Bantu.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>In the third place I just want to say with regard to his reference to economic interdependence, that it is very clear that economic interdependence may well be a factor in accomplishing sound political relations. However, this does not follow as a matter of course and the existence of interdependence is no guarantee for sound political relations. We see this in southern Africa. The other day we learnt of the statements made by Sir Seretse Khama, the President of Botswana. I say this is no guarantee, because interdependence is a matter with differences in degree, because more than one country is always involved in the interdependence of any particular country. I leave it at that.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Carletonville rightly said&#x2014;he and I usually get on very well&#x2014;we have come to the end of a very important debate. To my mind certain main points have emerged from this debate. We have again had a very clear statement, as we have just had from the hon. member, of the philosophy and ideology of separate development. In addition to this there has been the development of the homelands. I am grateful for the positive note we have had in this regard and I want to state very clearly that our own standpoint in this regard has also been stated very clearly, and that is that we do indeed welcome any steps which promote the development of the homelands.</p>

<p>The third main point has been the independence of the Transkei, and some of the implications of that independence, in particular the question of the citizenship of Xhosa-speaking people who are permanently resident outside the Transkei. In addition to this we have dealt with the position of the Whites who are resident inside the Transkei, as well as the question of their citizenship and economic prospects. In the fourth place we have discussed the matter of the purchase of farms in order to carry into effect the so-called consolidation proposals which Parliament passed here last year. The fifth question was that of the Bantu in the cities. In this regard we have once again had a repetition of the ideological views of our colleagues opposite. This, of course, involves the question of housing. Because we are extremely concerned about this matter, as the hon. member for Jeppe has indicated, I am very sorry that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not entered this debate before me.</p>

<p>Since we have come to the end of this debate, I ask myself what positive aspects have emerged in the course of this debate. As far as I am concerned, the only significant rays of light have been the emphasis placed on the economic development of the homelands. We have also had the aspect raised by the hon. member for Innesdal, viz. that we should find a different basis for financing the social and other services for the Bantu in the cities. Those services should not be financed from liquor profits. There has also been the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that employers may possibly be placed in a position to build also family homes in urban areas. I hope he will apply this to the Western Cape as well. We have also had the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s announcement concerning the committee of inquiry into race discrimination. That committee&#x2019;s report was being considered, he said, by the Cabinet at the present time, and I trust that that report will be made available to everyone before long as this is a matter which certainly does not concern only the Government. There has also been the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s announcement that the recommendations of the committee of inquiry into influx control are being implemented. This, too, is a matter which goes much further than simply the officials and the implementation of measures. This is a matter of the greatest concern to this House and to large numbers of people in South Africa. Therefore, I want to ask the hon. the Minister to tell us what the changes are that have been recommended by the committee. Finally, we have dealt with the methods concerning the purchase of farms and the financing of such purchases. I think it was the <span class="col_5657-5658" refersTo="page_0159"/>hon. member for Aliwal in particular who made a very positive contribution in this regard.</p>

<p>These, to my mind, are the only positive points which have emerged from this debate up to now. There are two groups of people for whom this debate has held no promise.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>The one group is the Whites in the Transkei, and here I am referring specifically to their position and their interests there. The second group is the Blacks permanently settled outside the homelands, particularly in our urban areas. I wish I had the ability to give expression to the degree of frustration and bitterness among our urban Bantu. We may behave like ostriches if we wish, but in my own mind there is not the slightest doubt that tremendous frustration and bitterness exist. This debate, however, has not offered those people a single word of hope. There has not been a single message of encouragement. There has not even been a sympathetic attitude from the side of the Government. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will be able to bring a little more light into the darkness prevailing here. I also want to refer to the speech which the hon. member for False Bay made yesterday in connection with the squatters at Crossroads. I know what the legal position is. According to law those people are here illegally but there has been no sympathetic approach to the human tragedy involved. To want to do away with that problem simply by saying that those people are here illegally, is no solution. This Parliament may make any law it wishes. Parliament may prescribe that we are to leave our homes tomorrow. But is the fact that Parliament may make any law, a criterion to apply? The hon. members maintain that the people are here illegally, but I want to put this very simple question: If, in the thirties, at the time of the great depression, the Afrikaner people were to have been told (a) you may go to Cape Town or Johannesburg only if you have a permit; (b) you will not be allowed to bring your family with you; (c) you will not be allowed to own a house there nor may you buy or build your own home there, how would the Afrikaners have reacted? However, we now try to lay down those conditions in respect of people who are being forced by similar circumstances to move to the urban areas. We simply cannot get away from that fact.</p>

<p>The biggest disappointment to me was the speech of the hon. member opposite who mentioned express transport as a solution to our problems and attached the labour zoning idea to this. Evidently the hon. member is not aware of the fact that there are people who have made a study of express transport and evidently he does not know either that immeasurable problems would arise for us if we were to apply labour zoning, as applicable to our Bantu, to the Bantu of the Transkei. Shall we be able to tell the people of the Transkei that Cape Town is the only city to which they may go for employment? Shall we be able to tell the people of Lesotho that Vereeniging is the only place to which they may go for employment? The hon. member is living in a dream world, completely removed from reality.</p>

<p>I want to touch on another matter. I refer to the question of citizenship, and as I understand the speech of the hon. the Minister, he said that the Transkei would pass legislation in terms of which the Xhosa-speaking people outside the Transkei would become citizens of the Transkei so that they would be given Transkeian citizenship automatically. He also said that if the Transkei were to refuse to regard certain people as citizens of the Transkei, such people would be in a situation of statelessness. This is how I understand the approach of the Government. According to my interpretation of the legislation, no other legislature than this very Parliament can deprive someone of his South African citizenship. This applies to my South African citizenship as well as that of the hon. the Minister. We may do what we like, but only this Parliament, and no other institution can deprive us of our citizenship. Section 2(5) of the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970, provides very clearly that citizenship of a territorial authority area will not detract from a Bantu person&#x2019;s citizenship of South Africa.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it seems to me as though I have to close the doors now since we have come to the end of the time allotted to hon. members for this debate. I indicated yesterday that I should like to address the hon. <span class="col_5659-5660" refersTo="page_0160"/>member for Jeppe in connection with the matter of housing affairs which he had raised. As I go along I shall also discuss points raised by the hon. member for Edenvale, who has just resumed his seat. The hon. member for Edenvale accused us of seemingly having an unsympathetic approach to the problems of the Bantu in certain situations and made specific reference to the squatter problem which we were experiencing here in the Cape.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is near-sighted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The very way in which we are dealing with that problem, is proof of the fact that we do have sympathy. If that hon. member thinks that the squatters&#x2019; presence here has solved their problems, and that we should simply allow them to continue living here, he is making a mistake. The very steps we are taking are aimed at solving the problems and misery resulting from their presence here. This is the sympathy we have. As far as those hon. members are concerned, the more they slip on the political road, the more they think there are instant solutions and the more they think one can simply allow certain situations to remain as they are. An attitude of this kind actually gets us nowhere.</p>

<p>Concerning the hon. member for Jeppe, I want to say that while I do not want to be unfriendly towards him, I should nevertheless point out that in his whole speech&#x2014;I have a copy of it available&#x2014;there is only one statement which is correct, and that is that there is a housing shortage. As I go along I shall prove to the hon. member why I am saying this and that certain things which he wants to have done, have been in existence for several years and are being implemented by the department. The hon. member said we possibly had one of the darkest pictures with regard to housing that the Government had ever had since coming into power. But has the hon. member forgotten that we inherited pitch black darkness? If he speaks of &#x201C;dark&#x201D; now, with which words would he describe the conditions which we inherited at that time and which we have since cleared up? I think his memory is very short. I do not wish to&#x2014;nor shall I&#x2014;minimize the problem which we have with the shortage of housing. It is a problem to which we shall have to give serious attention before it gets any bigger.</p>

<p>Having said this, I do want to add that we are nevertheless performing wonders in the meantime. Allow me to mention three facts only. In the homeland towns of Umlazi and Ntuzuma 23 000 dwelling units have been provided over a period of approximately 15 years. Now hon. members will say that this in the homelands and not in the White area. Therefore, allow me to add to this at once, that if we had not made that provision in homeland towns, most of those people would, what is more, have lived in the White area. At the moment 1 000 dwelling units have been approved for Bloemfontenin. In Mabopane East and Mabopane West 7 500 dwelling units have been provided over the past six years. Therefore, the programme is continuing all the time. Let me come to a matter touched on by the hon. member for Jeppe. He referred to the standard, the quality, of the houses provided. This is a matter to which constant attention is being given, and the standards are being improved. An agreement has been entered into with the National Building Research Institute to conduct research into this very matter of standards for us. From the side of the department we are making a financial donation to them. They have experts in their service who have worked at UNO and who have conducted research in Africa and in South America. The experts maintain that South Africa is leading the world in the field of the handling of sub-economic housing and the upgrading of squatter conditions. The hon. member should remember that it is of no avail if we only provide for a select group of people and give them everything while neglecting those who are lower down on the list. We must see to both groups.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the improvement scheme. I do not think the hon. member referred to it. The improvement scheme already existed when the previous home-ownership scheme was still in operation, in 1968 when the original home-ownership scheme was withdrawn, a special circular was sent to local authorities stating that the improvement scheme would not be cancelled, but would be continued. It still exists today.</p>

<p>With reference to the provision of housing by employers, the hon. member said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are certain methods, however, by means of which this problem can be tackled. Recently, for instance, a suggestion was <span class="col_5661-5662" refersTo="page_0161"/>made whereby employers were encouraged to provide housing for their employees.</block>

<p>This is not a suggestion which has just been made. It is a measure which has been in existence for a long time. It has been in existence for the past five or six years. This measure has been in existence, first with regard to single housing and now with regard to family housing as well.</p>

<p>The question of tax rebate may have slipped the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind as he had to devote his attention to quite a number of other matters which had been brought to his attention. However, concessions do exist in the form of tax rebates. Twenty-five per cent of the money spent, to a maximum of R2 500 per employer, may be deducted for income tax purposes in terms of section 11(t) of the Income Tax Act. The hon. member said that if only we would make these concessions and would do things of this kind, he believed the housing problem could be solved.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Those measures already exist. The hon. member should assist in seeing to it that people carry out these measures, so that we may in fact make progress in the field of housing.</p>

<p>As far as home ownership schemes are concerned, the hon. member said with reference to a prominent Black man in Soweto&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; if he were given the opportunity of owing his own home &#x2026;</block>

<p>Listen carefully now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he would even be prepared to take it for 30 years provided no strings were attached.</block>

<p>He may have it for 30 years with the &#x201C;strings attached&#x201D; and still have the option to renew it for a further 30 years. This does exist, and the hon. the Minister yesterday gave the guarantee concerning the privileges in terms of section 10, something on which I agree with him. Someone who has a certificate of citizenship, ought to enjoy greater privileges and greater advantages than the Bantu who do not have this in the White area.</p>

<p>Methods are constantly being sought for the more effective financing of housing in the White areas. The hon. member for Innesdal also referred to this. He made special mention of the fact that it worried him that administration boards had to fill their purses by constantly stimulating liquor sales. I assume I understood the hon. member correctly, i.e. that he meant that Bantu beer played such an important part in the socio-cultural scheme of things of the Bantu that that type of liquor should still be sold to the Bantu.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to the hon. member for Innesdal. The hon. member asked us not to leave it at that, but to seek other methods of financing. I agree with the hon. member. One of the things he mentioned, was the fact that the Bantu himself should make a bigger contribution as he had progressed considerably on the road to better remuneration. This is true. I want to state clearly that I agree whole-heartedly with the hon. member. The days are over when the Bantu, also as regards housing, had to hold out his hands imploringly for the Government and the White man to drop everything into them. There are Bantu who can provide for themselves. The hon. member pointed out that there were Black people who were even prepared to spend R10 000 on housing. There are some Black people who can do this. Those who can provide for themselves, will have to do so. They can also borrow money from private financial institutions. Those who cannot make it on their own, will still be provided for by the State.</p>

<p>However, there are other methods, too, which are being investigated, methods which are aimed at improving financing in order to create a better housing set-up for the Black man in the urban areas. [Time expired.]</p>

<from><span class="col_5663-5664" refersTo="page_0162"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, since we have now reached the end of the discussion of this Vote, and before I react to the speeches by two or three individual members, I should like to convey a word of thanks to hon. members on the Government side in the first place, for the way in which they have participated in this debate. Hon. members on this side have indeed painted a very fine picture of the activities of my department to date, a picture of the past. Some hon. members based their speeches on the thought that I have occupied this post for ten years now. Others went back further than those ten years. I want to give hon. members the assurance that the picture they have painted of the activities of this department over the past decade was a very clear one. However, hon. members on the Government side did not merely look back. They looked ahead, too, and painted a picture of the path that lay ahead. One can only reconnoitre the road ahead if one also takes into account where one has come from. That is why the past is important and that, too, is what hon. members on this side of the House have done.</p>

<p>It would take an unnecessary amount of time to refer to each member separately. However, throughout the debate I have listened to every hon. member&#x2019;s speech and kept a note of the central theme of every speech made by hon. members on this side of the House. Not a single member on the Government side participated in this debate in anything but a meaningful way. Indeed, once again I was filled with tremendous pride to hear the positive contributions made by hon. members on the Government side. It was clear that they clearly perceived the wider dimension and the wider perspective&#x2014;to use the words of the hon. member for Carletonville&#x2014;of these developments. This ought to be an inspiration to all of us. This in fact is the picture painted by hon. members on this side of the House, to which the hon. member for Edenvale referred a moment ago. The hon. member for Edenvale&#x2014;I shall deal with his speech later&#x2014;summed up the course of the debate. According to him one of the rays of light in this regard was the development of the homelands which was outlined here. Without exception this was pointed to by members on our side of the House only. I did not hear a single member opposite say anything positive or constructive in connection with the development of the Bantu homelands. What we did have from them&#x2014;and I am not arguing about the fact that the Opposition has the right to act in this way&#x2014;was analytical questions. However, there was nothing constructive. All they did was to carp and level criticism, some of which was false as regards the presentation of what this important department does. Hon. members will see that the same thing will happen when the next Vote&#x2014;Bantu Education&#x2014;comes up for discussion. What do these two departments do together? If hon. members look at the amounts voted for the two departments, departments which are run by one Minister and which get some of the largest amounts in the budget, they can well ask what is being done with these amounts. What do we create with the money we get? To this I want to say that I am proud that a true picture is painted by hon. members on my side of the House. It is a pity that the Opposition did not do the same. As I have already said, they have the right to speak analytically and make inquiries. They made use of this right. However I am of the opinion that the Opposition has a wider duty to perform, particularly with regard to an important matter such as this.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few more words in connection with the minor difference of opinion between the hon. member for Griqualand East and myself last night with reference to the information I furnished in reply to the question put by the hon. member for East London City. I have no quarrel with the hon. member for East London City. He understood me correctly throughout. However, it is the hon. member for Griqualand East who understood me wrongly. What was the argument about? It was about the availability of money in the present financial year for the purchase of properties&#x2014;not only businesses, but all kinds of properties&#x2014;from Whites in the Transkei. It could be shops at the outposts, it could be business enterprises in the towns and it could be buildings or unimproved plots. It could be any kind of property from Whites in the Transkei. I mentioned the amount&#x2014;the hon. member mentioned it himself&#x2014;which was being voted for this in the budget. The hon. member pointed out that the amount was smaller than last year. I added that additional revenue was to be included. This was revenue which amounted to about R800 000 in the year <span class="col_5665-5666" refersTo="page_0163"/>ending March 1975. I estimated this amount because I did not have the data before me. I added that the amount could be more or less the same this year. The hon. member for East London City, and the hon. member for Griqualand East in particular, had some reservations about the amount I mentioned subsequently, when the hon. member asked me a second time, I rose and referred him to para. 8.1. of the Auditor-General&#x2019; s book. I did not mention the paragraph then, but I do so now. I estimated the amount at about R800 000, but it appears that I underestimated the amount. That is where the hon. member misunderstood me. I said that I underestimated the amount, because the amount furnished by the Auditor-General was R831 484. I have now eliminated the uncertainty in this regard by quoting the exact figure for the year ending March 1975. The hon. member may take it that it will probably be about the same in the present year, perhaps more. I have pointed out all these things.</p>

<p>Subsequently the hon. member came along and quoted para. 8.2.2. This is three paragraphs further on and deals with something entirely different, involving other figures. The paragraph he quoted was not in respect of the total amount. Para. 8.1 relates to the total amount and the hon. member for Griqualand East read the paragraph which deals with certain properties purchased. It only relates to commercial properties and not the total purchases. The hon. member did not give the full picture. That is the second mistake the hon. member made in his arithmetic yesterday. He admitted the one, although not as a mistake. However, it was a mistake. He argued with me about a difference as regards the amount voted for the Transkei. He put it at more than R60 million and I said that it was only about R30 million. Subsequently the hon. member admitted that he had added one figure twice. He should rather not have added one figure twice, but the correct two figures only once; he would then have obtained the correct answer. The hon. member spoke twice yesterday and in both speeches he made very serious calculating errors. And around him there is a group of people who crow and make out that he is a hero with his correct figures. That hon. member should be more careful when he quotes figures here in the House. I am now going to leave the hon. member in peace.</p>

<p>However, in his second speech yesterday the hon. member put a question to me which I should like to reply to now because this is the first opportunity I have had. The hon. member asked what the position of the White people in the Transkei, who are not Transkeians, would be as far as taxes were concerned. It ought to be very clear to the hon. member what the position will be there. People who earn their money in the Transkei will, of course, be subject to tax which the Transkeian Government may impose. Our officials who are there and who will remain on the establishment and payroll will not, of course, be subject to that because they will still be receiving their money from us. The other people, however, will be subject to the tax imposed by the Transkei.</p>

<p>I still owe the hon. member for Pinetown an answer. I see that the hon. member is not present and I take it that he has a good reason for that. I do not take it amiss of him. The hon. member put questions to me concerning problems at Ndwedwe. In the meantime I have ascertained what the position is. Those of us who have been to Pinetown and Ndwedwe will know that the topography there is very difficult, because there are gigantic ravines, valleys and rivers. It is therefore very difficult for people to travel to the office at Ndwedwe via a detour. The KwaZulu Administration realizes this. It has already been decided by the KwaZulu Administration that a sub-office ought to be established in this region near the place to which the hon. member referred so that the people can apply there for their requirements. The possibility of establishing a special district there so that the area may have its own district office has already been suggested. In the meanwhile, until such time as these things have come about, additional facilities are provided in the form of a mobile unit which travels there once a month to serve the people there locally. The authorities, therefore, understand the difficulties of the people in that area. We hope to provide better facilities presently in the form of a sub-office, and perhaps even in the form of a district office. The hon. member also pointed out to me that application forms for birth certificates for Bantu were not available. It is true that the submission of birth certificates is a requirement for the admission of children to schools. As a result there was a big rush of people who required birth certificates. The stock of forms was temporarily exhausted and a problem <span class="col_5667-5668" refersTo="page_0164"/>arose, but I believe that it has been surmounted by now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Carletonville made a good speech. I have only the highest praise for it. It was an outstanding speech. It was yet another example of that positive picture which has been painted.</p>

<p>In his speech the hon. member for Edenvale, did, in a certain sense, do something that was useful in a small way and I want to praise him for it. In a nice, typically professorial way, as befits him at the end of the year before the examination, he gave his students a r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; of the whole two-day debate, all the main themes.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Is that so? Then they knew the story very well themselves. Without making any comment, the hon. member mentioned a great many things. Everything was very correct&#x2014;all the themes discussed here in the debate. The theme which he started to comment on was the one to which I have just referred. That was when he mentioned the rays of light that were visible in this debate. The one ray of light which, according to him, was visible was in connection with the development which is occurring in the bantu homelands. In that connection I want to remind him of what I said a moment ago, namely that those rays of light were presented by this side of the House. The hon. member need not do it now, because he is not going to speak again, but he can come and tell me privately which of his members there, or of the members in the other little Opposition party, spoke about this ray of light, the fine economic development that there has been in the homelands. He may as well come and tell me. I should like to hear. Sir, not one of them did so. It was the hon. members on this side of the House who described that ray of light.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about the interdepartmental investigation into influx control to which I referred. Now I want to tell the hon. member that we have given an undertaking to certain representatives of the Bantu leaders to hold a very thorough and comprehensive discussion with them. This has already been referred to in this House. I think that this has already been referred to in the past by no less a person than the hon. the Prime Minister, among others. It has been said that we want to hold discussions with the Black leaders concerning the degree to which we can bring about a revision of influx control without throwing the system overboard, but nevertheless with a view to modernization and improvement. Before we have completed those discussions with the Bantu, I do not want to discuss our views on changes in influx control here. I should like to talk to them first. I think the hon. member will appreciate my furnishing this explanation now.</p>

<p>The hon. member went on to say that for two groups of people the debate seemed to be of very little use. One of those groups, he said, was the Transkeian Whites. The hon. member nods his head in agreement; I can almost hear it over here. Sir, what does the hon. member mean when he states that there was nothing in the debate for the Whites of the Transkei? He is now climbing on the same old bandwagon as the &#x201C;selling down the river &#x201D; bandwagon we heard about yesterday. He does so in order to intimate that there is nothing in this debate for the Whites of the Transkei. In this debate I repeated the assurances which we have given and implemented since 1963. I repeated the assurance given in the February statement, to which I referred. I said here what the Prime Minister and I and others have said on a number of occasions, namely that we guarantee the Whites and the Coloureds established in the Transkei their security in connection with the take-over of their properties etc. when they leave the Transkei in due course.</p>

<p>Good heavens, Sir; now the hon. member wants to know how many years it is going to take. Here we again have the same insinuations we had yesterday. On the one hand the hon. member for Griqualand East wants the people to be able to leave the Transkei as soon as possible, and on the other hand he himself wants to remain there as long as possible. You will see, Sir, that that hon. member for Griqualand East will be one of those people who will cling to the Transkei with all his might and till his last gasp. He himself will not try to get out of there quickly. He will try to stay there as long as possible. And do you know, Sir, what his greatest advantage is? The longer he stays there, the longer this Government will continue to give him guarantees there.</p>

<p>Before the sun has set today, the hon. member may go. I shall ask the Secretary to get hold of a form right away on which the hon. member can set down his own property. [Interjections.] But the hon. member is now engaged in all kinds of fancy footwork. He has just asked when he can go. My witnesses are sitting here, and I say to that hon. member that he can go before the sun sets today.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Edenvale that this debate has once again, for the umpteenth time, given and repeated to the Whites in the Transkei the assurance we have already given. We have said that we as a White Government are behind them, and we give them guarantees which no Whites elsewhere in Africa have had. In fact, we have had to accept responsibility for Whites in other parts of Africa in the past and we shall even do so for our people in the Transkei.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member states that the other group for whom nothing was forthcoming from this debate are the Bantu in the White area. I myself have tried to provide a fundamental outline here of the value, the significance to the Bantu of being here in the White area in terms of our policy&#x2014;not in terms of the hon. member&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;if it is borne in mind that they are here as citizens of their own homelands and identify themselves with their own peoples. I pointed out that they would be far more welcome here in our area as a result of such an identification and would have far more privileges, far more concessions, far more recognition and far more incentive than when they did not want to recognize that citizenship which was theirs. We have referred here to housing matters. The Deputy Minister spoke of this matter this very afternoon. But then the hon. member comes along and does a very, very stupid thing for a person of his professorial knowledge of these matters. He actually compared&#x2014;and I made inquiries here as to whether I had heard him correctly&#x2014;the Afrikaner&#x2019;s migration to the urban areas whereas, as he said, they did not need permits for that and permits were not required either, with the migration of the Bantu to the urban areas. [Interjections.] Now the hon. member sees what a grave error of reasoning he has committed and how wrongly he has reasoned.</p>

<p>Sir, this is the distorted thinking I spoke about yesterday, viz. that in terms of his integrationist approach he equates Whites and the Bantu with each other in White South Africa, whereas the Whites here are in their own homeland and do not need to have a permit when they leave the farm to go to the city because it all takes place within their own homeland. However this does apply to the Bantu because here we differentiate between the two groups: The one in another man&#x2019;s homeland and the other in his own homeland. This is what the hon. member does not understand, and the comparison he made here is therefore a stupid comparison. It is a comparison which one ought to fail in an examination if one were to give it as an answer.</p>

<p>There the professor fails again for the second time. This hon. professor who is now a member of Parliament is today referring to the division of South Africa. Sir, we are not dividing South Africa today. <span class="col_5671-5672" refersTo="page_0166"/>[Interjections.] Oh, really, there is an hon. old gentleman who does not know it either. Sir, we are not dividing South Africa today. This story, that we are now dividing up South Africa, that we have to divide up wealth and that we have to share power with each other, is an extremely dangerous one, and we are hearing it a great deal. It is an extremely dangerous approach on the part of the Opposition. Even before 1910 South Africa was divided among Whites and Blacks. It was a historic division. All we are doing today is to amplify the promise we began to carry out in 1913 and which we gave effect to in this same House in 1936, by increasing the amount of land by 70% so as to carry out that promise in full. We are not dividing South Africa up.</p>

<p>The hon. member made a second mistake, too, this afternoon. I think he should analyse his basic philosophical approach in regard to our policy a little more carefully. I can recommend some good literature. In fact, within five minutes I can give him three or four excellent pamphlets to read&#x2014;written by one N. J. J. Olivier, onetime lecturer at the University of Stellenbosch. Those pamphlets were published by an organization of which he was one of the brilliant members and officeholders. I am referring to Savra.

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I request the privilege of the half-hour, although I will most probably not make use of the full period. On behalf of this side of the House I want to express our sincere thanks for the departmental report on Bantu Education which reaches us in time every year and is therefore available for proper study and analysis. We are also grateful to the Department of Bantu Education because they make such wealth of factual material available to us in that report. We are sincerely grateful for it. I must say this report compares very favourably with the type of abbreviated report we regularly receive from the principal department, the Department of Bantu Administration and Education.</p>

<p>I also want to speak with great appreciation of the dedication of the officials of the Department of Bantu Education. They do an excellent job of work, sometimes under very difficult circumstances. This is very clear to all of us. This afternoon I want to discuss two aspects in particular. The one is the Snyman Report on Turfloop, and then certain general matters concerning Bantu education, especially those which concern the Western Cape. My colleagues will then touch on other aspects of Bantu education. In connection with the Snyman Report, I would like to take the House&#x2019;s memory back for a moment, to sketch the background to separate universities.</p>

<p>In 1958 a commission was appointed to go into this matter. The hon. the Minister may perhaps derive something of value from the evidence which was given before that commission. On that occasion a minority report was published. I should now like to indicate the main points of that minority report. By the way, that minority report was signed by members who sat on the UP side of this House at that time, namely Messrs. Moore, Louis Steenkamp, Mrs. Margaret Ballinger and Messrs. Steytler and Ronald Butcher. The chief recommendations of the minority report are summarized in the following nine points in which the minority report&#x2019;s points of difference with the main report are indicated.</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) It (the minority report) rejects the plan for a council and an advisory council and for a senate and an advisory senate in favour of one council and one senate for each university college.</li>

<li>(ii) It rejects the principle of racial separation implicit in the scheme for two councils and two senates.</li>

<li>(iii) It provides for full rights of the council of each college as a body corporate with authority within the institution for which it is constituted. <span class="col_5673-5674" refersTo="page_0167"/>This includes the right, subject to the approval of the Minister, to appoint the staff who shall be its employees.</li>

<li>(iv) It provides for representation on the council of other than Government nominees.</li>

<li>(v) It rejects exclusive ethnic divisions as the foundation of any university college established under the Act.</li>

<li>(vi) It correspondingly rejects the proposal that finance to establish and maintain Bantu university colleges should be provided from and through the Bantu Education Account.</li>

<li>(vii) It provides for the association of the colleges during their formative years with any South African university or universities and for such association with at least one such university.</li>

<li>(viii) It proposes the postponement of the closing of the &#x201C;open&#x201D; universities for at least ten years; and</li>

<li>(ix) Finally it specifies the Minister in charge of higher education as the Minister in terms of the Bill.</li></ol>

<p>We had the Snyman Report after certain problems arose at the University of the North. On practically every point that commission found the points which appeared in the minority report at the time to be correct and it was consequently recommended that changes be made in this connection. The hon. the Minister, in his reaction to the recommendations also indicated that most of the recommendations of the Snyman Commission had indeed been accepted and would be applied.</p>

<p>I gave evidence before the commission on behalf of SABRA, and as hon. members will notice in the minority report, many of the recommendations included in it, are recommendations which SABRA submitted to the commission at the time. The hon. member for Rissik is always talking about change, but I want to urge him to read the recommendations which we submitted to the commission at the time. He will derive great benefit from it.</p>

<p>I referred to these recommendations specifically in order to indicate the problem with the hon. members on the opposite side that we are faced with. Time and time again we make recommendations, not for the sake of party-political advantage, but recommendations which we believe are indeed right and necessary for the sake of the situation in our country, and time and time again these recommendations are rejected. After that we need situations like the one which arose at Turfloop before the Government is compelled to alter its policy and standpoint. This of course creates a very dangerous precedent. Once the conviction grows upon our Black people that the only manner in which they can bring about a change&#x2014;changes which are logical and apply to things which should have been done correctly in the first place&#x2014;is to have a repeat of Turfloop, then we are pursuing a very dangerous course.</p>

<p>I want to inform the House of my personal experience. At the time I was offered the principalship of one of those university colleges and with this in mind I was even nominated member of the council of one of the colleges. Eventually, when I had to decide whether I would accept the appointment as principal, I asked the Minister of Bantu Education&#x2014;it was before the Bill was published&#x2014;to tell me how the colleges would be managed. His answer was that the maximum degree of apartheid would be applied in the colleges. The non-Whites at that university would not have representation in the senate together with the Whites and the council would consist of Whites only. An advisory council for Bantu would be established and there would be differentiation as far as salary scales were concerned. He went further and said that they would try to bring about the minimum of contact between Whites and non-Whites, both mutually on an interpersonal as well as on staff and student level. I found time and time again at those colleges that the Black students had separate tearoom and were not even allowed to sit in the same tearoom with their White fellow colleagues. Can you understand in what spirit the Black people under those circumstances, approached those colleges from the outset. I am grateful that, because of the service which those colleges have rendered, a part of that suspicion and opposition has disappeared. However, the lesson is very clear: If we dish up something to the Blacks in this way, whether it be citizenship in the Transkei, or anything else for that <span class="col_5675-5676" refersTo="page_0168"/>matter, if we do things which amount to depriving them of the rights which they enjoyed, such as the right which they had to attend open universities if those universities would admit them, if we do things which no one in his proper mind can justify, we are looking for trouble. Nor must hon. members on the opposite side tell me that the changes which were made, were merely an adjustment and an unfolding or extension of the policy, because this is not correct. These things have already been said. I have such statements before me. However, I leave it at that. Let me just add that here I discussed the contents of the Snyman Commission&#x2019;s report here on a previous occasion. I pointed out what that report tells us, namely that a spirit of opposition exists, as became apparent at Turfloop, and that that spirit of opposition was not only due to circumstances at that university, but that it also reflected the overall situation in this country. The importance of our task in this House and in this debate is to find methods to eliminate that friction in some way or another. Now hon. members can understand my disappointment that we have done things in the past few days which are in fact inclined to increase the intensity of the conflict and the possibility of confrontation.</p>

<p>At this stage, may I say that this is the first time that this Vote will be dealt with by the new hon. Deputy Minister for Bantu Education. We wish him everything of the best in this connection. Mr. Chairman, you will know that many misgivings exist about the views of this hon. Deputy Minister. Allow me to say&#x2014;I must say this because it is the truth&#x2014;that there was tremendous disappointment amongst the Blacks at that appointment. The hon. the Deputy Minister will have an tremendous task to gain the confidence of the Blacks in dealing with this Vote. We wish him all success, because he is faced with a tremendous challenge.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>In particular I want to refer here to a few aspects of Bantu education in the Western Cape. Until recently I as well as other people noted with great appreciation the progress that had been taking place in the sphere of Bantu education. In the last few years, however, an atmosphere has developed in Bantu education&#x2014;I am now referring to the teachers, the children and the parents&#x2014;which is alarming. This applies to the Western Cape in particular. The problem of double shifts, which destroys proper education, the extremely poor conditions in the schools themselves, and the absence of equipment are all fundamental bottlenecks. For instance needlework is offered as an optional subject. In the course of their school education it is in fact the only subject which many girls can possibly take. However, the necessary equipment for this, is not provided. On the other hand the subsidy which is paid, is hopelessly inadequate to provide even the most rudimentary requirements for offering this course. You can go and see for yourselves what is available at those schools for offering science subjects, subjects like physics, chemistry, etc., subjects for which equipment is necessary. Go and see what they have there and compare it to the equipment of the poorest White school there is. This is an unthinkable situation. It is simply unthinkable. It simply cannot go on like this.</p>

<p>I have often objected in this House to the fact that no new high schools for Bantu children are being built in our urban areas. This is an unthinkable situation. It is a situation which not one of us here would endure. I want to repeat once again that the simplest rule is still that we should do unto others as we would like them to do unto us, even though this is considered by some people to be a mere catch-phrase.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the policy which is being followed at present causes the break up of families. It is the cause of children being sent away from their parents at the most receptive age and when they need the discipline of their parents the most. It also entails tremendous financial burdens for the parents. This is something which ought to touch the heart of every parent sitting here. Do you know what it costs a parent to send his child to King William&#x2019;s Town, since the railway concessions for school children have been cancelled? Two return journeys per year cost at least R112. The fare to Umtata is even higher. To that must still be added the cost of books, of school clothes, of ordinary clothes. If children live with their parents, it is still possible to devise ways and means. When children are sent away, however, it causes other problems. I can continue in this way. There is still the <span class="col_5677-5678" refersTo="page_0169"/>cost of boarding. School hostels are not able to accommodate all the children. As a result they must board with private people. Seen from a financial point of view, those people are being ruined. The result is that many parents are simply unable to send their children to school, do not want to send them, and that many children do not want to go to school. In other words, we are creating a group of frustrated people, and on top of that a group of lay-abouts and juvenile delinquents. This is the result of the policy which is being followed in that regard.</p>

<p>Apart from that there are still the legal implications. The parents know this. They know that when a registration certificate or an identity document is issued to their child, the fact that they lose the right to reside permanently in the urban area, is used to tell them that they have lost their qualification in terms of section 10 of the Urban Areas Act. This is a totally impossible situation. This is a situation which has been divested of any common sense or of any morality. Mr. Chairman, I am choosing my words.</p>

<p>We have taken cognizance &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>No, there is nothing poisonous about it. I am trying to convey something to the hon. member which he as a parent ought to realize. He must please not speak of poison. [Interjections.] We took cognizance of the announcement by the hon. the Minister that free books would be available to pupils in Bantu schools until 1979. There is a tremendous need in those schools and we must move as rapidly as possible. There is no doubt that our Bantu teachers are poorly equipped. If hon. members do not know it I want to tell them that, as a result of the demoralization which has set in in Bantu education in the Western Cape, there is a complete lack of discipline today. There is a complete lack of discipline among both teachers and pupils in Bantu schools. There is also the chronic shortage of classroom space and the absence of any assistance to school principals. Only here and there do you find one that has a part-time secretary and there are even schools where the principal does not have his own office. More and more obstacles are being placed in the way of principals bringing teachers in from outside. In the Western Cape there are no training facilities for teachers. I will deal with this again in a moment. If a school in the Western Cape wants to find a teacher, it has to obtain teachers from elsewhere because there are no training facilities for teachers. It is being made more and more difficult for school principals to find teachers elsewhere. The day the Transkei becomes independent, this problem is going to increase twofold. A dual system of red tape is going to come into being.</p>

<p>In the Western Cape there is not a single training college for teachers. It is, in all honesty, a situation which cannot continue. In the whole of the Western Cape there is not one technical or apprentice training facility for Bantu children. They must go to the homelands for this.</p>

<p>Lastly: The salary structure of Bantu teachers remains, in comparison with the scales of White teachers with the same qualifications, of such a nature that the desired human material is not attracted to teaching. What we are now trying to do with the Bill before us, is to enhance the status of White teachers. That status previously existed amongst Bantu teachers, but is rapidly disappearing as a result of discrimination.</p>

<p>The problems which I raised, have not been raised in a spirit of unnecessary criticism. I merely stated the facts. It is the responsibility of the Government of the country to remedy the things to which I have referred.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member made quite a venomous speech. I only agree with one thing the hon. member did, and this is to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister on his appointment. I want to do the same, but without the reservation which the hon. member attached to it. We on this side of the House have no doubt that the hon. the Deputy Minister will occupy his post with honour, competency and distinction. When he was appointed Deputy Minister a few weeks ago, he said that he was much more progressive than the hon. member for Houghton. I did not think that this was such a remarkable claim, because over the years we have learned to know the hon. member for Houghton as a person who placed many obstacles in the way of the development of the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Edenvale spoke about two matters, namely the Snyman Report and <span class="col_5679-5680" refersTo="page_0170"/>the state of affairs in respect of Bantu education in the Western Cape. As far as the Snyman Report is concerned, he took it amiss of the Government for taking away the right of the Bantu students to visit the open universities. In this connection I want to quote what another expert said in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 14 March 1976&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prof. Stock, chairman of the Committee of University Principals, said the time was not yet ripe for universities to accept under-graduates purely on merit. He said: &#x201C;Ideally universities should be open to people of all races, but at the moment in this country there are still serious difficulties at undergraduate level. All students should come from more or less equal background levels of development and have the capacity to benefit equally from attending the university.</block>

<p>It is amazing that a person who was not even born in South Africa and has only been in the country for a few years, should teach a professor in ethnology a lesson.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about Bantu education and painted an extremely sombre and negative picture of the terrible conditions which apparently prevail. He spoke about the double-shift system which supposedly causes all the inconvenience. Of course, this is an undesirable state of affairs. All the things which the hon. member pleaded for, <i>inter alia</i>, the abolition of the double-shift system, the lack of classroom space and other facilities, are all things which cost money if we want to remove them. If for example we want to abolish the double-shift system, approximately 11 000 teachers will be involved in this. This would mean that 11 000 additional classrooms would have to be provided at R3 400 per classroom. Ten thousand classrooms would cost R34 million and 11 000 a little more. If, say, R1 500 per year is paid to 11 000 additional teachers, this gives us a total amount of R16 million. The hon. member does not tell us where that money should come from. The hon. member spoke about the inadequate facilities and said that we should compare a Bantu school with the poorest White school. Last night the hon. member for Bryanston censured the Government because expenditure on Bantu education was R28 per year per capita in contrast as against R500 per capita for White education. However, the hon. member&#x2019;s figures are not entirely correct. In 1974 the figures were R39,53 per capita for Bantu education. For 1975 it was approximately R44 and this year it will certainly be very close to R50. In any event, there is still an extremely large gap. The hon. member for Edenvale must say whether he is in favour of eventual parity in the capital expenditure in respect of White education and that of Bantu education.</p>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;naturally&#x201D;. That makes two of us. I am beginning to realize that this hon. member and myself have common grounds. The hon. member accused us a moment ago of not practising what we preached, and not doing unto others what we would have them do to us. However, it is fundamental to the NP policy that we do not begrudge others that what we claim for ourselves. I therefore grant the Bantu that eventually he will also receive an amount of R500 per capita for his teachers per year. The only difference between the hon. member and myself is how we must bring it about, how we must increase the level of Bantu education and narrow the gap. The standpoint of the hon. member is that Bantu education must be financed by the Treasury. If we want parity, an expenditure of R500 times 4 million pupils will be necessary. This gives a total of R2 000 million. This amount is absolutely prohibitive. The only way in which parity can be obtained is to reduce the level of White education and to increase the level of Bantu education. I am sure the hon. member would not welcome such a step. However, there is a different method and the Government is following that method. If we want to increase the level of Bantu education, we must ask ourselves how the Whites have succeeded in having the high level of education today where they can spend R500 per year on every pupil. This amount has not always been so high. When that hon. member and myself were at school, the Government did not spend R500 per year on our education. I do not think it was even a quarter of that amount. There were years in which it was not even R40. Why is this amount so high today? The answer is that the White&#x2019;s economic position has improved over <span class="col_5681-5682" refersTo="page_0171"/>the years. We pay more taxes and because we pay more taxes, the Government is able to give those good things to us. In order to be able to increase the level of Bantu Education, there is no other way but the one the Government is following at present, namely (a) to make the Bantu homelands themselves responsible for their education and other services and (b) to improve the economic position of the Bantu to such an extent that a fiscal system can be devised by means of which the Bantu can be made even more independent. In 1970 there were only 1,4 million Bantu taxpayers. Last year there were 2,4 million. This is immense progress. Chief Minister Mopedi said the other day: &#x201C;Our Blacks want to stand on our own two feet&#x201D;. I want to suggest that if we can encourage the spirit among those people, it would mean more than all the million rands of subsidies which we pay. This year the gross national income in the homelands is estimated at R1&#x00BD; milliard. According to a projection it will be R17 milliard by the end of the century, twice that of the Whites today. This is after all an immense source from which taxes can eventually come in order to give the Bantu an education at the level which I and the hon. member for Edenvale desire.</p>

<p>Sir, in the list of priorities of this Government there are few matters which stand higher than the development of the homelands and the accompanying generation of revenue for the people there. On the one hand education can make it possible and on the other hand that economic improvement as a result of better education can in turn mean a higher level of education. In the programme of the generation of income there is increased production in agriculture, of which we heard yesterday. These are all the positive things which the hon. the Minister mentioned a moment ago. For instance, there is the establishment of industries, the development of trade as a strengthening of the multiplicity factor, rapid transport, to which reference was also made last night, the training of labour, the development of human potential, the creation of an infrastructure and many other matters. The hon. member tells us that we are neglecting matters here. The world is continually being told that the per capita expenditure on Black education is so low, but what is not said, is that while the per capita expenditure on university training for Whites is R1 950, it is R2 500 for Bantu.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to associate myself with the congratulations of other hon. members in respect of the appointment of the hon. the Deputy Minister to this office. We wish him well. We know that he is a very able man and that he is equal to the task. To be responsible for education in this country and for the education of Blacks in Africa, is an enormous task. I have previously told this House that a Black man of Africa one day showed me the conditions prevailing in Brazzaville in the Congo. He described circumstances there and said: &#x201C;We are watching what you in South Africa are doing in the sphere of education, and you must come and help us. We are fighting and losing this battle. &#x201D; Therefore, Sir, I should like to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister has a major and important task on his shoulders. Therefore we should like to wish him well. It is regrettable that the hon. member for Edenvale made the unfortunate remark that the Black people are supposed to be unhappy about the appointment of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I think that unhappiness was merely in the heart of the hon. member, because the Black people I have discussed the matter with have no objections whatsoever against that appointment. I certainly think that it was a very unfortunate remark.</p>

<p>The hon. member had a great deal to say about the Snyman report. He said, <i>inter alia</i>, that it dealt with unrest on the campus of the University of the North, and then told us that suggestions made to the Government, had not been accepted. I should like to refer to page 186 of that report, where Mr. Justice Snyman had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission wishes to stress that the adjustments that could be made if the recommendations above were accepted, would not obviate future student unrest.</block>

<p>In other words, the steps which the commissioner recommends&#x2014;and these are his own words&#x2014;will, although it might remove the emotion from the unrest, not eliminate it altogether. Sir, I find it regrettable that a man with whom we have always had some sympathy because he took the wrong track, but who will eventually perhaps find Ms way back again, could be so blinded by prejudice that he could utter jeremiads here about the so-called shortcomings in Bantu education. He did so <span class="col_5683-5684" refersTo="page_0172"/>while one could sing a song of praise about this Vote. One could wax lyrical about the fantastic achievements in the sphere of Bantu education over the past two decades in South Africa. Of course, there are still shortcomings, but there are shortcomings in White education as well. However, if we stare ourselves blind at the shortcomings only, we would not see the magnificent and wonderful things which have been done in this sphere. I state categorically that the tempo of development in respect of Bantu education in this country over the past two decades has not been equalled or surpassed anywhere in the world in the sphere of education. I want to challenge the hon. member to prove to me where in the world this tempo of development in the sphere of education has been surpassed or even equalled. To prove my statement, I should like to indicate very briefly how, firstly, Bantu education was developed during the past ten years and, secondly, I want to try and draw a comparison between conditions here in South Africa and those in a few African countries. Firstly, I should like to deal with the spectacular progress made during the past ten years. I obtained the information from the annual reports and I believe it is correct. In 1965 there were 8 810 Bantu schools, primary and secondary, and in 1975 there were 12 573&#x2014;an increase of almost 40%. As far as teachers are concerned, there were 34 000 in 1965 and 69 000 in 1975&#x2014;an increase of more than 100% within 10 years. In 1965 there were 1,9 million Bantu pupils at school, and in 1975, 3,7 million&#x2014;an increase of 98%.</p>

<p>Yes. In 1965, 13,9% of the population attended school and in 1975, 17,7%&#x2014;a fantastic improvement. No, I beg your pardon. There were 13,9 million Blacks in 1965, and 17,7 million in 1975; 14,12% of the population attended school in 1965 and 21,07% in 1975. This number of pupils attending school as a percentage of the population, compares well with many European countries and no African country comes near to it. The nearest I was able to come with the information available to me, was 18%. If that is not spectacular progress&#x2014;in any language and in any country and in any terminology&#x2014;I do not know what progress is. In addition, mention can be made of the expenditure in respect of Bantu education, excluding the universities. In 1965 R25,2 million was spent on Bantu education, excluding the universities; in 1975 it was R160 million&#x2014;an increase of 640% during the ten years. [Interjections.] As far as Black lecturers are concerned: In 1965 there were only 39 at the various Bantu universities, but in 1975 there were 96&#x2014;an increase of 240%. Black students in 1965 numbered 939, and in 1975, 4 133. These were the Black students at the three universities, plus 5 262 who attended Unisa and other universities. Altogether 9 395 Black students were enrolled at the universities in 1975. Under the circumstances, it is an absolutely astonishing achievement. It gives us a clear picture of the progress made during the past 10 years.</p>

<p>I should also like to try and compare the education here at home with that elsewhere in Africa. Before doing so, however, I should like to refer to the argument of the Opposition side that Bantu education in South Africa cannot be compared with Bantu education elsewhere in Africa, but that Bantu education in South Africa should actually be compared with White education. Surely, that is a very stupid argument. After all, these two things cannot be compared. When the Whites came from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, they came from a civilization which had by then reached its peak. That was the time of Vondel and Hoofdt. The Dutch and English civilizations had by then reached their peaks, and the people who came to this country maintained that civilization here. I do not know whether hon. members have been to America. There one can see that there has been virtually no development among the Navajo Indians in their reserve. It is a very large area with a very good rainfall. I am not trying to tell the Americans how to run their affairs, but that large area in America cannot be compared with the rest of America. Why should the Black people in South Africa be compared with the Whites here? It can certainly not be done, and therefore I say that Bantu education in South Africa should be compared with Bantu education elsewhere in Africa. I have chosen two countries for the purpose of this comparison, and I shall say why I have chosen these two countries. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to associate myself with the remarks and <span class="col_5685-5686" refersTo="page_0173"/>felicitations extended to the hon. the Deputy Minister in this his first Vote. I wish him well and want to suggest to him that he, like his immediate predecessor, should give effect to some of the sound advice and suggestions that we, on this side of the House, have tendered from time to time. If he were to do that, we would certainly notice a greater improvement in the whole sphere of Bantu education. Our plea to him is that whatever he does, he should seek to increase the tempo of improvement.</p>

<p>I now want to come briefly to something that disturbs me greatly. I am referring to the training of Bantu pharmacists. Let me say at the outset that I believe the facilities, staff and equipment provided at Turfloop for the training of Bantu pharmacists are second to none in South Africa. Of that I am sure. However, let us look at some other facts. First of all, we have the information that since the establishment of a training centre for pharmacists at Turfloop 24 pharmacists have graduated. According to the answer to my question it is estimated that the cost to train a Bantu pharmacist, from matriculation standard to graduation, is R13 200 per student. It is interesting that the State has largely paid for this, because it is by virtue of financial assistance that these men have been able to train. However, what has happened to the Bantu pharmacists? Are they employed by the State? The answer I get from the Department of Health is that not one single Bantu pharmacist trained in South Africa is employed by the State. I think it is therefore justifiable to ask why not? I now want to give the hon. the Minister the answer. The answer is plainly and simply a question of salary. I want to refer the hon. the Minister to an advertisement in the South African pharmaceutical journal of February this year. On the one side it says &#x201C;Pharmacist: Commencing salary up to R7 380 per annum depending on qualifications and experience. Requirements: Registration as chemist and druggist with the Pharmacy Board. Duties: General pharmacy duties. Apply Secretary for Health.&#x201D; Opposite that advertisement and on the same page we find&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bantu pharmacist: Commencing salary, R3 450 per annum &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is less than half.</p>

<block name="quote">Requirements: Registration as chemist and druggist with the S. A. Pharmacy Board.</block>

<block name="quote">Duties: General pharmacy duties.</block>

<block name="quote">Applications: To the Secretary for Health.</block>

<p>How can the hon. the Deputy Minister expect that pharmacists trained under excellent conditions&#x2014;I would never suggest that their qualifications are inferior or that their ability is inferior&#x2014;will take up positions under those circumstances? Can he wonder that pharmacists who are trained in South Africa seek positions in other countries in southern Africa where they do not adopt this attitude? I can only sum up the attitude as being a cock-eyed outlook, a lop-sided approach and it smacks of gross discrimination. I believe that to indicate in this advertisement a salary difference which amounts to a salary ratio of 100 to 47, is utterly unfair, because it states the highest rung for the White pharmacists and it mentions the lowest commencing rung for the Black pharmacists. However, even with that, the salary ratio is 100 : 63&#x2014;100 to the White and 63 to the African.</p>

<p>In the time that is left to me I want to deal briefly with teacher training. I believe that teachers are the key factor in raising standards and efficiency in schools. I should like to refer the hon. the Deputy Minister to the report of the education panel, the panel which was constituted in 1961 and comprised a broad section of academics. This panel issued a second report in 1966 in which it made certain projections. The projections were based on Bantu teachers. They projected enrolment, teaching force and the number of teachers required. I am sorry to say that in terms of the projections there has been a disappointing result. I take the dates 1965 and 1975 and when those two dates are compared, the enrolment was almost identical with the actual projection&#x2014;2 million pupils. The teacher projection was 34 000 but the actual figures were 29 000&#x2014;a shortfall of 5 000. This resulted in a pupil/teacher ratio of 1 to 67. In 1975 the enrolment figure of 3,7 million tallied, with only a slight difference, with the projected figure. There was an improvement because there were 69 000 teachers and the projection was only for 55 000. However, the projection was based on a ratio of one teacher to 68 pupils. The teacher/pupil ratio has therefore improved to 1 to 54. However, the <span class="col_5687-5688" refersTo="page_0174"/>projection showed that 100 000 teachers would be needed in 1975 to produce a teacher/pupil ratio of 1 to 38 and that is just about double the ratio in White schools where we have a ratio of 1 to 20. I therefore suggest that the overall picture in so far as Bantu teachers are concerned is depressing.</p>

<p>I want to refer the hon. the Deputy Minister to an answer given to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North during this session. He asked whether there was a shortage of qualified teachers, but the answer dealt solely with a shortage of unqualified teachers. It nevertheless made sad reading because in the primary schools the shortage has now increased to 5 000 unqualified teachers in schools in the White areas of the Republic. In so far as secondary school teachers are concerned, their shortage has increased from 99 in 1972 to 241 in 1975. The increase in the shortage is by two and a half times. I know that on the credit side there is the fact that there has been a larger number of teachers who received college training, but I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to indicate when the backlog will be reduced to such an extent that we shall have an improved teacher/pupil ratio. When is it expected to discontinue the use of unqualified teachers, unqualified teachers who, as far as I know, have a Std. 8 education or less? Yet these teachers are expected to teach not only in primary schools, but in secondary schools as well. No wonder that sometimes the results are not as good as we would like them to be.</p>

<p>I should also like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if he would give some details about the new plans for adult education. His predecessor announced earlier this session that steps have been taken to increase the facilities for and tempo of adult education. Goodness knows, that need has existed for many years, because the programme of adult education can be directed at people in the cities who find it very difficult to attend continuation and night classes in the townships and who have no means of improving themselves if they should so desire. I notice that over the last few years there has been an improvement in the enrolment in the Bantu continuation and night schools. It is gratifying to see that. However, if one considers that the total enrolment in the White areas is a mere 9 000 souls throughout the White area of the Republic, I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will concede that the need in this respect is a great one. I trust that, when he replies, he will indicate the extent to which he proposes to remedy this need by the introduction of literacy courses at night schools. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Berea always makes a solid contribution. Consequently I enjoyed listening to him. Since I have only a short time at my disposal, I shall leave it to the hon. the Deputy Minister to reply to the hon. member.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Edenvale. It seems to me as if the Deputy Minister is a thorn in the flesh of the hon. member. Apparently this is not something recent, but has been the case for many decades. Apparently the hon. the Deputy Minister is a constant reminder to the hon. member for Edenvale of what he was and what he has now become. As a scientist, the hon. member was by no means an able politician, and now that he is a politician, he is no longer by any means a scientist. It amazes me sometimes that the hon. member wants to go into detail about the background and the history of the development of universities for the Bantu people. All he did was go off at something of a tangent into one of the commissions of the time and failed entirely to see this matter in perspective. In the course of my speech I shall refer now and again to the hon. member for Edenvale.</p>

<p>I should like to begin my speech by quoting a single paragraph from the annual report of the Department of Bantu Education. I also want to congratulate the public servants, the Secretary and the department on a very sound piece of work. I must say that it took a lot of time to go through the annual report and acquire a sound grasp of the extent of the activities of the department. In the introduction it is correctly stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The information contained in the annual report indubitably points to the tremendous task which has to be accomplished by the department, a task somewhat further complicated by the great extent of the territory, covering the whole of the Republic and South West Africa, that has to be served. Furthermore, it concerns the education of 15 various population groups with 17 various languages employed as media of instruction, <span class="col_5689-5690" refersTo="page_0175"/>and each of which is offered as a school subject in most cases already up to the matriculation/senior certificate.</block>

<p>The second paragraph reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every year reference is made to the rapidly increasing number of pupils, now having risen to over 21,07% of the total population. An aspect worthy of emphasis, being more important than mere numbers, is the phenomenal growth of the school population at the secondary level. Particularly noteworthy is the increase of the enrolment from 209 519 in 1974 to 318 568 in 1975, amounting to 52% <i>in one year</i>. This development is indicative of the increasingly successful activation of pupils to remain longer at school.</block>

<p>In view of this enormous growth it goes without saying that any hon. member could unearth a number of bottlenecks. For example, it can be pointed out that there is a shortage of money, that there is a shortage of teachers, that there is a shortage of classroom space and many more. I am prepared to concede that there are shortages. However, the achievements of Bantu education over the past 20 years have been phenomenal. This is something which one cannot get away from.</p>

<p>I should like to refer briefly to the contributions made by Whites in the field of tertiary education, particularly at universities. On page 134 of the report we note that there are 317 Whites attached to Bantu universities as professors, senior lecturers and lecturers, and 128 members of staff in non-teaching posts.</p>

<p>Furthermore there are three White rectors. Now it is true that a great deal of negative criticism is being levelled by the leftist elements in South Africa at what the Whites are doing in South Africa. The extent to which the real and positive contribution to Bantu educational institutions by Whites is ignored, is sometimes amazing. I have in mind in particular, able young people who are well trained academically, people who have left their own cultural milieu and who seek their future in a teaching career among other peoples. In such cases there is often the problem of cultural gaps. Such people often experience difficult conditions. We shall find that in the world of liberal thinking today an extremely negative and critical line is adopted towards these people. However, I want to break a lance for those people. I want to tell them that they have done well and that they should not cease to do well. In common with people attached to Bantu universities, I am concerned about the many things I read, things which appeared in the so-called report of the Snyman Commission. I, too, find many of those things disturbing because I know that my people and my Government, with the greatest piety, devotion and dedication, have attempted to perform a task for the non-White peoples of South Africa. As a result, when things happen such as those to which the Snyman Commission refers in its report, it hurts us. It hurts us in the first instance because we know that the reactions which have occurred there have very often been unfair reactions. Consequently when the matter is discussed more objectively and more penetratingly, it is possible to eliminate many of the problems that exist with regard to the matter.</p>

<p>I accept that it is possible for a sense of frustration to have developed among many of the students, and many of the lecturing staff, too, about certain aspects of the overall pattern of society in South Africa. However, not all frustration, irregularities and problems that have occurred at Bantu universities are ascribable to the presence of the White man and the policy of separate development. There are other reasons, too, which give rise to frustration. In the first place there are the natural reasons. We must accept that most Bantu students come from a milieu which, 100 to 150 years ago, was still determined by primitive agricultural-economic systems, and we must accept that these people can be taken out of their centuries-old cultural milieu, not in a matter of a century, but in a few decades&#x2014; particularly the decades after the Second World War which had a tremendous impact on the material and spiritual cultural achievements of man&#x2014;and can be placed in a highly technical world in which the cultural milieu is entirely different to what they have become accustomed in the course of centuries. Nor is the frustration which this causes among the young Bantu students peculiar to Bantu students alone. It applies to the White students as well. There are many White students who have also had to be taken out of a rural community over a period of 50 to 100 years to be confronted immediately with the great realities, schools of thought and ideologies of <span class="col_5691-5692" refersTo="page_0176"/>our time. Here we must bear in mind that the great philosophical schools of thought of our time are so constituted as to question and reject everything which has thus far given meaning to man&#x2019;s existence. It is not only the White people who are thereby placed in a vacuum, in which the realities of life have thrown them totally off balance; it has also had a great impact on the Bantu students. Hon. members can speak to medical practitioners. They very often have to deal with Bantu students. The physical symptoms displayed by these people are very often symptoms arising out of the psyche of the persons concerned. It is of importance, too, to bear in mind that among the Blacks in South Africa the consciousness of the Whites, and also of the Blacks elsewhere in Africa, is apparently not to be found. It is an historic fact, as my colleague, the hon. member for Algoa said, that when the White man came to South Africa he already possessed an advanced form of civilization, a civilization which had acquired a great deal of knowledge in the course of centuries, and that this immediately placed him in a position of superiority towards the Black man. Since then the White man in South Africa has not stagnated with regard to the development of his thinking, research and science. He has developed further in those spheres. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#simkin">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. H. W. SIMKIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Rissik in saying that the hon. member for Edenvale presented a relatively distorted image to us. For that reason I should like to deal with the development of tertiary education for Bantu on the basis of the development of the University of the North. Because of the growing need for university training, especially after the Second World War, the enrolment of Black students at the universities of the time was limited in consequence of admission requirements which were becoming progressively higher. As a result of this, tertiary education was not within reach of the large mass of Black peoples in South Africa. In order to meet this problem the National Party Government appointed a commission of inquiry as long ago as 1953 under the chairmanship of Dr. Holloway to investigate the possibility of establishing separate university facilities for Black people. The result of this was that the Extension of University Education Act was passed in 1959 in terms of which the University Colleges of the North and of Zululand were established under the academic control of the University of South Africa. In the same spirit the University College of Fort Hare, too, was transferred to the Government.</p>

<p>At the time of the establishment of the university colleges it was stated very clearly that the policy was that the national units served by the colleges, would eventually be able to man all posts, i.e. as soon as a sufficient number of trained Black academics was available. The same would apply to the management of the colleges. This still is the policy of this Government, as is evident from the annual report of the Department of Bantu Education. The total number of White members of the staff at the University of the North, for instance, decreased in 1975 while the number of Black members of the staff increased by approximately 80%. The University College of the North was opened on 11 January 1960 with a student enrolment of 80. The total staff, administrative and teaching, was 22 Whites and 7 Blacks. During the subsequent ten years the numbers grew to 671 students with a total staff of 81 Whites and 34 Blacks. During this period 279 degrees and 305 diplomas were awarded to students. Because the university college developed so rapidly during the&#x2019;sixties the ties with the University of South Africa were severed with the passing of the University of the North Act in 1969.</p>

<p>As from 1 January 1970 the institution became an academically autonomous university on the same campus. The university already has the following faculties: Arts; commerce and administration; education; law; theology; mathematics and physics, which, <i>inter alia</i>, also has a department of pharmacy. The hon. member for Berea has already referred to this. At this university training can be offered on all academic levels up to doctoral status. In addition the university also offers profession-orientated diploma courses in social work, commerce, education, law and nursing. The senate supervises the arrangement of instruction in the classes. The opinion of interested parties and experts is that the university maintains a sound average academic standard. Since that time the number of students has increased to a total of 1 695 in the year 1975. Expectations are that the <span class="col_5693-5694" refersTo="page_0177"/>numbers may increase even to 5 000 or more by 1980. The staff has also increased to 140 Whites and 79 Blacks. During 1974 1 482 bursaries and study and teaching loans to the amount of R281 580 were awarded. The number of students who enrolled for 1974 was 1 526, in other words 97,1% of the students studied with financial assistance, mainly from the Government. The unit cost per student for 1974 was R1 731. Since the establishment of this institution as many as 1 013 degrees and 837 diplomas have been awarded. In order to perform the academic and other functions of the university, the institution has modern, functional and beautiful buildings. Since the establishment of the university total capital expenditure already amounts to more than R5 million. Current expenditure for the year 1975 amounted to nearly R4 million. The library, for instance, comprises an attractive six storied building which, according to estimates, can house approximately 20 000 books. The university even has its own computer. Because of its situation, the university is obliged to provide accommodation for virtually all its students. For that reason many women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s residences were built. At present the university can provide accommodation to 1 895 students. The time at my disposal does not allow me to refer to the recreational and sporting facilities. What has struck me, however, is that reference has frequently been made in the course of this session to the Snyman Report. What really interests me is what the hon. members of the Opposition have failed to mention about the contents of this report. I want to refer to what, in my opinion, are very important findings contained in this report.</p>

<p>Firstly, the commission is of the opinion that the establishment of separate universities for Blacks was a sound step, which made it possible that special attention be given to the Black student and which enabled him to make up his leeway. Secondly, the commission is of the opinion that this university, together with the other universities for Blacks, offers room for many more Black students than would have been the case had they been dependent on universities for Whites. Thirdly, the commission is also of the opinion that more individual attention is being given to the students than is normally the case at other universities. The fourth matter on which the commission expressed an opinion, which is also very important, is that it is convinced of the fact that the university has experienced sound growth since its establishment, that its establishment is justified and that it is undoubtedly managed in a very responsible manner. Furthermore, I want to refer to two very interesting statements in this report. I refer in the first instance to page 56 of the report. We have heard very little of SASO, the foster-child of the hon. member for Pinelands. I now quote page 56 to indicate what the commission found&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the conclusion is inescapable that the establishment of SASO ushered in a period of unprecedented unrest among the students which disrupted the peace and quiet and normal activities at the university.</block>

<p>What does SASO itself say in their policy manifesto? I quote from page 207 of the report. There the following is stated in para. 6&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">SASO believes that all groups allegedly working for &#x201C;Integration&#x201D; in South Africa&#x2014;and here we note in particular the Progressive Party and other Liberal institutions&#x2014;are not working for the kind of integration that would be acceptable to the Black man. Their attempts are directed merely at relaxing certain oppressive legislation and to allow Blacks into a White-type society.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before, I return to the hon. member for Smithfield, may I take the opportunity of extending to the new Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education the congratulations and good wishes of those in these benches. The hon. the Deputy Minister is on record as saying that he is more verlig than the hon. member for Houghton. He will have adequate opportunity to demonstrate exactly what he means by that as he continues his work. This is a very difficult and wide field, which will tax all his verligte resources.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to underline what was said earlier, almost obliquely, by the hon. member for Port Natal. That is that when we talk about Bantu education, or any education, it must be seen in the total context of South Africa as an industrial society, wherein the skills of all its peoples should be utilized to the <span class="col_5695-5696" refersTo="page_0178"/>best advantage. I do not think that there would be anyone who would disagree with that, but this is only possible if there is a developed educational infrastructure and a school system in which the majority of the pupils in that system stay for at least the full primary course. This we do not yet have in South Africa, and we need to reach that stage with the minimum of delay. If one takes a table representing a group of African children who started in grade school in 1957, you will find that when we come to 1964, that is when they would normally reach Std. 6, the figure of 100 has dropped to 8,7.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Yours, particularly. [Interjections.] If you go on to 1968, you find that by the time these children will have reached Std. 10, that figure has dropped to 0,8. The grim fact is that there are not enough Black children getting to school, and even fewer are staying on in school. There are many reasons for this, but there is one fact that emerges from this which is indisputable and that is that as a result of this we have not merely a ripple but a veritable wave effect throughout Black society which will not leave us untouched. Therefore, however long we spend on saying what we have attempted&#x2014;and much has been attempted&#x2014;and however much stress is placed on the development which has taken place, it seems to me and to those of us in these benches at least that there must be an acceleration, perhaps like we have never seen before in South Africa, in speeding up the necessary development of the education of the Black man in South Africa. I would say, together with the hon. member for Berea, that a key requisite in all this&#x2014;and there are many facets to it&#x2014;is to lay even greater stress on better qualified teachers and more teachers. For whatever else we do, no matter how many buildings we put up and no matter how many books are provided, if we do not have the teachers we simply are not going to be able to have that basic infrastructure which leads to the development of an economy which will enable the development of the earning ability and therefore the production of more money for more education. In a period of rapid growth of population and school enrolment the failure to develop secondary school education in the most vigorous manner possible cannot but produce an underdeveloped, unqualified and underqualified teaching staff. This leads inevitably to the employment of unqualified teachers, to a high pupil-teacher ratio and to the lowering of standards offered in schools.</p>

<p>If one looks at the teacher shortage which is outlined in many tables and one reads the various projections which have been made over the years, it is an incontrovertible fact that again and again in our projections relating to pupils we have been more or less correct, while in the projection of teachers required and teacher trainees we have been hopelessly wide of the mark. At the end of 1972 the number of teacher trainees was less than 10 000. During this time the number of pupils had more than doubled to 3 093 000. In 1976 we have been reminded that we have topped the 4 million mark for the first time. Mention has already been made of double sessions which were first introduced in 1955, 20 years ago, as a temporary measure. Now this involves a teacher teaching two groups of pupils consecutively without extra payment, but this means that the number of hours given to the individual child has inevitably to be reduced to three hours instead of the normal, say, 4&#x00BD; hours. In 1973 just under a million African children were in double-session classes. That is 33% of all pupils in Bantu education. To do away with this, as we have already been told by the hon. member for Port Natal, would require more than 10 000 extra teachers, but the normal increase required, the normal requirement per year, is 4 000 new teachers. In 1972 only 4 346 were qualified. The quality is further exacerbated by the high teacher-pupil ratio which I will not dwell upon as it has already been stressed in this debate, but when one looks at the qualifications of the existing teacher force, which is so absolutely vital, less than 12% of African teachers have Matric or its equivalent. A staggering 88% have J.C., Std. 8, or lower, and of these nearly 30% have less than J.C. It is clear that even to improve this major area of infrastructure, viz. to achieve greater development of teachers and have better qualified teachers, will involve colossal funds and vigorous planning. I have not even mentioned the desperate shortage of so many other facilities such as buildings, books and equipment. Against such a background of urgent need, it is depressing and tragic that this Government has seen fit, if <span class="col_5697-5698" refersTo="page_0179"/>my information is correct, to actually cut back on funds available for Black education.</p>

<block name="quote">Morally and practically there was no higher national priority, said Mr. K. B.

<p>Mr. Chairman, this afternoon I have two very pleasant tasks to perform. In the first instance I should like to add my congratulations to all those good wishes which have already been conveyed to the hon. the Deputy Minister here this afternoon. In the second place I have the pleasant task of bringing a message of hope to the hon. member for Pinelands. The hon. member was also a person who traditionally had to be a bearer of good tidings, a message of hope and expectation. However, he is apparently no longer a bearer of good tidings. He is caught up in pessimism and despondence about the future. I am asking him now to look at the future with me in order to share in a vision of what lies ahead for South Africa in the sphere of Bantu education so that he can once again pluck up courage for the future. The hon. member complained that not enough Bantu children were going to school. He asked that the process be accelerated. I should like to ask him to look at the future together with me on the basis of scientific data. If he does so, I am sure that all the bottlenecks which he finds so disturbing, can be solved. Then he will be able to accept with all of us that the Department of Bantu Education is accomplishing one achievement after the other.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>It is simply a characteristic of the times in which we are living that people are strongly orientated to the future. It is as if people find the prospect of what lies ahead so enthralling that they are particularly anxious about what lies ahead of them in the years to come. Possibly it is the immense speed with which our world is changing almost every day which causes people, and especially young people, to entertain doubts about the future. In any event, whether it is expectation or fear, the fact remains that being future-orientated has become a characteristic of our time. Futurology is consequently university subject which is presented at most European universities. That subject tries to determine tendencies and project them into the future so as to be able to identify future problems and bottlenecks in time. On the basis of such identification the necessary adjustments can then be made in time and a strategy can be decided upon which will prevent bottlenecks. I should like to look into the future in such a spirit this afternoon in respect of Bantu education.</p>

<p>I want to consider certain projections so that the future perspective which it opens to us, will fix our attention on certain aspects of our strategy. I base these projections or predictions on scientific information which I found in the March 1976 newsletter of the Human Sciences Research Council. According to this the present tendencies are analysed and on that basis a forecast is made up to the year 1990. If one takes into consideration that the period until 1990 only covers a stretch of 14 years, one realizes that the future picture which will unfold over the following 14 years, is simply fantastic.</p>

<p>There are many bottlenecks and problems in connection with Bantu education and one could draw up a long list in this regard. <span class="col_5699-5700" refersTo="page_0180"/>However, if one looks at Bantu education in South Africa as a whole, it simply spells out one big success story. Several hon. members have already demonstrated by means of statistics this afternoon what has been achieved in the sphere of Bantu education. There is no country in the world with a large developing Black population which can boast of such achievements in the field of education as those of the Republic of South Africa. According to this newsletter of the HSRC the Black school population in 1960&#x2014;the hon. member for Pinelands ought to find this an interesting statistic&#x2014;was 1,5 million, but 14 years later&#x2014;that is to say, in 1974&#x2014;it was 3,5 million. If one looks 14 years into the future on the basis of the projection of the HSRC, one finds that the Black school population will reach 8,2 million in 1990. In 1960 12,5% of the Bantu population was at school, but in 1974 this figure had grown to 19,7%. According to the projection at least 30% of the Bantu population will be at school in 14 years&#x2019; time. Thus compares favourably even with any White country in the world. It is a success story of which one can indeed be proud. It is a story which makes one optimistic if one thinks of the future. It is therefore significant, too, that this fine publication in which, <i>inter alia</i>, Black education is also referred to, is justifiably called <i>Stepping into the future</i>.</p>

<p>The same success story applies to students at universities. Originally there were few pupils who received secondary education and eventually passed matric. The universities did therefore not have a large source of supply. However, this situation is changing drastically. In 1957 there was a total of approximately 1 600 Black university students, but in 1974 there were already 7 800 and in 14 years from now, in 1990, it is anticipated that there will be 43 100 Black students in South Africa, enough Black students to fill approximately three universities of the size of the present University of Stellenbosch or the University of Pretoria. This is indeed a tremendous future perspective. Population groups whose education graph rises so sharply, are population groups with a fine future in South Africa.</p>

<p>It is of course clear that one of the aspects which we must bear in mind carefully in our education strategy for the future, is to provide sufficient employment opportunities for this multitude of learned and educated Black people, especially in the homelands. Although many opportunities exist for professional Black people in various professional directions in the homelands&#x2014;I am thinking for instance of the sphere of education&#x2014;it is a cause for concern that there is an apparent &#x201C;brain drain &#x201D;, to use the English expression, or erosion of trained or educated Blacks from the homelands to the White areas. A strategy to provide sufficient opportunities for trained Blacks in the homelands, is extremely important, but such a strategy will also have to explore new possibilities. A strategy always demands daring and even experimental thought based on definite aims. The question which I should like to put, is whether agreements cannot be reached with the homeland governments on the grounds of good neighbourliness and sound co-operation that trained or educated citizens of that country who cannot be accommodated there, can play a greater part in certain categories of employment in South Africa. This will of course have to take place in border or nearby areas. This means that in those categories of employment the Black man will also have to be afforded the opportunity of being employed at all levels in accordance with his training and qualifications. I emphasize once again that such a horizontal arrangement in respect of the division of labour can only be arranged between the respective governments, i.e. on grounds of separate development.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which I would like to touch on with respect to a Bantu education strategy. The problem of Africa and therefore also of Black education in South Africa is that the pedagogics or education which is used, has a strong Western orientation and is not always compatible with the culture, and what is particularly important, with the aptitude and potential of the Blacks themselves. As a result of the rising finance costs of education it is extremely important that people should be trained in accordance with their potential and in accordance with future employment opportunities which will arise. In the USA today there are literally thousands of graduates who cannot find employment in the direction for which they were trained. This creates tremendous frustration. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to try to bring the hon. member for Johannesburg West right back to the present after he moved so far out into the future in his speech. I <span class="col_5701-5702" refersTo="page_0181"/>want to remind him that, while good news is naturally central to one&#x2019;s basic message, it is also central to the fact that good news must always come with a specific answer to specific problems and must not only point to some far-off distant heaven. The hon. member tends to overlook that fact. Let us come back to earth. We agree that there are many children at school. We are glad that the school attendance is improving. However, the fact I want to try to bring home to this House is that, if one wishes to bring about the position that the teachers are better qualified and that there are more of them, how is one going to go about this if less than 1% of the Black children who go to school ever reach matric? Perhaps he will tell us a bit about their future as well. Out of six million African children who started school between 1958 and 1968, half dropped out by Std. 3. What kind of future is that not only for the Black people but for all the peoples of South Africa? Unless we are prepared to inject vast funds, skills and commitments to change this picture, the future is bleak not merely for the Black man but also for the White man of South Africa.</p>

<p>Earlier in the debate I was quoting from Mr. Hartshorne&#x2019;s speech delivered at the University of the Witwatersrand. Just to make my point perfectly clear, I wish to quote now from a report which appeared in <i>The Star</i> of 13 December 1975. In this report one reads, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cuts in the funds available to Black education were today attacked by a senior Government official as being false economy.</block>

<p>If he was wrong in that, he must be spoken to. I happen to know him. I know him to be a very fine education planner. I have seen a great deal of the work he has been doing and I should imagine that he would know what was going on in the department. He is reported as having said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall be retarding a moral commitment to provide the majority of our people with one of the basic human needs. It is true that education stimulated individuals to seek a better life, but to ration it, to cut back on it, was an even greater risk. Indiscriminate flat-rate saving can be as dangerous in economic and social terms as overspending.</block>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister would obviously agree, I think, with that analysis and comment because, when I put a question to him earlier in this session about inflation and the cutting back of expenditure in his department, he responded brightly by saying that education was anti-inflationary. We agree with that wholeheartedly. Education is anti-inflationary. Not only do we believe that education is anti-inflationary; we also believe it can and must and will lead to a far greater level of stability and security in South Africa, provided we succeed in this gigantic task. I read in the newspaper yesterday that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development had informed one of the members on this side of the House that free books, which are now being made available to Black school-children in South Africa, would be available to all school-children by 1979. I really cannot understand why it is not possible to try to expedite this scheme. We have been told over the last two years that this discrimination was going to stop. Now we are told that it is going to take until 1979. We are also told as a hard fact that just over 20% of Black children who start school leave after a single year. I again refer to Mr. Hartshorne&#x2019;s statement in <i>The Star</i> as long ago as 1974, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa must implement compulsory Black education by 1980, despite the cost &#x2026;</block>

<p>Those were Mr. Hartshorne&#x2019;s words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; if it is to survive the pressure of the next few years.</block>

<p>The fact is that we need more and better trained teachers. Although attempts are being made, those attempts are not enough. Efforts must be increased, and that must happen now.</p>

<p>When we came to the budget earlier in this session there was obviously a great stress on the increase of money available for defence. There was no quarrel from these benches as to that increase. We made that point very clear. I want to try to make another point just as clear. If we are to believe our military leaders and the statements by many people in South Africa who should know, it is quite clear that no matter how much we spend on military hardware, we are simply not going to win the war in southern Africa. We believe it is <span class="col_5703-5704" refersTo="page_0182"/>imperative to win the war of the mind and of the spirit in South Africa. One of the best ways to do that is to provide the best possible education for all the peoples of South Africa. That is why we stress this. Hon. members on the other side of the House must not tell us what has been done. We on this side of the House are advocating what should be done. Their approach will get us nowhere at all. We agree that it is good that a lot has been done, but we add that a great deal more needs to be done, and we simply have to expedite matters.</p>

<p>The best thing the hon. Deputy Minister could tell this House today&#x2014;in the same way that the hon. the Minister of National Education announced to South Africa that his Government has declared a new deal for teachers in South Africa&#x2014;is that there will be a new deal for Bantu education in South Africa and that the Government is going to expedite the sort of development that has been taking place, and needs to take place at an even greater rate. The amount allocated in the budget for Bantu education is a mere 1% of the budget, a mere increase of R9 million. In relation to what has to be done, this is just a drop in the ocean. That is one-third of 1% of the gross domestic product. We simply cannot go on operating on that standard of priority in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the time that remains to me I just want to touch on one other aspect which is going to cost no money at all. However, it could do a tremendous amount of good for education and for the entire society in South Africa. If only the hon. the Deputy Minister would agree to amend a certain regulation, I believe it could do untold good in South Africa. I am referring to the question&#x2014;I know it to be a controversial issue&#x2014;of the medium of teaching in African secondary schools in urban areas. In the very long and excellent report which has already been referred to, we are told on page 52 that the policy of having half the subjects taught in English and the other half in Afrikaans is a consistent policy of the Government and that it is going to continue. When I put questions to the hon. the Deputy Minister earlier this session, he made it very clear that this was going to continue and that he did not even think it was necessary to keep the statistics of those people who had asked for some change to be made in this regard. This is the only group of people who are handicapped in this way. They are the only ones who are penalized in this way. Imagine the outcry if the young people at Jan van Riebeeck School were compelled to write their junior and senior certificate subjects in English. Imagine the outcry if the pupils of SACS were told that they had to write half their subjects in Afrikaans and the other half in English. Why on earth can Black children not enjoy the same sort of discretion and the same sort of choice which White children, Coloured children, Chinese children and Indian children enjoy? The only group of pupils who are penalized and victimized in this way are the Black children in secondary schools in urban areas. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#hefer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. HEFER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pinelands advocated a larger investment in and increased expenditure on the training of teachers for the Bantu child. I can just tell him that the hon. the Deputy Minister himself will furnish answers in the field of teaching staff and the revision of salary scales. Since the hon. member referred to a quotation, I, too, want to read him a quotation. The person I want to quote, is a certain Jessie Jackson, a lieutenant of the late Dr. Martin Luther King. I want to quote what he said on the education of the Black pupil compared to that of the White pupil in the USA. I regret having to quote an example of this kind, but this is the country where Black pupils have full civic rights and where they share and have shared everything in equal measure with the White man and where they have been forced by legislation to participate in everything. I want to quote a single paragraph only. Jackson said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The thrust of my argument is that Black Americans must begin to accept a larger share of responsibility.</block>

<p>After all the years of equal treatment according to statutory arrangement, according to law, this Black man advocated that the Blacks should accept a larger share of responsibility. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We need to tell our young people: All right, we will get all the State and Federal money we can. But first and foremost we need to put your hand, your body and your mind to work, rebuilding our communities. What we must do for our young people, is <span class="col_5705-5706" refersTo="page_0183"/>challenge them, to put hope in their brains rather than dope in their veins.</block>

<p>We want to ask the hon. members of the PRP who are a bunch of political migratory birds&#x2014;and I feel inclined to say that they are political vultures because they move from one political heap to another&#x2014;why they readily avoid the sphere of integration in schools. They do not come anywhere near it today. They do not come anywhere near it, because if they did we would confront them with reports on a riot at a school in Boston where students come to blows because Black students had burnt the American flag in the school&#x2019;s auditorium. They have full civic rights and a full say in the school and the country. A teacher at the school, a veteran of Vietnam, said that in all his battles in Vietnam he had never seen something as dreadful as he saw that day between White and Black students. Why are those hon. members avoiding this sphere today? After all, they advocate integration, because they say: &#x201C;The parents and children should have their own choice to attend the schools which they prefer.&#x201D; Surely that is integration. Why do they run away from integration today?</p>

<p>The ability of this single small department with a Deputy Minister in charge and the phenomenal growth for which it has been responsible astonish the whole world. It has been calculated that the growth in this sphere of education, calculated up to the day, from December 1972 to December 1975&#x2014;a period of three years&#x2014;represents 572 new pupils being admitted to school every day. Therefore, the growth equalled 572 Black pupils per day or an increase in the number of schools of 1&#x00BD;schools per day for every day of the past three years. The additional facilities to render this possible, were provided not only by the Whites, but also by the community structures of the homelands and by the Bantu authorities. We are very grateful for this. This is such a fantastic growth rate that it is in fact a disrupting factor as against the rest of the infrastructure of a community.</p>

<p>The Government is responsible not only for education, but also for developing the potential of the territories and homelands which have not yet gained independence. It is also responsible for the creation of employment opportunities to accommodate the developed Bantu after he has been trained. This is imperative. Our method of approach as regards the education of the Black people differs from that of those hon. members. The philosophy of the Government is that we want to educate the Black man essentially as a person and an individual belonging to a particular people, in other words, our object is to raise the strata of the people at the rate and tempo which our funds will allow. We envisage the development of a people within its own national context. We cannot educate the Blacks egoistically and selfishly with the sole object of supplying our own economy. The development must be such that the Blacks may also stimulate and develop the economy in the homelands. However, the infrastructure has to be created accordingly and investments must be made so that there may be reservoirs to which this stream of Bantu may flow for employment. This is illustrated to us very clearly.</p>

<p>After the teaching profession, in which 69 000 are employed the profession which employs the largest number of trained workers is that of Black nurses in the Republic. Forty thousand of them are registered and in the process of being trained. Why are there so many of them? Because employment opportunities do exist for them. We find them in the homelands at clinics and at hospitals which have been transferred and which are being transferred to the homelands to be dealt with as State hospitals. From the extension of our universities and primary and secondary schools we can see that our development has been phenomenal.</p>

<p>I should like to touch on another component. Is this development of the Bantu youth suspended in a vacuum or does a sounding board exist in this regard? Is there a cup somewhere in which it may be caught up? People sitting on those benches, are not able to understand the notion of something burning and welling up in a person. One gets this feeling, because one is proud to know that one belongs to a particular group of people. This is a notion which is indefinable and which one cannot express in words. However, it is something which binds one, in altruism and in piety, to that which is one&#x2019;s own. The task of the Government is to make every Black child feel that he is being nourished and developed within a particular group and national context. This is of great importance to us, and that is why we are gradually giving those people the <span class="col_5707-5708" refersTo="page_0184"/>land which we have been keeping in trust. We are making it available to them as their own property, so that they may have space in which to live. But, Sir, it has to be more than beautiful mountains and streams of water and scenery. These have to be areas in which development can take place, areas in which those people can take over the infrastructure and the development of all sectors. I want to stress that this is territory which is theirs; it belongs to them. Recently we read in <i>Die Burger</i> of the beauty of the Klein Karoo. Similarly we should also be able to read in future in bulletins and in newspapers overseas of the beauty of the Transkei or of Gazankulu. Sir, this is their property and we are giving it to those people in accordance with the extent to which their development qualifies them to manage it correctly, to handle it correctly and to develop it correctly.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question of citizenship. We grant the people citizenship. We emancipate them to a stage where they may exercise rights as enfranchised and full citizens. They need not plead, as this Black American, who feels that he has been handled by the White man and that the White man has been thinking on his behalf over the years, has to do. Those people still feel inferior. We want to lead these people to full citizenship, to full development and to full adulthood. We give to these people constitutional government which enables them to govern their country without revolution and without bloodshed, with everything which accompanies this. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. W. B. PAGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Standerton has regaled us with what one could call a speech in two parts. The first part was his private war with the hon. member for Pinelands, which was followed by a general war with the &#x201C;Progs&#x201D;, and the second part dealt in the main with what he termed the phenomenal growth taking place by virtue of the fact that one and a half schools per day are being erected for the Bantu of our country. I wonder, Sir, if you will permit me to pull the rug from under his feet a little. If one and a half schools per day are being built for the Bantu of our country, is the establishment of boarding-hostels keeping pace? According to the figures which are available to us, the hostels in the homelands in 1973 numbered 187. In 1974 there were 201 and in 1975 204. Over the same three-year period the number of pupils in the homelands rose from 38 990 to 45 930. I submit that the two figures are not proportional to each other. A far worse situation arises when we look at the position in the White urban areas. In 1973 there were 28 hostels as against 30 in 1975. In the same period the number of pupils outside the Bantu homelands increased from 13 200 in 1973 to 19 200 in 1975. Sir, we need to build hostels faster than schools and at the rate of two and a half per day if we wish to accommodate the Bantu children requiring accommodation. I leave the hon. member with that happy thought.</p>

<p>In common with my colleagues, I wish the hon. the Deputy Minister well in his new post. I do, however, want to say this to him: I trust&#x2014;and I say this in all kindness&#x2014;that in his responses and replies he will deal with matters a little more speedily than he has dealt with a matter relating to a certain school in the area of Umhlali. I shall not elaborate on that, save to say that the hon. gentleman has taken quite a long time over an answer which I have been waiting for.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have heard much in this House over the past few months about the need to increase productivity. In fact, it is fair to say that South Africans of all races are today more conscious of the meaning and the importance of increasing productivity than they ever have been. This is not only vital in these highly inflationary times, but is also, I believe, essential for the continued existence and well-being of our South African society and our way of life. But tucked away in the regulations governing the administration of Bantu education, we have a situation that can only harm our constant striving towards this greater productivity. I am speaking of regulations in respect of the medium of education in African secondary schools situated in the White urban areas, and in this regard I agree with the hon. member for Pinelands. Pupils in these schools, in terms of the regulations, have to study for and write examinations in both official languages of the country, two or three subjects in English and two or three subjects in Afrikaans. At all other secondary schools, that is to say schools for Whites, Coloureds and Asians and African secondary schools in the homelands, the pupils are allowed to study for and complete their examinations in one of the official languages. I shudder to think of the indignation that would be expressed were <span class="col_5709-5710" refersTo="page_0185"/>these regulations to apply to such schools as, shall we say, Northlands Boys&#x2019; High School in Durban, Port Natal Ho&#x00EB;rskool in Durban, or to Jan van Riebeeck Ho&#x00EB;rskool or Bishops or Rondebosch Boys&#x2019; High School here in Cape Town.</p>

<p>Are you pleading for mother-tongue education?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#page">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. W. B. PAGE</person>:</from>

<p>I am making an intelligent speech, and you are making unintelligent interjections. Mr. Chairman, it follows also that it must require tremendous mental and emotional adjustment on the part of the teachers to have to switch from one language to the other several times a day. But this is not as traumatic as the mental and emotional efforts that are demanded of the African pupils, nor as traumatic as the frustrations they must feel at having to try to memorize the technological terms in a number of subjects in two official languages, neither of which&#x2014;and I stress this&#x2014;is necessarily their home or mother tongue. The result of all this is inevitable and obvious. We must inevitably find that there will be lower examination marks in each subject, and this is borne out in some measure by the statistics that were published in the annual report of the department. It must also be agreed that this situation will further inevitably result in the reduction of the possibility of obtaining the minimum pass aggregate or a first class pass for the pupil who has to write examinations under these conditions. I would also like to point out that each time a pupil, from any race group, fails an examination of this nature, it represents a wastage of public money, which I feel can be obviated in the case of these African pupils by a reappraisal of the situation by the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>This brings me to another problem which I feel is deserving of ministerial attention. I am referring to the timeous announcement of Senior Certificate results, and in this connection I wish to refer to a question tabled by my colleague, the hon. member for Durban Central, which appears on page 53 of the questions section of Hansard of 3 February 1976. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. P. A. Pyper asked the Minister of Bantu Education:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) When were Bantu candidates for the Junior and Senior Certificate examinations informed of the results of the 1975 examination, and (b) when did the schools and teacher-training colleges reopen in 1976;</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement on the matter.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education then replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol><li>(1) (a) Junior Certificate: Results were released on 17 January 1976 and were published in newspapers on 19 and 20 January 1976; Senior Certificate: Results were released on 21 January 1976.<br/>(b) 27 and 28 January 1976, except for schools in KwaZulu which reopen today.</li>

<li>(2) No.</li>

</ol>

<p>Senior Certificate results were announced on 21 January, and I presume from the Minister&#x2019;s reply that they were not published in the newspapers as was the case with the J.C. results. I would further presume that these results would have been mailed to all the examination candidates, and they could not possibly have reached them in under two to three days. This brings us to 24 January. Sir, you will agree, and you will be aware, from the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply, that teacher training colleges reopened on 27 and 28 January. This means that the successful students with the required level of pass, as indicated by their symbols, had precious little time in which to gain admission to these colleges and in the case of those&#x2014;and there must have been many of them&#x2014;who travelled there in the hope of being admitted, can you imagine their disappointment, Sir, when they found that they had not obtained the symbols which were required to grant them admission? This, to them, would have proved an extremely expensive exercise. As I have pointed out, my hon. colleague went on to ask the Deputy Minister whether he would make a statement, and the hon. the Deputy Minister replied, &#x201C;No&#x201D;. I say this in all humility to the Deputy Minister, and it grieves me to say it; this was an arrogant and callous answer. It was a callous answer in the sense that here we <span class="col_5711-5712" refersTo="page_0186"/>had Bantu who had expended money needlessly because they did not have their results timeously.</p>

<p>Another problem which I feel is worthy of the urgent attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister results from the quota system, whereby a number of high school pupils from the urban areas are compelled to return to their homelands for their schooling. I submit that these problems are, firstly, sociological in that we are led to understand that the urban Bantu youth are not readily accepted at schools in the homelands and that many of them are expelled because of behavioural problems. A further aggravation is the question of accommodation. I dealt with the availability of hostels a little earlier in my speech. I ask the Deputy Minister: Do schools in the homelands have the necessary accommodation? Obviously not. Are there any plans for the establishment of additional boarding schools in order to cater for them? Now, Sir, there is much which can be said about the shortcomings of the present system and the regulations governing Bantu education. I have attempted in my address here this afternoon to be constructive and I trust that the hon. the Deputy Minister will be equally constructive in his replies to the questions and the suggestions I have put to him.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am rising to express my sincere thanks to hon. members for their congratulations and their good wishes on the occasion of my assumption of this task. I should like to pay my tribute to the hon. the Minister who has for all of ten years now been rendering service in the interests of this department. His years of service have coincided with great and epoch-making events in the history of South Africa, and I think the contribution he and his department has made to this history is considerable. I also want to pay tribute to the secretaries of the two departments, and in this case in particular to the Secretary for Bantu Education and his fellow-officials, for the very brilliant service they are rendering in the interests of this department. In addition I want to say thank you very much for an extremely valuable and very thoroughly compiled annual report which has been made available to members. That annual report has drawn favourable comment even from people who, politically, belong to the side opposite to the one to which I belong.</p>

<p>The estimates which are before Parliament in fact contain the financial implications of the purposeful development in the education of the Black people. In spite of certain discordant notes which we heard here this afternoon, I am certain that we have a very wide field of consensus and that all of us speak in the interests of the education and training of Black people. May I also inform hon. members who made contributions and asked questions, that I shall, D.V., reply tomorrow, when I conclude the discussion, to the questions and the misgivings of hon. members, as well as to those of the hon. member for Umhlanga! I think he may look forward with pleasure to the reply to his last misgiving.</p>

<p>One should not deal with this budget in isolation, for the budget is a continuation of the programme which has been purposefully introduced and adopted over the years to meet the educational needs of Black peoples. I have already referred to the annual report, which is a very thorough piece of work. In it a great variety of educational services are presented, all facets of the education, up to the tertiary level, which is being provided to Black pupils and students. Here is a wonderful example of the enormous progress which has been made in all spheres, and in a particular, too, the objectives which are being kept in mind with the present budget.</p>

<p>Sir, we have had quite a number of statistics here this afternoon. Perhaps one could in fact describe this discussion as the &#x201C;battle of the statistics&#x201D;. I hope I will be permitted to add just a few of my own.</p>

<p>The total number of pupils at the schools&#x2014;I think it is necessary for us to consider this, even though members could point out that the ideal has not yet been attained and that we have not yet reached the 100% mark, which is the target set under a compulsory education scheme&#x2014;is nevertheless significant, particularly if we take note of the progress which has been made.</p>

<p>In 1975 the enrolment was approximately 3,8 million, and that represented an increase of 400% over 20 years. We must now simply pick a date in the past with which to compare our achievements. The previous r&#x00E9;gime is a little too far back in the past. This 400% increase in the school enrolment compares very favourably if we take cognizance of what <span class="col_5713-5714" refersTo="page_0187"/>the increase in the population has been, and the increase in the population has been considerable. Over the same period it was approximately 170%. In 1976, the present year, it is calculated that the number of pupils attending school is 4 050 000&#x2014;almost a quarter million more than last year.</p>

<p>To mention another figure: In 1955 9,8% of the Black population was attending school. They were attending a total of 5 800 schools with almost 22 000 teachers. That figure grew over the 20 years until the percentage Black population attending school was 20,3%, which is 75% of all children of school-going age. We then had 12 573 schools, with 68 000 male and female teachers. In 1976, the present year, the percentage of children at school had risen to 21,1% of the total Black population.</p>

<p>When we come to secondary pupils, we find that the number of pupils between forms I and V has increased from 209 519 in 1974 to 318 568 in 1975&#x2014;an increase of 52%. Incidentally, this is also a reply to the hon. member for Edenvale, who said there were no facilities or schools for secondary pupils. But here we have an increase of 52% in the number of secondary pupils in the White area.</p>

<p>Reference was made to the students at the three universities. The number has grown from a mere 481 in 1960 to 4 133 in 1975. This means an increase of 57% per annum.</p>

<p>If we now consider a factor such as school-leaving, we see that, unfortunately, there is still a great deal of early school leaving. This matter is receiving attention from the department. The reasons for it are predominantly economic. There are many work opportunities for pupils who do not really have any qualifications. They can find a little job somewhere, and they jump at it. There are, in addition, no auxiliary classes for the mentally retarded and because there are no auxiliary classes and they cannot follow the ordinary courses at a school, it goes without saying that they do not benefit from that education, and because they cannot be accommodated elsewhere, they leave school. According to estimates there is approximately 10% to 15% of the population in any community that does not benefit from normal school training.</p>

<p>However, it is a privilege for me to announce here that the department has already introduced experimental classes at a few schools. Purposeful education for this group is being planned and tested. As soon as this system has been tested, it will progressively&#x2014;and this is National-progressively now&#x2014;be introduced in schools, particularly in those larger centres where the numbers will justify it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He is even speaking Afrikaans now! He will soon have come to my mother tongue! When we come to school admissions, it is possible, in the larger centres, for virtually all those attending school for the first time to be accommodated. We instituted a very exhaustive investigation of this matter in Soweto and Mamelodi. Do hon. members know what the findings were? In Soweto there were six pupils who had applied for admission but had not been accommodated, and the reason for their not being accommodated was not because there was no room. It was because their mothers were afraid of a certain road along which they had to travel to reach the school! However, there was a further interesting phenomenon which emerged. There were 980 pupils in Soweto who were admitted to the school before they had reached the prescribed age. This is what is happening under this dispensation on which so much scorn and abuse is being poured.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with statistics now, I want to give prominence to a few other interesting figures. I want to point out the increase in the enrolments, say between 1955 and 1975. In sub-standard A there was an increase of 270%, i.e. 13% per annum. There was an increase of 282 000 to 808 000 enrolments as far as sub-standard A was concerned. In standard 2 there was an increase of 370%; in standard 5 an increase of 480%; in form I an increase of 920%, i.e. an increase <span class="col_5715-5716" refersTo="page_0188"/>of 46% per annum; in form III an increase of 700%; and in form V, an increase of 1 336%. In respect of the latter the enrolments increased from 674 to 9 009.</p>

<p>However, hon. members ask us what we are doing, not what we have done. Well, this is what is happening, and this is happening according to the manner in which the National Party Government wishes to promote Bantu education in a positively progressive way. Of course it is not always possible to take up all the pupils into secondary schools. However, the indication is that 85% of the pupils who passed standard V in 1975, are in fact at school. For various reasons some of the remaining 15% had to go out to work. Perhaps it is not a fair comparison, but just compare the position for a moment with the position in Zambia where only 20 000 of the 80 000 pupils who passed Std. 5 in 1975 were in fact taken up into the secondary schools. This represents only 25% for that particular year. In one year, from 1974 to 1975, our Black secondary school-going population increased by 52%. However, if one adds 1976 and one takes the number of standard 6 pupils who also had to be accommodated in form I, the increase from 1974 to 1976 was 140%. We have succeeded in motivating the pupils to remain at school longer. This means that we have motivated the communities to keep their children at school longer.</p>

<p>When we come to compulsory education, a matter which was touched upon by certain hon. members, it may be said that we are gradually creating and preparing the situation that will enable compulsory education to be introduced in certain areas. All of us are in favour of it in principle, and the Black people are looking forward to it longingly. Members of the Cabinet of Basotho Qwaqwa have asked us to speed up the introduction of compulsory education. Feelings do not differ in regard to this matter, but we must face up to the practical situation.</p>

<p>I do not want to elaborate too extensively on the matter, but simply indicate a few aspects. Finance will have to be found to make the introduction of compulsory education possible. That finance comes to a large extent out of the pockets of the White tax-payers. We are prepared to speak to our own people and to persuade them to allocate as much as possible for this purpose. We shall do so. However, I want to put it in this way: We can have compulsory education if&#x2014;and it is a very big &#x201C;if&#x201D;&#x2014;our growth rate were to remain the same and if it is possible to maintain the increased financial support provided between 1973 and 1975. Unfortunately, owing to the cuts made in the 1976-&#x2019;77 budget, we can expect a delay in the programme. With an increase of 9% in the allocation of the department we can only mark time, to say nothing of continuing in the direction of moving towards compulsory education. To be able to have compulsory education before 1982, there has to be an annual increase of 20% on the previous year&#x2019;s estimates for four or five years in succession, so that after four years the estimates will be double what they were this year. The figure of 17% to 18% unqualified teachers has to be reduced to 7% to 8% at the most. These are all things which are necessary for compulsory education.</p>

<p>The number of pupils per teacher also has to be reduced. For example, it will take five to six years at the present rate to be able to achieve a ratio of 45 pupils to one teacher. To be able to arrive at a ratio of 45 pupils to one teacher in 1980, there has to be approximately 6 200 new primary school-teachers at the end of 1975, and an additional 1 000 annually until 1980. These are all requirements for such a vast project. To be able to attain the ideal of 45 pupils per teacher in the White area in 1980, the number of teaching posts in the department has to be increased by 2 800 in 1976, by 3 500 in 1978 and by 4 500 in 1980. I am pointing out the major requirements that will have to be met if such a great ideal is to be attained within the foreseeable future. I could say more about this, but provisionally I shall leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>I should like to say something about teacher training. It is of course true that there is a great deal in that regard that we should like to see improved. In 1955 there were approximately 5 900 student teachers. In 1976 this number moved up to 15 500. We should at least be fair and give credit for the progress that has been made. Over the next five years this number will have to increase by 1 000 per annum, and that is what we are envisaging. I also want to point out that in 1973 a scheme was introduced under which unqualified teachers who were in possession of a junior certificate and at least three year&#x2019;s teaching experience, were admitted to a special one year professional course. After successful completion of the course they <span class="col_5717-5718" refersTo="page_0189"/>obtained the primary school-teacher&#x2019;s certificate. This course has proved to be very popular and it will make a major contribution to the systematical elimination of unqualified teachers.</p>

<p>I want to point out, moreover, that at present there are 41 teachers&#x2019; training schools. This year three new teachers&#x2019; training schools were put into operation, another three are being planned for the immediate future. The goal which the department sets itself is to produce a minimum of 10 000 primary school teachers per annum by 1980. The admission qualifications for this course is the junior certificate. I do not want to discuss everything now, but the question of what we are doing to promote this production could perhaps be asked. According to projections we expect to have to produce more than 10 000 primary school teachers per annum by 1980, while there will be 6 100 primary school teachers with a primary teacher&#x2019;s certificate in 1976.</p>

<p>There is another very interesting and important facet of training namely the industrial orientated training. The department is making a great contribution to this training. There are for example 18 <i>ad hoc</i> border industrial schools which are being run by the department itself. In 1975 alone, 2 376 employees were trained at these <i>ad hoc</i> border industrial schools. During the past five years more than 10 000 of them have been trained in this way. It may interest hon. members to know that the contribution of the State, by way of subsidies to these schools alone, amounted to R389 000.</p>

<p>A very important facet is of course in-service training. Notice has been given of a Bill in connection with in-service training which will soon be before Parliament. Very generous tax concessions have been made to industries that undertake such in-service training. A total of 142 schemes have been registered, and 423 different industrial courses are being offered. This is only as far as the registered schemes are concerned. Involved in these courses were no fewer than 55 591 employees who received in-service training in this way with a view to greater skill and increased productivity. Then, too, cognizance has not even been taken yet of the 158 schemes that have not been registered, and in respect of which the better trained employees have not been included. The State&#x2019;s contribution to this training is virtually 97% as a result of the tax concessions which are being granted to the companies concerned. I want to add to this that five of our most senior officials have been placed at the disposal of this service training scheme.</p>

<p>There are, in addition, eight departmental industrial training centres. This year alone 12 800 pupils have received basic industrial training there. These training centres are in fact an extension of the ordinary schools, but basic training is given there for 2&#x00BD; hours a week. These centres will be expanded so that each of these centres will be able to train 5 000 pupils annually. The programme makes further provision for the establishment of an additional four new centres. When all of them are functioning, it will be possible for 60 000 pupils to receive this kind of training annually. We hope that this will be possible from 1977 onwards.</p>

<p>Apart from that there is technical training as well. This year 3 400 pupils have received such training, at 24 trade schools situated throughout the Republic and South West Africa. Three trade schools are being planned for this year. Therefore, progress is being made.</p>

<p>I would also be able to elaborate on the question of advanced technical education. This is receiving constant attention. The numbers, however, are not large. There were only 401 students in 14 different fields of study in 1975. These include courses for engineering technicians, surveying technicians, geology technicians, telecommunications technicians, etc., as well as paramedical courses such as dental therapy, occupational therapy, dietetics, radiography and physiotherapy. These are all courses which are being offered. A few basic principles are contained in the budget. In the first place there is the provision of staff to the schools. An additional amount is being requested for the creation of additional posts to keep pace with the normal growth in the number of pupils. I have already pointed out that during the period 1975-&#x2019;76 alone there was an increase of almost 250 000 in the number of pupils. Classroom space and teachers have to be provided for those additional 250 000 pupils. In addition provision has to be made from this amount to reduce the number pupils per teacher by approximately two. The idea is that, where there are 53 pupils in a class, for example, the number should be reduced to 51, or even to 50, and ultimately perhaps to 45. This means, <span class="col_5719-5720" refersTo="page_0190"/>however, that additional classroom space, additional furniture, additional staff and additional equipment has to be acquired. The cost of these things is enormous.</p>

<p>I should also like to say something in regard to the question of double sessions. It is my privilege to announce that the department has begun to create additional posts at certain schools this year by means of which double sessions will be eliminated. I am aware that an hon. member put a question to me in this regard earlier on. I did not reply to it because the plan was only put into operation this year, and because we shall still have to give consideration to its effect. I want to point out that with this new programme we envisage reducing double sessions. This will result in fewer teachers being involved in double sessions. However, I want to add that it is not the case&#x2014;as an hon. member alleged here earlier on&#x2014;that classes to which double sessions apply, inevitably have shorter lesson-hours. They receive the normal time for their tuition. The difference is merely that there are certain subjects, such as hygiene, religious tuition and so on, which overlap, and where two classes are able to receive joint tuition in the overlapping period between the first and the second sessions. Therefore precisely the same amount of time is allocated to each class, in that there is some overlapping.</p>

<p>At present 20% of all new appointments are being made with a view to gradually eliminating the system of double sessions. However, hon. members correctly pointed out that this does involve approximately 12 500 teachers. More than 5 000 of them fall under the Department of Bantu Education. The remainder fall under the homelands.</p>

<p>Someone asked a question about adult education. That matter is at present receiving the special attention of the department. It was announced last year that a division of the department was giving the necessary attention to this matter. The necessary investigation has been made. There are various organizations which are doing good work. There are other organizations whose activities possibly require a measure of investigation. In the estimates, however, provision has been made for an amount of R250 000, which will be employed to take over certain schools and certain classes and to test the needs and the effectiveness of this kind of education before a larger sum of money is appropriated for the purpose. Hon. members will appreciate that it is a new direction in which we are moving and that we first want to make sure that we are taking the correct steps.</p>

<p>Next I want to refer to farm schools. The basic premise of the department with regard to farm schools is that accommodation and school buildings have to be provided by the persons and bodies attracting Black labour to the White areas. Those persons and bodies have to accept responsibility for it. In this way farm owners also have to make provision for the school facilities of the children of their farm labourers and possibly, too, for the Bantu children in their vicinity. I also want to point out that since the subsidy allocated to a farm owner for the erection of a school building has to date amounted to R240 for a single classroom and R360 for a two-classroom school, provision has now been made in the estimates for an amount of R1 000 for a building with one classroom and R1 800 for a building with two classrooms. This is the purpose for which the amount of R200 000 which is mentioned in the estimates, is being requested.</p>

<p>In addition, there is the question of free school books. I want to point out that all reading books in the three languages&#x2014; Afrikaans, English and the mother tongue of the pupil&#x2014;are being supplied to primary schools by the department. This applies to all reading books. Each year every school has to submit a requisition for the supplementation of or replacement of the stocks. Generous provision is being made to the schools. Each pupil receives two reading books per language. An estimated 18 million books have already been supplied. With regard to text books, large-scale purchases are usually made at the end of the year if the full contribution for reading and library books has not been fully utilized. From the beginning of 1974 the department began with a scheme to provide schools systematically with free text books for content subjects. I could elaborate on that. If necessary, I shall return to this tomorrow, but I just want to mention this provisionally.</p>

<p>If one takes into consideration the progress we are making, and what we are planning, one can see that it is all aimed at systematically preparing the ground for eventual compulsory education. Before this can happen, however, there has to be a reduction in the ratio of pupils to teachers. There has to be an elimination of <span class="col_5721-5722" refersTo="page_0191"/>double sessions. Classrooms have to be erected, auxiliary classes have to be provided for the mentally retarded, free books have to be provided, there has to be a lowering of the admission age, etc.</p>

<p>It is a fact that if we want to reduce the ratio of pupils to teachers to 30 : 1, we shall have to double the number of teachers and classrooms. However, it is important to point out that the department has to take into consideration that it cannot move ahead more rapidly than the homelands are able to do. A total of 63% of the Black school-going population are at school in the homelands. We cannot move to far ahead or allow them to move too far ahead of us. Hon. members will understand why it is necessary for us to keep pace with each other in this regard.</p>

<p>Mention is sometimes made of the unit costs per pupil, as was again done this afternoon. However, may I request attention for another matter. What the budget of the Department of Bantu Education does not indicate, in other words, what is not included in respect of the unit costs per pupil, is the establishment of buildings by the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards and the building of farm schools by farmers. This physical development is not included. However, this is all part of the unit cost per pupil. The percentage of Black children in the lower classes is greater, and because the costs attached to the lower classes, are less, the average expenditure per pupil is accordingly lower as well.</p>

<p>Teachers&#x2019; salaries differ as well. Black teachers receive less than White teachers. If, in addition, the qualifications of a Bantu teacher are lower, it means that he earns a lower salary. It also means a further reduction in the expenditure per capita, i.e. per pupil.</p>

<p>I think I ought to give the entire picture. As far as the Republic is concerned, an amount of R77 885 000 is being budgeted for the 1976-&#x2019;77 financial year. The budget of the homeland governments for education is R103 000 000. Added to that is the amount which the Department of Bantu Administration and Development pays the White staff in Black schools. This amounts to a further R4&#x00BE; million. The total therefore amounts to R185 774 000. In South West Africa a further R10 million is being spent. If one adds the capital works to the grand total of R196 000 000, the total then amounts to R215 000 000. After all, the expenses involved in capital works must also be included. In the Republic the amount is R15&#x00BD; million, and in South West Africa, R3&#x00BD; million. This does not include the amounts which are being spent on capital works by the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards and farmers on farms in the interests of Bantu education. If one were to divide the amount equally on the basis of the four million Black pupils, the unit cost per pupil would be R54. In South West Africa alone the amount in respect of pupils under the control of the department is R128 per pupil. There we make provision for the needs of all the Black pupils.</p>

<p>In my opinion the positive aspects of the appropriation are of importance. Hon. members pointed out that the appropriations amounted to R18 million in 1961. In 1975-&#x2019;76 they had increased to R160 million. This is an increase of 900% or 56% per annum. It is a pity that the economic situation in this country necessitates Government spending having to be restricted to an increase of 6%, as indicated in the speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance. However, the amount which is being requested in the present estimates for Bantu Education does nevertheless represent an increase of 13%, which is in fact more than the general guideline, but less than the corresponding percentage last year.</p>

<p>I conclude by pointing out that the estimates do not, as far as salaries are concerned, make provision for the salary increases announced by the hon. the Prime Minister. An additional amount will therefore have to be appropriated. The 10% increase, as announced, applies to White officials. The salaries of Black officials, including Black teachers, will have to be supplemented by an amount which will result in a higher percentage. The intention is to incorporate the 10% and at the same time bring about a narrowing of the gap between the salaries of Whites and non-Whites. The precise extent of this has not yet been finalized, and therefore this is all that I am able to say at this stage. However, I also want to point out that attention is being given to the revision of the salary structure of Bantu teachers. This will possibly result in new key scales for teachers. However, further particulars are not available, for the matter is still being investigated.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in adding my congratulations to the hon. the Deputy <span class="col_5723-5724" refersTo="page_0192"/>Minister on assuming his new post, I must confess that, having listened to this rather remarkable and almost pyrotechnic display of figures he has given, I hope he does not end up as other Ministers and Deputy Ministers have who initially were also very promising incumbents of the post. He has painted a very bright picture today, which on the face of it leads one to believe that everything in the garden is rosy, that the progress has been remarkable and in fact amounts to one of the most fantastic achievements which the Government has to its credit. However, if one looks at the practical side, one does not get that picture at all. The whole matter was discussed very fully and on an extensive basis during the debate last year. If the hon. the Deputy Minister would care to examine what was said last year, he would find all the very same issues with regard to the enormous finance that is required, all the same problems that he has raised now, save that now the hon. the Deputy Minister speaks with a tremendous amount of conviction, almost leading one to believe that everything has been set in motion. In response to a question in connection with a very important matter, namely the question of double session, a promise was made last year that it would receive immediate attention. All authorities claimed that it was one of the most vital factors of the day and it was stated that it was a contributory factor in causing a lot of wastage in enrolment. It was promised that something would be done and that something had to be done. Yet, in reply to a question earlier this session, the hon. the Deputy Minister said nothing had been done. His answer was a plain and unequivocal &#x201C;no&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The question which was put to him was: What progress has been made since 1 January 1975 in the elimination of double sessions in schools under his control? The reply was &#x201C;None&#x201D;. There were no embellishments to that at all, and one wonders what the promises of this hon. the Deputy Minister will mean. Another question which still remains a burning and sore problem, is the question of the improvement of salaries. This has been pressed in this House session after session. We have pointed out how vital it is to increase salaries in order to attract people to the profession. Does the hon. the Minister realize that a male teacher receives a starting salary of R92 per month in the primary school? According to the present determination, the average labourer is earning R80 to R90 per month, as the lowest salary on the scale. Women teachers receive R80 a month.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. So that hon. member made a nonsensical statement.</p>

<p>We now come to the question of text books. Apparently the total cost involved in supplying text books would be R3 191 760, in terms of a reply that was given. It was also said that it would be reached by 1977. The hon. the Minister gave these estimates in reply to a question put to him last year. The date has now been extended to 1979. However, I think it is a very vital question. The process should have been accelerated already. I want to agree with the hon. the Minister, that the report is a very interesting reflection of the activities of the department. I should like to go so far as to say that the department consists of a considerable number of very dedicated officials, who are trying to do their best. Their best, however, can only be their best in terms of the slow crawling movement of Government policy. I would not be so proud of the small sum of R77 million which appears in the budget at the moment. The hon. the Deputy Minister included the figures of all the homelands, but I cannot verify the figure of R215 million he has given me. It seems astronomical. However, the point is that R77 million is provided for here. The hon. the Minister maintains that it comes out of one source of taxation. I am not <span class="col_5725-5726" refersTo="page_0193"/>terribly upset about that either, although I think it comes from more than one source of taxation. One of the members on the Government side went to the trouble of explaining that there are 1&#x00BD; million Black taxpayers today as against a third or quarter of that figure some years ago. According to that hon. member the number is continually increasing.</p>

<p>Of course the funds come from the general purse of the country, but what is wrong with that? If the Black man improves his economic situation, if his contribution to the GNP improves, if his standard of living improves and if his earning capacity improves, he will obviously make a greater contribution to the general funds of the country and he will fully justify an increase in the budget figure. Actually I think the figure is very low indeed. The hon. the Deputy Minister talks about the number of schools, but I want to know from him why it is still necessary for private agencies to make tremendous contributions to the provision of schools. Last year one of the members on the Government side acclaimed this fact with tremendous pride and praise. On this very day R80 000 is being donated by the Argus group for a new school. I have often felt ashamed of the fact that the public has to provide the very much needed schools in some of the big centres of our country. The hon. the Deputy Minister talks about schools and classrooms as if they are simply coming off a conveyor belt. If it were not for the assistance of the public, the need for schools would have been much greater. That particular group of newspapers contributed about 32 schools in Soweto alone. I think it is a fantastic contribution. Why must we rely on them for that? Why must we feel elevated because we have been able to get something from the public? After all, it is the Government which is responsible for the Black man, not only because he is Black, but also because he is a citizen. The Government is also responsible for him in the interest of the community. After all, what is the basis of the disciplinary life of the country if not the educational life of the community? The entire discipline of the country hinges on that. It is to the advantage of all sections of the country that education progresses at the fastest possible rate despite the extra costs.</p>

<p>I do not know why we always complain of the fact that the money comes from the coffers of the so-called White taxpayers. I think it is one of the most fallacious and foolish arguments we could ever use, and I think it is time that the hon. the Deputy Minister dropped silly statements of that nature and rather concentrated on what is needed. He should concentrate not only on what is needed despite difficulties, but also to overcome the difficulties. The hon. the Deputy Minister must ensure that he overcomes them as speedily as possible, because all is not as rosy in the garden, as he maintains. We are aware, and it has been stressed, that there is a shortage of equipment and that there are many other deficiencies, such as a shortage of teachers in certain technical subjects.</p>

<p>The last matter I want to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister is that it is all very well looking with pride at the percentage increases in the numbers in the higher standards. However, percentage increases are also fallacious figures. If a man earned R1 and improves to R2, he increases his salary by 100%. Therefore percentages can be fallacious. The fact that from the millions who start school, the figure drops away almost to nothing by the time they reach matric. That is the serious situation we have today. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer in brief to what was raised by two members on the opposite side, and then say a few words about the universities in general. The hon. member for Edenvale as well as one of the other hon. members over there had something to say in consequence of the Snyman Report. As long ago as February of this year I made a public announcement on the Government&#x2019;s attitude in connection with the Snyman Report, as far as it concerns us. I stated that a whole number of the recommendations could be accepted. It goes without saying of course that some of the recommendations accepted, can be carried into effect administratively. However, there are also other recommendations which will require legislation.</p>

<p>I also said at the time that we would look at the legislation. It will not, of course, only concern legislation in respect of the University of the North, because the affairs of the other two universities, as the hon. member knows, are regulated by identical laws. Consequently we are going into the question of the legislation relating to the three universities, on a fairly wide basis, with a view to effecting amendments. From the nature of the case it will, of course, not be possible to do so this year. The amendments will affect various matters, such as the authority of the councils, as well as the position of the advisory council, to which the hon. member referred. It will also affect the composition of the councils, etc. That legislation will be introduced next year.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Berea raised the question of Bantu pharmacists. I wish to explain that we of course do not compel the pharmacy students who qualify at the University of the North to work for us, for the State or even for the provinces Qualified Bantu pharmacists are very scarce, as the hon. member well knows, and as he pointed out yesterday. The salaries offered are, of course, very high, so that those who are qualified are very easily employed by the interested bodies and persons in South Africa. It must, however, be realized that many of them practise as individual pharmacists. Although there are others working for pharmaceutical firms, it still remains possible that in future some of these persons who are working for other employers may be employed in hospitals in the Bantu homelands or even in provincial hospitals. With regard to the question of salaries, to which the hon. member referred yesterday, I want to remind him that we gradually improve salaries from time to time. In this process we always try to narrow the gap between the salaries of White persons and those of Black persons.</p>

<p>*I want to say a few words in connection with the three universities in general. I think hon. members will realize that universities are a difficult proposition in certain respects throughout the whole world. There are various problems with which they have to contend. I think that if we evaluate our position in terms <span class="col_5729-5730" refersTo="page_0195"/>of world criteria and circumstances, we shall find that we in South Africa are relatively fortunate as far as our three Bantu universities are concerned. I realize that there are all sorts of problems and that the possibility of tension exists. Generally, however, I think we may be very grateful for the fact that the Bantu universities have been functioning extremely satisfactorily over the years and that they have produced excellent results up to the present time, fine products for the Bantu community and the Bantu peoples, and that they are still, to the extent to which this is practicable, meeting the new demands which are made. Of course, one cannot establish a faculty or a department if it will have virtually no students, one for which there is no demand. However, I can point out many interesting extensions we have in fact had. A particularly interesting extension is the one which came into operation in Umtata this year. A branch of the University of Fort Hare was opened in Umtata. The position there is even more interesting if one takes into consideration the fact that the Transkei is becoming an independent country later this year. The necessary provision for this is being made by the department, the Transkei and the University of Fort Hare. In the same way the University of the North has recently entered into negotiations and has started conducting inquiries into establishing a branch of the university somewhere in Bophuthatswana so as to serve the people there as there is a demand for something of this nature. At the University of Zululand in Natal we have the interesting development that an institute, for training, particularly in law and public administration, has been established. This is evidence of the way in which the universities adapt themselves to the needs of the Bantu homelands and of the Bantu peoples.</p>

<p>In the past, and particularly this year, a start was made on a reasonable scale at all three of the Black universities in South Africa, namely at Fort Hare, Turfloop and Ngoya, with the training of first-year students in medicine, since all three universities will co-operate with the proposed medical university. In the course of time we have had all sorts of extensions at all three universities, for instance, new departments and faculties. We look at matters in the light of the people&#x2019;s specific needs and the available funds. We must have regard to the funds available. Everyone knows that unlimited funds are not available. For us, as well as for the poor universities, this raises problems. However, in this connection, this year especially, we have had a new turn as far as obtaining capital funds for universities are concerned, in that the three universities have been authorized to raise loans. Not only are negotiations in progress with the universities in connection with obtaining loans for certain capital extensions; but such loans have already been made, for instance in the case of Fort Hare. So hon. members will see in the estimates that funds are being appropriated to cover interest payments and the redemption of loans which have been made. In general I therefore want to give the assurance that, as far as the three universities are concerned, the Department of Bantu Education, and the Government as a whole, are fully intent on assisting the process of development in the future as far as possible and within the limits of possibility and reason.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#swanepoel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">K. D. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the end of the debate I should like to confine myself to the role which the Blacks are playing in their own education in South Africa. This role is becoming progressively bigger and is gaining more and more momentum. Consequently it is the policy of the Government, and particularly of the Department of Bantu Education, to place the say in and the control and supervision of their own education, completely in the hands of the Bantu themselves.</p>

<p>Therefore, I should in the first place like to dwell for a moment on school boards and committee boards. For every community school in Bantu residential areas in White areas, a school committee is established. These school committees are established by the parents. Where there are two or more Bantu schools in an area, a school board is established. Where there is only one school in an area, a committee board is established. What is important here in the first place, is the number of committees and boards. There are 1 364 school committees, 155 school boards and 253 committee boards. This gives us a total of 1 772. If we have regard to the fact that each one of these committees and boards consists of nine members on the average, it means that approximately 16 000 Bantu parents are directly concerned and have a direct interest in the education and training of their children. These committees and school boards <span class="col_5731-5732" refersTo="page_0196"/>are established by the school committees. Therefore it is the parents themselves who are responsible for the composition of the various boards. What is of greater importance, however, are the powers vested in these committees and school boards and the functions they have. They have wide and executive powers, especially in respect of the staff of the schools concerned and also in respect of the location of the schools. They are in control of their schools and are therefore the legal employers of their teaching staff. The teachers are the tutors and educators of the children, and for that reason the school boards and committee boards are given absolute power as far as the appointment of teachers is concerned, and also as far as their dismissal is concerned, should this be necessary. Through these boards parents therefore have direct control over the teachers who are to educate and train their children. Cognizance must be taken of this. The supervision and control of schools is therefore not official-orientated or White orientated. The full responsibility in respect of the person in charge of the class&#x2014;the key figure in the education process&#x2014;is therefore in the hands of the Bantu themselves, the parents of the children at school.</p>

<p>But what is even more important is to look at the composition of these school boards in the larger Bantu residential areas. Here the school boards are grouped and composed on an ethnic basis. In Mamelodi, for instance, there are separate school boards for the North Sotho, the Tswana, the Tonga, the Venda, etc. In Soweto there are no fewer than four school boards for the Zulu alone, three for the Tswana and one each for the Tonga and the Venda, etc. Sir, this ethnic grouping, the recognition of a separate national character, is condemned by both opposition parties, especially by the PRP. Only yesterday the hon. member for Houghton had a great deal to say here when she condemned the registration of Bantu children in Bantu residential areas in the White urban areas and objected to including the homeland, etc., of the child on the registration card. For them this composition and groupings of school boards on the basis of ethnic classification must be something odious, because to them it is discrimination. After all, here we are separating the Zulu from the Venda, the Tswana from the North Sotho, etc. I am afraid that they will even condemn the principle of these people exercising control themselves through school boards, composed of members from their own ranks. I have been a member of this House for a short time only, but one thing has become very clear to me, and that is that the party to my right advocates a strange policy, one of denationalization, of removing the national character of the various national groups and of denying various national groups an identity of their own. I gain the impression&#x2014;and I am convinced that it is not a mistaken one&#x2014;that they do not want others to have what they themselves have. They condemn separate development. If they want to be consistent, they must also condemn the say which those Black parents who serve on the school boards have with regard to appointment and dismissal of teachers and where schools are to be built.</p>

<p>I want to dwell for a moment on the cultural organization and youth organizations, especially as far as the homelands are concerned. A strong need for the development of their language and a pride in their language has developed in the homelands, and the various homeland governments, on Cabinet level, have launched some form of cultural organization. Bophuthatswana has progressed a long way in this regard, and I should like to use this homeland as an example to illustrate this. Members of the Cabinet of that homeland and others acted as founder members and patrons of an organization of this kind and are still acting in this capacity. Branches were established and extended to Bantu residential areas in White areas where members pay a nominal annual subscription. In Bophuthatswana there are already more than 10 000 members and each member is provided, <i>inter alia</i>, with at least four books&#x2014;fiction or works of literature. This means that 40 000 books have been purchased and are being distributed in this manner. Purchases are subsidized by the Department of Education concerned. The result is, firstly, that authors and potential authors are encouraged to write as a market exists for their books.</p>

<p>In the second place it also serves as a stimulus for the publishers since manuscripts may be accepted without their running a great risk. In the third place a wide reading public has emerged as a result of this step. Fourthly, authors&#x2019; conferences are held at which the procedure of having manuscripts accepted, is explained. Furthermore, the members of these cultural organizations are divided into various <span class="col_5733-5734" refersTo="page_0197"/>sub-committees or work committees, each giving attention to a particular subject in its turn: for example, a language committee, a song and music committee, an art committee, etc. These cultural organizations have not been initiated by Whites nor are they the result of the efforts of Whites, but of the Black peoples themselves. For this reason I believe that something fine and positive will develop in this regard.</p>

<p>As far as youth organizations and youth preparedness are concerned, we should like to see the youth in the homelands being activated to a larger extent, being better prepared and motivated and acting in a more prepared and motivated manner. Consequently I am grateful for the fact that the Government has appointed an organizer for this purpose, viz. to investigate and to promote youth organizations in the homelands. These youth movements, however, must spring from the peoples themselves and must not be lame imitations of a Boy Scout, Voortrekker or Land Service movement. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>It is a pleasure for me to enter the debate at this stage of the discussion and, as it were, to bring it to a close. I should like to express my great appreciation for the positive contributions of hon. members on my side of the House, and also on the opposite side of the House. I want to thank the hon. members for Port Natal, Algoa, Rissik, Smithfield, Johannesburg West and Standerton, as well as the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Gezina, very sincerely for the contributions they have made to bring what is being done in the sphere of Bantu education clearly to the attention of this House, and in that way of the entire country.</p>

<p>I think that members on this side of the House had a very easy task, for what is in fact being done in the sphere of Bantu education at the primary, secondary and tertiary level, is overwhelming. I want to rectify a newspaper report on the salaries of Black teachers. I think I made it clear in my speech yesterday afternoon that the salaries of Black teachers were not being increased by 13%, but that the 13% to which I referred was an increase in the amount that is being requested in the estimates for Bantu education, and not for the teachers as a group. I think I made it clear, viz. that the amount, requested for Bantu education in the estimates, represents an increase of 13%. I have already said that the salaries of Black officials and Black teachers will be supplemented by an amount which, percentage-wise, will bring about a considerable narrowing of the gap between salaries. No final decision has yet been reached on what the precise extent of the amount will be.</p>

<p>Judging by the speeches made by hon. members of the Opposition they had an extremely difficult task to level criticism. On the one hand it is possible to point out what has not yet been achieved. However, this is an aspect to which thorough attention is being given by this side of the House, and in particular by the Government and by the department concerned. Sometimes one cannot but gain the impression that the Opposition are extremely unwilling to express appreciation when this can and must be done, and that they ferret around to such an extent to find something they can criticize that in the end they paint a completely distorted picture. Therefore it will not be taken amiss of hon. members on this side of the House when, of necessity, they point out the positive aspects and also quote witnesses to support their arguments, witnesses who express appreciation for the things which are being done, and in particular by this department. I have here a letter which was received by my department. It was written by a representative of the Church of the Nazarene. He wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A group of 30 businessmen from the United States visited me on very short notice, and wished to visit Lebowa homeland, among other places.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I know that you will be pleased &#x2026;</block>

<p>And I hope members of the Opposition will also be pleased&#x2014;for it is in the interest of South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to hear that the impressions and views of all being done for the Bantu by the Government was very favourable. They were particularly impressed by the educational and medical fields, and quite surprised at the degree of governmental development in the homelands. It all helps overseas.</block>

<p><span class="col_5735-5736" refersTo="page_0198"/>This is a letter from someone from that part of the world, someone who forwarded to my department the favourable comment of Americans on what is being done in South Africa. He added that it ought to help overseas.</p>

<p>I should like to react briefly to some of the remarks made by hon. members of the Opposition. I have already replied on some points, and therefore, I am not going to spend any further time on them. I want to refer to a few of the matters raised by the hon. member for Edenvale. Perhaps I should tell him that he need not be a so deeply concerned about my image among the Black people. Perhaps his approach is that my image can only improve. I want to give him the assurance that it will improve. I do not think that the responsibility for a certain part of that image is mine. It is attributable rather to statements made by hon. members on that side of the House and by a certain section of the Press which represents them, and which they support. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I must say that there are no hard feelings between the hon. member for Edenvale and myself. However, I want to emphasize that if that so-called image of mine is due to the fact that I take up the cudgels in the interests of the White man, alongside that of the Black man and the Brown man, I accept full responsibility for doing so. I am not ashamed of doing so. I stand by what I said in my first speech in this House. It is an honour and a privilege for me, as an Afrikaner and as a White person, to render this service, and more service now to the Black people than I have time to render to my own people. I do so gladly. I do so as a Christian who wishes to render a service to other people across the dividing lines of colour and of race. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am saying this without reproach to the hon. member for Edenvale. I think he enjoys it. He referred to educational facilities in the Western Cape. It is of course well known that&#x2014;under the policy of the Government&#x2014;the Western Cape is a preferential area for Coloureds. Nevertheless there are four secondary schools in the Cape Peninsula, two of which are senior secondary schools. According to the formula of one classroom for every 250 families, the production of the full quota, with these four schools, is being complied with. A second aspect which he mentioned, was in connection with teacher training here in the Western Cape. I want to mention to him&#x2014;perhaps he is aware of it&#x2014;that there is not a single unqualified teacher in the Western Cape. In any event we cannot establish a training centre in every Black residential area close to a White area. Our policy is that those institutions should be homeland-orientated, and therefore should preferably be established in the homelands. As far as secondary schools are concerned, the hon. member in fact created the impression we were not establishing any new schools in White areas. The truth of the matter is that in Soweto, for example&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Houghton will support me when I say this because I think she is aware of it&#x2014;18 new schools were established in 1974-&#x2019;75. Eighteen new schools were established there in two years alone, i.e. 1974 and 1975. I think this is an achievement, and I think the hon. member for Houghton could occasionally also state this as positively as I have just done. I think she would receive credit for it if she did so. As far as needlework is concerned&#x2014;I am not very handy with that kind of thing&#x2014;the facts of the matter are that needlework is of course compulsory for all girls in Black schools, and the subsidy in respect of handcraft subjects, such as needlework, has already been increased.</p>

<p>I come to the hon. member for Pinelands. I think I have already replied to certain things he mentioned. On this occasion I just wanted to reply to a specific matter which he raised. I think it is fair to him to say that he raised the question which he touched upon in regard to a statement by Dr. Hartshorne more by way of a question than a statement. Or did the hon. member make an accusation, a specific statement? I give him credit for having made inquiries in regard to a report which appeared on what Dr. Hartshorne had allegedly said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>It was a newspaper report.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was a newspaper report. I think that if one had to form an opinion of that newspaper report, one would have to say that it was so bad and so distorted, compared to the original speech of Dr. Hartshorne &#x2026; Oh well, if the hon. <span class="col_5737-5738" refersTo="page_0199"/>member for Pinelands and I had in our time interpreted the Bible in that way, then we would have been able to prove from the Bible that one should commit suicide, for in the Bible it is stated that Judas went and hung himself, and in another place it is stated: Go thou and do likewise!</p>

<p>But what did this official say? He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The private sector has placed considerable pressures on the Government to prune State expenditure.</block>

<p>He is therefore reacting to pressures on the part of the private sector, and in regard to that pressure on the part of the private sector he replies&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But indiscriminate flat-rate saving can be as dangerous in economic and social terms as overspending.</block>

<p>He was reacting to pressure on the part of the private sector. I think that I have, with that, in fact replied to the entire matter, but I could still quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Here I would also include industrial training. This is not the time for industrialists or for commerce to save by pruning training programmes. This is false economy.</block>

<p>And this &#x201C;false economy&#x201D; does not refer now to the policy of the Government, but to pressures on the part of certain parties in the private sector. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should like to see far greater use being made of the opportunities created by the Government through the programmes sponsored by my department.</block>

<p>Here he is stating the Government&#x2019;s, and specifically his department&#x2019;s, approach. Unless of course the hon. member, or the newspaper, wishes to imply that this official had allegedly had access to the budget before it was presented and is now advocating that we should, for that reason, take steps against this official. If they want to do that, they must do so, but this is the standpoint this official adopted in regard to certain agitation&#x2014;one almost wants to say&#x2014;on the part of the private sector to bring about a pruning of expenditure.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, Sir, I can only let the facts as I have stated them here suffice. They exonerate this official. I want to quote just one more short sentence from what he said, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To slow down the promising developments of the last three years will be short-sighted and dangerous for the economic future of South Africa.</block>

<p>He can say this because he knows what the positive approach of the department and the Government is, i.e. not to prune expenditure on these basic items.</p>

<p>I want to go further. I discussed school leaving, compulsory education, etc. What the hon. member for Berea raised, his questions in regard to pharmacists, etc., has been dealt with by the hon. the Minister. I replied on the training of teachers and adult education.</p>

<p>I should like to come to the hon. member for Umhlanga. That hon. member discussed hostels. Our basic approach is of course not to convey pupils to the school but to bring the schools to the communities in which those pupils are, and for that reason the schools are being built in the communities in which those people are present. But over and above that, apart from the general basic policy, we are at present building four schools with hostels in the homelands through the agency of Bantu education. This is being done. If the hon. member wants further information about this matter, we can give it to him. However, I am simply stating this first as a basic fact.</p>

<p>A second aspect which he touched upon was the medium of instruction. It is of course the case that we regard the mother tongue as the medium in which the child should receive instruction, particularly in the primary school. The same applies to the primary schools for <span class="col_5739-5740" refersTo="page_0200"/>Bantu in the White area. There is mother tongue instruction up to Std. 4, and after that in the two official languages on a 50 : 50 basis. But now I think the hon. member will concede&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Pinelands also discussed this&#x2014;that the policy of 50% Afrikaans and 50% English in the secondary schools is being applied in such a lenient manner that in practice the instruction in matric is virtually 100% in English as against nill in Afrikaans. I think one could almost say: 95% English and 5% Afrikaans. That is the information I have at my disposal now. This is the case in spite of the fact that the official policy is 50 : 50. But in practice the 50 : 50 is being applied in such a way that it is predominantly English in the secondary schools! This year, I think, a single subject was taught in Afrikaans for the first time in a high school in Port Elizabeth. That is the picture. Now, I do not know whether the hon. member actually meant that we should have unilingual education, i.e. in English only in the secondary schools!</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then I do not really know what the hon. member meant, because we are applying the policy in such an accommodating way that it is in fact &#x201C;one horse, one rabbit&#x201D; and the horse in this case is definitely not Afrikaans.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether the choice is not left to the community in which the school is established. In the Free State, for example, the majority of the parents and the children may want to be taught in Afrikaans, and in Port Elizabeth, perhaps, primarily in English. Is there a choice, which the parents, the children or the public in the place where the school has been established may exercise?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In practice it means that the language proficiency of the teacher, who has to teach the subject, is taken into consideration. What is also taken into consideration is the language which is used the most in that specific area. We adhere to the 50 : 50 principle, but we also adapt ourselves to the language which is in predominant use in a specific area. If the homelands were to change over to a specific language as the sole medium of instruction, that is of course their own business. However, they will have to reap the fruits of it. There is one fact I should now like to point out. The pass figure for matriculation in one of these homelands is 42%, as against the pass figure of 63% in the remainder of the Republic, and that is when English has already been used as a medium of instruction from Std. 3. Educationalists indicate that this is in conflict with sound pedagogic principles.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlanga referred to certain results in Durban. I could not reply to this in detail when questions were put to me earlier because the matter was to a certain extent <i>sub judice</i>, but in this regard I think that I should now furnish a few particulars to indicate that this department, as far as examinations are concerned, is faced with an enormous task and certain stumbling blocks. Junior certificate results were released on 17 January 1976, and senior certificate results on 21 January 1976. However, I want hon. members to bear in mind that the following public external exams were held: Higher primary, i.e. Stds. 5 and 6, with a quarter million full-time candidates as against 2 000 private candidates; junior certificate, i.e. form 111, with 49 000 full-time candidates and 15 000 private candidates. We come then to the senior certificate, i.e. form V, with 8 500 full-time candidates and 20 000 private candidates. For the teachers&#x2019; certificate there were 7 000 candidates. This gives a picture of the tremendous task as far as examinations are concerned.</p>

<p>The department does not have its own computer. Perhaps this is a deficiency and we should look into it. It makes use of the computer of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. This means, however, that the time at the disposal of the department is very limited, and for the most part the staff had to work over the week-ends and after hours to process the many thousands of computer cards. This is the practical situation which can be advanced as a reason for the delay.</p>

<p>Arising out of questions which were put to me here there is one further point I want to refer to. In the case of the senior certificate examinations, irregularities occurred in the Durban area before the examination took place. There was an alleged theft of question papers from one of the KwaZulu inspector&#x2019;s <span class="col_5741-5742" refersTo="page_0201"/>offices. However, there was no time to set new question papers. The question papers are prepared by the Department of National Education. Then they go to the internal moderator, and subsequently to the external promoter of the Joint Matriculation Board. Only then are they printed and distributed. That is the procedure. After the question papers had been corrected and the usual schedules drawn up, it became clear that the points obtained for history, geography, biology and physiology in the following six schools were abnormally high: Lamontville, Isibonelo, Ohlange, Vukazakhe, Menzi and Swelihle. I hope I am pronouncing the names correctly.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>There were 507 candidates involved in this. Those results were abnormally high, without the normal achievement distribution and with an exceptionally high number of A, B and C symbols. When this happens, one must ask whether something irregular is not happening. A comparison with the results of the internal June and September examinations confirmed the suspicion that the candidates must have had access to the question papers beforehand., It was decided that the schools in question would rewrite the four subjects in the supplementary examinations in March. The schools were notified accordingly. The symbols which were obtained in the other subjects were made available to the candidates. As a result of this decision the candidates concerned could not gain admission to the University of Zululand since the registration of students closed on 1 March. However, that is not the end of the story. An interdict has been brought against the Minister by the father of one of the candidates. In terms of the interdict reasons had to be advanced by 20 February 1976 as to why the results of the subjects in respect of which irregularities had been suspected had not been made available to the candidates.</p>

<p>Since the department acts as an agent for national education in regard to the senior certificate, and the rules only make provision for action against a candidate if irregularities take place during the examination&#x2014;not prior to the examination&#x2014;the legal representative of the State was of the opinion that the case should, for technical reasons, rather be settled out of court. The results were consequently released to the candidates and those candidates were not prevented from enrolling. My information is that they received notification in time to be able to enroll. In other words, no obstacles were placed in their way.</p>

<p>I think I have now dealt with all the questions, except those of the hon. member for Jeppe. I think we have already discussed double sessions, salaries and text books. I think there is an idealistic scheme in progress to eliminate the backlog. In regard to the one point which the hon. member mentioned, I think he agrees with the aim of this department, i.e. that we should not rely on the provision of school facilities by outside bodies. We have to budget for that. The problem is that outside bodies have other aims as well, and sometimes there are all kinds of strings attached to their donations, however welcome those donations may be. We must budget for this ourselves, and make the necessary provision for it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question in regard to technical training. I do not know whether the hon. the Deputy Minister has mentioned this point already, but I heard no reply from him in this regard. What is the policy of the department in regard to the training of technicians, i.e. both those of artisans and the more advanced training of technicians? Is it the policy that that training will take place only within the homelands, or is there also provision for such training in White South Africa. If there is such provision, where are the colleges which are providing <span class="col_5743-5744" refersTo="page_0202"/>such training, and where will such colleges be established in future?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I would very much like to give a full reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question. Perhaps there is still time to put it on the Question Paper. However, I just want to mention that I referred in my speech yesterday to the industrial orientated training. A great deal of that training is taking place within White residential areas. Apart from the 18 <i>ad hoc</i> border industrial schools, there are the departmental schools which are actually regarded as an extension of existing schools within the communities. At these schools basic technical training is received for 2&#x00BD; hours per week, over and above trade training which falls into a completely different category. Then there are the trade schools of which we have 24 throughout the Republic and South West Africa. In addition there are quite a few new ones which will open this year. I could also mention the trade schools in the homelands in particular. Apart from that there is the in-service training which is also technical training with a view to increasing the skill of employees who are already employed. There are certain categories of employees who may receive this training so that they may become better equipped for their task. I should like the hon. member to agree to my furnishing a more detailed picture of the matter on a subsequent occasion.</p>

<p>With that I have come to the end of my reply. I want to thank hon. members sincerely for their contributions.</p>

<heading>MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN AFRICA BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 3, in line 12, to omit &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;National&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of the amendment, if it is accepted, will be that the Minister of National Education and not the Minister of Bantu Education will be the responsible Minister.</p>

<p>The motivation behind the amendment is straightforward and simple. All medical education in South Africa up till this point has been under the aegis of the Minister of National Education. One recalls, for example, the fact that Black students are now being trained in Durban at that university and the education which they receive falls under the Minister of National Education. In view of the fact that the new university is, in terms of the Bill, to be called the Medical University of southern Africa and will deal specifically with medicine and allied disciplines, it seems to us reasonable that it should come under the jurisdiction of the Minister of National Education rather than that of the Minister of Bantu Education in order to keep under one Minister and one department all the work of medical training in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. member for Durban Central, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 3, in line 12, to omit &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;National&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The amendment is basically in accordance with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pinelands, and I want to identify myself with his general motivation for it. However, I want to add that the amendment is not intended to cast any reflection on the competence of the Minister of Bantu Education, but we feel that it would be in accordance with the position we have in the rest of the country, the position that all our medical faculties form part of an ordinary university and fall under the Minister of National Education. I feel it would be only right for the medical training of everyone to take place in accordance with the established pattern.</p>

<p>In theory, perhaps, it could be argued that, whereas other universities offer other courses in addition to a medical course, the circumstances of the proposed university necessitate a deviation from the established pattern. <span class="col_5745-5746" refersTo="page_0203"/>Accordingly, it was pointed out during the Second Reading debate that other aspects became important in the case of the proposed university. The other aspects are related to the Government&#x2019;s view on the development of national identity and so forth. In actual fact, such views are not applicable to strictly scientific subjects such as medicine and dentistry. Consequently, those considerations are not relevant in this case, even though they might be relevant in the case of other universities. Since the Bill provides for the university to be open to all Black people, and even to Blacks from outside the Republic, the whole concept of the development of a people and the building of a national identity cannot have any bearing on it. We must render a service to the Blacks and I agree with that, but the service must not be motivated by such philosophical considerations.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that the status of the proposed university would be comparable with that of other universities in the country which provide medical training. With reference to this, I want to say that in order to create the impression in the outside world, and among our own Blacks as well, that the training which will be provided at the proposed university will in fact be, comparable with what is offered in the existing institutions it seems to me that the proposed university should fall under the Minister of National Education.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to argue at this stage that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pinelands as well as the amendment just moved by the hon. member for Edenvale is out of order. I base my argument upon the fact that the amendments militate against the already accepted principle that the entire responsibility, in so far as the State&#x2019;s responsibility extends, will be in the hands of the Minister of Bantu Education. It has also been provided in existing legislation that the creation of such an institution is in order. In this connection I refer specifically to the Extension of University Education Act, No. 45 of 1959, which is a statute of this Parliament. The argument in connection with equal training is not relevant now, anyway, but it shows what the hon. members are after, and it does not have much to do with administration. I consequently advance at this stage that the two amendments are completely out of order because they affect the principle already passed at the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to support what the hon. members for Edenvale and Pinelands said about this clause. Medicine and the medical sciences in South Africa should fall under one head. I do not see any reason whatsoever for a distinction being made in this regard between Whites and non-Whites. The medical profession is a profession we wish to foster in this country. There must be no clash of ideas as to the direction education in this field should take. The Minister of Bantu Education may quite easily have different ideas to the Minister of National Education concerning the direction it should take. I am talking about the Minister and not specifically about Mr. M. C. Botha. The present incumbent of that post may work hand in hand with the Minister of National Education and liaise with him. However, that is not the point. The point is that it ought to be controlled by one man. If that man should also be responsible for another portfolio, that is a different story. In this case we have two separate portfolios covering the same work. I want to emphasize that the work should at least be the same in both cases.</p>

<p>For the past few days we have been talking about discrimination. There must not be a vestige of suspicion that there can be any discrimination between students going to one <span class="col_5747-5748" refersTo="page_0204"/>university and students going to another. They must be on the same level. It is strange to people outside this House and also to people outside the country that when it comes to higher education, specifically in respect of medical students and paramedical people generally, the Blacks should fall under one Minister and the Whites under another. It is my contention that they should all fall under the Minister of National Education. The hon. the Minister need not be afraid that he is sacrificing part of his empire, because that is not the position at all. It is not that we on this side of the House want to deprive him of this work. All we want him to do is to see it as we see it, viz. that this type of education should fall under one Minister. Accordingly I should like to support the hon. members for Edenvale and Pinelands.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one is surprised to find that the members of the PRP have suddenly begun to take an interest in the Committee Stage of this Bill, since they did not say a word in the Second Reading debate. I ask myself what they want to achieve by moving amendments at this stage. Are they being forced to do so by Durban North? Is this an attempt to secure a few votes in Wednesday&#x2019;s election? One simply wonders.</p>

<p>As far as clause 1 is concerned, I want to allege that tertiary education for the Black peoples has developed much more rapidly under the control of the Minister of Bantu Education than would otherwise have been the case. I should like to illustrate briefly what I mean by that. Let us take a quick look at the natural development of medical science and medical training in South Africa. In this connection I should like to quote from a letter which was written as far back as 1851 in the then Transvaal House of Assembly to a certain Dr. H. Voormolen, in an attempt to persuade him to come to the Transvaal. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is seker dat u of enigiemand anders wat hom onder ons vestig en medisyne praktiseer, &#x2019;n goeie lewe sal verdien aangesien u sal besef hoe moeilik dit moet wees om jou eie geneesheer te wees in tye van siekte.

<p>The letter goes on to say that the ordinary fevers of one, two and three days&#x2019; duration found in Holland did not affect them. This letter tells one two things: It illustrates that there is a geographic connection and that conditions are found which are common to certain countries and certain peoples. At that stage there was no need for Black doctors. That need only arose much later; it arose in the middle of this century. By comparison, therefore, the training of Bantu developed much more rapidly. The development which was found at Durban as far back as 1951 testifies to this fact, as does the development which is taking place at the moment. The importance of the national context&#x2014;in this respect I have to disagree with the hon. member for Edenvale&#x2014;must be emphasized here, especially in respect of medical training. Throughout history every nation has wanted its own training. That is why we have to give that training to the Bantu peoples of this country as well.</p>

<p>The criticism has now been expressed that the development of the institutions for tertiary education which fall under the control of the Minister of Bantu Education is not equal to the development there would have been if they had fallen under the Minister of National Education. The allegation has even been made in this debate that because of this, the standard is not the same either, and that the universities concerned are second-class universities. This is the so-called bush college idea we have encountered before. We had the same criticism <span class="col_5749-5750" refersTo="page_0205"/>in respect of the University of the North which is controlled by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education. Where does this university stand today? This university is regarded as one of the best universities in our country today, as we heard from the hon. member for Smithfield yesterday. This university at Pietersburg has a campus which any university could be proud of. The university was only established in 1960 and had only 87 students to begin with.</p>

<p>I just want to say that that university under the control of the Minister of Bantu Education is accepted by the homeland concerned. It was accepted precisely because of its national context and precisely because it is controlled by the Minister of Bantu Education. I want to point out that this university, which has already developed into the largest non-White university, will confer 306 degrees and diplomas upon students on 8 May. Therefore I want to allege that the fact that the university falls under the Minister of Bantu Administration holds advantages for these peoples. As regards clinical medicine, too, it is important that the development should take place in a national context, because there is a real difference between the medicine of the White man and that of the Black man. There is a basic difference, and this difference is not the result of separate development, but is caused by racial characteristics. For this reason, Bantu medicine is completely different from White medicine. I should like to mention a few examples. The hon. member for Rosettenville should know these things. Coronary diseases, for example, are common among Whites, while they are hardly ever found among the non-Whites. Liver diseases, however, are more generally found among the Bantu peoples, but never among the Whites. Ulcers &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to tell the hon. member for Pietersburg that he ought to read the Snyman Commission&#x2019;s report. He will then see that this fine university he is lauding now as an example of the excellent administration of the Department <span class="col_5751-5752" refersTo="page_0206"/>of Bantu Administration and Education and the Minister in charge of that department, in fact comes in for a very severe drubbing at the hands of Judge Snyman. Part and parcel of the comment made by the judge in this regard is that the students feel themselves separated. That is one of the reasons. I put it to hon. members that the separation of the medical school from the ordinary administration of other medical schools is simply going to add another grievance. I do not believe that the Department of Bantu Administration has such a good record in administering the university that it should now take under its wing the medical school which is about to be set up. Indeed, the history of the administration of the universities under Bantu Administration has been one of constant disturbances at the universities. The historical occurrences we know of at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Turfloop are indicative of the fact that the department does, in fact, not know to handle higher education. I believe the attitude which the department adopts is that it is dealing with glorified high schools when it in fact deals with universities. I therefore believe that the hon. the Minister of National Education is far better qualified and far more experienced in the handling of institutions of higher education than the Department of Bantu Administration. For that prime reason I wish to support the argument which has been advanced by the hon. member for Pinelands and also by the hon. member for Edenvale, viz. that the new medical school should be placed under the Department of National Education, which is used to handling university institutions and knows how to deal with them and is likely to have a much easier passage in the future than if it were left in the hands of the Department of Bantu Administration.</p>

<p>Also, I believe this medical school should not be called a university right at the outset. There are many examples of universities starting off as university colleges and after a certain number of years graduating to the status of a full university. Indeed, all the universities for Bantu education started as university colleges, as did our own. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not consider an amendment to clause 1. I do not know whether an hon. member of the Opposition has already moved an amendment to this effect &#x2026;</p>

A new university is here being set up, and the rector of this university will not be able to be a member of the Committee of University Principals.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietersburg did raise a very important point at the beginning, I think. It is a point which I believe to have a major bearing on the amendments. It referred to the fact that the PRP had nothing to say during the Second Reading Debate, but are now advancing arguments of principle in connection with their objections to the Minister of Bantu Administration. The only problem is that the hon. member for Pietersburg could not deal with sleeping-sickness as well. Mr. Chairman, I hope you will allow me to ask the hon. members of the PRP to tell us whether they were asleep, and if not, whether they support the principle of the Second Reading. It is a question which is relevant under every clause. Why did these hon. members not give an indication at least, as they ought to do during a Second Reading stage, of the fact that they intended to move material amendments? However, the members of the PRP turned their backs to the debate and seemed to be very satisfied with themselves. They must tell us now whether they were in the arms of Morpheus. If not, in whose arms? I think this is a matter we have to thrash out with the PRP, because we cannot allow them to advance important arguments here when we have not been able to prepare for them.</p>

<p>We did not have time to prepare ourselves because we did not know what their arguments were. The argument advanced by the hon. member for Pinelands differs basically from the other arguments. It is a very sweet-sounding argument, i.e. that it would be much easier for administrative reasons. Then the hon. member for Rosettenville called the whole quality of the education into question. The hon. member for Houghton, on the other hand, said that we would not be able to control the universities. How far have these arguments advanced by now? How could we have prepared ourselves for them if we were unable to see the way these people were thinking during the Second Reading Stage? We shall not let those hon. members get away with it. We want a reply in respect of each of their arguments.</p>

<p>As regards the amendment concerned, I want to point out that the Minister of Bantu Education is the obvious person, because it arises logically from the whole Bill. Secondly, it is in line with the whole principle of training in primary and secondary stages for the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education to be able to deal with standards, etc. When it comes to consultation with the homelands, which is an important principle of this Bill, when it comes to representation on the council and when it comes to the opinions of the homelands leaders in connection with their needs, etc., do hon. members wish to involve another Minister in these matters or should they be dealt <span class="col_5755-5756" refersTo="page_0208"/>with by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education? Therefore this amendment of the PRP is ill-considered to begin with. Secondly, it is an amendment which seems to have come to them at a later stage, because they agreed with us at the Second Reading.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to get into any quarrel as to why the PRP did not take part in the Second Reading debate on this Bill. I want to tell the House that it did not suit them at the time to speak. The several leaders of that party were sitting in their benches and never even raised a word of protest. Therefore, I take it that they did not want to take part in that debate. If that is the attitude they take in debates, they must not complain later. Mr. Chairman, I now move the amendment printed in the name of the hon. member for Durban Central on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) On page 3, in line 34, to omit &#x201C;Medical&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;Medical Sciences&#x201D;;</block>

<p>During my Second Reading speech I said that I thought that the &#x201C;Medical University of Southern Africa&#x201D; was a misnomer. I therefore also move the amendment which is printed in the name of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(2) on page 3, in line 35, to omit &#x201C;Southern&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;South&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I now wish to talk about the name of this university. As I said in my Second Reading speech, to me it is a misnomer. The two amendments which appear on the Order Paper go hand in hand and deal with the naming of this university. I hope it is going to be a university and not a university college. However, I do not like the name of it. I do not think it is a medical university and I would like, if it is going to have the name &#x201C;medical&#x201D;, to have &#x201C;sciences&#x201D; inserted between &#x201C;medical&#x201D; and &#x201C;university&#x201D; so that it will read the &#x201C;Medical Sciences University.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister and other hon. members in the House have said that overseas there are medical schools which are attached to universities and which people can attend to obtain a degree. These are hospitals in medical schools and there are two opportunities of getting recognition for the work done. Let us take an example in Great Britain. One can obtain a degree from the Royal College of Surgeons or from the Royal College of Physicians and become a member or a licentiate of one of those colleges. At the same time one can take a university degree at the same medical school. That is optional, but here it is not optional. Here one can obtain a degree from a medical university, but it not a medical university in the full sense. I want the hon. the Minister to understand that a medical university can only give a degree in medicine and perhaps in dentistry. It certainly cannot give a degree in veterinary science.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>It cannot, because it is a medical school and the two faculties are separate. To overcome the difficulty and to make sure that we do not exclude veterinary science from this university I want to include the word &#x201C;sciences&#x201D;. It will then include medical science, dental science and veterinary science. What objection can the hon. the Minister have to that? It is only a matter of clarification. In any case, &#x201C;Medical University of Southern Africa&#x201D; is a cumbersome name. I am not going to harp on it again, because it is the second time I am arguing about this. Another point I want to make, is that I do not like the word &#x201C;Southern&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister said that he is using the word &#x201C;Southern&#x201D; and not &#x201C;South&#x201D;, because the university is going to take in students from all parts of Southern Africa. I sincerely hope that it will do so, but that does not mean to say that it should be a Southern African university.</p>

<p>It is our university here in South Africa and it belongs to the Republic. It is not going to belong to the Transkei, it is not going to belong to Bophuthatswana, and it is not going to belong to KwaZulu. It is going to be a South African university. If I wanted to go to the University of Heidelberg in Germany, they would not have to change the name of that university because I come from South Africa. They do not have to change the name of the Heidelberg University because a certain student comes from France. It remains the Heidelberg University in that area. It was established there. To indicate that a university <span class="col_5757-5758" refersTo="page_0209"/>is going to take students from other areas, by changing the name to &#x201C;Southern&#x201D;, is ridiculous. It is our university and I think we should call it the University of South Africa. The argument that that may clash with the existing University of South Africa also falls by the board, because one is prefacing the name of the University by calling it the &#x201C;Medical Sciences University&#x201D;, which does not exist in the case of the University of South Africa. He must think again about this. It is not a complete name; it is an untidy name and can mean anything. We do not want it to be so vague. I will be quite happy if the hon. the Minister calls it the Ga-Rankuwa University&#x2014;finis en klaar. What is wrong with that? I see nothing wrong with that name. That should be the name of the university. We are certain of at least three of the faculties at this stage, namely the dental faculty, the medical faculty and the faculty of veterinary sciences. We know that because it is provided for in the Bill. So why not call it the Ga-Rankuwa University? The Minister, however, does not want to do it. He indicates that he is not sure of the place because the words &#x201C;in the vicinity of&#x201D; appear later in the Bill. He talks about the university being placed in the vicinity of Ga-Rankuwa. To meet all the objections of the hon. the Minister to our amendment, let us then call it the University of Medical Sciences. I am sure that will satisfy everybody and will not detract from the value of the university. The clause will then certainly get the support of this side of the House.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, no new arguments have been advanced in connection with this matter, and therefore I should like to say something at this stage about the various amendments that have been moved. Judging by the amendments, the major objection of the members on the other side is related to the idea of the work being done by the Minister of Bantu Education or any other Minister. Members who have been in this House for a long time will know what the position is in connection with this subject. This is not the first time these hon. members have debated, during the discussion on a Bill, what the functions of the Minister of Bantu Education as against those of the Minister of National Education should be. We know that we have here a radical and basic political difference of opinion between the two parties, and that is what the argument is about. The hon. members on the other side cannot discuss this measure in the wider sense with us today, and therefore they confine their arguments to the narrow sphere of medical training. However, I know that it is the standpoint of both parties on the other side that the education of all groups in South Africa should be placed under one Minister, and this is the point at issue. However, the hon. members cannot advance that argument here today, because that wider scope is not allowed here. Now they advance feeble and transparent arguments, illogical arguments, in saying that all medical training should fall under one Minister. They simply argue that all medical training should fall under one Minister and that this should be the hon. the Minister of National Education. However, in that case all agricultural training would also have to fall under one Minister, all art training would have to fall under one Minister and all other subjects would also have to fall under one Minister. Must it be a different Minister every time? Surely this is a very unsound argument.</p>

<p>We know that the universities intended for the Bantu peoples fall under the Minister of Bantu Education. However, members who support this amendment want to bring about a division so that just the one university providing medical, dental and veterinary services will fall under a different Minister from the one who controls the other universities, such as Turfloop, Fort Hare and Ngoya. These three universities fall under the Minister of Bantu Education, but they now want this new university to fall under a different Minister. Surely it is an absolutely wrong administrative approach to divide one organism into two modules. Surely this is quite wrong and it cannot be condoned in terms of the administration of education. Nor can it be condoned from an educational point of view, and for that reason I really cannot even consider substituting the hon. the Minister of National Education for the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education, as I am asked to do. The universities are integral units for administrative purposes, and they are controlled by the Minister of Bantu Education. He is the educational guardian of the various Bantu peoples which according to our ideal&#x2014;and it is going to be realized one day&#x2014;will each be able to manage its own affairs. For this reason the Minister of Bantu Education is the <span class="col_5759-5760" refersTo="page_0210"/>guardian Minister under the trustee concept which is a very old one in South Africa, and he is the Minister who has to prepare these matters for the day when each of the Bantu peoples will be able to take over its own affairs. They must not try to pass these matters on to another Minister who has another task in relation to the other population groups of South Africa. I find it strange that the hon. member for Edenvale also advanced this argument. As a good and experienced academic he ought to know that it is a fairly old classical ideal among academics that a theological faculty and training in the medical sciences are ideal directions which should be provided at any university to enable that university to function perfectly. However, he now wants to remove all these aspects from the Minister concerned with the other academic training activities in regard to the Bantu and he wants to entrust them to someone who has absolutely nothing to do with the academic training of the Bantu people. With this I have really dealt with all the arguments advanced by the hon. members who wanted this matter to be handled by the hon. the Minister of National Education instead of by the Minister of Bantu Education, and I do not think there is any of the hon. members&#x2019; arguments I have not replied to.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton floundered today as I have never seen her flounder before. She said that in her opinion there was nothing to choose between Bantu administration and Bantu education, because both fall under one Minister. However, the hon. member sat in this House for six years while two different Ministers handled these two portfolios. My predecessor as Minister of Bantu Administration was Mr. De Wet Nel and my predecessor as Minister of Bantu Education was Mr. Maree. Two different Ministers handled the two different departments. It may be a coincidence in a certain sense that one person is now handling both departments, but they could be entrusted to two different persons at any time. She also asked me why it did not fall under the hon. the Deputy Minister charged with Bantu Education. The hon. member does not seem to know what is going on. She is living in a dream world. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Education does not handle all the educational affairs of the Bantu. Did she not see me getting up on this very day and speaking in this very debate on universities, while the hon. the Deputy Minister spoke on the schools? There is a delegation of work, after all, so I cannot understand how the hon. member could have advanced such a silly argument as this one.</p>

<p>I must say that to some extent I agree with the hon. member for Bloemfontein West that the PRP members want to make use of the Committee Stage to raise matters that should have been raised at the Second Reading, because they were absent when the Second Reading took place and consequently neglected their duty. As regards the arguments in respect of the other amendments, the amendment of the name, I believe it was Shakespeare who said &#x201C;What&#x2019;s in a name?&#x201D; A name is important, but in another sense a name is not important. I do not want to quarrel about this matter with my good friend, the hon. member for Rosettenville. I want to concede that one could argue about this for a long time. I want to tell the hon. member&#x2014;this will please him greatly&#x2014;that the initial idea&#x2014;which did not emanate from me, but from the officials&#x2014;was that we should give the university almost the same name as the one proposed by him, namely the Medical Science University, or something of that nature. We considered that name; we considered many other names. This is something I mentioned during the Second Reading debate, so I am not going to repeat it at any length now. We tried to consider the matter on a realistic and practical level.</p>

<p>We have been speaking for many years of university training for Bantu students in medicine, in dentistry and in veterinary surgery. We still refer to all three directions of study by the same umbrella name. We always speak of them as medical training. When we started the planning and when we considered what the institution would look like and where it would be situated, unofficially we were already referring to the proposed institution as the medical university. The name created itself. That is really what I want to say. It is therefore the most natural name we could find. We could think of other fine-sounding, academic-sounding and thoroughly justified names. I am not arguing about that. In practice, however, people are going to speak of the medical university. The hon. member asked why in that case it could not be the medical university, or whatever university, of Ga-Rankuwa. As far as I am concerned, I advanced enough arguments about this point <span class="col_5761-5762" refersTo="page_0211"/>as well during the Second Reading debate. These amount to the fact that we do not want to tie the proposed medical university specifically to Ga-Rankuwa, because Ga-Rankuwa has an integral association with one single Bantu people. As against this, all Bantu peoples will share in the university, in the composition of the councils as well as by supplying students and in many other ways. They must not be given the impression in any way, whether symbolically or indirectly, that the university belongs more to one people than to the others. We want the dedication and the support of everyone and we want to do justice to the needs of everyone.</p>

<p>The hon. member even said, &#x201C;It is an untidy name.&#x201D; I think the hon. member&#x2019;s name is more untidy. Surely it would not be right for the university to have a name but to be referred to by another name in practice. The proposed name is short and to the point: The Medical University of Southern Africa. This name will probably be abbreviated to Medunsa.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading Debate I explained why the expression &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; was preferable to &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;. I gave the two reasons for this. In the first place it gives a wider idea of the work that is done there in regard to Southern as well as South Africa. In the second place, there is already a university which is known as the University of South Africa. Consequently there could be confusion. The hon. member realizes this, because he referred to it himself today. He anticipated my argument and tried to reply to it himself. For these reasons I believe that hon. members will understand that it is not possible for me to accept any of the proposed amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to react to some of the points which the hon. the Minister has just raised. I should like to support the amendments moved by the hon. member for Rosettenville. To begin with, however, I want to deal with the question of a name for the proposed medical university. We note the expression &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D;. In practice, the University of South Africa has in fact spread its wings far beyond the borders of the Republic of South Africa. If there is an institution which is entitled, by virtue of the service it has rendered, to use the name &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D;, it is undoubtedly the University of South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>You are strengthening my argument.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>No. On the contrary. What my argument amounts to is that if one accepts the argument of the hon. the Minister with regard to the term &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D;, the conclusion is that&#x2014;by virtue of services already rendered&#x2014;the term &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; belongs to the University of South Africa rather than to an institution which has not even been begun.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister went on to argue that the proposed name involved a wider context. By the way, I hope the hon. the Minister will be more accommodating when we are dealing with the remaining amendments. As I have already indicated, we are not concerned here with a reflection on the hon. the Minister in his official capacity. The term &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; may in fact create a false impression. The normal meaning we attach to the term &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; is one which includes at least all the territories, all the countries, in this part of the continent. If we were to use the term &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D;, we could expect, after all, that there should be some consultation at least with the BLS countries and that we would be creating an institution here to which people from the other countries, apart from the Republic and the Transkei, would also have access. Under those circumstances there might still be justification for the use of the name &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D;. But under the present circumstances it seems to me that those countries could object by saying that we are using a term here which is not correct but which is false and which does not reflect the facts of the matter. I am just mentioning this. I agree with the hon. the Minister that a name is a name, but under these circumstances it does seem to me that if we want to use the term &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; to express a geographical area, the term &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; would be less acceptable than &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;. But I do want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Rosettenville. I think there are other possibilities that could be investigated. We could even call it the &#x201C;M. C. Botha Institution for Medical Studies&#x201D;. [Interjections.] I mention this just to indicate that there are other possibilities. The name &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; seems to me to be inappropriate under these circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="col_5763-5764" refersTo="page_0212"/>Furthermore, I want to say that as far as the question of the medical university is concerned, the hon. member for Rosettenville indicated that this was once again creating a false impression. This institution is not devoted to what is normally regarded as medical science, not if we include veterinary surgery. I want to say again that the word &#x201C;medical&#x201D; as it is used here is one which creates a false impression, and to protect the Minister himself from accusations of this nature, I do want to say that it seems to me that the wider concept of &#x201C;medical sciences&#x201D;, if we have to use it, can in fact include veterinary surgery, and not the other way round.</p>

<p>I want to refer in passing to certain of the other arguments that were advanced here. The hon. the Minister himself refuted the argument of the hon. member for Pietersburg. The hon. member for Pietersburg spoke of national development which was supposed to be the basis of this whole Bill. The hon. the Minister replied to that by saying that this institution will be open to all the Bantu peoples, and he also said that the impression must not be created that one people is being favoured more than another. Sir, we cannot eat our cake and have it. Either the matter transcends the boundaries of ethnic variety as far as the Black people are concerned, or it does not. The hon. the Minister says very clearly that it does transcend those boundaries, and therefore he cannot motivate it by saying that this institution is essential for building a Bantu people, unless we say that we regard all the Bantu peoples as one people.</p>

<p>This is not true. The University of the North is not an ethnic university in the sense in which the University of Zululand or the University of Fort Hare is. Surely this is quite clear. [Interjections.] That may be so or it may not be so, but I just want to say that we must not use arguments which actually destroy our own case. This is my reply to the hon. member for Pietersburg as well. I want to say quite honestly: We must not put up our own windmills and then attack them again. This proposed university was not referred to as a bush college by this side of the House. I did not do this and I do not think that any of the speakers on this side did, and there were really only two speakers who took part in the Second Reading debate. I do want to have my objection recorded to the fact that we have been accused of something we did not say.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am speaking of the hon. member for Pietersburg. My impression was that he applied it to this debate as well.</p>

<p>Then I also want to refer to the argument of the hon. member for Bloemfontein West. As we shall see later, the homelands are represented on the council of this proposed institution in terms of clause 10. Consequently it is not necessary to do this through the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education; they are represented on the council themselves. So I cannot concede any validity to the argument advanced by the hon. member for Pietersburg, the hon. member for Bloemfontein West and the hon. the Minister that the responsible person must be the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education and not the hon. the Minister of National Education. It does not matter at all who the administrative head is. Whether the Black universities had been established on an ethnic basis or on any other basis, such as the University of the North, would have made no difference. I am not prepared to concede that the hon. the Minister of National Education would have done any less competent a job than the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education in respect of those universities. Therefore the other arguments fall away. Consequently I want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider in a more positive spirit the objections in connection with these three specific points.</p>

<p>Then I just want to ask whether it is in order for an hon. member to support two contradictory standpoints at the same time. I say this because I am sure those hon. members did not consult <span class="col_5765-5766" refersTo="page_0213"/>with one another. The hon. member for Durban Central moved in his amendment that &#x201C;Universiteit van Suider-Afrika vir Mediese Wetenskappe&#x201D; be used, but the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North proposes that &#x201C;Suider-Afrika&#x201D; be deleted and replaced by &#x201C;Suid-Afrika&#x201D;. So we have two different proposals here: One member proposes one name and another member proposes a different name.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I abide by your ruling, but &#x201C;Suid-Afrika&#x201D; and &#x201C;Suider-Afrika&#x201D; do not mean the same thing in Afrikaans. What is printed here, therefore, is a contradiction. The one amendment refers to &#x201C;Suid-Afrika&#x201D;, while the other one refers to &#x201C;Suider-Afrika&#x201D;. Consequently these two amendments contradict each other.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, quite apart from the translation, one amendment implies &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D;, while the other amendment implies &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D;. These are two quite different terms. My problem is that the hon. member for Rosettenville moved the amendments on behalf of these two hon. members. The hon. member for Edenvale then said that he supported both amendments, and I therefore want to know whether an hon. member may support two amendments that do not have the same meaning. With all respect, Mr. Chairman, I want to disagree with you and to say that the substance of these two amendments is not the same. I should like hon. members on the other side to give me an indication of which of the two amendments they actually support. I should like to have a reply from the hon. member for Edenvale at a later stage.</p>

<p>However, what also interested me a great deal this morning was the sudden and absolutely unexpected interest taken by the PRP in this Bill. The Friday before, when the Second Reading debate on the Bill was resumed, the hon. the Leader of the PRP and the hon. member for Parktown were present. They have set themselves up to be the spokesmen of the Black man in this House. The hon. members also believe that they have to look after the interests of the Black people of this country. However, it seems to me once again that the PRP is not so sincere in its behaviour towards the Black people as it would have us believe, for it seems that some members on that side were to have spoken on the Bill. Perhaps one of the hon. members who were to have spoken on it was precisely the hon. member who was referred to earlier as Brother Superior, the hon. member for Pinelands. However, he did not want to change his arrangements for the weekend in order to be able to advance arguments on behalf of the Black people against the principle of a medical university being established for Black people. Consequently I question the sincerity of that party in respect of the Black people of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville is an elderly member for whom I have great respect, but he made a remark I do not feel happy about. He said that the fact that this university would fall under the Minister of Bantu Education would stigmatize the university, because it could create the impression that it was just an institution falling under the Minister of Bantu Education. He said that the university should fall under the Minister of National Education, otherwise it would look like discrimination. I think it was a very unfortunate remark which the hon. member for Rosettenville made, because his words implied that the education controlled by the Minister of Bantu Education was inferior compared to the education offered to Whites and falling under the Minister of National Education.</p>

I took the trouble to read the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech with great care and I found in so doing that he gave three major reasons for the siting of the university at Ga-Rankuwa. It was necessary that the medical school be near a hospital which is large enough to provide the students with adequate opportunities for training, which of course is absolutely right And he stated also, correctly, to my mind, that there would have to be medical practitioners and specialists in the vicinity who could serve as part-time staff and instruct the medical students. Thirdly, he said that it was essential to ensure that such a new institution would from the outset maintain recognized standards in the training and evaluation of its students. He also said that the university would be specially <span class="col_5771-5772" refersTo="page_0216"/>situated so that it would be within reach of two established universities, both with medical schools, one being Pretoria University and the other the University of the Witwatersrand. Each of these has a medical and a dental faculty which would be of assistance to the new medical school at Ga-Rankuwa. He said finally that the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Institute would also be within easy reach. Some of these reasons are valid, but others, I would suggest, are not so valid. To my mind the only really valid reason for siting Medunsa at Ga-Rankuwa is the last one, viz. that it is close to Onderstepoort. I would suggest, however, that it would be very easy to simply absorb Black students at Onderstepoort itself rather than set up a huge new expensive institution. The other reasons given by the hon. the Minister I do not think have such validity. Ga-Rankuwa, I believe, is about 40 km outside of Pretoria. I do not call that within striking distance of part-time specialists for teaching purposes. It certainly is not within striking distance for Johannesburg specialists who are attached to the University of the Witwatersrand Medical School. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister how many consultations he had in depth before he decided to site the new medical school at Ga-Rankuwa. He said that he had spoken to both the universities of Pretoria and the Witwatersrand and that they were willing to help him and, indeed, even to sit on the council. That we have established.</p>

<p>I wonder whether either of those universities had a better suggestion to make, or did they simply agree to serve on the Ga-Rankuwa council and to help with the development of the new medical school when they knew that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind was irrevocably made up? Then I wonder whether he discussed the siting of the new medical school with the one teaching medical school that has had 25 years of experience of training Black doctors, and that is of course Natal Medical School. Did he discuss the siting of this new medical school with them? Did he get their advice? Did he have any suggestions from them? I think it is very important that the experience of Natal Medical School be utilized before we establish a R30 million institution 40 km outside of Pretoria. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister consulted the University Advisory Committee, as it was, or the new advisory committee which has been set up as a result of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission&#x2019;s report. Did the hon. the Minister consult the Committee of University Principals? At present I think there are five universities which have medical schools and they all have principals who belong to the Committee of University Principals. I would have thought that the hon. the Minister would also have consulted those people. If he did consult them, were all of them in agreement that Ga-Rankuwa is the ideal place to site a new university? We all agree that there has got to be more training facilities for medical students, and particularly for Black medical students, but I would like to point out that the establishment of Medunsa is dependent on the closing down gradually, the phasing out, of Natal Medical School and at most it seems that by 1980, according to estimates made by experts, Ga-Rankuwa will be at its limit of 200 medical students in all. For a very small sum of money an additional 40 students could be accommodated at Natal and as far as taking more students is concerned &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I say that if I do not want the medical school to be sited at Ga-Rankuwa, I do want it to be sited somewhere else? What I am suggesting to the hon. the Minister are alternative sites. I want to put it to him that for an expenditure of much less than R30 million the existing facilities for instance at Baragwanath Medical School could easily be expanded to accommodate the students whom the hon. the Minister wants to train. Baragwanath fulfils all the conditions the hon. the Minister stated in his Second Reading speech for choosing Ga-Rankuwa. It has a large hospital containing, I believe, some 3 000 beds. It is already training medical students. All the Black medical students at the University of the Witwatersrand receive their training at Baragwanath. And, what is most important, it has the part-time specialist staff at hand, experienced in all the medical sciences and, I might say, in all the paramedical sciences too, which can provide the necessary training for these students at very much less cost than R30 million for a new medical school.</p>

<p>A final reason for asking the hon. the <span class="col_5773-5774" refersTo="page_0217"/>Minister to reconsider where he is going to site the medical school, is to remember that Baragwanath is closest to the largest Black city south of the Sahara, i.e. Soweto. This means that aspirant medical students can live at home and attend the medical school at Baragwanath. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I do not intend repeating all the arguments which were advanced during the Second Reading debate, but I do want to point out that we consulted with people over a broad spectrum. It is true we did not consult with all the bodies which the hon. member enumerated, but we have the co-operation of the University of Pretoria and the University of the Witwatersrand in the body which we established. We never had any bickering on the part of these two universities over the fact that the planned university will be situated in Ga-Rankuwa. There is a good hospital at Ga-Rankuwa.</p>

<p>It would not be possible to omit the words the deletion of which has been proposed, and not substitute anything in their place, because then it would be a floating university which could float about all over the whole Transvaal. It would be a real &#x201C;pie in the sky&#x201D;, as the hon. members so often say here in Parliament. It is completely unpractical to delete those words and not insert anything in their place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a fact that during the Second Reading debate, both the hon. member for Rosettenville and I discussed the desirability of whether the <span class="col_5775-5776" refersTo="page_0218"/>proposed university should not necessarily be located in Ga-Rankuwa. We also referred to Baragwanath and Soweto as alternative locations. The hon. the Minister has already replied to our representations in this regard. I must say that his reply was not satisfactory, but I shall leave it at that now.</p>

<p>In regard to the proposed amendment I want to point out that there are to my mind two criteria in the location of an institution such as the proposed university. Simply as far as the consideration goes that there are two universities which have to be involved in the new institution, I believe that the hon. the Minister will concede that Ga-Rankuwa is not really of decisive importance, because there is a wide area within which the proposed university could be situated without it being difficult for these two universities to be involved in it. Apart from this consideration, there are to my mind two other criteria. The one applies to the development of a national identity, to talk in terms of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy, and as far as this is concerned, I have already pointed out earlier that that argument falls away in any case since the proposed university will not be confined to one particular population group. Therefore, seen from that point of view, there is no reason why the proposed university cannot, for example, be situated in Soweto. The argument is furnished that Soweto comprises of a conglomeration of people and that a university there would reflect the conglomeration and will therefore not be able to make a contribution to the creation of a national identity. But that argument of course is also applicable to the proposed university itself since it has already been said that it will be open to all the Black people of southern Africa.</p>

<p>The second consideration is that the establishment of the proposed university should make a contribution to the development of a particular area. Therefore it is necessary, for the sake of the future development of areas like the Transkei, the Ciskei, KwaZulu or whatever the case may be, for the state-in-the-making to have its own institutions for higher education. During the Second Reading debate we specifically asked whether the planned university would form part of a specific homeland and the reply to that was in the negative. I also asked whether, in view of the fact that the normal requirement is that trust land should be transferred to some homeland or other, the trust land on which the university will be set up, will be transferred to a homeland. The reply to that was that nothing prohibits the trust land from being held back and not being transferred to a particular homeland.</p>

<p>I merely want to point out that that consideration concerning the location of the university does not apply in this case either.</p>

<p>With reference to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply to this debate, I want to suggest in all humility that, if the words &#x201C;near Ga-Rankuwa&#x201D; were deleted, it does not necessarily follow that other words should be inserted. The words &#x201C;in the province of the Transvaal &#x201D; are still applicable. Other legislation exists which was passed previously on the other universities in which only the province is indicated within which a university shall be situated.</p>

<p>Although I am afraid that the die has been cast as far as the proposed amendment is concerned, I want to point out nevertheless that I believe, in the first place, that Soweto is the obvious place. In the second place I believe that Baragwanath is the obvious hospital. In the third place I believe that even if the university were to be situated in Soweto, it will be possible for the two universities to be involved in the contemplated university.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister a question about the utilization of Onderstepoort, a point which the hon. the Minister also touched on. How are Black students to be accommodated in the veterinary science department at Onderstepoort? If they are not to be accommodated there, I should like to know how Onderstepoort&#x2019;s facilities will be used in the training of Black students.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to give a reply to the last question of the hon. member. The hon. member knows what my reply is to the other points which he raised and therefore I need not refer to them again. As far as veterinary students are concerned, it seems to me there is a misunderstanding. I am a little hesitant to deal with this matter under the clause which is now being considered, because I really do not know whether it belongs here. If I deal with it here nevertheless, the hon. member must please not raise the matter again under the relevant clause.</p>

<p>The intention is not that the veterinary students shall be trained at Onderstepoort. Their hostel and sport facilities will be provided on the grounds of the planned university and they will even be able to attend certain lectures there. Onderstepoort will render assistance at Medunsa. It may be that arrangements may be made with Onderstepoort so that students may attend demonstrations and so on at Onderstepoort, but the centre of veterinary training for Black students will be at Medunsa.</p>

<p>This morning, by way of a passing reaction on the part of the hon. the Minister I formed the impression that he was not very interested in extending his authority to an unlimited extent.

<p>The hon. member must please not waste my time; I am concerned with very serious matters. If I am to answer the hon. member&#x2019;s interjection, I want to point out to him that there are also non-Whites at some of the White universities. The hon. member knows this as well as I do. I therefore cannot speak of &#x201C;White &#x201D; universities in the sense in which he usually means it. I would rather carry on with my argument.</p>

<p>It is essential that the pattern which we want to establish there, must fit in as closely as possible with those of our existing full-fledged universities. This morning, when we were discussing the Bantu Education Vote, the hon. the Minister indicated that he was considering legislation the essential aim of which would be to bring the excising Bantu universities closer to the accepted pattern of the universities in South Africa.</p>

<p>I did not put it in that way.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I am using my own words, but this is probably what is envisaged by implication as regards the composition and functions of the council, etc. I should like to repeat that it is essential, for that university too, that we should do so. This being so it seems obvious to me&#x2014;I repeat that it is in the interest of the university institution which the hon. the Minister wants to found&#x2014;that we must establish the same pattern with respect to the functioning of the institution as is already being followed at the other universities. No real objection can be made to this, especially not when considered in the light of clause 10. In clause 10 an explanation of the composition of the council is given. In the light of the confidence which the hon. the Minister himself expressed in the people who are contributing towards the founding of that university, and who will also serve on the council of the proposed university, there is a difference. It <span class="col_5779-5780" refersTo="page_0220"/>differs from the university colleges for Blacks, with respect to the manner in which the councils are composed. In this connection it would also be as well to take note of the university institutions of the Indians and of the Coloureds. Here we are dealing with a completely different situation. Here we have people who are capable of holding their positions in the council concerned in every respect. Therefore I believe that it is essential that the same powers be granted to that council as those possessed by the councils of our existing universities. In that respect it seems ridiculous to me that whereas in clause 4(1) the council is empowered to borrow money, in clause 4(3)(a) it is stated that the university may not borrow money without the approval of the Minister.</p>

<p>Earlier we spoke of the borrowing power of the Black universities. I did not gain the impression that it would be subject to Ministerial approval. However, it seems ridiculous to me to expect that a council as will be constituted here, should have the approval of the Minister before it may borrow money. The same applies to the question of the acceptance of donations or bequests. This does not apply to any other university. Once again, taking into consideration the composition of the council, it is surely totally unnecessary to make the acceptance of donations or bequests subject to approval by the Minister.</p>

<p>Clause 4(6) concerns agreements with other bodies which may be entered into by the university. It seems to me as if this is also a matter which should rather be left to the council. I want to make a friendly appeal to the hon. the Minister to try and see to it that&#x2014;on the strength of the status of the proposed institution&#x2014;an attempt should be made to get away from the impression which is consistently created by the Bill, the impression that it is not really an independent institution at all, but that it is actually an institution which is under the thumb of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education. This is the impression which is created there. It seems to be an institution with no authority of its own, with no power of its own and with no right to act as a corporate institution.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to support the hon. member for Edenvale. I want to refer to clause 4(4), which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The university may with the approval of the Minister receive money or any other property by way of donation or bequest &#x2026;</block>

<p>We on this side of the House have moved that the words &#x201C;with the approval of the Minister&#x201D; be deleted. If we delete those words and insert &#x201C;with the approval of the council&#x201D;&#x2014;I have a written amendment to that effect here in front of me&#x2014;this provision will fall in line with clause 4(5)(a), which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The university may acquire for its use such stores and equipment, in such manner and on such conditions, as the council may determine.</block>

<p>Surely, if the council may determine that, why may it not determine which donations the university may receive.

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, all three amendments which have been moved here affect a very important matter. I do not want to allege that they affect the central principle of the Bill, but they do affect a very important aspect of it, an aspect with implications for the principle of the matter. This is the question of the financial control of the university. Hon. members will remember that similar provisions exist with respect to the other three Bantu universities, as well as with respect to the universities of the Indians and of the Coloureds. These are universities which receive every cent of their money from the State, apart from money which they borrow, the interest and repayment of which is the responsibility of the State. In the last instance, therefore what it amounts to is that they do indeed receive all their money from the State. For that reason it is a very important financial policy requirement set by both the State and the Treasury, and the hon. the Minister of Finance, that the permission of the Minister is required before the university may borrow money or accept donations. In my turn I am responsible to the hon. the Minister of Finance and, as is quite clear from the Bill, consultation with the hon. the Minister of Finance is <span class="col_5781-5782" refersTo="page_0221"/>prescribed. This is a very important matter, and we must not lose sight of the fact that, since the State is entirely responsible for the provision of all funds, the State cannot therefore be eliminated entirely, as the proposed amendments envisage doing.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Rosettenville however states that if in the instance of clause 4(5)(a) it could be said that with regard to supplies the council alone can decide, that could serve as a good argument in favour of his amendment. It is not a good argument, because the money is primarily made available to the university. When the university has received that money, the Government trusts them to use that money in order to obtain supplies. It is not necessary that I or the hon. the Minister of Finance should control their supplies. What we do control, is the money allotted by us. That is what we do account for here.</p>

<p>*That principle is at issue here, and we find the same principle in several other places, throughout the Bill. I can say in advance that I shall oppose any attempt to change this. I shall do so on the principle that the State must protect its joint responsibility from the financial point of view.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Edenvale. I think it is quite right that he attempts to limit, at least to some extent, the authoritarian control that the hon. the Minister wishes to exercise over this proposed medical university. He states as a reason that the same provisions exist in respect of other Black universities. Of course, he is quite right. The three ethnic universities for the Bantu, the Indian University of Durban Westville and the University of the Western Cape, all have to adhere to the same provisions, and in every case it is with the approval of the hon. the Minister. Not one of those universities may accept money without the approval of the hon. the Minister. However, the fact that he introduced it at that time&#x2014;and I may add that it was opposed very strongly by this side of the House&#x2014;does not make it correct now. As we opposed it then, we wish to oppose it again now. I cannot see any reason why the hon. the Minister has to have his thumb down on this new university medical school. He gives it the title of university immediately. It is not even a university college. It is not a college of medicine or of medical sciences. It is a university.</p>

<p>Surely, one of the hall-marks of a university is that it has some measure of autonomy. However, that is not the case under thus Government or under this hon. Minister. He has to dictate &#x2026;</p>

The hon. <span class="col_5783-5784" refersTo="page_0222"/>member for Houghton also says so, but then opposes the provision that the Minister of Bantu Education exercises that authority because, she says, it cannot be justified in the case of a university which is becoming a full-fledged university, there are discriminatory noises, and so on. I want to point out to both these hon. members that the Universities Act, No. 61 of 1955, applies to White universities, and section 21 makes provision for every application for a loan to be subject to the agreement of the Minister of National Education. Now the hon. members must tell us whether they reject completely the function of Parliament of exercising financial control by means of its executive. In other words, what these hon. members now want to do, is to introduce entirely new principles as far as financial control over universities is concerned instead of those which apply throughout to all the White universities. This derives from the central act which applies to White universities and runs through like a golden thread through the Bantu universities too. It is a universal principle, as the hon. member for Rissik rightly said. That is why these amendments cause discordant sounds to be uttered, and this also goes for the second amendment of the hon. member for Edenvale. It is a fact that every form of expansion or an agreement for the provision of services by other bodies or persons, which is also a form of expansion, is subject to the approval of the Minister&#x2014;the Minister of National Education in the case of every other university. Therefore all the arguments which are raised in this context, fall flat.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has said that the principle involved, in this power to be retained by him, is directed towards the financial control of the institution because of the Government&#x2019;s involvement in the continued financing of these universities. I wish that that was correct, because I believe that when we look at the particular provision in this clause and similar provisions throughout the other clauses&#x2014; which, with your leave, Sir, I will deal with merely because of the pattern of which this forms part&#x2014;one finds that in no less than 21 instances in this Bill before us the residual power remains vested in the Minister. Sir, one wonders why that is so, because those powers are not, as the hon. the Minister said, merely to exercise financial control. It goes much further. This particular clause is part of a pattern presented in this Bill. I wonder why the Minister must have these powers retained unto himself. In clause 4, which is before us, this power restricts the university; and if one looks at clause 5 one sees the persons whom the hon. the Minister now wants to make subject to his control. I need not go through it. It is the whole format of a university: the chancellor, the vice-chancellor, the council, the senate, the convocation and so on. That is what constitutes a university. The hon. the Minister now wants, right throughout the Bill, not only to deal with the financial aspects, but the principle which he wants to get accepted in clause 4 is a principle which also goes through to the appointment of staff and everything&#x2014; the whole way through. Sir, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I believe that if he wants to give&#x2014;and I believe he does&#x2014;the proper status of a university, of a medical university, to this institution, then for heaven&#x2019;s sake let it be seen to be so, with all the powers which are normally given to a university. But throughout the attitude of the Minister, as is evidenced in clause 4, is that powers which would normally be exercised and should be exercised by the controlling body of this university, will be subject to his approval or disapproval. As I say, this occurs in no less than 21 instances in this Bill, and if I might be allowed a little latitude on this point, Mr. Chairman, it would save me speaking 21 times during this Committee Stage. This is not offering separate development with the sky as the limit for a medical university for Black people when there is this retention of power in the hands of the Minister. The hon. the Minister might well say that in future, so far as this university is concerned, it is going to be conducted by the Minister and directed by the Minister. That is what goes through the whole of this Bill.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I wish to raise, with respect. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether, with his knowledge of the conduct of the affairs of a university, affairs which require the fulltime attention of the university and the staff of that university, it is practical for him to suggest that these powers of control should be exercised by his department. He himself certainly cannot do it. His responsibilities for other matters in his portfolio take up too much of his time for him <span class="col_5785-5786" refersTo="page_0223"/>to be able to attend to every one of these matters that require his approval. I ask the Minister not to detract from what can be a valuable institution, from what can be something of value to the Black people of South Africa, by restricting in every possible aspect the powers of those bodies which are appointed to run this university in terms of the Bill before us.</p>

<p>Order! Before I call upon the next hon. member to speak, I should like to say that in this clause we are dealing with the question of the approval of the Minister. This is repeated like a refrain in many of the amendments on the Order Paper. For the convenience of hon. members I therefore want to suggest that they now debate this aspect fully under this clause and that, when we come to the next clauses, the amendments are simply moved for approval or rejection. I cannot give a ruling on this because any hon. member is entitled to speak about it, but if everyone agrees, I now give hon. members the opportunity to elaborate on this subject fully, with the reservation, of course, that there be no repetition.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can understand the Minister&#x2019;s argument if this clause dealt only with moneys. If it provided that the university may with the approval of the Minister receive money, then I could understand his reluctance to allow the council to determine from where the money shall come. But this goes further. It deals also with property and donations. Does the Minister seriously think that he should interfere to the extent that if a person wants to give this medical school a microscope, before they can accept it they have to go to the Minister to get his permission? That is what the clause says, and it is quite ridiculous. It also means that if a bequest is made to the university, before they can receive this bequest they would have to go to the Minister and make sure that they can in fact accept it although it may be too late to go back to the man who left it because he cannot change his will. And yet the Minister for some reason or other could decide not to allow them to take money from the person who is offering it. It is donations, material donations, given to them which they will not be able to accept unless they go to the Minister. I think the hon. the Minister should have another look at this. As I have said, I can understand if it dealt with simply the financing of the university. However, it goes much further. What is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention? Is it that every time somebody wants to give the university a gift of some sort, must they go to the Minister for permission to receive it? That is what the provisions of the Clause boils down to. I want the hon. the Minister to have another look at this before he rejects the amendments we have put forward.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to identify with the argument of the hon. member for Rosettenville. However, I also want to return to the remarks of the hon. member for Bloemfontien West. Am I correct in saying that the hon. member referred to section 21 of the Universities Act?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>My remarks concern the first amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the one which concerns bursaries and loans. I should like to point out to the hon. member that he did not read section 21 together with section 20 of the Act concerned. Section 21 only concerns loans made by the State. Section 21 specifically states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) The Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance may, subject to the provisions of this Act and out of moneys voted by Parliament for this purpose &#x2026;</block>

<p>If the hon. member looks at subsection (l)(e), he will see that the following is appositely mentioned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(e) the repayment of any loan &#x2026;</block>

<p>This excludes any loans from moneys voted by Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; lawfully raised by a council, before or at after the commencement of this Act &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_5787-5788" refersTo="page_0224"/>It is therefore a recognized practice and the right of the university council to raise loans. It is a recognized right. Section 21, to which the hon. member referred, only applies to loans raised out of funds which were provided for this purpose by Parliament. It is therefore much more restrictive than in the case of loans which must be approved by the Minister in terms of this Bill. I also want to point out that if this principle is accepted, the Universities Act, 1955, would automatically apply to the proposed institution. That is of course our whole idea, that this institution be treated on an equal footing with other university institutions. The hon. member therefore left us under a wrong impression as far as this matter was concerned.</p>

<p>As far as the arguments of the hon. the Minister are concerned, I want to say that, as the hon. member for Rosettenville indicated, the only real argument the hon. the Minister advanced, was that relating to finances. But this is nevertheless something which occurs gradually. Our other universities are financed by State subsidies to the extent of 70% to 80% nowadays. Is it necessary to change the whole pattern when there is 100% subsidization? In any event it seems to me that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument does not hold water. Even with the provision as stated here in (3)(a), there is the possibility of donations and bequests and there is an income from tuition fees and boarding fees. Clause 23 already provides that this money should go to the State. The hon. the Minister is therefore creating the situation that this university will indeed have no financial fund. This is not in accord with the nature of a university. Nor does it follow from the fact of the contribution made by the State towards the financing of the universities. The universities are therefore going to have their own sources of income&#x2014; for example tuition fees, boarding fees, the possibility of donations and bequests and the possibility of other income by way of loans or whatever. As far as the financial argument is concerned, therefore, there is no reason why this university should not be cast in exactly the same mould as the other universities in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say something in connection with the request which you made to us. We do indeed feel that if we cannot make progress here, it will be pointless to motivate our standpoint afresh in respect of each clause. However, there are two major points of difference. The one, of course, concerns the financial affairs of the council, while in the other case it actually concerns the functions of the council with respect to the internal administration of the university. We shall still deal with that, but what I want to say now, is that in this case, too, it is obvious to me that the council taking into consideration the way in which it is composed and the responsible people who are going to serve on the council in terms of the existing provisions, there is no reason at all why the council, as far as the internal administration of the university is concerned, should not have the same powers and authorities as the university councils at other universities.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, bearing in mind your suggestion of a few minutes ago, I was going to save my own energy and strength for a little later on in the other clauses. However, rather than letting hon. members anticipate, I would like to speak about it now. I want to support the amendments moved by the hon. member for Eden-vale. The one thing which is very clear is that the hon. the Minister has decided that he will give and give generously with one hand and that he will take back almost as generously with the other. That is, of course, to be expected. It is the kind of paternalistic attitude we have come to expect from this department. We do not only have the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; being repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> in the Bill, but also the words &#x201C;approval&#x201D;, &#x201C;with the concurrence&#x201D; and &#x201C;consultation&#x201D;. The only time it changes is when we have to have the &#x201C;prior approval&#x201D;, whatever that may mean, as distinct from &#x201C;approval&#x201D;. I hope the hon. the Minister will rethink the whole approach towards this new venture. We are all agreed that it is a venture that is due in South Africa, but I am sorry for the way in which it is being done. It is sad that the hon. the Minister feels that he cannot trust the senate and the council to administer this university.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for the suggestion you made, with the agreement of hon. members, in connection with this clause.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I would like to say to the hon. member for Houghton that I am not as nervous about these <span class="col_5789-5790" refersTo="page_0225"/>matters as she pretends I am. It is a matter of State finances and the customary practices and principles applying in this respect. The hon. member speaks of me being nervous, but the truth is that she believes so much in unbridled freedom that she does not trust the Government at all with the necessary control where interests of the State are concerned. That is the difficulty I have with the hon. member. She agrees with me.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Green Point asked why all these powers should be granted. He asked if this was really a very practical method. I can tell the hon. member that I have already had ten years of experience of this at the other three Black universities in South Africa. The same goes for my two colleagues in respect of the other two non-White universities in South Africa. In practice it works quite satisfactorily. I give very much more attention to various other types of activities of the two departments than to financial control of the universities. Everything is arranged properly on the basis of the prescribed procedure and action is taken according to this. The hon. member for Rosettenville cannot make it out to be ludicrous. It is an old trick of hon. members, if they have a poor case, to present the opponent&#x2019;s case as being ludicrous. Now the hon. member says that if those people want to buy a microscope, they shall have to run to me first &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. The hon. member is reading his own wishful thinking into the Bill. Were clause 4(4) not in the Bill, then our universities would not have proper authorization to establish private development funds, because they receive private development funds by means of donations. The hon. member can just as well go and find out at the other three universities which I have been administering for ten years already, whether this is the case or not. These development funds were established during my time as Minister. Those universities do a great deal on their own campuses with money which they receive from outside. Everything which they receive is managed in accordance with to a proper set of rules, which we drew up for that purpose. In other words, they receive a general authorization and approval if they receive money, donations, things like microscopes or properties of various other kinds. This takes place according to that procedure which is laid down and they do not have to come to me or to my department with each of those matters; it is properly arranged.</p>

<p>Why is it then not in the Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not necessary to put it in the Bill as such because it lies within the discretionary power of the Minister to arrange it in this way together with his department. However, I do not take it amiss of the hon. member for Rosettenville. The hon. member should not, however, become so excited, because it seems that he is even becoming angry with me. I do not take it amiss of him, because he does not even have half a day&#x2019;s experience of ministerial administration. I cannot take him amiss of him because he does not know how a Minister operates nor how a department works. What does the hon. member know about this? He has no experience of it. The tragedy is that he is never going to gain any. The hon. member does not even want to accept my explanation either. After all, one should not define every discretion, every sensible action taken by the Minister and his department, in an act. Then hon. members on the other side of the House would complain even more. In practice, therefore, in respect of matters of this kind, this university will operate in the same way as the other three universities which fall under my administration have been operating in the past. After all, it would be very unfair to try and deal with this new university according to a completely different pattern. With time one can always re-organize these things, but let us keep the whole group of universities with which I as <span class="col_5791-5792" refersTo="page_0226"/>Minister of Bantu Education am dealing, on the same course, broadly speaking. If this does not happen, one can create unpleasant circumstances not only in the department, but also between the universities themselves.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands complained about the money which was taken back. He said that I gave a great deal with one generous hand and took far more back with the other stingy one. It is not I who am doing so; it takes place in terms of procedures of the State, of the Treasury; it is the financial principle where the State makes investments and spends money on certain matters. The proceeds then return to the Treasury. That hon. member does not know it, because he has even less knowledge and experience of State administration than the hon. member for Rosettenville, he has only been in this Parliament since the year before last. I do not think that he gained any experience of financial administration in the church to which he was previously attached.</p>

It is not like an ordinary university. That hon. member knows as well as I do that there is status involved in the training of doctors and dentists. The status involved here is much higher than that of an ordinary B.A. degree or something similar.

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are now concerned with the second aspect about which I spoke earlier. The relative position of the hon. the Minister and the council with respect to financial control has already been mentioned. Here, in clause 8, however, we are dealing with the powers of the hon. the Minister as against those of the council in respect of the internal control of the university. Everything which I said in connection with financial control of the university also applies here. In all honesty taking into consideration the composition of the council, I cannot see why the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s approval should be required for the appointment of a rector, vice-rector, lecturers, etc. This is not his task.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the members of this Committee will agree with me that the rector of this university, like the rector of any university, is a very important&#x2014;certainly the most important&#x2014;executive, policy-forming and policy-protecting official of the university. This university is of course completely dependent on the State and since this university must undertake extremely important ventures, great care must be taken in the appointment of the rector. I am certain that my hon. friend on the other side has already realized&#x2014;and if he has not yet discovered this I just want to point it out to him&#x2014;that this provision differs from the provisions which apply in respect of the other five universities for non-Whites. In those cases the Minister appoints the rector and that is the end of the matter. He can consult the council in this regard, but he does not require the approval of the council. In this case we made two very important changes. Firstly, we gave the council the power of appointment, admittedly with the agreement of the Minister. Secondly&#x2014;and this is a very important matter&#x2014;we shifted the initiative which will result in the appointment of the rector, from the Minister to the council. The council will be the body which will begin looking for a person to occupy the post of rector. The council will have to obtain the Minister&#x2019;s permission for the appointment of that person.</p>

<p>In other words, we have brought about a major shift in emphasis and responsibility from the Minister to the council. However, I hope that hon. members will understand that it is not possible to eliminate the Minister in this case. I have already given the reason for this. The rector is such a vitally important executive, administrative and academic officer of the university. The institution is also entirely dependent on the State for its money and must serve large communities and the government of other homelands. Therefore the appointment of the head of such an institution requires the approval of the Minister of Bantu Education. That person must have the confidence of the Minister in everything he does because he is responsible for the whole functioning of that university. Therefore it is by no means asking too much that the Minister should give his permission. This is a very major concession, if I may call it that, in comparison with the position up to now. Indeed, it is a very much greater concession than one finds abroad at other universities, where the whole council&#x2014; including the rector&#x2014;must be appointed by a Minister merely because those institutions are also considered to be State institutions. We do not do this here.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister only emphasized one point, namely the question of the appointment of the rector. As a matter of fact my arguments went further. I refer to the position of the Minister as against the council as far as the internal administration of the university was concerned. Let me first answer the point with which the hon. the Minister dealt. Everyone will grant at once that the appointment of the rector is a very important matter. It is clear that it involves great responsibilities. However, this applies to all universities.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope you will not rule me out of order if, in the light of the general nature of the discussion, I come back to the composition of the council as it is set out in clause 10. If we look at the composition of the council, we see that it will consist of the rector and vice-rector, one person appointed by each of the Bantu homelands as official representatives of the homelands, two members of the senate of the university, one person from each of the faculties of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science of the University of Pretoria, who are nominated by the council of the University of Pretoria&#x2014;a total, therefore of three persons nominated by the University of Pretoria; one person each from the faculties of medicine and dentistry of the University of the Witwatersrand, a total, therefore, of two persons from that university; one person nominated by each of the other three Black university councils; then, the Secretaries of Bantu Education, Bantu Administration and Development and of Health, as well as another two persons appointed by the State President, the chairman of the Hospital Board and, in conclusion, one person appointed by the Minister. It is therefore a body of stature. It is a body which consists of persons who possess the highest sense of responsibility, persons who are fully acquainted with the functioning of universities&#x2014;most of them, anyway. They are people who carry the full authority of years of experience of university administration. Not one of these people are people of whom it can be said that they will not carry out their duty in a responsible manner at that university. Had <span class="col_5797-5798" refersTo="page_0229"/>the council been constituted in another way, I could still understand the Minister wanting to have control of the internal administration of the university. However, why is the approval of the Minister necessary for the appointment of a vice-rector, of lecturers, etc? By this means the hon. the Minister is moving a motion of no confidence in this body in advance. I want to tell you frankly and in all honesty that except in so far as one wants to provide a service to the Black community, if I were to be asked as a thinking, responsible person to carry out my duty within the university system if it was subject to limitations and supervision of this kind, and if this lack of confidence was expressed in anticipation, I would find it very difficult to participate in this. I want to tell the hon. the Minister once again that by doing this he is doing himself an injustice because he has, after all, made it apparent that to him, he, as Minister of Bantu Education is not the issue. What should apply here, is the status of the university, including its status in the eyes of the outside world, the sort of institution which we want to create and the involvement of people who would be only too keen to carry out their full responsibility in this respect. I want to say in all honesty that in the light of these circumstances it seems to me to be entirely unnecessary, and not only unnecessary, but entirely undesirable, that the Minister should take upon himself all the powers mentioned in this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Edenvale is making a great fuss about the right of veto, if one may call it that, which the hon. the Minister possesses. The hon. the Minister did, after all, spell it out very clearly that, from the point of view of the hon. member for Edenvale, this is a great improvement on the present position at the existing Black universities. As the Act reads at present, the council recommends someone to the Minister. The council does indeed take the initiative. Actually, the whole matter is in the hands of the council. The Minister only has to express his approval. Since this is a new university and since one knows that clashes or disputes may arise in such a council, it is necessary, as is the case in many other acts, and many other boards and councils, for the Minister to have the final say, in spite of the fact that the boards and councils, including the university councils, may have certain powers. In the case of the marketing boards, for example&#x2014;to mention an analogous case merely to illustrate the point&#x2014;all the decisions of those boards are subject to ministerial approval. In this case it is not true that the Minister can tell the council what it must do, because the entire initiative rests with the council. I do not believe one can say that the Minister does not have confidence in the university council he has appointed. I do not believe that this is the intention at all. However, I think that it remains a sound principle in the case of a new body like this university that, especially in the beginning&#x2014; things may change later&#x2014;one should give the Minister that right, seen, too, in the light of the fact that practically all the money for that university comes from the Minister. However, the cardinal point is that the Minister is responsible for the way things are done at that university. The Minister is the person who will come under fire in this House if things go wrong at that university. I therefore believe that the clause, as it reads at present, is entirely in order and I support it as such.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not actually have anything to add to what I said to the hon. member who spoke a moment ago. The only thing I must still do, is say something about the second amendment of the hon. member. In that amendment he moved that the words &#x201C;shall subject to the provisions of this Act, be as determined by the council with the approval of the Minister&#x201D;, be deleted and replaced by: &#x201C;be as prescribed by statute&#x201D;. The hon. member is now smiling broadly. After all, he said that I become excited and angry, but does he realize that with that amendment he has undone precisely what he tried to do by means of the first amendment? To be specific, the statute must be approved by the Minister. In other words, the position remains unchanged. I do not believe that the hon. member is actually gaining anything by his second amendment, and therefore I think it was rather senseless to move it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me just assist the hon. member. He suggests that &#x201C;be as prescribed by statute&#x201D; be included in the clause. If the hon. member looks at the definition in clause 1, he will see that in the case of this Bill the statute is not the general common statute for the other universities, but a statute which may be prescribed in terms of clause 29. Clause 29 of this Bill stipulates that a statute of Medunsa must be approved by the Minister, as I, too, put it. The hon. member made a mistake there.</p>

I take it that when a student from another country in Africa applies for admission to South Africa, his application has to be considered by both the Department of Immigration and the Department of the Interior. I should like to know whether, if both those departments have recommended the application, those papers are then referred to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>He is too suspicious, and he has taken a very difficult example. This could apply to a Coloured person, for instance.

<p>Mr. Chairman, in view of the discussion that has taken place, the hon. member apparently expects me not to accept the first amendment. As far as the hon. member&#x2019;s second amendment is concerned, an amendment which amounts to the deletion of clause 23(2), this in fact affects a matter which we discussed earlier, when the hon. member for Pinelands maintained that I was giving freely with one hand, but taking back with the other. I referred to that too. It is the essence of the financial practice of the Treasury. When the Treasury provides money for a certain undertaking&#x2014; makes a certain investment&#x2014;it claims the return from it. I should very much have liked that money to go to the universities, but things simply do not work that way. The State takes that money back and, in the same year, or in a subsequent year, gives it back by way of a vote in Parliament. This is financial procedure which is followed by the Treasury and Parliament. It is impossible for me to accept that proposal.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members would have noticed that the object of the Bill before the House is to make provision therefor that the Sishen-Saldanha Bay Railway line may also be used for the handling of traffic other than that of Iscor only.</p>

<p>On the introduction of the principal Act in 1973, the then Minister of Economic Affairs advanced various sound and valid reasons for the Government&#x2019;s decision to limit the use of this railway line to the conveyance of Iscor&#x2019;s iron ore only. He emphasized that it was of cardinal importance that the primary traffic over this line, namely bulk iron ore traffic, be handled with the maximum degree of efficiency and speed&#x2014;in other words, without the encumbrances involved in station to station traffic. This was of prime importance in view of the fact that Iscor is called upon to compete on the international iron ore market, in respect of which rail transport is a primary cost component, unlike the case with most other export traffic.</p>

<p>All Iscor&#x2019;s competitors on the international market have control over their transport systems and, consequently, over their transport costs.</p>

<p>However, he also pointed out at that stage that it would nevertheless be possible to maintain this underlying operating principle if part of the traffic would not be Iscor&#x2019;s, but the bulk traffic of other parties. I am sure I need not repeat all the arguments put forward at the time by my predecessor, but should hon. members wish to refresh their memories on this particular score, I should like to refer them to Hansard, cols. 3688 to 3962 of 29 March 1973.</p>

<p>Hon. members may now well question the Government&#x2019;s decision to change the nature of the Sishen-Saldanha Bay railway line, and I therefore propose to dwell on this point for a little while.</p>

<p>In the process of carrying out this project at an estimated cost of R378 million&#x2014;I may mention in passing that the line was completed on schedule on 28 April 1976&#x2014;the establishment of this new connection with a seaport of enormous potential triggered off renewed interest on a very substantial and large scale in the development of mining undertakings in Namaqualand and the north-western Cape. These new facilities do not only create the <span class="col_5815-5816" refersTo="page_0238"/>required transport and port facilities, but also provide new potential to areas which did not appear to be economic propositions in the past. These developments consequently resulted in representations from various sources that the Government should allow Iscor also to handle the traffic of other parties.</p>

<p>As was explained in the House in 1973, the railway line was designed to make provision for the construction of additional crossings which would permit the operation of more trains and, in doing so, increase the capacity of the line considerably. Iscor has in fact already spent a considerable amount of money on requirements with the object of expanding the line&#x2019;s capacity.</p>

<p>Having regard to the fact that the basic railway infrastructure is already being established, the costs pertaining to the addition of crossings and ancillary facilities, such as signalling and the purchase of the necessary rolling stock, will be proportionately lower than Iscor&#x2019;s primary capital expenditure, and it can therefore in the long term be in the interests of both Iscor and the other users of this line if the traffic provided by them is added to that of Iscor. These advantages will, however, only materialise if certain important requirements are complied with.</p>

<p>In the first instance, the additional traffic must be of sufficient tonnage and be offered over a sufficiently long period in order to justify the additional expenditure. Secondly, it must be possible to fit in the additional traffic with the primary Iscor traffic without disturbing the smooth functioning of the line, which will be to the detriment instead of to the advantage of Iscor&#x2019;s costs. Thirdly, the third party users of the line must also keep in mind that Iscor will initially have to contend with considerable interest obligations which will only be wiped out over a number of years, and that the true benefits of the project will in fact only materialize in the long term.</p>

<p>In view of these considerations, and having regard to the enormous contribution the Sishen-Saldanha railway line may be able to make towards the national economy if operated as a multi-purpose project, the Government has decided to lift the original limitation on Iscor.</p>

<p>*In addition, the Straszacker Committee of Inquiry also came to certain conclusions and made recommendations which led to the announcement by the then Minister of Economic Affairs on 29 August 1974, that the Government had decided that the Sishen-Saldanha Railway line could be utilized for the conveyance of public transport in conjunction with the South African Railways Administration.</p>

<p>To return more specifically with details concerning the railway line and the traffic it is expected to carry at this stage, I may mention that private entrepreneurs are interested to have in causing to be conveyed annually over this railway line approximately 1,5 million tons&#x2014;primarily ore&#x2014;as from 1977 and approximately 15 million tons as from 1979.</p>

<p>It is being planned that trial runs with the first ore trains will commence in the middle of May 1976. I may also mention that the railway line and its 22 bridges, the longest of which is 1 035 km, and one tunnel of 800 metres have been constructed at an average rate of 3,5 km per day. I believe hon. members will agree with me that this is indeed an achievement for Iscor and its contractors.</p>

<p>Clause 1(a):</p>

<p>Clause 1(a) of the Bill seeks to amend section 2(1 )(b) of the Sishen-Saldanha Bay Railway Construction Act, 1973, by deleting the present prohibition on the conveyance of public traffic over the railway line.</p>

<p>Clause 1(b):</p>

<p>Clause 1(b) of the Bill empowers Iscor to enter into any agreements with the S.A. Railways Administration or with another party, which may be required in connection with the working and use of the control and management of the line of railway in order to regulate in an expedient manner the conveyance of public traffic.</p>

<p>Clause 2 contains the short title.</p>

<from><span class="col_5817-5818" refersTo="page_0239"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of hon. members on this side of the House, I rise to give this Bill our enthusiastic support. We should like to take this opportunity of associating ourselves with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comments in conveying our congratulations to Iscor and to the contractors concerned in this vast and historic transport undertaking in that it was completed only a few days ago and only three years after the Bill was passed. Having said this, I am going to make use of this opportunity to be extremely critical of the Government&#x2019;s original Bill which became the Sishen-Saldanha Bay Railway Construction Act. I want to refer to the statement which the then hon. Minister of Economic Affairs made to the House when he said that the decision that Iscor would build a single-purpose line for carrying Iscor&#x2019;s iron ore from Sishen to Saldanha, was a Cabinet decision. At that time we on this side of the House, with the introduction of that Bill which the then Minister of Economic Affairs described as a &#x201C;tiny little Bill&#x201D;, took exception to two things. The first was that the Bill was at that stage being rushed through the House and the second was that what was important in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech was what was not said rather than what was said. I think it is only right that I should read the following words of the then hon. member for Parktown, Mr. Emdin (Hansard, Vol. 43, 1973, col. 3662)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Speaker, I think it is an insult to Parliament&#x2014;and I use these words advisedly&#x2014;that a Minister should come to this House and say &#x201C;I want to give Iscor authority to build a railway line&#x201D;, without telling us anything about that railway line. There is nothing in the Bill and there is nothing in the Minister&#x2019;s speech that gives any indication whatsoever as to the nature of this railway line.</block>

<p>We know that at the time there was a great deal of discussion and that there were two different viewpoints. Many people in public life and on this side of the House believed that the Railways should have constructed this line, while many others believed that since it was merely to be a single-purpose line, it therefore could well be constructed by Iscor. The hon. the Minister himself, when introducing the Bill, pointed to one of the main principles of the Bill, and I quote the following (Hansard, Vol. 43, 1973, col. 3658)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The following main principles are contained in the measure before the House:</block>

<block name="quote">(a) Iscor is being authorized to build a railway line from Sishen to Saldanha Bay for the conveyance of its own exports ore &#x2026;</block>

<p>We find that there were two other principles contained in the Bill, namely the right of expropriation and the fact that Iscor would not be allowed to expropriate land which was already held under the control of the Railways. Those were the three principles. We now find in the Bill before us that, in essence, the railway line may now be used for the conveyance of public transport. We on this side of the House may claim validly that we associated ourselves with the thoughts of the hon. member for Moorreesburg, who became known in this House as &#x201C;Saldanha Piet&#x201D;, &#x201C;Railway Piet&#x201D; or &#x201C;Progress Piet&#x201D;, and that we believed that the Cabinet was wearing blinkers in relation to the ultimate future of that section of our rich and prosperous country, in taking the attitude at that stage that it should be a single-purpose line. We have a right to expect that the Cabinet of the Government of South Africa should plan ahead and should be far-thinking in its planning. Here we have the factual situation that before the first &#x201C;toot&#x201D; of the first railway engine has been blown and before the line has been completed, a decision to negate the original principle of the Act is being taken in order to carry out, what we believe, any sensible Cabinet should have done. We should have had enough faith in South Africa at the time to consider the building of a multipurpose line. Had that decision been taken then, this project would have probably been undertaken by the S.A. Railways. If it was not <span class="col_5819-5820" refersTo="page_0240"/>to be a single-purpose line, there would have been a White Paper outlining the project and this House would, at that stage, have been given the fullest possible information.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to a salient factor concerning the Bill which is before us. The original Act envisaged that Iscor would require a two-station line, namely a station at Sishen and a station at Saldanha Bay. Tremendously heavy trains would roll down this line and they would pass the returning empty trains at a halfway siding. It would be co-ordinated so that there would be virtually no stopping. If Iscor was to compete in the world market for the necessary tenders for the sale of its products overseas, it had to eliminate all unnecessary expenditure. The hon. Minister himself was at great pains to say that if they were to achieve that high level of efficiency, there was no doubt at all in the minds of anyone he knew that it was by far the best that this should be a single-purpose railway line. He said it was of the utmost importance that the train which departs fully loaded from Sishen to Saldanha Bay should be back at Sishen as soon as possible to take another full load. This was the essence of the requirement for the line to be single-purpose. I would like the hon. the Minister to give this House an assurance that this facet has been examined and that in now opening the line to further public usage, Iscor as such will not be prejudiced in their costing of the whole operation upon which the decision was based to develop Saldanha Bay as an ore harbour and to develop this railway line. I think it would be irresponsible of any member in this House, particularly on the part of the Opposition, if we did not get this assurance from the hon. the Minister. I say this, because it was this very point on which they based their argument when we pleaded, at the time, that the North-West Cape deserved further consideration than merely a single-purpose railway line, and that we should have envisaged a multipurpose line at that stage.</p>

<p>Sir, we are going to support the Government on this occasion, but this is indicative of the fact that when legislation is brought to this House, it should not be rushed as the original Act was rushed. The fullest information should be given to the House. We want to record in Hansard our belief that the Cabinet was at fault and should accept the criticism that it was not far-seeing, that it did not do its homework properly and that it had no overall plan for the future when deciding in 1973 that this line should be a single-purpose line. We on this side of the House are on record in Hansard as having pleaded during the discussion of that Bill that the Government should have had more faith in the future of the North-West Cape, more faith in the Development of Saldanha Bay as a potentially large general harbour, and more faith in the railway line than to allow it to be a single-purpose line only. With these words I wish to say that we have the greatest pleasure supporting this Bill, but we go on record as having said in the original debate that in every stage we were 100% behind the concept that Iscor should develop Sishen and Saldanha.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to say that we differ from the gentlemen sitting to the right of us and from those sitting to the left of us. The basis of our objection to this Bill is really quite simple, because what this Bill is actually doing, is turning the Sishen-Saldanha railway line into a line which may be used for the conveyance of public traffic. We have good authority for that, which comes from that side of the House, and I wish to quote it. If Iscor has stuck to a single purpose private railway line, in respect of which we already had objections, we might have been able to support this Bill. However, all this Bill is doing, is simply producing a situation where Iscor is in direct competition with the Railways, or it is granting Iscor a privilege which is not extended to other corporations or to other businesses in the Republic of South Africa. It is no good for the hon. the Minister to come along with the rationale for this legislation, stating that Iscor&#x2019;s competitors overseas have control of their own transport systems and therefore have control of their own transport costs. Will the hon. the Minister give us examples of Iscor&#x2019;s competitors overseas who have control of their <span class="col_5821-5822" refersTo="page_0241"/>own railway systems and therefore of their own transport costs, those railway systems being used to convey public or general traffic? To my own knowledge, the railway systems owned by corporations in Australia, for instance, are restricted entirely to moving their own ore from the mining site to the ports. In Canada and America, as far as my knowledge goes, any corporation owning its own railway system is restricted to carrying its own products, i.e. the ore processed from the mines. The question of Iscor being able to vie with its overseas competitors has to date been the only rationale the hon. the Minister has offered. We all know of another company which owns an iron ore deposit. I am referring to Mr. Wilhelmi&#x2019;s company. Is it now to be entitled to own its own railway line, to take its ore to the ports and, if necessary, in order to make it an economic concern, is it going to be entitled to transport the ore of other parties so as to be placed on an equal footing with Iscor? I should now like to go back to 7 March 1973 to quote what the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x2019;s predecessor had to say when discussing the original Bill, the founding father of the Bill we are now discussing. He said, and I quote (Hansard, Vol. 42, col. 2104)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would like to inform the House that I am in full agreement with the decision to go ahead with the Sishen-Saldanha project. If Iscor&#x2019;s expectations materialize, namely to carry upwards of 15 million tons of export iron ore and a large quantity of semi-processed products over this line, it will become a most valuable asset to South Africa.</block>

<p>We have no quibble with that. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have good reasons for concurring in the decision that the railway line and ore quay should be operated by Iscor. In the first place, it will be a single purpose line carrying only Iscor&#x2019;s products and materials.</block>

<p>After certain other remarks, he then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have, however, set two conditions: Firstly, there will be no connection with any SAR line &#x2026;</block>

<p>That condition has gone by the board. Let me quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and secondly, no SAR personnel may be recruited by Iscor unless they had left the service of the SAR at least six months previously.</block>

<p>I cannot say whether that condition has been met or not. He continues, however, by stating&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Should the Government of the day in the years ahead consider that it would be in the country&#x2019;s interest to effect a linking-up with SAR lines in order to enable other bodies to make use of this line, or that railway lines to link up with this line would have to be constructed in order to provide for the needs of others, the operation and ownership thereof would have to be transferred to the South African Railways because the existence of two competitive railway systems, one privately owned and the other a Government undertaking, could never be allowed in South Africa. I should also like to add that a privately owned single-purpose railway line and harbour are not unique.</block>

<p>There we have it. That was the reason given in justification. Now let me quote the present hon. Minister in charge of the S.A. Railways (Hansard, Vol. 51, col. 3729)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and may I just say that I have always been in favour of a public line or a multi-purpose line&#x2014;&#x201C;the same difference&#x201D;&#x2014;being operated by the Railways &#x2026; But, be that as it may, I want to emphasize that it has always been my view that it would be best if the railway line were operated as a public line.</block>

<p>Well, there we have it. There we have heard two Ministers in charge of the S.A. Railways and Harbours saying that if the line becomes a <span class="col_5823-5824" refersTo="page_0242"/>public line, it should be run by the Railways. To that we have absolutely, no objection. In fact, we are in favour of it, and therefore it is no use saying that simply because Iscor controls the management of the present line, and will continue to control the management of the public line, the point has therefore been taken, because the difference between a line which is restricted to private traffic, in the sense of carrying only Iscor&#x2019;s products, and a line carrying general traffic is very clear and extensive. Since we cannot support this Bill, the only other point I should like to make is that the hon. the Minister has said that Iscor has spent a considerable amount of money increasing the capacity of the line and building up the ancillary equipment and line plant to make provision for its use by others. He said that Iscor is going to lay down conditions that traffic coming from third parties&#x2014;if one can use that phrase&#x2014; must be of sufficient tonnage and available for transportation over an extended period of time so that Iscor will not be detrimentally affected. That is the heart of the matter because Iscor is not running this line in the way it would be run if it were being run by the S.A. Railways and Harbours. I would therefore be interested to hear whether the hon. the Minister is in a position to say that there is absolutely no difference between the management, charges, construction and facilities of that line and any similar line run by the S.A. Railways and Harbours, because clearly there is a difference.</p>

<p>I now just want to refer briefly to the explanatory memorandum tabled in the House today. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Arising from a decision of the Cabinet, the railway line between Sishen and Saldanha Bay harbour will be used as a multi-purpose line. Accordingly it has become clear that the new harbour at Saldanha Bay will develop into a commercial harbour earlier than originally anticipated and that general cargo working as well as shipping will increase at the port.</block>

<p>Then comes the significant sentence, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Railway Administration will therefore be obliged to take over responsibility for the control and in due course the operation of the harbour &#x2026;</block>

<p>All we can say is that we wish the same applied to the railway line because then everything would be clear-cut and tolerable.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to associate myself with the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens by also expressing my appreciation for the change of approach we have had, an approach which led to this railway line being changed into a multipurpose line. I was one of those on this side of the House who felt from the outset that it was unfortunate that Iscor was restricted to the use of this line as a single-purpose line only. We stated our point of view quite frankly in this House at that time. To me it matters very little whether this line is going to be operated by Iscor or by the S.A. Railways and Harbours. However, what is predominantly important to me is that it is now going to be a multi-purpose railway line and that this will open new doors for an area which has been very poorly served by public transport up to now. This entails development possibilities for those areas situated in the vicinity of the railway line. It will be possible to construct sidelines from this railway line to serve other areas, and for that reason I think we can express our great appreciation for the fact that this legislation is serving before Parliament today. I think the public in that part of the world is very grateful. This is all I want to say in connection with this legislation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens for his support of this legislation. Although he expressed his support in a very strange manner, I think that we nevertheless agree with one another in the final instance. However, I should like to refresh the memories of hon. members in all fairness. In 1973, when the principal Act was introduced, my predecessor never denied the fact that the time might come <span class="col_5825-5826" refersTo="page_0243"/>when the railway line would also have to be used for other traffic. To prove this, I want to refer hon. members to the Hansard of 1973, col. 3689, where my predecessor had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not want hon. members to deduce from this that I am opposed to the principle of a multi-purpose railway line, for I think that if other purposes could be served by this railway line, it would be in the national interest to do so.</block>

<p>Furthermore, he said (col. 3690)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One could perhaps expand the idea of a single-purpose line to bulk traffic, to iron or steel products, not necessarily ore from Iscor.</block>

<p>The only basic difference between the point of view of the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens and the point of view of my hon. predecessor in 1973 is, in all fairness, only a matter of timing.</p>

<p>He anticipated it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me say immediately that, as a theoretical argument, such a standpoint is very easily anticipated. As against this, hon. members will agree with me that the hon. the Minister, at that stage, advanced valid reasons as to why very high priority had to be given to Iscor&#x2019;s own requirements as far as the construction and the management of the railway line was concerned at that time, and indeed with the object of making it competitive on the international markets where it had to compete. I readily want to concede the academic argument, but it remains a fact that, with the construction of the railway line, the stressing of certain geographical areas with great potential and the extension of the facilities of the railway line, it became obvious to me that it should also be used for other traffic.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Johannesburg North. If the hon. member is opposed to the legislation, I know that I am right. The hon. member must not take it amiss of me because I am saying this. His basic problem is that he is unable to divorce himself from the idea that this institution, Iscor, competes with certain interests of his company.</p>

</speech>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I withdraw it. But it is known that the interest of Iscor clash with organizations in which the hon. member has an interest. The hon. member is not only opposed to this legislation; basically he is opposed to the fact that Iscor exists at all. In addition, his argument this afternoon was basically aimed at the fact that Iscor should have a railway line. Let me say immediately that I cannot accommodate him in that respect. The fact that Iscor is prepared also to carry other traffic on that line, emerged in the final instance from the consideration that it is in the national interest that it should do so. Let me make it quite clear that Iscor is prepared to extend the capacity of this line as a result of the very strong representations received from North-Western Cape, that they should also be given the opportunity to exploit the enormous potential of the mineral wealth, for example at Aggeneis, of that area. If we could promote the purposes originally anticipated at the time of the construction of this railway line and if we could reconcile these with the general requirements of that area, we should not come along with academic arguments as to who should control the railway line or who should not control the railway line. I am not prepared to take this aspect any further at this stage. I accept that the hon. member does not want to accept the principle and I therefore leave it to him. Nothing I can say will persuade him to change his point of view. In view thereof any further argument will, to my mind, be fruitless and senseless.</p>

<p>I want to say at this stage that I appreciate the point of view we had from the hon. member for Parow, who was also the chairman <span class="col_5827-5828" refersTo="page_0244"/>of the railway group on this side of the House. I want to say in general that we may make this railway line available to other people and other areas, as has indeed been anticipated originally.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. the Minister this question? If the line is going to be used to convey commodities other than those of Iscor, who will lay down the tariffs for those commodities and who will decide to what extent the other commodities may be carried? Will the line for instance be able to carry livestock to the various markets, or will it be confined to the transportation of minerals and related commodities?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there will be no competition between the Railway administration and Iscor. As far as the second part of the question is concerned, I want to point out that arrangements have been made for exporters wanting to use the Iscor railway line to make arrangements with the S.A. Railways as the general transport agency of the country and that they should negotiate with that administration about the tariffs. The tariffs which will apply on the railway line will be determined in an agreement between the Railways and Iscor, so that the position of the Railways will not become involved as a result of alternative tariffs. Since the hon. member comes from the Eastern Cape, I want to add that this will also apply to the railway line from the north to the Port Elizabeth harbour. I am able to give him that assurance. The hon. member will appreciate that this line will initially and primarily be used for the conveyance of minerals and ore. I am unable at this stage to say precisely what the situation is going to be with other traffic, such as the conveyance of livestock. However, what I can tell him, is that I eventually foresee the day when the railway line will be used without any restriction, if the need exists.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, can the hon. the Minister give this House the assurance that, in consultation with Iscor, it has been established that Iscor&#x2019;s rates will not be prejudiced by the Bill which is now being passed, to the extent that they will no longer be able to compete in world markets with the export of ore?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can give that assurance immediately. Indeed, this Bill may make it possible for them to be more competitive because of the additional traffic on the line, which may possibly result in a reduction of the unit cost of traffic.</p>

<p>Bill read a Second Time.</p>

<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister, in his reply to the Second Reading debate, said that we in these benches were not arguing on the basic principles of this measure, and that our objections were founded outside the Bill. I should like to refer the hon. the Minister to paragraph (a) of this clause, which substitutes a new paragraph for paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Act. This provision is in fact the &#x201C;guts&#x201D; of the matter. The really important change is the deletion of the words &#x201C;shall not&#x201D; and the substitution therefor of the word &#x201C;may&#x201D;, which means that the line &#x201C;may&#x201D; be used for the conveyance of public traffic. That is what this Bill is about and that is why we have objections to it. We shall therefore object to this clause as well.</p>

<p><span class="col_5829-5830" refersTo="page_0245"/>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister gave an extraordinary reply to a question from the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens. The hon. member asked the Minister whether he would give him an assurance that, as a result of the carrying of other traffic on this line, Iscor&#x2019;s rates would not be prejudiced.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>That was not the question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is exactly what he said, and the hon. the Minister said in reply that, as a result of carrying other traffic, Iscor could in fact be placed at an advantage, as compared with its overseas competitors. Mr. Chairman, we would like to ask the hon. the Minister what he meant by that. Did he mean simply that the extra volume on the line will reduce the rates? If he means that, then obviously Iscor is in a privileged position on this line as opposed to running on other South African Railways lines. On the other hand, did he simply mean that there would be increased revenue to Iscor and that the rates would stay the same? If the rates stay the same, it is difficult to see how they will improve their competitive advantage compared to their overseas competitors.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the costs which Iscor will have in moving that iron ore up and down this line will be changed in any way by the addition of other traffic on this line. Furthermore, will he give us an assurance that, in so far as third parties are concerned, when they have their traffic moved on this line, the rates will be exactly the same as those which would be charged by the South African Railways for moving similar quantities of goods on similar lines?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer to the question asked by the hon. member for Johannesburg North. We support this Bill for reasons which go right back to 1973, when the whole of this question was debated. At that time this party took a very strong view about the necessity of creating a railway line in that part of the country which could in fact serve the multiple interests which exist there and which need to be developed. The argument which was brought against us, not only in this House but privately as well in discussions with the people concerned, was that Iscor should carry ore to the coast in order to compete on the international market and if the freight charges which are standard in South Africa under the S.A. Railways were to be applicable on the transport of ore, then Iscor would not be competitive on the international market. The S.A. Railways&#x2019; reply was that they had to charge a higher freight rate because of their commitments, commitments not only in respect of general freighting policies, but also in respect of the higher expenditure to be met when one operates a multiple line because a dual-purpose line is a much more complicated line.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>One needs more station masters.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, one will have to have more station masters and more signals. One will have more complicated equipment to handle and one needs a better electronic system as well as more loop lines and things of that nature. Because of these implications the cost will be higher.</p>

<p>We have come to the point where it is proposed that the line between Sishen and Saldanha be made a multi-purpose line. This means that we shall have to introduce these more complicated techniques and provide additional platforms and buildings, the whole paraphernalia which goes with a multi-purpose line. This, inevitably, must raise the cost of operating the line. Although we support the development of a multi-purpose line, the question raised by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens still remains: Is it not a fact that this is going to increase the freight charges on this line and therefore make Iscor less competitive? This was their own argument. However, the hon. the Minister replied to the question of the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens as follows: &#x201C;No. On the contrary, the <span class="col_5831-5832" refersTo="page_0246"/>freight charges are going to become cheaper by virtue of the line becoming a multi-purpose line. &#x201D; Presumably the hon. the Minister has in mind the fact that in addition to the ore, the line will also carry a few hundred milk cans.</p>

<p>Sir, this argument is hardly convincing. If the original argument was correct, it appears that the freight rates on this line must increase. It is reasonable to ask whether the freight rates are going to be increased, and whether Iscor is going to be competitive when it comes to selling its ore on the international market, because, if Iscor is not competitive, if Iscor does not make a profit in selling its ore on the international market&#x2014;we should remember that that was their original contention when they rejected the idea of the S.A. Railways operating that line&#x2014;the question remains: who is going to bear the losses? The losses are bound to become the responsibility of the taxpayers. Inevitably, as happens when public corporations fail to produce a profit, the hon. the Minister himself will have to come back to the House and ask for money to wipe out the deficit. That is why I ask this question. When the hon. the Minister tells us quite glibly that it is simply a question of more traffic generating more profit and hence a drop of the freight rates resulting, I must say that I think it is too simple an answer. I believe all the evidence, which was produced in the arguments put forward over the years, suggests that the true case is contrary to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s contention. For that reason, Sir, we would like to hear an explanation by the hon. the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there were two arguments under consideration at that time. On the one hand, it was argued whether or not the railway line should be a multi-purpose line. On the other hand, there was the question as to who should control the railway line. At the time of the original consideration of the construction of the railway line&#x2014;however, I do not have the technical qualifications to evaluate the matter&#x2014;it became apparent that the railway line, together with the rolling stock, the signals and all other accessories, would be considerably more expensive than had originally been calculated according to the calculations based on the standards laid down by the Railways. As I understand the matter, this was one of the reasons advanced for the control over the railway line to be entrusted to Iscor, and that the railway line should be a single purpose line.</p>

<p>In my Second Reading speech I indicated that during 1977, 1,5 million tons of freight of another nature is expected to be conveyed on the railway line. This is a calculation based on the inquiries which have already been received. In the second place, I pointed out that the said volume of freight is expected to increase to 15 million tons by 1979. The freight to be conveyed, will be mainly ore. The movement of goods is extremely important. Although the railway line will be a multipurpose line, it will mainly have only one commodity really, i.e. the conveyance of ore. The fact that the railway line will be a multi-purpose line, may, however, mean that it could also be more profitable. I have already told the hon. member on which grounds I base my statement. From the nature of the case I cannot&#x2014;and I do not want to try and do so either&#x2014;pass judgment as far as the distant future is concerned. As a matter of fact, the situation may arise in due course that large volumes of freight of a totally different nature will have to be conveyed on that section. However, this is something in respect of which I am unable to venture a prediction now. I do not have the gift of clairvoyance. With what I have just said I have also replied party to the question posed by the hon. member for Johannesburg North. However, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens asked me whether I am sure that Iscor would not be prejudiced by the implications of this legislation. He put this question as a result of the fact that Iscor&#x2019;s ability to compete on the international market was under consideration initially, also when it hasd to be decided whether the railway line would be a single purpose line and whether it would be controlled by Iscor. I gave him that assurance. I want to say again that this is not expected to happen. I also pointed <span class="col_5833-5834" refersTo="page_0247"/>out that as far as tariffs are concerned&#x2014;and I want to repeat this&#x2014;conveyers wishing to use the railway line should, in the first place, negotiate with the South African Railways. In the second place, I said negotiations would then take place between Iscor and the Railways in respect of the tariffs which would apply and the provision of the transport facilities. The determination of the tariff is being left to Iscor and the Railways. With this we want to try and ensure that there will be parity of tariffs. It may be that the transport will not be cheaper, but if only bulk trucks and trains are used for additional traffic, a reduction in costs is indeed a possibility. This is what I am trying to tell hon. members.</p>

<p>Clause 1 of the Bill will amend section 15 of the Act in order to authorize the Minister of Economic Affairs to make regulations concerning the microfilming of documents in the Companies Registration Office and in the office of the Master of the Supreme Court, as well as the use of reproductions made of such microfilms for official purposes and the admissibility in evidence of such reproductions in any proceedings. The Bill provides for the proposed amendment to come into operation on a date fixed by the State President. The reason for this is that the administrative arrangements for the introduction of a microfilming system will take a considerable time and I cannot give any indication at this stage of when it will be completed.</p>

<p>The proposed deletion of section 44(5) of the Act, which is provided for in clause 3 of the Bill, will mean that it will no longer be necessary for a company, after it has changed its name, to continue using its previous name along with its new name for a period of 12 months. In practice, this provision had the effect of unnecessarily delaying the announcement of the new name of a company.</p>

<p>Since the Act expressly provides that a company may amend its memorandum of association, the requirement laid down by section 55(1) of the Act that such amendment of the memorandum must also be authorized by its articles is considered to be superfluous and it is proposed that it be deleted. Furthermore, the proposed amendment to section 55(1) of the Act embodied in clause 4 of the <span class="col_5835-5836" refersTo="page_0248"/>Bill will make it clear that a company is authorized to make additions to the objects in its memorandum and that an amendment to the memorandum of a company does not involve only an amendment to the existing objects of a company.</p>

<p>In the absence of a specific provision in the Act to provide for the possibility of converting issued or unissued shares of one class into another class, doubt arose as to whether this could in fact be done. To remove this doubt, it is now being proposed in clause 5 of the Bill that an additional paragraph (i) be added to section 75(1) of the Act to provide specific authorization for the conversion of shares into other classes and to legalize such conversion of shares into different classes as has taken place since the commencement of the Act on 1 January 1974.</p>

<p>The proposed amendments to section 99 of the Act which are contained in clause 6 of the Bill will make it clear that if a company has converted any of its shares into redeemable preference shares, the provisions of the Act relating to such preference shares will be applicable.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is proposed to simplify the provisions of the Act relating to rights issues by companies listed on a recognized stock exchange, whether in the Republic or elsewhere. Stock exchanges invariably require that when shares or debentures are offered to existing members or debenture holders, the latter should have the right to renounce the offer in favour of persons who are not members of the company. It is contended that in these cases, although the offer can be regarded as an offer to the public, a prospectus should not be required since the affairs of the company are already known to the public by virtue of information published in annual financial statements and Press reports. In view of the fact that stock exchange committees do exercise control over companies which are listed or which apply for the listing of new shares, it is considered as desirable that the provisions of the Companies Act be amended to meet the requirements of the stock exchange in order that listed companies would be able to issue new shares in the form of rights issues at a minimum cost by <i>inter alia</i> limiting the documentation requirements and eliminating unnecessary duplication of forms and reports. Clauses 7 to 10 of the Bill contain certain proposed amendments to the Act in the said connection.</p>

<p>Clause 7 of the Bill will insert certain new definitions in chapter VI of the Act which contains provisions relating to the prospectus requirements. The expressions &#x201C;letter of allocation&#x201D; and a &#x201C;rights offer&#x201D; need to be defined and, in order to remove any doubt as to whether an external company must comply with the requirements of the Act when offering shares in the Republic, it is proposed that, for purposes of the said chapter, a company be defined so as to include an external company in the said expression.</p>

<p>The amendment to the Act proposed in clause 8 of the Bill will exclude a rights offer from the provisions of the Act relating to an offer to the public.</p>

<p>In clause 9 of the Bill provision is made for the insertion in the Act of a new section 145A which will require that a letter of allocation shall not be issued or distributed without the approval of a stock exchange.</p>

<p>In clause 10 of the Bill the insertion in the Act of a new section 146A is proposed which will provide for the registration of a letter of allocation by the Registrar of Companies and for the application to a letter of allocation of certain provisions of the Act relating to a prospectus.</p>

<p>Amendments to the provisions of section 148 of the Act relating to matters to be stated in a prospectus, are proposed in clause 11 of the Bill. A new principle will be introduced into the Act in the sense that a public company not listed on a Stock Exchange will be permitted to offer shares to its members with a right of renunciation in favour of other persons not members of the company. These companies will be allowed to offer shares by means of a shortened form of prospectus. It is expected that the relevant proposed amendments will result in a saving of costs and will eliminate certain administrative requirements in the office of the company making the issue.</p>

<p><span class="col_5837-5838" refersTo="page_0249"/>The existing provisions of the Act relating to an offer of shares by a listed company in an advertisement will, by virtue of the amendments to section 157 proposed in clause 12 of the Bill, be extended to all public companies, listed or otherwise, when shares which are the subject of a rights offer, with or without the right of renunciation, are offered to the members of a company. The proposed insertion of the additional para (g) in section 157(1) of the Act will enable a company to include, in the relevant advertisement, particulars of the last day on which subscriptions for the shares may be lodged.</p>

<p>Section 173(8) of the Act presently requires a company to lodge with the Registrar, together with its annual return, particulars of the other directorships of every director of the company, unless such return is lodged by another company of which the director is a director. The purpose of the said provision is to enable the Office of the Registrar to complete the Central Register of Directors established under section 217 of the Act. Particulars in regard to all directors of companies are now available, and it is therefore proposed in clause 13 of the Bill that section 173(8) of the Act be deleted with effect from 1 July 1975.</p>

<p>In clause 14 of the Bill the insertion of a further proviso to section 175(1) of the Act relating to the payment of annual duty by an external company is proposed. The said proviso will exempt certain external airline companies from the payment of annual duty. In this connection, I must explain that when the Republic enters into a bilateral agreement with another State, in respect of a scheduled international air transport service between the Republic and that State, one of the conditions contained in the agreement is that there should be reciprocal exemptions in respect of the payment of taxes and other State levies. The annual duty payable by a company in terms of the Act is considered to be a State levy. Whereas airline companies became liable for the payment of annual duty when the Act came into operation, it is necessary that the proposed exemption should apply as from 1 January 1974.</p>

<p>Clauses 15 to 18 of the Bill contain certain proposed amendments to the provisions of the Act which deal with the exercise by members of a company of voting rights at general meetings and annual general meetings of the company. The proposed amendments to section 189(1) of the Act contained in clause 15 of the Bill will allow a company to provide in its articles that a proxy may vote on a poll as well as by a show of hands. The proposed amendment to section 189(2)(a) of the Act makes provision for the inclusion in a notice, calling a meeting of a company, of an indication that a proxy is permitted also to vote otherwise than on a poll. At company meetings it is often necessary to expedite the disposal of routine matters and, if proxies were unable to vote on a show of hands, the proceedings would inevitably be delayed.</p>

<p>Some doubt apparently exists as to when precisely voting rights in relation to preference shares arise. It is, therefore, now proposed in clause 16 of the Bill that section 194(1) of the Act should state that, when any dividend or any redemption payment on the shares is in arrear, the shareholders shall have the right to vote at meetings of the company.</p>

<p>Section 226 of the Act presently contains a prohibition on loans by a company to its directors and officers. In clause 19 of the Bill it is firstly proposed that the said prohibition shall apply in respect of the managers of a company and not to its officers. Secondly, it is proposed that the said prohibition shall apply not only to loans but also to the provision of security by a company to its directors and managers. For purposes of the prohibition, the directors or managers of a company will include the directors and managers of its holding company and any other subsidiary of the holding company, as well as to any other company or body corporate controlled by the directors or managers of the company, its holding company or a subsidiary of the holding company. It is also proposed that &#x201C;loan&#x201D; be defined as a loan of money, shares or debentures or other property and to include extended credit which is not paid in accordance with the normal business practice of the <span class="col_5839-5840" refersTo="page_0250"/>company and that security be defined to include a guarantee.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that the manner of control by directors or managers over another company be sufficiently defined so as to indicate what would constitute effectual control for purposes of the said prohibition. However, certain transactions will be excluded in cases where all the members of the company consent to the loan, or where members consent by means of a special resolution, or when the company actually and regularly carries on the business of making loans or giving security. Other transactions excluded relate to the provision of funds to purchase the shares of the company for the benefit of directors, officers or employees in connection with a scheme, controlled by trustees. Also excluded is the provision of funds to provide housing for its director or manager, subject to the consent of the company in general meeting. In order to enhance the efficacy of the said prohibition, it is also proposed that directors or officers of a company who authorize transactions which are prohibited by virtue of the provisions of section 226 of the Act, as well as the directors or officers of the holding company may, apart from any criminal liability which may apply in respect of such directors or officers, be held personally liable to indemnify the company against any loss it may suffer as a result of any such loan or security.</p>

<p>Clauses 20 to 22 of the Bill contain certain proposed amendments to sections 270, 277 and 278 of the Act relating to the reappointment and removal from office of the auditor of the company. The amendment to section 270 of the Act proposed in clause 20 of the Bill will ensure that the Registrar of Companies is informed if the auditor refuses to be reappointed as auditor of the company. Clauses 21 and 22 of the Bill contain proposed amendments to sections 277 and 278 of the Act which will in effect defer the removal from office of the auditor of the company, unless such auditor has complied with the relevant provisions of the Public Accountants&#x2019; and Auditors&#x2019; Act, 1951, relating to reporting material irregularities which could cause loss to the company, its members or creditors, to the Public Accountants&#x2019; and Auditors&#x2019; Board within the time limits prescribed by the relevant Act.</p>

<p>In clause 23 it is proposed to amend the provisions of section 280 of the Act relating to the resignation of the auditor of the company. The section presently provides that an auditor shall furnish the company with an affidavit to the effect that at the time when he resigns he has no reason to believe that any material irregularity has taken place or is taking place which could cause loss to the company, its members or creditors. The Act presently also provides that the said affidavit shall be lodged by the company with the Registrar. It is now proposed that the affidavit in question be replaced by a notification forwarded to both the company and the Registrar of Companies. The amendments concerned will also provide that it shall not be necessary for an auditor to re-audit the books of account of the company before resigning, but in appropriate cases he will be required to mention in his notification of resignation the material irregularities on which he has reported. Since it would be necessary to prescribe by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> a form of notification, it is also proposed that the amendment shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by the State President by proclamation.</p>

<p>In clause 24 of the Bill it is proposed to make section 288(2) of the Act subject to the provisions of section 291 thereof which prescribe the circumstances under which it is not necessary to deal with subsidiaries in the group annual financial statements.</p>

<p>Clause 25 of the Bill provides for the substitution for section 295 of the Act of a new section relating to disclosure by a company in its annual financial statements or particulars of loans made to and security provided for the benefit of its directors or managers.</p>

<p>Vote No. 8 and S.W.A. Vote No. 3.&#x2014; &#x201C;Transport&#x201D;:</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this hon. committee will know that, in proportion to the time allotted for the discussions of other Votes, not much time is allotted for the discussion of the Transport Vote as such in this Committee Stage. Nevertheless, I do not think that this is an indication of a lack of interest in this Vote. It is a fact that transport is a matter which affects each one of us. Whether one likes it or not, one must be on wheels today to be able to earn a living in the modern world. For this reason I say that this is a Vote which affects each one of us in one way or another in modern life.</p>

<p>I want to point out, however, that we are actually discussing this Vote in an abnormal atmosphere today, because there are two matters which fall neatly into place in this debate but which may not be discussed in depth at the moment. In the first place there is the Urban Transport Bill which is to be discussed in the near future; or at least, so I assume. It is a matter of extreme importance to South Africa, and its scope will only be recognized and felt by the population of this country in years to come. Although the Bill will be discussed at a later stage only, I want to say on this occasion, however, that I am of the opinion that the hon. the Minister took a very wise step by giving to specific interest groups outside an opportunity to go somewhat deeper into the matter and to make the necessary representations to him in that regard. Secondly, Sir, there is as important a matter which may not be discussed today, and that is the question of road transport. Road transport today represents approximately 50% of South Africa&#x2019;s transport. It may not be discussed at the moment because of the fact that a commission of inquiry is investigating the whole matter. I should like to express the hope that the commission is doing its work in a productive manner, and that this House will in due course be able to discuss the findings of that commission in the form of a Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to dwell on a subject this afternoon which has often been discussed in this House. I make no apologies for doing so once more. I am referring to the matter of road safety. I believe this to be a subject which is to be discussed over and over again so that the seriousness of this matter may be brought home to the public. Road accidents have assumed such proportions at the present time that the matter is receiving attention in international world forums. A recent report states that even the World Health Organization is engaged at present in gathering statistics in order to investigate the magnitude of this problem. It is alarming to think, in the modern times in which we are living, while literally millions of rand are being spent in order to combat specific diseases, that 10 million people are involved in accidents the world over each year and that a quarter of a million people die on the roads of the world each year. It seems to me at times as though the modern world simply accepts this slaughter on the roads as payment for the tremendous asset the motor vehicle has become in the world.</p>

<p>I also want to say at once that I am not unaware of the good work which is being done by the National Road Safety Council, but, I believe nevertheless that we should dwell on this matter once again and that we should devote our attention to it anew.</p>

<p>Road safety and road accidents have become a world affair and South Africa has not escaped the epidemic of road accidents. I need not even remind this House of what the case was a week or two ago. Every day there were headlines in the newspapers of South Africa reminding us of the fact that the long weekend was ahead and that so many and so many people would lose their lives. Sir, the predictions were not far out. This is a serious matter which affects all of us. In saying this I do not want to suggest that I am such a good driver; far from it. I am just an ordinary driver, and perhaps even poorer than the average. Nevertheless, this is a matter in which all of us <span class="col_5843-5844" refersTo="page_0252"/>should take an interest because it affects so many of us.</p>

<p>I have here a newspaper report in which the casualty rate on our roads is analysed. The report states that it has become an epidemic. In applying these particulars to South Africa, I say that we have not escaped this epidemic. I now want to view the matter in all simplicity. What is the cause of road accidents today? The World Health Organization identified three causes. The first is the human factor, the second, the motor vehicle itself and the third, the roads. Normally these three factors contribute to accidents, but the main cause of road accidents and the casualty rate on our roads is not the car nor the roads, but the human factor, and this brings me to the position in South Africa.</p>

<p>We have a population in South Africa which is perhaps not properly motivated to fulfil its duty in this regard at all times. I think we can do a great deal more to bring home to the population the tremendous danger which faces each one of us. I ask myself: How are we to set about things in this regard? In the first place I believe we should pay attention to the mental attitude of the people. Regrettably I have to say that it would appear at times as though the South African&#x2014;and I include myself&#x2014;does not always realize the danger which the motor vehicle constitutes today. Sir, I personally try to keep to the speed restrictions. When I am travelling in the third lane, the fast lane, people still approach from behind flicking their lights at night to overtake. This happens when I am driving at the prescribed speed. Other people again sound their horns behind me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, apparently I am one of the aged, but the fact remains that it has evidently become a feat today to elude the traffic police and to break the regulations concerning speed restrictions. I think this is something which is extremely wrong. It should be brought home to the nation that laws are made to be observed and not to be broken. I think the traffic police can occupy their time fruitfully by informing and guiding the nation instead of going to a parking area to see whether or not one has been parking there for ten minutes too long. Therefore I maintain that the people must be motivated, in the first place, to be safety conscious. In the second place attention should be given to the man who sits behind the steering wheel. Cognizance should be taken of how he conducts himself.</p>

<p>In this regard, too, a problem arises. Drivers&#x2019; licences are issued in the Cape Province, in the Transvaal, in the Free State, in Natal, in the Transkei, in Botswana, in Lesotho, in Swaziland and in Rhodesia, according to different standards. The people do not keep to their own areas. Traffic overlapping is taking place continuously. So one may find a very poor driver from the Cape Province going to the Transkei and causing a fatal accident there, or vice versa. The point I am trying to bring home is in the first place, that we should try&#x2014;and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister cannot take the lead in this regard&#x2014;to bring about a uniform system for the issuing of drivers&#x2019; licences in Southern Africa. The tests which are laid down should be approximately the same for all licence holders and, secondly, we should see to it that all people who get in behind a steering wheel have a licence.</p>

<p>Here in my hands I have an alarming report which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i>. The hon. the Minister probably saw it too. &#x201C;20 000 drive with false licences &#x201D;. This is a statement which was made by Mr. P. W. van Veen, chief of the Transvaal Provincial Inspectorate, and he definitely is a man who knows what he is talking about. He alleges that an enormous trade in drivers&#x2019; licences exists on a national scale in South Africa, especially when it comes to Bantu drivers who drive heavy lorries. Not only are these people evading the law, not only are they paying R150 to R300 per licence, but they cannot drive properly either, and in this way we find them on the roads of South Africa where they endanger the lives of other motorists on the road.</p>

<p>I believe, firstly, that the hon. the Minister should take cognizance of the report, secondly, that the hon. the Minister should determine whether the facts are correct and, thirdly, if the facts in the report are more or less correct, I believe that this is a matter of exigency requiring close co-operation with the hon. the Minister of Justice in order to put an end to this evil. And when he has done this, I believe the hon. the Minister should consult his road safety people to devise a uniform system for <span class="col_5845-5846" refersTo="page_0253"/>South Africa and the Transkei, which will shortly be independent, and Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland so that we may have uniform standards in this greater South Africa as regards the issuing of licences.

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if ever there was a matter on which I agreed with the hon. member for Maitland, then it is this very matter he has just discussed briefly, because if ever there was something which caused the greatest degree of concern, not only to all of us present in this House, but also to every person outside this House, then it is the matter which was discussed by the hon. member for Maitland. Sir, right at the outset I want to say that I do not want to give the impression this afternoon that I have all the answers with respect to road safety, but on this occasion I do want to say this&#x2014;and I address myself to the hon. the Minister of Transport&#x2014; that if ever there was a time in South Africa that road safety and everything connected with it should enjoy the highest priority, then that time is now. Just consider for a moment that some of our young men die on our borders from time to time to the distress of everyone, and consider for a single moment that more people died on our roads in one weekend, the past Easter weekend, than were killed on our borders over a long period, and when we do so we must realize that this is a matter which deserves the highest priority. Let me state quite clearly that I am the first person to admit that counteracting this greatest evil, if I may put it so plainly, is naturally a problem which cannot be solved so easily, because there are many aspects to road accidents. But what concerns me particularly, is the fact that we in South Africa have the highest road accident rate of all the countries of the Western world. Let me read the following to hon. members&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has the worst road accident rate in the world. It is seven times higher than America&#x2019;s and six times higher than Britain&#x2019;s. These shock figures have been released by British road experts during a survey of 16 of the world&#x2019;s major countries. South Africa&#x2019;s yearly fatality rate for every 100 000 vehicles, is 349 &#x2026;</block>

<p>Listen to these figures&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Britain&#x2019;s is 63 and America&#x2019;s as low as 52. Second to South Africa is Poland with 144.</block>

<p>These figures point to the necessity that this matter be discussed under this Vote. However, I know it is not the easiest problem in the world to solve. According to the National Road Safety Council there has been a high correlation between the increase in the number of motor vehicles and the increase in the number of road accidents over the past 20 years. The increase in the number of road accidents has corresponded to a large extent with the increase in the number of vehicles, viz. approximately 7% per year. This high accident rate leads to a death rate of approximately 22 persons per day on our roads. This is an appalling figure. Twenty-two of our people die on our roads every day as a result of road accidents! Has the time not come, therefore, to take drastic steps, which are recommended by experts from time to time?</p>

<p>After the institution of the fuel conservation measures on 14 November 1973, an immensely positive effect on road safety in South Africa was seen at first Within the first year after these measures were instituted, according to the Department of Statistics, accidents decreased by 9%. I am now referring to the year 1973-&#x2019;74. Fatal accidents during that period decreased by the unbelievable figure of 33%. Since the lowering of the general speed limit was the most visible and direct factor, speed was very soon picked out by the general public as the major single cause of accidents. Although speed is an important factor, the lowering of speed is not the permanent solution for the problem of road accidents with which we in South Africa are faced.</p>

<p>In order to prove this statement, I just want to mention a few facts. In 1975, in spite of the very much lower speed which was maintained in comparison with the speed which had been maintained before the implementation of the fuel conservation measures, the accident and casualty rate soon showed a tendency to return to what it had been before the implementation of the fuel conservation measures. Between 1974 and 1975 the number of accidents increased from 213 103 to 260 075, viz. an increase of 22%. The death toll increased by 28%, namely from 6 344 in 1974 to 8 140 in 1975. The total number of accidents for 1975 has already exceeded the figure for 1973 of <span class="col_5847-5848" refersTo="page_0254"/>221 528, which was before the implementation of the above mentioned measures. This therefore constitutes absolute proof that there is no real single solution for road accidents in South Africa. Speed is indeed a contributing factor because the intensity of accidents decreased considerably. A low speed may therefore lead to a drop in the number of fatal accidents as a result of the lower intensity of accidents, but precisely what the most justifiable and acceptable speed is according to scientific facts, remains an open question. One cannot therefore counteract this evil by merely reducing speed. The other factors which cause road accidents are legion. I should just like to mention a few briefly. Unfortunately I do not have the time to deal with all the causes, but I would nevertheless like to put a few questions to the hon. the Minister of Transport. The first is: Are our roads in South Africa today built in such a way as to have the least possible number of danger points and are we satisfied that the roads which are being built in South Africa today, are being built so scientifically that they counteract road accidents at all times? The second question is whether we are satisfied with the standards of safety of the motor vehicles we use on our roads. I am very pleased to know that the Bureau of Standards is at present engaged in an investigation in this respect. I also want to know if it has not become urgently necessary for us to think seriously of making the wearing of seat belts compulsory. I ask these questions only to draw attention to a few specific points. As far as the compulsory wearing of seat belts is concerned, it is interesting to note that this has been applied most effectively in Australia. It is alleged that the wearing of seat belts in South Africa could reduce the death toll by up to 500 per annum. Today there are 15 countries in the Western world where the wearing of seat belts has been made compulsory by legislation. In this connection I refer to France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Japan, Sweden and Australia.</p>

<p>What is very important to me, is the question whether we in South Africa should not try to maintain a better attitude on the road. In my opinion the people in South Africa should be told every day that we should exhibit an attitude on the roads which, when we enter a motor vehicle, will indicate that we have respect and regard for people driving another motor vehicle. What is even more important: I think that we have such a great responsibility in respect of this important matter, that the question of a better attitude on our roads should be given attention in the home, too. Is the time not ripe for our parents to tell their sons and daughters that when they are behind the steering wheel of a motor vehicle, they should not only have respect for their own life and vehicle, but also for those of the other people who use the roads?</p>

<p>The last question I want to ask, since my time has almost expired, is whether the time is not ripe for us to place the whole traffic system in South Africa under the S.A. Police once again. I believe that the S.A. Police have been trained to be able to apply control over our traffic system and I also believe that they have the respect of everyone in South Africa. I am also of the opinion that if we were to do so, we would eliminate this continual overlapping in respect of road safety in South Africa. I believe that this overlapping is a source of concern for many people in South Africa. Why should there be overlapping? [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to raise two completely different matters with the hon. the Minister. The first one is in connection with the work of his department, in the administration of the Merchant Shipping Act and the making of regulations in terms of that Act. It also has an additional function which I think is very important and which arises from the administration of that Act. I refer to the issuing of certificates of qualification and of competence. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether South African certificates of qualification received by our mariners are valid in other countries of the world. Reference has been made in the report to the fact that there is a shortage in South Africa of qualified people for shipping services. Therefore, the question arises whether our qualifications are recognized and if not, why not. I frankly do not know. There is also the question of certificates of competence which are given these days in respect of craft as small as fishing vessels. At the moment there are about 700 registered fishing vessels and 49 pleasure boats, the skippers of which have received certificates of competence.</p>

<p>This brings me to a matter which I raised in the House not so long ago, when an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Act was debated. I refer to the position of smaller boats <span class="col_5849-5850" refersTo="page_0255"/>than those vessels which fall within the ambit of the Merchant Shipping Act. There are hundreds and thousands of smaller craft which use our coastal waters without any supervisory authority whatsoever. Earlier in this session I drew the attention of the hon. the Minister to it and for a moment I thought during his reply to the Third Reading debate that he was going to say that his department had taken over responsibility for safety regulations concerning all vessels using our waters, but to my disappointment he said that it would only be the larger vessels, because the administration would become too cumbersome if smaller vessels were also included.</p>

<p>This matter is becoming increasingly urgent. I would urge that the department give consideration to the possibility of taking under its wing at least the provision of safety requirements for all vessels, including small vessels. There is a not inconsiderable loss of life but what is even worse is the endangering of the lives of others who have to go to sea in order to try to rescue those people in small vessels, particularly when those vessels have no safety equipment, as is often the case, or are, frankly, not even seaworthy. We have dangerous seas off our coasts and many members of the public take maritime affairs far too lightly. Many think one can get into any form of vessel and safely embark on a trip around our coast.</p>

<p>Arising from this matter I have been busy discussing, is the whole question of maritime administration in South Africa. Quite apart from the Navy, which is a department in itself, there is the Department of Transport, which is responsible for certification and safety regulations concerning larger vehicles, there is the South African Railways and Harbours Administration, which is responsible for the administration of commercial harbours, there is the Department of Commerce and Industry, which deals with the smaller harbours which, I think, one could call the fishing harbours, and there is also, strangely enough, the Department of Sport and Recreation, which since last year has become responsible for the building of small boat harbours, although it has not yet exercised that responsibility. I have mentioned time and again in this House the necessity for one department to take under its wing the building of small boat harbours, because at the moment the facilities are hopelessly inadequate. Every Tom, Dick and Harry, who has a boat in his back-yard, thinks he can launch that boat from somewhere along our coastline and more particularly from our open beaches. It is a crazy situation. There is absolute chaos. I would ask the hon. the Minister to take a lead in establishing some form of greater co-ordination and, if possible, to give his attention to the establishment of a Department of Maritime Affairs to cover all these things which fall outside the ambit of the Navy&#x2019;s activities.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer briefly to two international sea conferences that have been held on the subject of the law of the sea. The one was held at Caracas the year before last, and the other last year at Geneva. I am very pleased to see that the Department of Transport was in fact represented at both of those conferences. Since pollution of the sea, which falls within the ambit of the department, is so important and is, indeed, being combated with some success, I would urge the hon. the Minister to give consideration to the possibility of his department also taking a lead in this particular sphere by persuading the Government to extend our sea limits. I have referred time and time again in this House to the necessity for us to have an &#x201C;economic&#x201D; sea limit of 200 miles and for our territorial waters to be extended to 12 miles. That is a subject I hope to deal with in greater detail before the end of this session.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to refer briefly to a matter which has been brought to my attention and which, I think, should be mentioned in the House. I refer to the question of the provision of bus services for the Coloured people at Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. There will be approximately 250 000 Coloureds there and there are going to be approximately 60 000 houses there. The Coloured Development Corporation is providing business and commercial sites for the non-White people at Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. However, for some reason or other, when it comes to transport, Tollgate Holdings is given the concession for the provision of bus services in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. There was in fact another applicant consisting wholly of Coloured shareholders and Coloured directors, who were able to provide Coloured capital, and yet the Tollgate Holdings subsidiary known as the Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain Bus Company was given this concession, while they in fact have only a 50% shareholding for Whites and 50% for Coloureds. There have been protests about this in <span class="col_5851-5852" refersTo="page_0256"/>the Press and also in the Coloured Representative Council. It seems to me that the local transportation board has indeed made a wrong award, because if one has a Coloured company able to serve Coloured people with Coloured capital and with Coloured staff and knowhow, it seems to me that such a company should at least be given a concession in that particular area. If there is room for two bus services in that area, I would suggest that consideration be given to the applicant who has been awarded that concession and also to a bus company which could be run by the Coloured people and for the Coloured people.</p>

<p>It seems to me as if the Coloured people are very often given the unscheduled bus services, which are the least profitable services. On the other hand, it seems, Whites are given the scheduled services which, I am told, are the most profitable. At least on the basis of equity and justice, I believe that the hon. the Minister should look into this matter to see whether it is not possible to give the Coloured people a bus company of their own and to provide that very necessary bus service to Coloured people at Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Simonstown touched on a few very interesting matters. However, in the nature of the matter I do not, unfortunately, have the time to discuss them at length, apart from referring in passing to his representations concerning small boats. We all believe that this is a very deserving cause. However, at this stage the problem is that there are approximately 20 000 of those smaller boats. Those boats are launched at any conceivable spot along our coast and controlling this is, in the nature of the matter, extremely difficult. However, I believe that this is a matter which necessitates definite attention, especially when the numerous needless deaths which occur&#x2014; the recent accident at Kleinmond is a case in point&#x2014;are taken into consideration. In that case, too as so often happens, people ventured out into the sea, defying all warnings, and there were no control measures in terms of which they could be prohibited from venturing out.</p>

<p>If time permits, I should like to refer later to Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain and the possibility of a bus service for the Coloureds who live there. This is one of the points raised by the hon. member for Simonstown.</p>

<p>However, I first want to refer briefly to another matter. To be able to do this, I certainly do not need to refer to the large variety of functions which this department must perform. We know, after all, that this is a department which operates over a tremendously wide field. The field covered by this department stretches from the highly technical activities of meteorologists and the Antarctic research programme, to the construction of national roads and the administration of compulsory third party insurance.</p>

<p>Another very important aspect of the activities of this department is the National Road Safety Council. Other hon. members have spoken about it already and more hon. members will probably be referring to that council in the course of this debate. To my mind the primary function of this department is the statutory control of traffic, whether road traffic or urban traffic, and the facilities which must be provided in this regard. However, within this broad framework there is still today one cardinal area over which this department does not exercise direct control. This is road traffic. In South Africa we still have the system that local authorities exercise a full say and full control over traffic measures. In the nature of the matter one cannot raise any objection to this in principle. However, in practice the problems are legion. The greatest is the financial problem. In our province, and certainly in other provinces as well, local authorities are nowadays to an increasing extent having difficulty balancing their budgets with the income from their limited sources of taxation. The limited sources of taxation of local authorities necessarily cause them to employ traffic departments as an instrument with which to earn revenue rather than for education and control. In other words, what this amounts to is that the budgeting for traffic departments is out of all proportion so that they may supplement their tax from other sources. The way in which this is done has already created so much opposition, resistance and antagonism among the public, that cooperation between the motoring public and the traffic departments of the various local authorities is out of the question. Whereas a traffic constable should actually have commanded the greatest respect because he controls traffic and because he encourages the safe use of roads, he is today, due to the policy which is being followed, regarded as the <span class="col_5853-5854" refersTo="page_0257"/>greatest malefactor&#x2014;if I may put it like that&#x2014;and is becoming the object of the antagonism of every member of the motoring public.</p>

<p>Because Cape Town is close to us, I want to take it as example to illustrate my standpoint. The speed traps in Cape Town are mainly on roads where these measures have nothing to do with the safeguarding of traffic. On the contrary. The effect of the speed traps on the roads is rather to make a transgressor of the ordinary driver.</p>

<p>To prove this statement, I want to point out to hon. members the most popular speed traps on the Cape Town roads. When the fuel saving measures were introduced, the general speed limit was 50 km/h. But with the lifting of the limits of 50 and 80 km/h the Cape Town Municipality suspended its previous speed limits within the municipal area and introduced lower speed limits. Let us take the Eastern Boulevard, on which no pedestrians are allowed and where there can virtually never be slow traffic, as an example. Previously this road was subject to a speed limit of 70 km/h, but this was reduced to 60 km/h. Today there are four speed traps in the direction of De Waal Drive and an additional three downhill in the direction of Cape Town. Another example is Union Avenue near Forestry on the way to Fernwood. Although this road is very open, the speed limit there has been reduced to 60 km/h from 70 km/h. There are six speed traps on this short stretch of road. The speed limit on Settler&#x2019;s Way from where it starts at the Groote Schuur bend to the Pinelands turnoff, was 80 km/h. This has been reduced to 60 km/h. This was done with the sole aim of being able to create traffic offences. When travelling along Settler&#x2019;s Way in the morning one finds a traffic which flows reasonably well, until one reaches the turnoff to Pinelands, from which point the speed limit is suddenly 60 km/h. From there one travels at a snail&#x2019;s pace to Cape Town. I can mention many examples where speed limits of this kind tend to disrupt the traffic and make transgressors of drivers rather than educate the driver. For the convenience of my colleagues who live in Acacia Park, I just want to warn that the eastern part of the Wingfield Boulevard is being used by the Municipality of Goodwood as source of revenue, while the western part is being used by the Cape Town Municipality as a source of revenue. They should therefore be careful when driving that way.</p>

<p>Cape Town&#x2019;s revenue from traffic fines in respect of the magisterial districts of Cape Town and Wynberg, amounted to more than R1 million for the year 1 April 1975 to 31 March 1976. More than 50% of this came from speeding offences on the few roads to which I have referred.</p>

<p>One asks oneself whether the approach of local authorities concerning traffic arrangements would have been the same if they had not received the fines and had rather deposited the fines in a central fund. Would this not perhaps have made a difference to the approach of local authorities? Whereas legislation has not yet been passed&#x2014;we are expecting legislation in this regard to be introduced in due course&#x2014;we shall have to think along the lines of a central body or a metropolitan council in which fines may be deposited. Local authorities will then, in the nature of the matter, lose income. After all, they have to maintain their traffic departments, and will therefore have to be subsidized to a certain extent. But there is a precedent for the subsidizing of a local authority. Library services are already being subsidized and even as regard traffic a certain degree of subsidization already takes place with regard to the patrol cars which are used on highways by the traffic departments of local authorities. Two-thirds of the costs with regard to motor cycles are subsidized.</p>

<p>I honestly believe that when this particular source of income is taken away from local authorities, traffic constables may serve a purpose other than sitting behind bushes on the outskirts of towns and watching out for people who exceed the speed limit. One would then find that confidence would build up between drivers and traffic officers. It would then be possible to educate people to consider the other driver as well, as the hon. member for Welkom so effectively put it.</p>

<p>I now come to the recommendation of the hon. member for Simonstown. He asked the hon. the Minister to see to it that when all things are equal in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain, the Coloureds be afforded the opportunity to establish a company which may be responsible for the conveyance of passengers in that area.

<from><span class="col_5855-5856" refersTo="page_0258"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was with considerable interest that I have listened to the various contributions from hon. members this afternoon. I cannot but agree with the hon. member for Maitland. He said we were conducting this debate in a rather unusual atmosphere in that two major pieces of legislation appear on the Order Paper at the moment, namely the Urban Transportation Bill and the Road Transportation Bill. Because of this, the field of discussion is narrowed down to some of the lesser aspects of the activities of the Department of Transport.</p>

<p>I want to raise the matter of the Springs bus boycott and the part played by his department in connection with it. I believe that lessons that were learnt from this unhappy affair must be taken to heart. There is no doubt at all that increases in bus fares always cause such unfavourable reactions on the part of the bus users that, potentially, boycotts become flash points of violence and of civil unrest. I believe that increases in bus fares is a matter of such extreme sensitivity that the Government, through the Department of Transport, must be very careful indeed how it handles applications for far increases in the first place and, in the second place, it must do everything in its power to resolve any dispute as amicably as possible. In neither of these aspects has the department been without fault in the past. The handling of the Kwa Thema boycott was extremely unsatisfactory. Twenty-five thousand Africans felt so strongly about the fare increases that they were prepared to walk up to 20 km per day for eight weeks rather than give in. At the end of that period, after minor concessions on the part of the authorities and after considerable harassment by departmental inspectors, the bus users went back to using the buses, but in a state of sullen submission and unhappiness.</p>

<p>I believe that the Government should go to the heart of the matter. It is a simple fact that the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development means that thousands of Black people have to live considerable distances from their place of work. The cost of transport to and from the so-called White cities places an intolerable burden on people whose income is very close to the poverty datum line. It is completely unreasonable to expect these people to pay for the Nationalists&#x2019; ideology, and the Government must realize that, if necessary, it must be prepared to subsidize bus fares for economically depressed communities. This must be accepted by it as part and parcel of the price of apartheid. Putco has already asked for further increases of approximately 20% on bus fares throughout the country on the grounds of rising costs. I am quite certain that these increases can be justified, but in view of the social implications of these possible increases, I want to ask the hon. the Minister to think very carefully indeed before any final decision is reached. This does not only apply to Putco, but also to other bus owners. The African bus service in Pretoria is also asking for increases on the grounds of cost escalation. If the pattern is going to be one of increased fares, followed by boycotts, followed by strike-breaking actions on the part of the authorities, followed by belated negotiations and followed by unhappy submission, then we are approaching the problem completely wrongly and I believe the results could be catastrophic. I think that the hon. the Minister realizes this, and at a time of inflation he must be very unhappy indeed at the thought of requesting subsidies, but the Government must stand by the results of its actions and its policies. There may well be other ways of handling this situation, involving greater employer contributions under the Bantu Transport Services Act, and I believe that these possibilities must be thoroughly explored before precipitate action is taken and an explosive situation is brought about. I also believe that the department must react far more quickly when any dispute occurs. In reply to a question which I asked on 6 April about the Kwa Thema bus boycott, the hon. the Minister pointed out that the function of his department actually ceased once the application for fare increases was concluded. Frankly, I am not concerned whether it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility or whether it is the interdepartmental committee&#x2019;s responsibility. I believe that permanent machinery should exist so that action can be taken immediately when any major dispute occurs, wherever it may be.</p>

<p>I may say that sensitivity over bus fare increases is not confined to Black people. The department is not without blame when it comes to the handling of applications for fare increases in respect of buses serving the White community. The hon. the Minister is very well aware of the anger and the disgust of many Cape Town users over the department&#x2019;s <span class="col_5857-5858" refersTo="page_0259"/>handling of the matter of fare increases by Cape Town City Tramways. Much of the public dissatisfaction had to do with the fact that bus users were unaware of the applications for the increases until they were a <i>fait accompli</i>. When I asked the hon. the Minister whether he was prepared to introduce legislation to amend the Motor Carrier Transportation Act in order to provide for the publication of applications for increases in fares prior to the hearing of such applications, he was really quite righteously indignant in his reply, that I should have presumed to ask the question in view of the fact that I was a member of the commission which is at present reviewing this. I still believe that it is in the public interest for the public to be informed beforehand, before fare increases are allowed. I think that the matter is urgent enough for an interim measure to put the matter right. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider his reply and immediately take steps to ensure that every application is published. &#x00EF; must say that I was very glad to hear the reply of the hon. the Minister in answer to my question on 19 March with regard to the investigation by an independent chartered accountant of the affairs of the Cape Town City Tramways as a result of the huge increase in profit shown by Tollgate Holdings Limited, which they attributed to their passenger division. Could the hon. the Minister inform the House as to how this investigation is progressing? I would also be interested to hear whether this independent chartered accountant would be entitled to listen to evidence from outside parties who may have an interest in the matter.</p>

<p>Proceeding from this matter, I should like to raise another minor point with the hon. the Minister. This concerns airport buildings. I believe that the bookshops in the airports at Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban are inadequate and that the facilities for travellers there should be improved. The areas that are set aside are too small. Passengers making purchases are cramped and uncomfortable. Also, I would like to ask whether any supervision is exercised by the department over the duty-free shop at Jan Smuts Airport, because I believe that customers are being exploited there. I had occasion to visit the duty-free shop the other day, and was astounded to see certain South African wines offered for sale at highly inflated prices. Other goods were offered for sale at prices which did not appear to reflect the real value without duty. I can only assume that the mark-up is highly excessive. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to give his attention to this matter because I do not believe that the lessees of this monopoly concession should be allowed to take advantage of the public by charging such excessive prices.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is rather strange that the hon. member for Orange Grove is again, at this stage raising the Kwa Thema bus boycott here. On Tuesday the 6th of April, he put a question to the hon. the Minister of Transport, i.e. whether his department had taken steps concerning the Kwa Thema bus boycott and if so, which steps, and if not, why not. The Minister furnished him with a complete answer to this, which answered all the questions he put today. But now the hon. member comes along and tries to make a political football out of this matter. I do think the increase in bus tariffs is so important; there are other agitators behind this, and I should like to know what role the Progressive Party played in this. The hon. member ought to know that any request for an increase in bus tariffs, first goes before the local road transport board. They then decide on the matter and if the applicant is not satisfied, or if the people affected are not satisfied, they appeal to the National Transport Commission. That body then gives a ruling, and if the people concerned are still not satisfied, it is possible to appeal to our courts. Now I may just inform the hon. member that in all these years not a single case which has gone to the Supreme Court as a result of tariff increases granted by the road transport boards or by the National Transport Commission, has been successful.</p>

<p>But I should like to come back on a subject raised by a few previous speakers, i.e. road safety. We have the greatest praise and appreciation for the National Road Safety Council for the work they do to promote road safety. But in spite of research information and educational guidance provided by this council, we have not yet seen the desired effect.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland mentioned the recent congress of the World Health Organization in Vienna and said that they had come to the conclusion that of the three factors which he mentioned, the human factor was the major contributory factor in road accidents. <span class="col_5859-5860" refersTo="page_0260"/>But the hon. member failed to add that the organization&#x2019;s message to the world had been: &#x201C;Forget about safe cars and roads and start by training the road user.&#x201D; Therefore I should also like to concentrate on the human factor. Sir, any young person of 18 who has passed the necessary tests, may have a driver&#x2019;s licence issued to him or her, with no strings attached. This is in fact a potential murder weapon with which that young person endangers not only his own life, but the lives of others as well. Now I wonder whether it is not time for the hon. the Minister to consider having a condition attached to the drivers&#x2019; licences issued to those young people. An effective condition would be that that licence would be withdrawn with the first serious traffic offence committed before that person was 25 years old. I say 25 years, because statistics I received from Rondalia Insurance Company indicate that drivers between the ages of 18 and 25 are the most dangerous road users. Rondalia ascertained that 39,1% of the policyholders between the ages of 18 and 20 years were involved in accidents last year. Furthermore, 51% of the people in the age group 18 to 25 years were involved in accidents last year. Therefore I think that if we wish to identify the crux of the problem, we should divide the drivers into age categories. As against to the previous figures I mentioned, only 3,9% of the people in the age group 31 to 35 years were involved in accidents last year, and only 2,7% of the policyholders above the age of 61. These are rather interesting statistics. As people grow older, and, perhaps, display more responsibility, there is a tremendous drop in the accident rate. The older generation are often accused of causing the accidents and of being the people who should be subjected to re-examination.</p>

<p>Where is the solution to this enormous death toll on our roads, a figure which is reaching epidemic proportions, to be found? It has been proved repeatedly that nothing influences the trespasser so much as being punished for his misdeeds. Therefore, however, we may argue about it, I think there is only one solution and that is the strict implementation of the law. The numerical strength of our traffic police will of course have to be increased. Speed limits may be introduced and guidance may be provided, but I believe that whether we succeed or fail will depend upon the man in the uniform. It is attempting the impossible to solve this problem with the present establishment of traffic police. The hon. member for Tygervallei asked whether we could not centralize the traffic police. The hon. member for Welkom also raised this point. By doing so I think we shall be able to utilize our manpower far more effectively. Many of the larger towns have between 20 and 30 traffic constables, but those men are limited solely to their own area of jurisdiction. In the Cape, I gather, with the establishment as it is at present, there is approximately 900 km for each traffic officer to patrol, if leave is also taken into consideration. For the ordinary traffic officer this is attempting the impossible. Therefore, to my mind, our solution lies in increasing the numerical strength of our traffic police so that the man in the uniform will be clearly visible. It has been proved over and over again that only the presence or visibility of the traffic officer makes the driver drive more carefully.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Tygerberg has also said: If traffic fines could all be paid into one central fund, and if that fund could be set aside to be used solely for the appointment of traffic officers and the prevention of death on our roads, we should make much more progress than we have up to now.</p>

<p>A second factor which should be taken into consideration, is the factor of driving under the influence of liquor. The person who gets behind a steering wheel in an intoxicated state, not only endangers his own life. He also endangers the lives of others. Is the time not ripe to impose a levy on alcoholic beverages? That levy may then be used to combat road accidents and to reduce the death toll on our roads. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am in full agreement with the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. Sir, the activities of the Department of Transport covers a very wide field. Today I should like to dwell on one of the divisions, i.e. civil aviation.</p>

<p>In the field of civil aviation a great deal of progress has been made in our country. We have had phenomenal growth and development in this regard. However, I should like to dwell on only one of the activities of the Division of Civil Aviation, i.e. the civil aviation subsidy scheme and the phenomenal <span class="col_5861-5862" refersTo="page_0261"/>results which have been achieved with this scheme.</p>

<p>The subsidy scheme is administered by the Civil Aviation Subsidy Committee. The committee consists of members of the Departments of Transport and Defence, members of the Aero Club of South Africa, the Commercial Aviation Association, the Aircraft Owners&#x2019; and Pilots&#x2019; Association. The scheme was introduced on 1 September 1954, and was established initially for a period of five years. As from 1 April 1961, however, the scheme has been continued for shorter periods, i.e. periods of three years. The present scheme of three years started on 1 April of this year with a budget, as we may see from the estimates, already amounting to the sizeable amount of R100 000. The scheme makes provision for the issuing of the first licence for the training of private pilots, for the licence for advanced training, for the commercial pilot&#x2019;s licence, for awarding instructors and instruments ratings as well as for subsidies paid on the purchase of gliders and parachute equipment. Subsidies are awarded on a basis of merit after applications have been considered by the committee. I do not want to go into those requirements now, because I do not have the necessary time at my disposal to do so. I may point out, nevertheless, that an age qualification of 17 to 40 years is a prerequisite. South African citizenship is another prerequisite. For the sake of the hon. member for Houghton, I want to point out that also women may be considered, although I believe that men are given priority. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Issues for the financial year 1975-&#x2019;76 are as follows: First licences were issued to 166 people who want to obtain private pilot licences, licences for advanced training were granted to 163 people, commercial pilot licences were issued to 53 people, 13 people were given instructors ratings and 17 gained instrument ratings. For the financial year 1974-&#x2019;75 the results were as follows: Out of 498 candidates 324 completed the course successfully. This was a somewhat disappointing number as one would have expected a higher pass rate. However, there were very sound reason for the lower pass rate. In order to raise the standard of flying, a condition was very definitely laid down that the pilots should first acquire the radio telephony licence. This was one of the factors which contributed to a lower pass rate. A second factor was that training fees were substantially raised and a third factor was that it was a year with a particularly high rainfall. A fourth factor was that there were problems with the availability of aviation fuel initially. At present this problem has largely been overcome with the result that this no longer constitutes a major problem.</p>

<p>The results which have been achieved up to now are truly phenomenal. From the time the scheme was established up to the end of 1974-&#x2019;75 the sizeable amount of R752 745 was spent on subsidies. This enabled 2 467 candidates to qualify for the initial issue of a private pilot licence, 2 747 candidates completed the advanced training and 375 candidates obtained the commercial pilot licence. All this points to the fact that this subsidy scheme has become a very important scheme. Consequently I should like to express my appreciation this afternoon towards the department for this generous scheme which has been established and for the fact that the amount appropriated for the scheme for this year, has again been increased.</p>

<p>Civil aviation, like aviation in general, is increasing at a tremendous rate in our country. Consequently we are among the leading countries in this regard today. To furnish a few other brief statistics, I may just mention that the total number of registered aircraft in our country numbered as many as 2 599 in 1975, of which 1 789 were single-engined and 498 multi-engined. As a matter of interest I just want to point out that there were 133 gliders and 55 helicopters. In this way I could continue quoting other similar statistics to prove how important aviation has already become in our country.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to touch on another matter, one which is near to my heart, and that is that safety in the air is priority number one, just as safety on the road is priority number one, as we heard here this afternoon. For this reason I believe that this aspect of aviation can never be stressed enough. One of the factors which determines the safety of the pilot, concerns overhead wires and cables which can be very dangerous to pilots. I wonder whether the time has not arrived that we, as somebody put it recently, bury cables rather than bury our pilots. If we cannot bury our cables, can we not at least mark them properly? I saw in Europe that many of these cables had been marked in a way which enabled one to see <span class="col_5863-5864" refersTo="page_0262"/>them very clearly, especially where there were overhead wires where one did not actually expect them. I believe this matter should be tackled with singleness of purpose. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister and the Department of Transport whether the time has not arrived for us to attend to this matter. As aviation grows, this problem will become more and more important. I want to ask that the necessary investigation be made in this regard. I am convinced of the fact that the department will receive valuable assistance in this from flying clubs all over the country.</p>

<p>A second safety aspect which is also of great importance to the pilots, is the availability of meteorological data. Our airways have no problems in this regard. Very thorough provision has been made for them. However, I believe it would be very good for the pilot who flies short distances only, and not on the normal air routes either, if we could achieve more effective co-ordination in the field of meteorological data so as to assist the private pilot in this way. I believe that in this regard we shall be able to obtain the co-operation of every enthusiast in this field. In every small town and village there will be people who will be prepared to provide us with the necessary information. Such information may then be processed at a central place to be made available to our pilots. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, first of all I would like to refer to the request by the hon. member for Orange Grove to the hon. the Minister, that an investigation be held into matters relating to the City Tramways. I suppose the hon. the Minister is fully aware of the fact that the hon. member for Green Point has been writing to him about this very same matter over the past three years. I am sure that now, with the added assistance of the hon. member for Orange Grove, the hon. the Minister will take some form of action.</p>

<p>My predecessor, Mr. Douglas Mitchell, told me once that, if one wanted the assistance of the hon. the Minister, or any reaction from him, one should invite him to one&#x2019;s constituency. He told me a story about how, when he wanted the lower South Coast road to be turned into a freeway, he invited the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor and another hon. Minister to visit the area. However, he chose a strategic time. He chose a Friday afternoon during a Christmas holiday season, and after some three hours of motoring the other hon. Minister&#x2014;I think it was the hon. the Minister of Agriculture&#x2014;said to the hon. the Minister of Transport: &#x201C;Here, ou Ben, jy moet nou iets doen omtrent hierdie pad, man! &#x201D; Needless to say, we now have a freeway there. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I wonder if I could invite the hon. the Minister of Transport to visit my constituency again and to use the South Coast road between Durban and Kokstad, through to Umtata, on a Friday evening, preferably at a month&#x2019;s end or on the eve of a long weekend. I say this because I believe that must be one of the most dangerous roads in South Africa at specific times. I believe that this is no news to any hon. member living in the Border area or close to one of the Bantu homelands. The hazards on those roads are increasing daily. The more Black drivers we get, the more Blacks can afford to buy cars, and the more Black people use that road, the more dangerous it becomes. It has already become an acknowledged fact that no one, save an utter idiot, uses that road on a Friday if he can avoid it.</p>

<p>It is said&#x2014;I do not want to corroborate it&#x2014;that half the drivers on that road are incompetent and that half the vehicles are unroadworthy. However, at particular times, especially over long weekends, one can see more broken-down cars on that particular road than at any other time. The cars are usually overloaded. It is not uncommon to see a normal motor car carrying 20 people. It is also not uncommon to see a one ton light duty vehicle loaded with 30 or 40 people, with all their luggage.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, come off it! But the passengers are likely to come off it too! One often sees a car dragging along the road, its rear end just about clearing the ground, its headlights shining into heaven, quite useless to anybody, the exhaust system belching clouds of smoke and the vehicle only just crawling. Such vehicles are a hazard. First of all, one is quite unable to overtake them, because of the clouds of smoke. The driver himself is unable to see anything in his rear mirror, because of the way the car is overloaded, because of the angle of the car and because of the clouds of smoke behind it. There are frequent breakdowns. Those <span class="col_5865-5866" refersTo="page_0263"/>dilapidated cars stop just anywhere along the road to pick up or to put down passengers, or vehicles run short of fuel over weekends, when there is no fuel available. Vehicles break down anywhere. As is well known, the road through the Transkei is extremely narrow with no verges on which cars can park. The result is that broken down cars are parked in the middle of the road and major repairs are being carried out on the spot. It is not at all extraordinary to see someone remove the differential of a car, take out the gear-box or lift out the engine right there on the road. The job is tackled there and then, with all the passengers sitting around having a picnic. That is the road we have to use. The state of affairs has become such that most people driving from Natal to East London, Port Elizabeth or beyond, do so in a roundabout way. They rather take the road through Bloemfontein, because it has become too dangerous to use the road along the south coast. The road through the Transkei is even more dangerous, because of stray animals, especially during the night. Pedestrians who have nowhere else to walk, use the road, particularly during nights when it is raining. Drivers are blinded by the lights of oncoming traffic rendering them unable to see pedestrians walking on the road surface. It also prevents them from noticing cyclists or animals or even people working on their cars. The driver of an oncoming car might notice a broken-down car standing in the road. However, what he does not see, are the legs and feet sticking out from under the car. Those legs and feet belong to the owner of the broken-down car, who is at that moment lying on his back under his vehicle, trying to fix it. What the driver of the oncoming car also does not see, are the spare parts from the broken-down car piled in the middle of the road, or even the huge stones piled on the road to prevent the broken-down car from running over a precipice.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members may think I am exaggerating, but I shall quote from a speech by Chief George Matanzima. It is a speech quoted in the report on a symposium held by the National Road Safety Council in October last year. In his speech Chief George Matanzima first of all refers to road safety in the Transkei. He appeals to the National Road Safety Council for help in teaching road safety in the Transkei and then says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to extend their services to the Transkei for the purpose of teaching road safety, even to the most backward and sometimes hostile members of the community.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The National Road Safety Council has been helping and there has been a slight improvement.</block>

<p>However&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding this improvement there is still a glaring disparity in law enforcement.</block>

<p>Further on he talks about the importance of car maintenance and says it is a major problem to keep a car roadworthy in the Transkei, so much so that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; over R100 reward to any driver whose vehicle reached a mileage life without an accident being attributable to it.</block>

<p>He goes on to say that another problem the Transkei has is a lack of qualified engineers and technicians to keep roads and vehicles in the Transkei in a satisfactory condition. He appeals for help in planning the roads in the Transkei. He says there is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; only 500 km of roads in the Transkei, out of 9 000 km, which are in any way constructed to a high standard.</block>

<p>This represents a major problem to us. We shall want to use the roads in the Transkei. We shall have to pass through the Transkei to get to the southern parts of South Africa. Will we in future have to use these particular roads which are not constructed in accordance with a safety standard? Chief Matanzima goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At present the ratio in the Transkei is 1 vehicle to 80 inhabitants.</block>

<p>He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding this ratio the safety aspect is posing a problem. In 1974 there were no fewer than 2 044 road accidents in the Transkei, in which 211 people were killed.</block>

<p><span class="col_5867-5868" refersTo="page_0264"/>The last quotation I would like to make is where he asks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If it was not possible for the Government to investigate the possibility of establishing a national drivers&#x2019; training scheme.</block>

<p>I quoted all this to prove that the position in the Transkei is critical and urgent. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider methods of increasing road safety in the Transkei. Could the hon. the Minister perhaps tell us what is being done to formulate a standard code of safety, as far as drivers and the roadworthiness of vehicles are concerned, between us and the Bantu homelands? What agreement is being entered into to see that there is a common code of examination for people taking out their driver&#x2019;s licences and also for seeing that vehicles are roadworthy? It is no good that we in the White areas have stringent driver&#x2019;s and roadworthy tests for vehicles if the drivers in the Transkei are not competent and their vehicles not roadworthy. These Black drivers will not know how to drive in a White area. They are a bigger danger in our areas than in their own. One may expect them to react in a certain manner, but then they react completely differently. Unless some standard code can be established for testing and for awarding certificates and for the safety of vehicles, I do not see how we are going to get anywhere at all as far as the separate and independent homelands are concerned.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in so far as the hon. member for South Coast is concerned about the condition of the roads which do not promote road safety, we on this side of the House would also like to see that road construction should be of such a nature that it will promote road safety. We appreciate the fact that several speakers have expressed concern on several occasions today for the high toll on our roads as well as for the measures we have in South Africa today with a view to road safety. Various problems were posed and solutions were suggested. But one of the basic problems of accidents was not touched upon. We in South Africa will have to realize that one of the most important ways in which we can reduce road accidents is to drive less. Over the past few years, as a result of circumstances beyond our control, as a result of the high fuel prices <i>inter alia</i>, it has become expensive to take to the road in a motor vehicle. However, when one considers the traffic on our roads today and the speed at which that traffic moves, one cannot but realize that the request to use fuel more judiciously in South Africa is falling upon deaf ears. When hon. members plead for road safety in this House, they should also feel themselves at liberty to ask the road user outside to drive more judiciously. It is interesting to see that when appeals are made for the conservation of fuel&#x2014;conservation by driving less and at a reduced speed&#x2014;tens and hundreds of our people do not take any notice of this. They still drive at a high speed, and this sometimes causes one to ask what the loyalty of these people towards South Africa is. When our people are asked to drive at a reduced speed and to use less fuel, there are so many of our people who cannot even be loyal as far as this minor request is concerned. One then wonders to what extent one can rely on the loyalty of our people when it comes to more important things. If we consider this lack of co-operation on the part of the public, there is one body which we can thank, namely the Department of Transport, especially the Government garage which has succeeded, over the past financial year, in driving 7,25 km fewer than in the previous year. If we look at the number of vehicles which are controlled by that department&#x2014;at present approximately 14 000&#x2014;we find that at present it is approximately the same as in 1972, in other words, the number has decreased. We want to tell the department that this achievement has been noted and appreciated by us.</p>

<p>I think there is one section of this department which often receives undeserved criticism and which seldom receives thanks for their useful work. I am now referring to the National Weather Bureau. It sometimes seems as if there are many people who see the Weather Bureau simply as a body which indicates the expected weather pattern for a weekend, and this is definitely not with a view to increased efficiency or productivity, but often only for a jaunt over hundreds of kilometres in order to lie in the sun for a day and a half and then rush back the following day to be in time for work.</p>

<p>Another sphere in which we shall have to guard against making a farce of it, is the new and unknown sphere of weather modification. Since weather modification can be quite <span class="col_5869-5870" refersTo="page_0265"/>spectacular when it is applied operationally as far as the size, colour and movement of clouds are concerned, many of our people have gained the impression that the Weather Bureau has a sort of magic wand which can change weather conditions at will. If some regions of the country wants sunshine and it rains, this department is accused of its research causing the untimely rain. I think that on various occasions in the past, the fact has been emphasized that at this stage research is being concentrated upon. However, recently, during the period in which we had superfluous rains, I read that a fairly responsible person, or a person who ought to be responsible, apparently said that the Weather Bureau at present has at its disposal the kind of knowledge to increase rain and that the time was ripe for them to be able to stop the rain as well. When one hears such statements, one realizes the real ignorance which exists in respect of this department, as well as the ignorance which exists in respect of the aim and service of this department.</p>

<p>Therefore, we want to express our appreciation for the fact that this department is at present involved in doing research in a responsible manner and collecting information with the purpose of interpreting and applying that data later on for the promotion of orderly weather modification in South Africa. In the research programme, which is incidentally, being undertaken in my constituency, there has been nothing much over the past year which can be described as spectacular progress. However, we are grateful for the installation of certain apparatus there which makes it possible for the ground staff to be able to determine the true position of the aircraft taking part in the operational programme. We are grateful that these people are collecting information in a scientific manner and then supplementing it and comparing it with that of other countries. It is not unlikely that a breakthrough will be made at some time or other in respect of orderly weather modification. However, I think that it is unlikely that that breakthrough will be made in South Africa, because there are other countries which have more money to spend on this research and more staff to devote to research in this sphere. However, we must be careful that our research and our development do not take place too slowly so that when that actual breakthrough is made, we will be unable to apply it in South Africa too. We also want to address a warning from this House that opportunistic weather modification may be grossly irresponsible. It comes to one&#x2019;s attention from time to time that there are certain bodies who often try and bring about large-scale weather modification and prevention of hail on a commercial basis as a sphere which can serve a major purpose in South Africa. Sir, we want to ask in all modesty that the department should closely bear in mind the scientific nature of this project and that the statistics of other countries should be verified with those we already possess in South Africa. Therefore we also want to ask that South Africa should co-operate in one of the major ideals in meteorology, i.e. to try and receive a continuous and exact picture of the weather conditions throughout the world as an uninterrupted check and a point of departure for weather forecasts and other uses, for example climatology. In this co-operation we shall have to utilize all knowledge we are able to collect from weather satellites, but we shall also have to guard against this information piling up or simply being used selectively, as a result of a shortage of experts and researchers.</p>

<p>Everything indicates that with the knowledge and the skill we possess in South Africa, there will be an improvement in the sphere of storm warnings. This is something which is already taking place in other countries, and is found to an increasing extent in South Africa, also with respect to local thunderstorms and rainfall. It is hoped that reliable forecasts for periods of from 5 to 7 days will be possible in the near future. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have no fault to find with the arguments advanced here by the hon. member for Bethlehem with regard to a very scientific subject, namely meteorology. Weather forecasting today is very much better than it was years ago, mainly as a result of the scientific progress in the world and the use of the satellite system for this purpose. Weather forecasting for the whole of South Africa is not such an easy matter as it is here in the Peninsula. When the north-west wind is blowing and Lion&#x2019;s Head is covered, we know that it is going to rain in Cape Town. When one visits the meteorological station at Hart-beeshoek and sees the blanket of clouds south of the Sahara, one can very clearly see, for the <span class="col_5871-5872" refersTo="page_0266"/>next 24 hours or for an even longer period, what the weather conditions are going to be in the immediate future. But so much for that.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the use of our roads by motorists. We do know that road transport plays a very important role in South Africa. If one thinks of the million or more motor vehicles which there are, all of which are driven by licensed motorists, and if one thinks of the 200 different models which are in use on the roads of South Africa, and if one thinks of the extensive system of tarred roads, then one realizes that one is faced with a situation in which the motor vehicle plays a very important role, in which the driver plays a very important role as do our roads. Before coming to the human factor, I first want to dwell on the motor vehicle in our system of transport in South Africa and, indeed, in the whole world. It is with great pleasure that I see the hon. the Leader of the House, the hon. the Minister of Defence, being present here this afternoon after his absence. Were it not for the fact that he was travelling in a very safe vehicle when the accident occurred, we would perhaps not have had the privilege of welcoming him back here this afternoon. The safety of the vehicle plays a very important role and I should like to tell the hon. the Minister, all other Ministers as well as all road users in South Africa that when one ventures on to the road, one should make use of the best vehicle available, as the hon. the Minister of Defence did. There has been talk of Mercedeses and Buicks, but I still think the safest vehicle is the best. But I should like to come to the human factor.</p>

<p>I do not have any statistics available, but I assume that there are well over a million motor vehicles in South Africa, vehicles which are driven by all sorts of people&#x2014;old, young and middle-aged, by women and men, Black, White and Brown. For me the issue is the licensing of the drivers of these extremely sophisticated and dangerous vehicles. When we look at the position of the pilots of aircraft in this connection, one finds that initially the pilots of aircraft are subjected to very strict tests in respect of health, skill and ability, and in addition they have to undergo very thorough training before being licensed, in the first place, not to pilot an aircraft, but to transport passengers. But when it comes to motor vehicles, one finds that the father of, say, four children, because he is able to comply with the basic requirements, such as reading road signs, applying brakes, accelerating and changing gears, is given a licence to drive a car, but at the same time he is also the transporter of passengers&#x2014;his own family. He takes to the road in this way, and if he is not a very proficient, a very careful and a very skilled driver, he is endangering not only himself and his own family, but also the families of other people. If we consider our military action in Angola, in which a small number of people died in the interests of South Africa, but to which a great deal of publicity was given, and if one thinks of the thousands of lives which are lost annually on our roads, we simply accept this as a matter of course; it does not touch our hearts and makes virtually no impression on us. Nevertheless thousands of lives are being sacrificed here, while it is so easy to prevent it from happening. I do not want to criticize our system of roads. There is, in any event, no time for me to do so now. In fact, I think our roads in South Africa are generally of a very high standard. When one has regard to the distances involved, our roads are certainly of the best in the world.</p>

<p>I want to concentrate on the driver of South Africa. No restrictions are imposed on the motorist who wants to drive, for instance, from Cape Town to Johannesburg. He may cover the distance in 19 or 20 hours without his being required to stop anywhere to regain his physical energy. It does not matter whether or not he eats or sleeps en route. No restrictions are imposed on him; how he makes the journey is left entirely to the discretion of the motorist himself. Drivers of vehicles employed by transport companies, however, are trained and are paid to drive the vehicles. If such a driver travels from Cape Town to Johannesburg, he has a co-driver. He may not be behind the steering wheel of that vehicle for more than four hours at a stretch. After four hours the co-driver must take over. On the private driver in South Africa, however, there are no restrictions. Therefore I am of the opinion that we should give much more attention to the private driver.</p>

<p>There are always three factors which must be taken into consideration. These are the road, the vehicle and the person. It is only the person, that is the driver, who can judge how fast or slow he should drive if, for example, it is raining or getting dark. The vehicle cannot determine that it should be going slower if, for <span class="col_5873-5874" refersTo="page_0267"/>instance, the road is bad. The road itself has no control over how fast or slow the vehicle is moving. Therefore the human factor is of so much importance when it comes to road-use and the prevention of road accidents. For this reason I feel that we in South Africa, with our long distances, should give much greater attention to the driver himself. Therefore we should begin in our schools, when the future drivers are approximately 17 or 18 years of age. Before drivers obtain their licences, we must make them fully road conscious. I myself obtained my driver&#x2019;s licence in a very small town, Cradock. This was many years ago. When I obtained my driver&#x2019;s licence I had no idea of what it was to drive a car for instance, in Johannesburg. The prospective driver&#x2019;s knowledge should extend beyond conditions in a small town. He should also know what it means to drive a car at a speed of, say, 130 km/h on a freeway&#x2014;I am now thinking of the times before the speed restrictions were imposed. For instance, what does one do if one is travelling at a speed of 90 km/h and one gets a puncture? What should the reaction of the driver be? I am afraid that 99% of our younger drivers&#x2014;not our older drivers who drove on rough roads in the old days and often got punctures&#x2014;do not know what it is to get a puncture at a speed of 90 km/h. They do not know what they should do to control the vehicle under such circumstances. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to reply to the discussion that has taken place so far. Many constructive ideas have been raised, particularly on road safety. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat discussed this subject and so did the hon. member for Maitland, who broached it. After the hon. member for Maitland, the hon. members for Welkom and Boksburg also discussed it. Therefore it is clear that road safety is a matter of great importance to all of us.</p>

<p>The carnage on our roads in recent times and the newspaper reports over the Easter weekend alerted everyone in South Africa to the fact that matters are not as they should be in South Africa as far as road safety is concerned. I do not want to detract in any way from the importance of the subject, or the extent of road accidents, but there are nevertheless certain aspects I should like to point out. The most important is that although we gained the impression over the last Easter weekend that the death toll as well as the number of road accidents was high, these were not really any higher than in the past. Nor were they any higher than had been expected on the basis of projected figures. The projections were made by the National Road Safety Council.</p>

<p>I think everyone will agree that the number of road accidents bears a close relationship to the number of vehicles in use on the roads. The National Road Safety Council has made projections for a number of years into the future to calculate the number of accidents which could be expected as a result of the growth in our traffic. It has been found in practice that the projected figures were in fact very nearly equal to the actual number of accidents. I should like to quote a few examples in this regard. For 1972 it was estimated in advance that 218 400 accidents would occur, and in point of fact there were 218 436. This shows that the estimated figure was very close to the actual figure. It was estimated that there would be 232 000 accidents in 1973, and in actual fact there were 221 000. I do not want to elaborate at too great a length on the figures, but if one considers the death toll, one finds that it was estimated that 8 400 people would die in 1973, while in actual fact 8 579 people died. In 1974 it was expected that 8 700 people would die, but the death rate in actual fact amounted to only 6 344. The reason for such a drop in both the number of road accidents as well as the death toll must be attributed to the speed restrictions which came into effect at the end of 1973. If one compares the actual figures in 1975 with the projected figures, one finds that the downward trend continued into 1975 as well, but that in reality there was a slight increase in the number of accidents, as everyone is aware. In 1974 there was in fact a decrease of 18% in the number of accidents, but in 1975 they have already increased to such an extent that the decrease which we experienced as a result of the lower speeds at which motorists travel amounted to only 5%.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Welkom pointed out that an average of 22 people were killed on our roads every day. If one takes the four days over the Easter weekend, it means that it could of course have been expected that 88 people would die. But we must not forget that the roads are far busier over the Easter weekend, <span class="col_5875-5876" refersTo="page_0268"/>and it is therefore understandable that there will be a higher accident rate. Last year it was said immediately after the Easter weekend that the death rate over the weekend had amounted to 59, but a year later, when the surveys were completed and the number of people who died subsequently, but as a result of injuries sustained over the Easter weekend, were also included, it was found that the death toll had in reality amounted to approximately 120. Consequently this means that over the Easter weekend an average of 30 people per day were killed as against an average of 22 per day over the entire year. At the end of the Easter weekend this year the death toll amounted to 73. If one multiplies this by two now, as was the case last year, one arrives at a figure of approximately 140, which was the death toll over the last Easter weekend. I am mentioning these figures merely to indicate that although we were shocked by the accident rate for the last Easter weekend, it was not entirely disproportionate to the expected pattern.</p>

<p>Another very important aspect of the number of accidents which occurred, is that 47% of the people killed on our roads, are pedestrians. I do not think that we always take this into consideration. Of that number 40% were non-White pedestrians. That fact gives rise to the need for one to try to determine what the pertinent reasons for it are. One wonders whether it is as a result of inebriation, of bad judgment, of poor discipline at cross-roads, etc.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case it is clear that this comprises the greatest percentage of our accident rate, and that special attention should therefore be given to the matter. Consequently the National Road Safety Council is at present devoting special attention to this aspect of the matter and is engaged in a publicity campaign, etc., to try to prevent so many pedestrians, and particularly non-White pedestrians, from being killed on our roads. I do not want to elaborate on this matter much further, except to say that all of us are of course very concerned about the matter of accidents which occur on our roads. I, personally, appreciate the proposals which were made here this afternoon in an attempt to counteract this slaughter on our roads.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal a little more specifically with the points raised by the hon. members. The hon. member for Maitland said that when he drives on the right-hand side of the road at the maximum permissible speed, people behind flash their lights at him because they want him to get out of the way. To begin with, I think that one should drive on the left-hand side of the road at all times. Let me elaborate on this matter a little. I am concerned about the fact that our traffic on our one-directional roads is not flowing as it should. I think that hon. members will agree with me on this score. There is always a hold-up somewhere. Even if one drives at the maximum speed, or if one wishes to drive faster for a particular reason, one finds that the traffic simply does not want to flow. My humble opinion is that the reason for this should be sought in the fact that we allow people to overtake one another either on the left or the right-hand side. I admit and confess that I am co-responsible for that. When I was still in the Provincial Council there was a Select Committee on traffic matters of which the late Mr. Henshilwood was the chairman. On that committee we decided that one could overtake a person on the left-hand side provided one made certain that one could do so safely. I personally believe that this is something which should be reconsidered, particularly on one-directional roads with several traffic lanes. One will never succeed in causing the slower traffic to move to the left-hand side of the road as long as other people have the right to overtake on the left. The motorist simply says: &#x201C;Surely you can overtake on the left-hand side; why should I move over to the left-hand side so that you can overtake on the right?&#x201D; Traffic on our one-directional roads with several traffic lanes will only flow smoothly if the slower traffic moves over to the left-hand side at all times so that the faster traffic is able to overtake on the right-hand side. This is a fact, and how is one to accomplish this now? It is not so easy to accomplish this. One can only accomplish it by making it compulsory. People can only be compelled to do this if, for example, a prohibition is imposed on overtaking on the left. Then it makes no difference whether a person is driving at slow or high speeds. When the opportunity presents itself, motorists must move to the left so that the right-hand lane can be open for motorists who want to overtake.</p>

<p>That also happens. Then one will simply have to flash one&#x2019;s lights to indicate that one wants to overtake. The hon. member referred to uniform qualifications for drivers. This is a matter which has a great deal of merit. I have been informed by the National Road Safety Council that, with the latest provision of information an attempt is being made to bring about uniformity in respect of learner drivers&#x2019; licences, as well as in regard to the issuing of new drivers&#x2019; licences. As far as forged drivers&#x2019; licences are concerned&#x2014;the hon. member referred to that as well&#x2014;we shall co-operate with the Department of Justice, as the hon. member himself also suggested. I am also of the opinion that the proposed central register of drivers&#x2019; licence holders will contribute a great deal to solving this problem, in so far as it is in fact a problem.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Welkom once again discussed road safety. He put certain questions to me. In the first place he wanted to know whether the roads are being built in the correct manner. Oh well, this is not something I can prove with figures. It is not as easy as saying twice two is four. Still, I believe that the local authorities the provincial administrations and the National Transport Commission, who are responsible for our national throughways, always take care to build the roads in such a way that it constitutes the greatest measure of safety. The hon. member also expressed his concern regarding the question of whether motor vehicles which are manufactured in South Africa comply with all the prescribed safety requirements. This is also an open question. I believe that our motor vehicles in general are good. Our great problem, however, is not that new motor vehicles do not comply with requirements, but that all motor vehicles eventually become unroadworthy and that many of them are not always repaired and overhauled adequately. In my opinion traffic officers are doing a very good job of work by carrying out tests from time to time on the motor vehicles on our roads.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to safety-belts. We could, of course, conduct a very long debate on safety-belts here. A recommendation was indeed made by the National Road Safety Council to the effect that the use of safety-belts should be made compulsory. This is a matter to which we should definitely give very serious consideration. The moment it is made compulsory for safety-belts to be used at all times, it means that, if I were to get into my car here and drive down to the Jan van Riebeeck Statue, for example, I would have to wear a safety-belt. Therefore, if I am driving down Adderley Street and I have not buckled on my safety-belt, a traffic officer or policeman might stop me and fine me for having failed to do so. It is by its nature a difficult problem. The question remains to what extent and under what circumstances it should be made compulsory. I admit candidly that safety-belts serve a very good purpose. Particularly for journeys over long distances it is in my opinion very desirable to wear a safety-belt. I am convinced that if my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Defence, had been wearing a safety-belt at the time of his recent accident&#x2014;which was not the case&#x2014;his injuries would probably have been far fighter. The fact of the matter is, however, that it will be a very difficult matter to apply such a requirement. One could cause major problems, particularly since one is once again dealing with the human factor, with a person who has to apply it and who could be injudicious in his methods when he fines people. The hon. member referred to the frame of mind of drivers. I am in complete agreement with the hon. member. If one goes to England and stands on the sidewalks of London one gains the impression that there is no discipline, that there are very few traffic rules. Yet the traffic is flowing. Then again, when one finds oneself in Germany, one sees that no one waits for anyone else&#x2014;unless required to do so by law. But there, too, the traffic flows. In the two countries I have held up as examples, one has circumstances which are completely dissimilar, but the results one finds there are nevertheless very much the same.</p>

<p>The ideal position would of course be if one could have a good and sound combination of both, i.e. the necessary measures and the application thereof, and at the same time the right frame of mind of the one driver towards another as we would like to have it. The hon. member also referred to the fact that the Police also have to deal with traffic matters. I should prefer not to discuss that matter, for it is a very contentious one.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown raised a variety of matters. The hon. member asked me whether we recognize certificated persons as members of the crews of South African ships. I want to inform the hon. member that that <span class="col_5879-5880" refersTo="page_0270"/>qualification is in fact recognized. There is a great shortage of certificated persons in the world. Therefore it is not only the case in our country, but throughout the world. The position in regard to certificated persons for South African vessels is still unsatisfactory, and exemptions to sail without certificated persons still have to be granted, particularly to the crews of fishing boats. During the 1975-&#x2019;76 financial year there were 2 023 such cases and in 1974-&#x2019;75, 1 792. Extreme concessions are, according to the circumstances, granted only in essential cases, but to encourage fishermen to acquire certificates of competency, it has been decided to take stricter action and to grant concessions for shorter periods and, if possible, not to repeat them.</p>

<p>The hon. member also discussed the control over small ships, small boats and other vessels. He also referred to that on a previous occasion, during the discussion of legislation. In that regard I should like to quote to him a memorandum which was submitted to me. In my opinion this is the quickest way in which I can dispose of the matter. The following report was made to me in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Representations have also been received from the Natal Commercial Fishermen&#x2019;s Association to the effect that all skiboats operating along the Natal coast should be controlled. There are approximately 2 500 such boats, of which only about 150 are properly licensed in terms of Act 57 of 1951. The department met representatives of the association on 30 January 1976 and again on 27 April 1976. The representations submitted boiled down to the fact that such uncontrolled craft are not suitable for use on the Natal coast, whilst many are often under the control of inexperienced persons. Apart from the above, the S.A. Navy is also of the opinion that there should be a record of all small craft, but this is purely from a security point of view. For the past six months the Marine division has been actively engaged in investigating this problem. We are deeply conscious of the difficulties involved in exercising control over such craft. The question of whether the control of small craft not falling within the purview of Act 57 of 1951 should be exercised by a local authority, is a matter for consideration. The present indications are that this would be possible. Investigations, however, are far from complete and it is considered that a further three months are required to make suitable recommendations to you in this regard.</block>

<p>The &#x201C;you&#x201D; referred to here is the Minister. I do not think that I can take the matter any further for the hon. member than that. I should like to give him the assurance that we are dealing with this matter to the best of our ability. The hon. member also requested that there should be one organization for the ocean, the large harbours and the small harbours. However, this is a very complicated subject and I think we shall need a far more comprehensive discussion of it than the one we are having today. The hon. member also requested that our sea limits should be extended. I want to tell him that we are not a member of the Inter-governmental Nautical Consulting Organization. We are trying to get our foot in at the door of this organization, but we have not yet succeeded. However, we shall continue our efforts to obtain membership. Without membership of that organization it will serve no purpose for us to take further action in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member, as well as others, referred to the Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain bus service. I do not think that any of us in this committee would deny the proficiency and the competency of the Cape Town bus company, under the supervision of Tollgate Holdings, to operate bus services, for I really think that it is, if not the best, then one of the best bus services in South Africa. It is run by a private concern, whereas we do not have private entrepreneurs doing this in the other cities of South Africa. In the other cities, the bus services have to be rendered by municipalities, at losses running into hundreds of thousands of rands.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, millions. This applies in particular to cities such as Johannesburg and Durban. For this reason I believe that we are all agreed that these companies are rendering very efficient services, with proper regard for all economic rules. Objections are being made to the profits they are making. The hon. member for Orange Grove was one of the hon. members who objected to this, but I shall come back to him at a later stage. Surely it is not a bad thing to make a profit. How can one <span class="col_5881-5882" refersTo="page_0271"/>expect a company to do business&#x2014;particularly if it involves such a complicated organization as a bus company&#x2014;without making a profit? Naturally they ought to make a profit. When the hon. member considers those profits, he must relate them to the capital investment. Millions of rands have been invested in those companies, and money has to be earned on those millions of rands, irrespective of whether it is by way of loan funds or their own capital. In this way a company has been established in this case, 50% of the shares of which belong to Tollgate Holdings, and the other 50% to non-Whites. This company has been granted the concession to provide services there. Personally I think this is a step in the right direction. Naturally it was not I who granted that concession, but the hon. member is quite entitled to raise the matter and to express his opinion to the effect that this should not have been done. Personally I think, however, that one has here the skill, proficiency and experience of a company that has been operating this kind of business for years. Added to this we also have the involvement of the Coloured community. If a well-organized bus service should be established at a later stage, and the organized Coloured community then wants to make a take-over, I think it would be a good thing. For a start it is in my opinion just as satisfactory that the bus services are at present being run on a 50-50 basis between the Coloureds and the bus company.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Tygervallei discussed traffic officers, speed traps and the revenue earned by local authorities by means of traffic officers. I must now admit that I was the victim of such a speed trap. It could very easily be said now that my attitude to this matter is not an entirely objective one. A moment ago, when the hon. member for Bethlehem was talking about the patriotism which ought to be manifested in respect of fuel saving, some of my good friends opposite glanced in my direction with a little smile on their faces. Apparently they were thinking to themselves: &#x201C;What did you do, Mr. Muller?&#x201D; I now want to explain to them that I am a good patriot and that I would never exceed the speed limit as far as fuel saving is concerned. In fact, I did not exceed it, for I was only travelling at 80 km/h. The worst thing of all was that it was on a national road.</p>

<p>It is not a disgrace. The hon. member for Houghton really could not restrain herself from getting in a word, but I am pleased that she did not make a speech this afternoon. Be that as it may, I did not exceed the speed limit imposed for fuel saving. I was only travelling at 80 km/h. But, Sir, I have to agree with the hon. member for Tygervallei that this speed trapping is really being done injudiciously. It is being done so injudiciously, and there appears to be something so strange about the revenue earned in this way, that it is just not acceptable to the public. A policeman ought to be seen as the friend of the public, and he is indeed in most cases, I would say, seen to be the friend of the public, although errors of judgment are made as a result of which he is sometimes not seen in that light. In the same way the ideal position is that the traffic officer should also be seen as a friend of the public. But what is he today? There is no more hated person that the traffic officer.</p>

<p>This is the unfortunate situation, when they proceed to set speed traps as well. An hon. member referred today to what happened on the road between the zoo and the junction of Newlands Avenue and Rhodes Avenue, this side of Kirstenbosch. That is where they usually lie in wait for people. However, they do not do this in the mornings when people are on their way to office, for then one is forced to drive at a snail&#x2019;s pace. The Cape Town municipality did not make the road wide enough to be able to travel at speed. One is then forced to drive at a snail&#x2019;s pace. On a Saturday morning, however, when the traffic is able to get moving, they are waiting there to trap the people who are travelling a little faster than 60 km/h. When the traffic is able to get moving, they are in fact obstructing the flow of traffic. The case was also mentioned of the freeway between the airport and Cape Town. When one passes the Mowbray golf course, one suddenly finds oneself on a road which, for all practical purposes, is the same as the one on which one has been travelling from the airport. Suddenly the speed limit is 60 km/h and then they are waiting just a little further on where the bushes <span class="col_5883-5884" refersTo="page_0272"/>grow at the side of the road. That is where they trap motorists. I can testify to this, because one morning my driver had to come in to fetch me. He was delayed there for almost quarter of an hour because the traffic police were trapping motorists there. Is this the way in which traffic officers should act to regulate the traffic? That is why I say that their main object ought to be to regulate the traffic. In this regard, therefore, I want to agree with the hon. member.</p>

<p>There is one way in which this matter will be remedied, and that is that these funds should go into a different repository to the one they are going into at present. I want to admit candidly today that I wanted to insert such a provision in the legislation on urban transportation. In fact, I have already inserted it there. There was a provision that all traffic fines in metropolitan areas should go into the metropolitan fund, but I then established that a committee had been appointed by my colleague, the Minister of Finance to go into the entire matter of the financing of local authorities. Because this had, wrongly, become such an important factor in the financing of local authorities, I then decided to omit it from this legislation for the time being.</p>

<p>That was a mistake.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But I want proper consideration to be given to this matter, and that is why I have referred it to the committee to give attention to and consider the possibility&#x2014;I think this is the right thing to do&#x2014;of paying all traffic fines into the metropolitan fund. The metropolitan area will then benefit from those fines in any event, while the control over and the supervision of the funds will no longer be vested in the local authority, but in the National Transport Commission.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove referred to bus boycotts and he made a few remarks about how non-White transportation should not have to pay for the ideologies of the National Party. I just want to point out to him that very large sums are being paid by way of subsidy, not only to the companies, but to the consumers, to the people who need the transportation. During the past year we have made provision for R10 million, and subsequently requested an additional R5 million in the Additional Estimates. This year we are making provision for R16 million for those subsidies, and I fear it is not enough. The matter has assumed such proportions that my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, has now appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Pretorius to reconsider the entire question of subsidization. In this period of inflation we simply cannot keep on paying more and more subsidies all the time. Apparently the hon. member is not taking into consideration that the salaries of the people using this transport are also being augmented from time to time. When we augment their salaries, we are engaged in the process of narrowing the gap between the salary scales of the Whites and the non-Whites. Yet it seems to me that he is proceeding on the assumption that the fares may simply never be allowed to go up, in spite of the fact that we are faced with inflation and all its various facets as far as transportation matters are concerned. Be that as it may, the hon. member raised quite a number of matters with regard to City Tramways here in the Cape as well. In that regard I told him on a certain occasion that I was instituting an investigation. He has now asked me what progress has been made with this investigation, and in reply I want to tell him that I approved the terms of reference this morning only. The terms of reference were finalized this morning, and this week, or next week, we shall proceed to appoint the auditors&#x2019; firm to do the necessary investigation which I undertook to do with reference to the question he asked earlier.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the duty free shops at Jan Smuts Airport, and said that exorbitant prices were being charged there. My information is that the prices which were to have been charged at the bottlestore to which he referred, were submitted to the department. I do not know whether there had been any deviation from any of those prices, but we shall give the necessary attention to this matter and establish whether or not that was the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg also referred to a central organization&#x2014;I think we must agree with him here&#x2014;for the control of traffic matters, for with the traffic officers of all the various local authorities it is a fact that there has to be a measure of duplication, as the hon. member did in fact indicate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kempton Park referred to civil aviation, and he was concerned about the fact that it is not very easy for the smaller aircraft that are not flying along the <span class="col_5885-5886" refersTo="page_0273"/>determined routes to obtain information from the meteorological offices. I can only say that the meteorological information is available at all the large airports, and anyone in the private sector who would like to obtain information concerning the weather predictions, is at liberty at all times to make use of the telephone to obtain such information.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to overhead cables. I am in complete agreement with him. Still, I think we may rest assured that the universal tendency is rather to lay cables underground than to have overhead cables, for not only are they a hazard to air traffic, they are also extremely unsightly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast referred to the roads in the Transkei and along the South Coast. The hon. member is of course aware&#x2014;but he made no mention of it&#x2014;of the excellent road which is being built along the South Coast. I had thought the hon. member would at least have said thank you for that road, a beautiful double highway.</p>

<p>Then I accept that. It is a double highway which is under construction along the South Coast of Natal in the direction of Port Edward. I have a map in front of me here. The National Transport Commission is of course responsible for the building of national through ways. The N2 is consequently the national throughway which is being built from Cape Town to Durban. According to my map a road has already been completed up to a point south of Ixopo. This is a national road. However, there is a section in between in regard to which there is as yet no clarity. I want to quote the following in regard to those roads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die basiese beplanning van die aanvaarde roete tussen die Umzimkulu-rivier en die Ikotshwana-rivier en tussen die Ikotshwana-rivier en die Umhlungwa-rivier is tevore reeds deur die Nasionale Vervoer-kommissie goedgekeur. Die raadgewende ingenieurs werk reeds aan die detail beplanning daarvan. Die gedeelte tussen die Umhlungwa-rivier en die Umtwalumi is teen &#x2019;n totale koste van R6 434 188 aangebou en reeds vir verkeer oopgestel.</block>

<p>I do not want to take up any more of the Committee&#x2019;s time. I just want to say that the section to Port Edward, to which I referred, has not been planned at all yet. Up to now there has still been uncertainty concerning the planning of that section, but the planning will still be tackled in future.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised another matter here in regard to the uniformity of roadworthy tests for motor vehicles in the Transkei and in the Republic. This is one of the many matters which have to be ironed out in view of the approaching independence of the Transkei. Details have already been worked out and made available, but have not yet been finalized. However, the necessary attention will be given to this matter. I am in complete agreement with the hon. member that this is a very important matter.</p>

<p>Apart from the reference he made to loyalty in respect of fuel saving, the hon. member for Bethlehem also referred to the Weather Bureau. However, I do not want to elaborate much on this. I know it is a matter that is close to his heart because Bethlehem is where he has established himself. I think he said there was quite a lack of progress in fact. I just want to point out that there is a great shortage of trained people. In recent times, as the result of the fight against inflation, funds have not all been that readily available either. But the hon. member will see that provision is being made in the Estimates for an amount of R25 000 for the purchase of a slow-moving glider which we intend purchasing to farther this aspect.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston concluded the debate by referring once again to road safety, and all the matters that go with it. In particular he emphasized the issuing of licences and the competence of the licence holders. Here, too, there is a deficiency in the sense that a person who qualifies for a driver&#x2019;s licence today may no longer qualify in 30 to 40 year&#x2019;s time. Just as we do not yet have a system in South Africa for certifying vehicles to be roadworthy from year to year, so we do not have a system whereby licence holders may be tested from time to time to see whether they are still competent to drive a motor vehicle either. We shall have to give attention to these difficult aspects&#x2014;one could almost call them this&#x2014;in future in order to ensure a greater measure of safety on our roads.</p>

<p>I should like to express my appreciation to <span class="col_5887-5888" refersTo="page_0274"/>the hon. members for the constructive ideas they raised.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we in the Official Opposition will support this Bill at Third Reading. I believe that at the Third Reading it is right and proper to discuss the effect in terms of the object of the Bill and in terms of amendments which may have been accepted during the Committee Stage. Although we on this side of the House put forward a number of amendments during the Committee Stage, none of them was accepted and the only amendment which was accepted was a relatively minor one moved by the hon. the Minister himself. The object of the Bill is to establish a medical university to serve the national units as defined in the Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, No. 46 of 1959. The use of the term &#x201C;Southern Africa&#x201D; in the title of the Bill suggests a broader concept than the Bill itself implies. I am aware that the scope of the Bill is limited in terms of clause 19 because the university council will be given certain powers but no complete autonomy. The council will only have a general permissive power to admit persons who do not belong to the national units provided for in the Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act. As such persons will only be admitted at the whim of the Minister, I believe that in the initial stages of this university it amounts already to a lack of confidence in the principle of a university being autonomous. The hon. the Minister has already admitted that there have been 25 admissions into the Bantu ethnic universities of students from outside the normal homelands of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>During the various stages of this Bill the hon. the Minister stressed the need for Bantu medical practitioners, dentists and veterinarians and in the figures which he listed, he also revealed the stupendous failure of the NP Government in respect of the training of Black dentists and veterinarians over the last 25 years. One should also bear in mind that 15 years have elapsed since the Bantu homelands concept was expounded by the NP Government indicating that the homelands would become independent in all respects. I question whether there is any other Black African State in a position such that none of its indigenous people is qualified at this moment in time to treat the population from a dental or veterinary point of view. I question where there is another independent country in Africa in this invidious position. I believe that the Government should have acted in this respect many years ago. In terms of its own Holloway Commission of 1953, if one studies the recommendations, the Government supported the principle of using existing services until separate services could be provided. Had the existing services been used or expanded, we would not have been in the position in which we find ourselves today.</p>

<p>As late as last year in reply to a question the hon. the Minister of National Education indicated to me that he had no intention of extending the medical and dental training facilities. He was dealing with the training facilities of all races under his portfolio. At that stage he knew full well that the present and projected output could not meet the demand and he also knew that he was not in a position even to project with any degree of accuracy the output of Bantu general practitioners and dentists because in reply to the question he said there was no trend on which he could base a projection. It is therefore disappointing that, while this new institution will become operational only in 1983, the hon. the Minister says he intends to phase out Bantu trainees from the University of Natal.</p>

<p>As far as the medical school of the University of Natal is concerned, the hon. the Minister has indicated that it is not his intention suddenly to close the medical school to Bantu students. He said it would be <span class="col_5889-5890" refersTo="page_0275"/>systematically superseded by an institution which will train more students. The idea of training more Bantu medical students is acceptable to this side of the House. However, every factor suggests that the training of Bantu medical students should continue at the University of Natal to supplement the supply that will flow from the university at Ga-Rankuwa from 1983. The hon. the Minister indicated that more than half the Bantu medical practitioners who are operating&#x2014;the hon. the Minister mentioned a figure of approximately 400&#x2014;qualified either at Wits, UCT or at the University of Natal. The small balance may have qualified overseas. As the hon. the Minister has told us, this matter has been under consideration by the Cabinet since 1966. Yet it would appear that there has been no adequate consultation with the University of Natal in the interim, because I am advised on good authority that only on 9 December 1975 the decision was conveyed to the university that they were not to enrol more Bantu students for 1976 and that this was to be accompanied by the gradual phasing out of Bantu students at the university over the succeeding years.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister admits that there is a serious shortage of Bantu medical practitioners. He is on record in Hansard as having said that the number of Bantu medical practitioners was &#x201C;completely inadequate&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister of Education admits, as I have said, that there is no projection possible. During the Second Reading debate on this Bill the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education quoted figures which, I believe, with respect, were unrelated to the full circumstances of the situation. I believe that the figures quoted by the hon. the Minister were detrimental to South Africa&#x2019;s image overseas. These figures were not in accordance with the figures forthcoming from other informed sources. Let me quote some. The hon. the Minister is on record in Hansard as having indicated on 2 April that in the case of the Bantu the ratio of medical practitioners to patients was approximately one in 45 000 and for Whites one in 400. This is an oversimplification of the whole situation. Let me quote from somebody who, I believe, knew at the time what the position in South Africa was. I quote ex-Administrator and ex-Cabinet Minister Gerdner who is on record as having said in October 1966 that &#x201C;possibly half the combined working time of the White medical practitioners was spent in attending to non-White patients&#x201D;. This is a significant fact which one cannot disregard. Let me quote, further, from <i>Tegniek</i> of May 1970, which is later still. In it there appeared a survey on &#x201C;die onafhanklike State van Afrika&#x201D;. The survey lists the &#x201C;inwoners per dokter&#x201D;. I take &#x201C;inwoners&#x201D; to be the inhabitants. The figure given for S.A. is one doctor per 1 487 inhabitants which is, incidentally, the most favourable ratio in the whole of the continent of Africa. However, if we take as our basis the Minister&#x2019;s figures which are now recorded in Hansard as being the figures in his opinion, we would find that with one doctor per 45 000 Bantu people, we would be bracketed with Burundi, Ethopia, Malawi, Niger and Chad. Yet <i>Tegniek</i> indicated that we had the best ratio in Africa. Let me refer, thirdly, to the &#x201C;Survey on Training and Employment of Medical, Dental and Auxiliary Medical Personnel&#x201D; of 1960, which is a survey that was instituted by this Government. Let me refer the hon. the Minister to Table 33 which is headed &#x201C;Population ratios per medical practitioner in densely populated cities of South Africa (according to census districts)&#x201D;. The highest, or worst, ratio of medical practitioners to the non-White population to be found in that table was the ratio in Kimberley which stood at one medical practitioner to 1 250 non-Whites.</p>

<p>The next table is No. 34. This is a survey of the 10 rural centres with a minimum of medical cover. There one finds the most unfavourable ratio i.e. one to 59 000, with the most favourable ratio of one to 5 266 in areas with a minimum medical cover. The average for these 10 areas amounts to a ratio of one to approximately 21 000. I accept that the statistics published in the report of 1960 refer to the year 1958, but if the position has deteriorated during the past 18 years, that is merely a further indictment of Nationalist Government inefficiency and neglect in this respect.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the question of the cost comparisons in relation to projected results, because despite the opinion of the hon. the Minister of National Education, this hon. the Minister, in reply to a question by me, did give a projection. The medical school of the University of Natal was established 25 years ago. The cost of establishment amounted to R772 400 while the cost of administration, since its inception 25 years ago, has amounted to R8,3 million. During these 25 years <span class="col_5891-5892" refersTo="page_0276"/>approximately 600 medical doctors graduated. Approximately 200 of them were Bantu.</p>

<p>Let us now look at the position as far as Medunsa is concerned. We find&#x2014;in reply to a question&#x2014;that the estimated initial cost of Medunsa is said to be in the vicinity of R30 million. Administrative costs are estimated at R3 000 a year for each medical student and R4 000 a year for each dental student. The estimated annual intake is 250, of which 200 will be medical students and 50 will be dental students. According to my calculations, the annual running costs will amount to R800 000. I now want to mention something which is very interesting. The projected output, according to the hon. the Minister, by 1985 the projected annual output will be 150 medical practitioners. By 1990 the output will have increased by 10 to 160 a year, and by 1995 by a further 10 to 170 a year. The figures relating to the output of dental graduates indicate that by 1985 there will be 35 per year, by 1990 40 per year and by 1995 43 per year.</p>

<p>These figures indicate that between the years 1985 and 1995 one can expect an output of 2 450 medical practitioners and 580 dentists from the Medical University of Southern Africa. However, that is what one can expect. But what are the indications if one considers past results? I believe these figures are optimistic, because in the 25 years during which the University of Natal has been in operation producing medical graduates, 199 Bantu doctors have graduated but 299 have failed.</p>

<p>I believe the hon. the Minister will have to accept that the possible proportion of failures could&#x2014;particularly in the initial stages&#x2014;be reasonably high.</p>

<p>My colleague, the hon. member for Edenvale, gave projections in his Second Reading speech, projections which I believe painted a very depressing picture. Let me say unequivocally that the United Party has never begrudged education the funds we have been asked to vote. However, I personally would like to sound a note of caution. The Minister states that the initial expenditure on Medunsa is likely to be up to R30 million. Speaking from memory, I believe the estimated original cost of the University of Durban-Westville was approximately R11 million and that at 31 March 1975 the expenditure on buildings and fixed equipment alone had already reached the figure of R17,5 million an increase in a relatively small number of years of over 50%. The administrative costs for the year 1974-&#x2019;75 was approximately R4,7 million. I suggest that the planning and implementation under present conditions should aim at a happy balance between extravagance and austerity. I believe we should aim to provide training and training equipment equal to the best and that savings should be effected wherever possible, but not savings on equipment. I believe that this should be done so as to ensure that when graduates emerge to play their part in health services, there will be adequate funds available to pay them on the same basis or ratio as their White counterparts with similar qualifications, similar experience and similar responsibilities. Let me draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that at present the salary ratio of Whites to Bantu is 100 : 72. The latest example I can produce for the Minister proves how sad the position is. According to figures given to me in January 1976, a Bantu chief specialist is paid a fixed salary of R11 250 per annum. However, if the hon. the Minister refers to the <i>Government Gazette</i> of April 1976, he will find that a post for a part-time district surgeon in Bloemhof was advertised at a salary of R18 000 per annum.</p>

<p>I would like briefly to deal with the hon. member for Lydenburg. I am sorry that he is not here at the moment.</p>

<p>That hon. member does not know what he is talking about either, and I am going to tell him where he is wrong. The hon. member did not listen to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech, neither did he read the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Hansard afterwards. Had he done so, he would have read in col. 4542 the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s brief description of the <span class="col_5893-5894" refersTo="page_0277"/>developments in Durban from about 1937. He also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1947 the Government decided to grant its approval in principle to the establishment of a non-White medical school at Durban under the patronage of the University College of Natal.</block>

<p>The year 1947 was in the good old UP days. This indicated planning. However, let me refer the hon. member to his own publication &#x201C;The Progress of the Bantu people towards nationhood &#x201D;. I refer to issue No. 5 published in 1960. This is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bantu students have trained as doctors at the universities of Cape Town and the Witwatersrand since 1937. In 1952 a medical school, especially for the training of non-White doctors, was established at the Natal University.</block>

<p>Who did the planning for that? Was it this Government or the UP Government? It could never have been put into effect in this time. It has taken ten years to plan for this university and it is still not off the ground. The article goes on further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A faculty considered by overseas experts to be one of the best designed and equipped medical schools in the Commonwealth. The Government provided the full cost of building, &#x00A3;405 000, and contributes more than &#x00A3;60 000 a year towards the running costs. The school&#x2019;s intake is 40 students a year, and ultimately there will be between 250 and 300 students.</block>

<p>After the hon. member for Lydenburg had made his statement, he took the number of Black matriculants there were in 1948. He then almost answered the question when he said that in 1958 158 Blacks obtained matric exemption, as against approximately 100 in 1948. The record is low and it is difficult to trace statistics of 30 years ago. However, I have certain statistics which were given to me in 1965 and, as far as I can remember, they were given to me by the Department of Bantu Education. Figures indicated that in the years 1959, 1960 and 1961 the number of Bantu who gained matric exemption was 72, 56 and 76 respectively. Another fact the hon. member for Lydenburg overlooked, was that the UP, to the best of my knowledge, increased expenditure on Bantu education as the years went by. But this Government pegged the State expenditure for Bantu education for nearly 15 years. They pegged it at R13 million. What was the result? In 1954 the per capita cost fell from R17 to R13,80 in 1959.</p>

<p>I see that the hon. member for Lydenburg is back again and I am glad he heard the last portion of my speech. The hon. member talks about planning, but the planning was not sufficient to cope with the shortage of Bantu medical practitioners. At one stage they could not even make a projection because there was no trend on which to go. This is the situation after 27 years of this Government. I think we have cause to condemn the Nationalist Government for this.</p>

<p>I want to refer to one other aspect, i.e. in regard to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s indication&#x2014; and I accept it&#x2014;that consultation did take place with the homeland Governments. I now want to give the hon. the Minister the opinion of an individual whose opinion is, to my belief, valuable, as I believe he is in touch with public Bantu opinion. Referring to this Bill, he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of course it is the principle which most people will reject. In another country the Durban School of Medicine would be open to cater for all colours and Cape Town would serve the needs primarily of that part of the world, while Wits and Pretoria ought to have satisfied the needs primarily of people in the Transvaal and none of them to exclude anybody.</block>

<p>We know that that is not the Government&#x2019;s attitude, but it is the UP&#x2019;s policy to extend services at that level.</p>

<p>In closing I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he makes all reasonable efforts to expedite this. I suggest that he takes a good look and that he gives preference to practicability over ideology. Before I sit down, I want to urge the hon. the Minister to reconsider keeping the Natal University open for as long as it is feasible, to provide the much needed supply of Bantu medical doctors.</p>

<from><span class="col_5895-5896" refersTo="page_0278"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. DU TOIT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to react to everything the hon. member for Berea said. He tried to make out that the Government neglected its duty as regards the training of Blacks. He also said that the Government should have made these training facilities available 15 years ago. Furthermore, he accused the Government of neglecting the training of the Blacks. Sir, this Government&#x2019;s deeds speak for themselves. The other day the hon. the Minister provided information in respect of matriculation exemptions. The number of matriculation exemptions rose from 182 in 1960 to 3 225 in 1975. This in itself is a major achievement. It was this Government which established the University of the North, the University of Zululand and the University of Durban Westville, among others. How then, can this Government be accused of not establishing these facilities in time? Furthermore, training facilities for doctors were also made available at the University of Natal. It was not a case of their having nowhere to go. With reference to the hon. member&#x2019;s last remark, I want to say that he knows very well what the policy of this Government is in respect of the establishment of facilities for each group. It is a conflict in principle between the UP and us and will always be disputed. Their standpoint is diametrically opposed to ours, because they maintained that these people should have been integrated into the various universities. This is the standpoint of the UP.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now come to the Third Reading of this Medical University of Southern Africa Bill. It was a Bill which was drawn up after thorough investigation by the department and it meets a long-felt need. After this Bill comes into operation, the first students will be admitted in 1978. Two hundred of them will be admitted at that stage. During the Second Reading and the Committee Stage of this Bill, very little was said about the faculty of veterinary science.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to devote my speech specifically to the present need for veterinary surgeons in South Africa, Black veterinary surgeons in particular. At the moment the position is that all State veterinary services in the Republic, in South West Africa and in the various homelands are provided by the department of Veterinary Services and the Veterinary Research Institute of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. With the coming into being and the independence of Bantu homelands it became necessary, in terms of Government policy, for each independent homeland to have its own veterinary services. Consequently it was decided that this step would be taken on 1 April 1973 in respect of Venda, Gazankulu, Lebowa, KwaZulu, the Ciskei, Basotho Quaqua and Bophuthatswana and this was in fact done. At the moment there are ten qualified White veterinary surgeons in the homelands, all of whom are seconded by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. At present there are still 11 vacant posts in the homelands. The BIC has one veterinary surgeon in its employ.</p>

<p>I also want to sketch briefly the position in respect of qualified veterinary surgeons in South Africa. The figures I am going to mention now are provided by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. There are 837 registered veterinary surgeons in the country, including South West Africa, and the distribution among the various fields of service is approximately the following: In private practice there are 456, of whom approximately 80 are in rural practices. In the Division of Veterinary Services, including the homeland services, there are 119. Forty two are engaged in research at Onderstepoort and there are 46 in training centres. There are 51 in industry, 15 in municipal services, and 108 in a variety of other services. The S.A. Veterinary Medical Association ascertained that in 1974 the shortage was 135. The shortage of veterinary surgeons is felt with particular force in the Public Service, where there are too few state veterinary surgeons to provide the services necessary in 353 magisterial districts, including those relating to the sphere of food hygiene. Apart from the vacancies, some state veterinary surgeons have to provide services in three or four, and sometimes five magisterial districts.</p>

<p>At the moment the faculty of Veterinary Science produces approximately 42 graduands every year. It is hoped that as from 1980 it will be possible to produce a maximum of 90. The S.A. Veterinary Medical Association has estimated the future demand for local graduands. They found that in 1980, 1 096 veterinary surgeons will be required, and 1 518 in 1985. Calculated at an critical accession of 40 graduates annually, and 80 graduates annually from 1980, with an erosion factor of 4%, there will be a shortage of 253 in 1980 <span class="col_5897-5898" refersTo="page_0279"/>and a shortage of 529 in 1985. These figures emphasize the need for veterinary surgeons and the necessity for meeting the needs of the homeland governments.</p>

<p>If one goes on to consider the livestock&#x2014; and one has to consider this if one wants to take the whole position in respect of veterinary surgeons into account&#x2014;we see that the homelands have approximately 37% of the total stock of cattle in the Republic and South West. Approximately 10,6% of the sheep and approximately 63,5% of the goats in the Republic and South West belong to the Blacks. As far as cattle are concerned, the Whites in the Republic have 8,5 million as against 3,8 million and 1,02 million owned by the Blacks in the Republic and in South West respectively. The condition of the livestock in the Bantu areas is, however, disappointing and we find that the turnover of cattle leaves a great deal to be desired. The cattle industry in the various homelands has only been partially developed, but there is a great deal of economic potential. In general the turnover of cattle is low. I just want to mention a few of the turnover figures. In the White areas in the Republic the turnover figure in 1970 was 18,8% and in 1974 it was 25,8%, as against an average figure of 1,4% in 1970 and 1,9% in 1974 in the homelands. The lowest turnover figure in respect of cattle in the homelands is in KwaZulu where it was 0,9% in 1970 as against 0,7% in 1974 and in the Transkei, where it was 0,2% in 1970 as against 0,7% in 1975. The highest figure is found in Bophuthatswana, where it was 4,1% in 1970 as against 6% in 1974, and in Quaqua where it was 2,6% in 1970 as against 5,5% in 1974. These low turnover figures can for the most part be ascribed to the traditional unwillingness of the Black man to sell his cattle, traditional breeding methods, ineffective management, higher marketing ages, an extremely low percentage increase and a high death rate. It is particularly in respect of the latter two reasons I have mentioned that sufficient staff for veterinary services could help immensely with regard to homeland development. By means of selection, breeding programmes, artificial insemination, castration, dehorning the cattle, control of disease, management and pasture rotation, this industry can grow and develop a great deal more. However, no one can do this better and no one can do it with greater inspiration than their own people, their own qualified people.</p>

<p>As I have said, the Department of Bantu Education made a projection of the requirements with regard to the training of veterinary surgeons. On the basis of the data at its disposal, the committee of inquiry recommended that training facilities for the Blacks be created as quickly as possible and that at least five veterinary surgeons should complete their training every year. The aim of a veterinary science faculty is not solely to train veterinary surgeons, but also to provide training to technicians, laboratory assistants, stock inspectors, etc. Although the former two categories are not urgently or immediately required at the moment, the training of stock inspectors is definitely of particular importance. According to a calculation by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, there were 261 posts for Bantu stock inspectors in 1974 to carry out identified work, whereas there are only 76 in the service of the homeland governments. Furthermore only 17 are at present undergoing training. You will therefore appreciate that the shortage of Bantu stock inspectors is acute. Furthermore, it can be foreseen that this faculty may in time become the incentive for research and the manufacture of serum for the homelands. The pressure on Onderstepoort could be reduced in this way. These services could develop to such an extent that even if they were not of world standard, they could still be of African standard. This is the first faculty of veterinary science for the Black man in Africa. There is a definite and urgent need for a veterinary science faculty. We are very sorry that it cannot be established immediately but we know that due to financial reasons it is impossible to include it in the planning immediately. We should like to ask that the urgency of this project be borne in mind at all times because the people best able to inspire the homelands to optimum production are their own people, people who have received the necessary academic and technical training. These trained people, together with the agricultural training of the Black people at Fort Hare and the agricultural colleges, will contribute towards the development of the livestock of the homelands. It is vital not only for the future of the homelands but also for the whole of South Africa. It will also help to cause these people to move away from their present subsistence economy. The highest possible <span class="col_5899-5900" refersTo="page_0280"/>production of beef is vital for the homelands as well as for South Africa.</p>

<p>Recently, a large manufacturer of agricultural implements in South Africa made a donation to Fort Hare. Over the past eleven years this company has already put R120 000, in the form of bursaries, etc., at the disposal of the agricultural faculty at Fort Hare. Recently they announced once again that they would sponsor a chair in agricultural engineering at the university of Fort Hare for five years, with five annual donations of R20 000 each. I want to appeal to the private sector to follow this example and see if we cannot set up a faculty of verterinary science sooner at the new medical university of Southern Africa. This faculty of veterinary science could perhaps be brought into being sooner by way of donations and contributions from the private sector. I can assure you that the Bantu of Southern Africa definitely need it so that their people can receive more effective training.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Vryburg has given us some very interesting statistics about the shortage of Black veterinary surgeons and trained personnel in the allied sciences, and I have no quarrel with what he said in that regard. I could of course give him an even more desperate picture, if I wished to, about the shortage of Black dentists in South Africa, but I want to come to the Bill we are discussing today and to say immediately that the official Opposition has made its position clear in stating that it intends to support the Third Reading of this Bill although it opposed the Second Reading and although the hon. member for Berea has admitted that not a single amendment of any significance was accepted by the hon. the Minister in the Committee Stage. However, the ways of the official Opposition have always been passing strange. They have never been well known for their consistency and they have always been unpredictable, and therefore the about-face and their change of attitude does not really surprise me.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, that reflects no credit on the hon. member&#x2019;s party and if I were he I would keep quiet about it, because in order to score a mean little trick off the PRP they were prepared to close down the debate on the Second Reading of an important Bill and cut out two of their most important speakers. [Interjections.] Sir, I want to get on with my argument and leave these piping little voices to talk among themselves.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that we are going to oppose the Third Reading of this Bill, for a number of reasons. First of all, although we are in full agreement with the need for more facilities in the Republic where African doctors can be trained, we are in principle against the establishment of yet another segregated institution for higher education in South Africa, more particularly as the establishment of this institution means the closing down of a really fine medical school at the Natal Medical School. It is a complete anomaly in this day and age, in the last quarter of the 20th century, to establish another segregated institution. We always did consider it wrong to segregate higher education in South Africa, and we still consider it wrong. The Snyman Commission emphasized in no uncertain terms that the separateness of Turfloop was one of the main reasons for the recurrent unrest at that institution, and only yesterday a Sunday newspaper carried a report which said that the rectors of the Black universities were in favour of desegregating their institutions. This, I say, is the direction in which the Government should be moving. It should be moving in the direction of opening the doors of all our universities and medical schools to suitably qualified students of all races in South Africa and to students from the neighbouring countries. All those universities who wish to open their doors should be allowed to do so. They should be allowed to open their doors to students of all races. I want to point out in this respect that even those universities which originally did not want to admit Black students are now taking them at post-graduate level. Unlikely institutions like Potchefstroom University and the Rand Afrikaans University, have announced their intention to accept post-graduate students. I believe that this trend will grow in South Africa and I believe it is eventually going to prevail in South Africa, and I think this is the direction which the Government ought to be encouraging.</p>

<p>The second objection we have is the manner in which the new Medical School is to be administered. It has been given the title of a university, but of course in practice it is going <span class="col_5901-5902" refersTo="page_0281"/>to be nothing of the kind. It will enjoy no autonomy, not even in the administration of purely academic matters. Practically every decision that is going to be taken must have the approval of the hon. the Minister. As was mentioned in the Committee Stage, the appointment of the rector, the vice-rector, and the lecturer members of the senate, the appointment, the promotion, the transfer, the secondment and the discharge of members of the staff, the admission of non-nationals, the fees payable and even when the external examiners may cease to be used, are all subject to ministerial approval.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the Minister responsible is not the hon. the Minister of National Education, as should be the case in respect of all institutions of higher education. The Minister responsible is the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education. His record, as far as the administration of institutes of higher education is concerned, would hardly earn him a medal for meritorious service. While again stressing that no one queries the need for more medical training facilities for Africans, let me say that Medunsa will not, in fact, be doing a great deal towards providing additional training facilities for doctors because <i>pari passu</i> with its establishment the Natal Medical School is to be closed down. From next year the admission of African students is to be phased out. No more first-year admissions will be permitted after the end of next year, and no more second-year students thereafter. I consider this to be a tragic and retrogressive step. What, I wonder, is the reason behind the Government&#x2019;s blind obstinacy in refusing to heed the pleas and arguments of the people who have been most concerned with the training of Black doctors for the past 25 years? I am referring, of course, to the staff of the faculty of medicine of the University of Natal in Durban. Let me add that their pleas were perforce made <i>post hoc</i> the ministerial decree to close down the medical school, because needless to say they were not consulted before the Cabinet took the decision to start the almost immediate phasing out of African admissions at the Natal Medical School, although the new medical school incidentally was, and still is, only in its planning stage. I have here a letter signed by the Dean, the Dean-elect, and 17 professors of the Natal Medical School, a letter published in the <i>South African Medical Journal</i> of 21 February 1976. In this letter it is stated, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Without prior consultation about the matter, the University of Natal has been informed by the Department of National Education of a Cabinet decision to phase out the admission of African and later Coloured and Indian students to its medical school. This decision means the destruction, in its present form, of an institution which we and our colleagues have so patiently built up over the past 25 years believing that we were making a contribution of national importance. We believe that this medical school has made a significant contribution to the good image abroad of South African medicine, not only in the calibre of its graduates and its devotion to, and understanding of, the needs of African medical education, but also in the quality of health care which it delivers and the standard of research work which it has published.</block>

<p>They also stress, of course, that they are in favour of the provision of more medical facilities for the training of Black students, but they are dead against the closing down of their institution. I believe that the professors who signed that letter may well make the proud claim which they have made, because in its quarter of a century of operation the Natal Medical School has not only graduated 216 African doctors, but it has also attracted medical men of outstanding ability, has established an international reputation and has obtained international recognition. Now this whole undertaking is to be closed down. Not only are the African students to be phased out but so are the Coloured and Indian students. Here was a marvellous opportunity for medical research in an area which contains all the major races of South Africa, an area in which original research of the highest importance has been and could continue to be carried out.</p>

<p>I want to quote the words of Prof. Malherbe who was, as we know, vice-chancellor and one-time principal of Natal University. He says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Setting up a new medical school involves more than just erecting buildings in a Bantu homeland. It involved, in the case of Natal Medical School, the creation of human relationships based on delicate negotiations <span class="col_5903-5904" refersTo="page_0282"/>with bodies like the Provincial Council, the local municipality and the Medical Association, not to mention the efforts put in by dedicated individuals. It is a tragedy that all this will be wiped out because the Minister so decrees.</block>

<p>I could not agree more with what Prof. Malherbe says. I want to point out that if the staff is upset by the Government&#x2019;s arbitrary decision to close the Natal Medical School, the students are in a state of grim hostility about it. So strongly do they feel that they have opted out of taking any part in the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Natal Medical School scheduled for later this year. I have a letter written by one of the professors, indeed the Deputy Dean of the medical school, in which he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nobody should be under any illusion about the real animosity and hostility that this plan has created among our Black students and graduates. Although they have kept publicly quiet, the hardening of their attitude and their kind of suppressed fury is seen very clearly. They simply will not co-operate with anybody White, even ourselves with whom they previously had very cordial relations. It is a very sad thing for us because these people are inevitably to be the leaders of their various communities and our earlier products were a credit to moderation and reason. These, I think, are going to be the real extremists. They have a nice word for the Cabinet plan.</block>

<p>The letter refers to the plan to close down the Natal Medical School&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They call it &#x201C;a re-settlement programme&#x201D; and, in fact, when one looks at it, that is really pretty apt.</block>

<p>I believe it is futile, both from the race relations point of view and also from the point of view of increasing significantly the number of African doctors that we will be able to produce, to carry on with this scheme. I want to expand on this for a few moments. Setting up facilities at Medunsa has been estimated, to cost R30 million spread over six years. However, the Natal Medical University admitted 73 applicant students this year and according to the Deputy Dean the intake of the medical school could be expanded first to 100 and then to 160 additional African students at a total cost of R800 000. Therefore, since with an expenditure of R30 million we are going to increase the output of South African universities in so far as Black medical students are concerned by a mere 40, it does not seem to me to be a very good proposition. What is the point of replacing a perfectly good medical school, which is internationally accepted, by a new one at vast extra cost for 40 additional medical students or, I may say, 127 if the Natal Medical School does not expand?</p>

<p>There is a further effect which I have been informed of on the three existing Bantu universities where extremely limited facilities exist for the training of science students. I am told that the number of applicants is ten times the number of places available for them and that at the present stage each practical laboratory session has to be repeated five times. These three universities will have to accommodate all the first-year African medical students who intend going on to Medunsa and therefore they will have to cut back on their numbers of ordinary science students. The new requirements of the South African Medical and Dental Council are that all medical schools should adapt the first-year science courses to the medical course. This is a new slant altogether and it is no good for the straight science courses. This means that the training of the first-year medical students at the Black universities is going to differ significantly from the training of the first-year medical students at the White medical schools. I do not believe that this is a good thing.</p>

<p>I come to my final point. The hon. the Minister did give certain reasons earlier on, but since I cannot accept them, I want to ask again why the new medical school should be established at Ga-Rankuwa. He told us there is a large hospital nearby but I say there is a large hospital at Baragwanath which is nearby Soweto which is the largest Black city south of the Sahara.</p>

<p>Why only near Soweto?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because Soweto happens to be the largest city. It has a huge hospital which is already functioning as a teaching hospital and many more students <span class="col_5905-5906" refersTo="page_0283"/>could be readily trained there. For an amount of far less than R30 million, hostels could be set up and the actual medical school itself could be established. It will be far cheaper than to start an entirely new institution out at Ga-Rankuwa which is about 40 km from Pretoria and which will not have easy accessibility for the part-time specialist staff who will have to do the teaching at that medical school. It will be difficult even for the Pretoria Medical School and I believe that it is going to be wellnigh impossible for the Witwatersrand Medical School, to supply part-time specialists for teaching purposes.</p>

<p>Also, I see from the White Paper that the medical school at Ga-Rankuwa is to be established on land owned by the S.A. Bantu Trust near the town of Ga-Rankuwa which is, of course, in the Bophuthatswana homeland. Since this land is owned by the S.A. Bantu Trust, could the hon. the Minister tell me whether it is intended to hand this over to the Bophuthatswana homeland and, if so, at what stage is it intended to do that? I want to point out that Bophuthatswana is one of the homelands which has opted for independence. The hon. the Minister proposes that this new Black medical school should serve all eight African ethnic groups. Does he think that this state of affairs will necessarily continue? Furthermore, if this land is handed over with the medical school and the hospital which will presumably be on it, does he think that the training facilities will necessarily still be open to the other seven ethnic groups after independence? I should like to know whether he has had any assurance on that count.</p>

<p>For all the reasons I have given, I want to say that we are going to oppose the Third Reading of the Bill. [Interjections.] I think it is an interesting point and I should like to know about it. What I believe we should be doing in order to increase the supply of Black doctors in South Africa, is, firstly, to expand the facilities at&#x2014;not close down&#x2014;the Durban Medical School. Secondly, I believe we should be re-opening our segregated medical schools&#x2014;that is, those that wish to reopen. This means that both the University of Cape Town and the University of Witwatersrand will immediately open their medical schools to Black trainees. I am prepared to bet that others, who were previously against this, will not be long in following suit and that they too will open their doors to Black medical students. I am referring to the other universities. Thirdly, I believe we ought to build another medical school which should be open to all suitably qualified students of all races because there is an overall shortage of medical training facilities in South Africa. And I believe that such a medical school should preferably be built in a place which is easily accessible both to students and to teaching staff.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let me begin with the last speaker, the hon. member for Houghton. I am afraid that in dealing with the standpoint of the hon. member for Houghton, we are always faced with the fundamental difference between her and us as far as matters of policy are concerned. This causes the specific issue one is dealing with to be blurred. In this case the hon. member for Houghton again phrased her speech in such general terms that the specific issue of Medunsa became rather blurred because her remarks covered a fairly wide range. Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that I shall have to err in the same direction to be able to reply to the hon. member.</p>

<p>Yes.

It would mean that even the small existing one which is quite inadequate and which is unsuitable for expansion, i.e. the one in Natal, would not be able to produce a larger number of doctors for the Bantu either. Not half a dentist or veterinary surgeon can be trained in a special institution.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s attitude to the Third Reading is utterly untenable. I should like the Bantu people of South Africa to take cognizance of it. As against that we have the attitude of the Official Opposition, an attitude I quite appreciate. I know that the Official Opposition is not very happy about this Bill. We heard their standpoints. We exchanged views quite frankly. In spite of everything&#x2014;I say &#x201C;in spite of everything&#x201D; because this is the expression I suppose they will use&#x2014;the Official Opposition sees a chance in this Bill to produce more doctors for the Bantu people in South Africa. They regard the Bill as an opportunity to create proper facilities for the training of Bantu dentists in South Africa. This is something which has never existed before. The same applies to the creation of training facilities for veterinary surgeons. In my opinion, this is a very sensible attitude which the UP is adopting. I want to express my appreciation to them for having intimated that they will not vote against this Bill. In fact, they have clearly indicated that they will support the Third Reading of this Bill. As far as I am concerned, this is a very acceptable attitude. However, I shall not allege that I have convinced the UP and that they share my views on this matter. On the contrary. To use a very well-known expression, I may say that I believe the UP has after all heard the voice of reason in connection with this matter. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Houghton has not heard it, of course. She is obstinately resisting it. It is so pathetic that whatever measure is proposed by this Government&#x2014; whether it is concerned with this proposed medical university or with anything else&#x2014;it is always violently opposed by the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member opposes everything, even if her opposition is injurious to the Bantu people. In this case her attitude is specifically injurious to the Bantu people. However, she does not care. She is against the Government just because she has to be against the Government. The hon. member for Houghton should have been an Irishwoman. She has the mentality of an Irishwoman. She is always opposed to everything that is proposed by the Government. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Houghton actually used this opportunity for emphasizing her old standpoint again, i.e. that all the existing universities should be opened to the Bantu in South Africa. She was concerned here with medical training, but she knows that she really wants this for all kinds of training. As far as she is concerned, the proposed medical university which this Bill deals with is not really necessary at all. I believe that the hon. member will not require me to reply to her on that point, because this is a matter we settled as far back as 1959. That was when the extension of the University Education Act was debated in this House. Through all the years that have passed since then, the Government has been stating its fundamental standpoint here. The hon. member for Houghton knows very well what it is, i.e. that each population group in South Africa must be provided with its own training facilities, as is the case with every nation and every country all over the world. That is why we should like to create a university of its own for every Bantu people. Nothing would have given me more satisfaction than the realization of that aspiration during my term of office as a Minister, i.e. the provision of a university of its own to each of the Bantu peoples of this country. As far as I am concerned, every Bantu people should also get its own medical training centre. However, politics, the administration of national affairs, and the development of the homelands are matters of practical reality. They have to be borne in mind. So this Government must take only those measures today and tomorrow which will be the right steps with a view to future development. This is what the Government is in fact doing in this case. It is laying the foundation here for a vast edifice with regard to the future development of all the Bantu homelands. For that reason the Government is in favour of providing separate facilities for every Bantu people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton spent a great deal of time in discussing the medical school at the University of Natal.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This is a matter which is not relevant here, strictly speaking. This Bill is not aimed against the medical school of the University of Natal. It is not a negative Bill. It is a positive Bill, a Bill creating a specific university with more facilities for medical training, as well as more and modern facilities for veterinary and dental training, in comparison with the existing facilities at the University of Natal.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton even produced personal letters here. She even mentioned the names of the people who had written the letters.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I definitely refuse to keep quiet in order to give the hon. member for Houghton an opportunity to make a speech from her seat. It is also somewhat difficult to make myself heard while she is speaking. However, I want to say to the hon. member for Houghton that in my opinion it is a reprehensible method&#x2014;and it is a method she often follows in this House&#x2014;to read out letters by other people. I, too, have received letters in connection with the medical university we are envisaging here. The hon. member would be surprised, it would send shivers down her back, if I were to tell her from whom and from where I got some of the letters. However, I am not going to use them. They are only meant for my own orientation. I do not think we should do this in a debate in this House. I do not know whether this is perhaps a typically feminine way of arguing, but in my opinion it is arguing on a personal level and as such it is not relevant.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of expanding the Natal University. I cannot argue with the hon. member about that either. I should not discuss it with her here. It is clear that the matter was investigated, not by my department, but by the Department of National Education, under which the University of Natal falls. After the matter had been investigated, we were informed of the findings, i.e. that it would not be justified financially and otherwise to make expansions on the same scale as the developments in connection with Medunsa. It is completely impractical to do this at the University of Natal. The matter has to be approached from this point of view as well, and that is what we did before we introduced the legislation. The hon. member also asked me a question which has been asked before in debates. She wanted to know why the proposed university had not been planned for a place such as Baragwanath, why it was to be erected specifically at Ga-Rankuwa. But the hon. member knows our policy standpoint in this connection. If the hon. member asks me why the medical school was not planned for Baragwanath, she might as well ask me why it was not planned for Soweto, or why Ngoya was not planned for Kwa Mashu, or why Fort Hare was not built in Langa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I did ask.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know the hon. member asked that. That is the way she thinks, that is the way her mind works. The hon. member knows our approach. For the umpteenth time I want to object to the idea of expecting us, with our policy of separate development, to think the way the integrationists on that side of the House think. This is not our approach, after all. We do not want to build universities for the Bantu peoples in the homeland of the White man, nor in the group areas of the Coloured people or the Indians. We want to establish facilities for the Bantu peoples in their own areas. Soweto is not the area of the Bantu, but of the Whites. The Bantu are in Soweto by the grace of the Whites in terms of our policy, and the hon. member ought to know that.</p>

<p>The last question of the hon. member I want to answer is related to the situation of the medical school, as I have said, on the land of the Trust. I do not know whether the hon. member did not hear this, but I added that since this was Trust land, we could make it over to the university itself at any time because the university is a body corporate which may own land or property. It says so in the Bill. I am almost sure that in the future&#x2014;we do not propose to do so for the present&#x2014;the land of the Trust will be made over to the university, so that the university, in which all the Bantu Governments will be represented by their representatives on the council&#x2014;together with us and the other parties&#x2014;will become the owner of the land. I do not want to anticipate future developments and to say what will become of the university later when the land as well as the buildings belongs to the university council. It is possible&#x2014;after all, it is <span class="col_5911-5912" refersTo="page_0286"/>conveniently situated&#x2014;that the university will be made over to Bophuthatswana. However, I cannot imagine that this would happen immediately after Botswana has become independent, because the other Bantu peoples are also involved in this matter. They are joint owners of the university. It is a university which belongs to all the Bantu peoples. Therefore I want to tell the hon. member that she asked an extremely premature question. Consequently I need not go into it any further.</p>

<p>The speaker who preceded the hon. member for Houghton was the hon. member for Vryburg. In my opinion the hon. member did everyone in this House a favour&#x2014;he certainly did me a favour, and I think the same applies to the Bantu and the people who are concerned with the university&#x2014;with the explanation he gave of the great need for the Bantu to receive veterinary training with a view to the development of stock-breeding and, if I may term it so, of the animal kingdom in the Bantu homelands. Unfortunately the hon. member did not have time to finish his speech. I want to congratulate the hon. member on the valuable contribution he made in the short time available to him. I want to convey my sincere thanks to the hon. member for Berea, who spoke first, for having supported the Third Reading of the Bill on behalf of his party. In fact, I have already responded to that.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as my hon. friend, the Chief Whip, says, the hon. member gave the Bill his support, but then he spoke against the Bill. I know the hon. member had a good deal of criticism against the Bill. To various aspects he raised various objections. I said a short while ago, not with reference to what the hon. member said, but arising from the debate up to now, that I understand the attitude of the UP. I understand that they are not happy with everything in the Bill, certainly not with all the details and certainly not with the general purport of the Bill. There are fundamental differences between them and us. However, we must nevertheless appreciate the fact that although they are dissatisfied with all kinds of things in the Bill, they do see the major point, i.e. that in passing the Bill, the Bantu people would be rendered a service, a service we cannot withhold from them. For that I want to thank the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member said&#x2014;the hon. member for Houghton said so too&#x2014;that not a single amendment moved by the Opposition parties had been accepted. The hon. member was not here when we did accept one of his amendments. Because the hon. member was not here, the hon. member for Edenvale handled the matter. The amendment I accepted was an amendment of the hon. member for Berea. For technical-political reasons, the hon. member for Edenvale was unable to move the amendment. I then took over the amendment. I want to thank the hon. member for Berea and the hon. member for Edenvale for being the fathers of the amendment in respect of which, if I may term it so, I then had to assume the role of mother.</p>

<p>So there is one amendment for which we can give the UP credit, an amendment I took over to assist the UP politically.</p>

<p>The hon. member pointed out quite rightly that in the past there had been a failure to train Bantu dentists in particular. This is a very unfortunate fact. However, I want to say to the hon. member that we have allowed Bantu persons over the years to study at certain other universities, apart from the University of Natal, such as the University of Witwatersrand and the University of Cape Town. We allowed them to study medicine at those universities. If a larger number of Bantu students had wanted to take up dentistry, we would have admitted them, if it could have been justified. If I remember correctly, we allowed one or two Bantu students to study dentistry. As far as I can remember, no students applied for admission to the veterinary faculty. The reason for this was probably that the necessary facilities were lacking. Now that the facilities are being created, hon. members on the other side will join forces with me in seeing that students do come forward to study in this direction. I want to correct the hon. member for Berea on one point, unless I misunderstood him. He said: &#x201C;The new institution will be in operation in 1982.&#x201D; However, this is not quite correct. The intention is that the new medical university near Ga-Rankuwa will begin to admit second-year students as early as 1978. This is <span class="col_5913-5914" refersTo="page_0287"/>the way it is being planned at the moment. The year after, third-year students will be admitted.</p>

<p>Then I will leave the argument there because I need not correct the hon. member. However, it was not quite correct the way it was recorded, and I had to correct the hon. member. The hon. member also referred to the figures I used in my speech. I want to give the hon. member a brief explanation of these figures again, because I think he interpreted my figures in too narrow a sense. I gave the figures regarding the number of White, Indian, Coloured and Bantu doctors that were available for serving those groups. Surely the hon. member knows as well as I do that those figures are theoretical approximations. They proceed from the assumption that the Bantu lead a completely isolated life here in South Africa, as do the Indians, the Coloureds and the Whites. But the Bantu doctors do not work only among the Bantu community, and the same applies to Indian, Coloured and White doctors. The figures I furnished would have been applicable only if the South African population had consisted exclusively of Bantu or Coloureds or Indians or Whites.</p>

<p>In practice, the position is much more favourable. I gave that favourable figure during my Second Reading speech here in this House, i.e. that for the population as a whole, there is about one doctor for every 2 000 people at the moment. The White doctors in South Africa do not serve only the Whites, and for that reason every White doctor in South Africa does not have to care for only 400 people. Every White doctor in the country is available to the whole population and in fact does more work outside than inside the White community. Basically, the same applies to the Indian and the Coloured doctors, because they too can treat patients outside their own communities. I think the hon. member must realize this. I say this because after my Second Reading speech, I saw a conclusion in a report somewhere which was based on the assumption that the figures I had furnished meant that White doctors treated only Whites, Indian doctors only Indians, Coloured doctors only Coloureds and Bantu doctors only Bantu. However, this is not the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Berea wanted to know from me whether we would allow the medical school of the University of Natal to remain open to all race groups as long as possible. However, this is a request which the hon. member should not address to me, because I have no power over that medical faculty. My department and I have investigated the matter thoroughly, together with the other Minister concerned and his department. Of course we shall watch the position very carefully. We plan to build at Ga-Rankuwa and we do not know what difficulties may arise. However, I want to assure the hon. member that we shall watch the position, but at this stage I cannot give the hon. member any further assurance. This is all I have to say in this connection. Finally, I just want to express my thanks to hon. members on both sides of the House for their contributions, for the assistance they rendered me in that way, and to the UP in particular for the support it gave to this measure.</p>
