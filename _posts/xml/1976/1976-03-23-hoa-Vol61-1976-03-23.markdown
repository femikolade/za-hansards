<heading>MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT OF HOUSE ON MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, VIZ. WIDESPREAD AND SERIOUS FLOODING</heading>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the motion printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House do now adjourn to discuss a matter of public importance, viz.: The widespread and serious flooding in large areas of the country.</block>

<p>On several occasions in the past, this House discussed serious droughts and other similar disasters in the country. Therefore it is certainly not inappropriate also to discuss, by means of a special motion, serious flooding and their effects. The serious floods which commenced last year at the start of the rainy season have already resulted in considerable loss of life. According to news reports between 20 to 30 people lost their lives during the past weekend. When natural disasters are accompanied by loss of life one&#x2019;s sympathy with the people who are affected goes even further. Therefore I think I am possibly speaking on behalf of everyone when expressing our sympathy with those who have lost relatives or friends in this tragic way. On this occasion I should also like to say that one learns with regret that considerable losses in the form of houses and other property have been suffered in recent times. Every province <span class="col_3713-3714" refersTo="page_0539"/>has since, last year, had its share of floods. With a few exceptions, <i>inter alia,</i> the Western Cape, the Boland and Namaqualand, there is hardly one district in South Africa which has not been affected by the floods. Damage has not been confined to the agricultural industry either. City dwellers and inhabitants of towns, industrialists and businessmen have also suffered considerable direct losses. One particularly thinks of the tremendous damage caused in Natal during the past few days. Any person familiar with the rainy season of this country is sceptical towards the idea that the worst is over. One can only hope that further aftereffects will be limited for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, many members of this House represent constituencies that are affected. Others have made it their business to acquaint themselves with the position in those areas which have had the worst rains and floods. My particular interest and the interest of the agricultural and natural resources group on this side of the House, have caused us to take a very serious view of the widespread floods. I have, personally, in the course of weeks visited many of the areas where the rains were excessive. Others, in turn, know those areas well and have been in contact with prominent people in all these areas.</p>

<p>The purpose behind my motion is more or less the following: Firstly, to outline to the House the extent of the damage suffered; secondly, to warn the public of South Africa that our food and fodder production can for the time being be seriously affected and, indeed, retarded&#x2014;this is a very important aim of this motion&#x2014;thirdly, to consider suggestions how best the areas that have been affected can again be made productive and, at the same time, how best to limit the effects of the floods; and, fourthly, to determine what role the authorities should play in building up the districts and rehabilitating the people concerned.</p>

<p>As I have said, I have personally visited many of these areas and have had numerous discussions, both formal and informal, with prominent people about the effects of the floods. I have had such discussions with people in the Northern Cape, in the Karoo, in the Western Transvaal and in the Orange Free State. One feature of these discussions that has struck me forcibly is that farmers would have liked to overcome this particular set-back by employing their own individual resources. However, that is just not possible. They all agreed that if they had received adequate commodity prices which allowed for the steep rise in production costs and also adequately took into account the risk factor, enough reserves would have been built up by individuals for them to cope with such emergencies themselves.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>You are playing politics now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to play politics with this matter. What I am stating, is a fact. If the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet has not had this experience, I am certain that the hon. the Minister, his Deputy and also the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs will have learnt the same if they have had discussions with farmers of the Vaal Hartz and Riet River schemes because these are the points which the farmers there have raised with me. Sir, I must just point out to you how difficult it is and has been for farmers to build up adequate reserves. Take, for example, that over the last five years, from 1970 to 1975, there has been an increase of no less than 175% in the price of dieseline, and an increase of no less than 154% in the price of petrol. In the case of tractors, the position is that with tractors of 100 h.p. the price has risen in those five years from R7 000 to close on R20 000, an increase of 171%. Sir, when they have had to cope with this sort of situation it is just impossible for farmers to build up adequate reserves to meet emergencies. When an emergency or a disaster strikes, one realizes immediately that the financial position of our farmers is not in line with the vast amount invested in farming. After all, inflation pushes up the value of land and of our resources, but it also depletes the value of our cash assets. The second feature which worries farmers in South Africa is the lack of a comprehensive plan which can be put into practice the moment a disaster strikes a particular area. All our planning&#x2014;this is what they say to us&#x2014;is done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. When a farmer has been badly hit by disaster the first thing he needs is an assurance that he will be assisted to get back on his feet again. In that respect he must have peace of mind.</p>

<p><span class="col_3715-3716" refersTo="page_0540"/>*But what do we find&#x003F; First investigations have to be made and after lengthy discussions it is said that production loans are available, precisely the same kind of assistance which is also available under normal circumstances. For that reason the farmers ask that plans should be available which could be put into effect immediately in any emergency. Over and above production loans such a plan should also provide for other matters.</p>

<p>In the first place, where damage has been caused to land, it can be brought back into production again by putting it right immediately. Where erosion, for instance, took place due to floods, it would have to be put right immediately. If the farmers do not have the necessary machinery at their disposal to do this, they should be able to obtain the necessary loans to purchase the machinery. For these repair works the Government should be prepared to pay a subsidy if we want to restore those areas to be able to produce immediately&#x2014;I am referring to the areas where physical damage has been suffered. In some irrigation areas such as the Vaalharts settlement, the area can only be made productive by carrying out large-scale drainage operations. Draining of holdings can be carried out if the necessary deposit facilities exist to dispose of the water. And what makes the situation so serious, is the fact that of the more or less 1 200 holdings in that irrigation area plus-minus 800 are today in the process of becoming water-logged and brackish.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Who is to blame for this&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not saying hon. members on that side are to blame. We said the reason why we want to have this debate, is that we can have a discussion on what should be done and what the authorities ought to do under these circumstances. [Interjections.] Sir, the garden of the hon. member for Stilfontein has not even washed away. Therefore I do not know why he is becoming so agitated now. The Department of Water Affairs should create the necessary deposit facilities and then leave it to the individual plot owners to continue the drainage on their plots themselves. We know it is a fact that with the rising of the water level due to the irrigation methods, it would in any case have been necessary to expedite the draining of the whole scheme. No one can allow the production of that area, which is an intensive agricultural area, with 1 200 plots and a turnover of R30 million, to drop to zero. Therefore, something drastic should be done. It has become imperative for steps to be taken, and the Department of Water Affairs and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services will have to take immediate steps to restore this area. The same applies to the Riet River settlement scheme. These are both intensive agricultural production areas and they ought not to be unproductive for long. One should realize that many farmers, not only those on the irrigation schemes, but also in the dry land areas of the Western Transvaal and the Free State, are going to have very poor maize, groundnut and sunflower crops this year. They are entering a period of no income and heavy expenses. And we find that bank credit has already been curtailed for various reasons. We on this side believe that this approach should be reconsidered in respect of these people. Furthermore, they should also be afforded extraordinary credit facilities by the Land Bank and by the Department of Agricultural Credit. Far more assistance will have to be provided to these people. Consider the position of the maize farmer of the Western Transvaal. Large areas there are water-logged. Where there has never been any water before, one pan after the other is filled with water now. Even homes and labourer cottages have been hit. One asks oneself what could be done about this.</p>

<p>Sir, this water will have to be pumped away into side streams and rivers so that drainage could be speeded up considerably. If this is not done, large areas will be unproductive for one or longer season. I do not want to estimate the extent of the damage throughout the country, because this would require an intensive study. It could amount to hundreds of millions of rands and even more, but all the authorities of the agricultural departments concerned and of Water Affairs will have to put their heads together, and I hope the hon. members who have so much to say on that side of the House will avail themselves of this opportunity to tell us what they have done, and to indicate what they are still going to do in future. They know, for example, that there is hardly any fertilizer left in the soil as a result of these tremendous rains. Practically everything has been washed out. This is going to be an enormously expensive process to restore the fertility of the <span class="col_3717-3718" refersTo="page_0541"/>soil. What do the hon. members on that side of the House have to say now&#x003F; Are they going to sit back and allow the price of fertilizers to be further increased in future for these people who will have to use two or three times as much as in the past&#x003F; Sir, we shall have to see to it that extension services are provided to save these areas from deterioration. This has become imperative, because we do not want to create white elephants anywhere. South Africa simply cannot afford this. Whether the climatic conditions are changing, is also an important question. Rumours are being spread by so-called experts that this is in fact the case, and if this is true, I suggest that the experts ought to investigate the matter, because we shall then have to make essential adjustments in our agricultural industry in these areas.</p>

<p>But, finally, what is still the most important aspect to me, is how to restore the confidence of that farmer, who has been severely hit, in order to continue his task. We should prevent farmers from leaving agriculture as a result of setbacks. After every drought or disaster people leave agriculture. It is the wish of us on this side of the House that the effects of this disaster, which has hit so many areas of South Africa, will be limited to the minimum. However, everything will depend on the urgency and earnest with which the authorities, the responsible Minister, are prepared to approach this task. If there is any lack of purposeful action, it can cause the agricultural industry and the economy of South Africa permanent damage. It is for that reason that I asked for a discussion of the matter here in Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I really have heard better speeches before from the hon. member for Newton Park than the one he made today. While I was listening to him, one thing became very clear to me. He told of all the people he spoke to and where he had travelled during the past few days, weeks and months. However, one thing is quite clear and that is that the people who represent those farmers do not sit on that side of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if a person could suggest here that prices of products should be increased in order to be able to help these people, I ask how one would be able to tell this to the people of, for example, Rietrivier. These are people who have lost 80% of their groundnut crop, 60% of their maize harvest, 85% of their cotton harvest, and I could continue to mention their losses in this way. What is the use of increasing the price of products when the producer has nothing to sell&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I shall presently tell the hon. member what the Government is doing about it. However, this has nothing to do with the prices. Therefore, when the hon. member for Newton Park suggests that, when there is physical destruction&#x2014;soil erosion, floods, dams and fences which are washed away&#x2014;a subsidy has to be paid, I want to tell him that a subsidy is indeed paid.</p>

The hon. member spoke about Rietrivier. That is my constituency. Over the past three years the hon. the Minister of Agriculture has been there twice to make a special inquiry into conditions in that area. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture was also there twice. The previous Minister of Water Affairs was there twice; the present hon. the Minister of Water Affairs has also been there. The hon. member for Newton Park suggested things here which are already being done at Rietrivier. [Interjections.] Those things are already being done there, and I want to say &#x2026; [Interjections.] Please give me a chance. The hon. the Ministers did not go there alone; they were accompanied by three secretaries of departments&#x2014;the Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services, the Secretary for Agricultural Credit and the Secretary for Water Affairs&#x2014;as well as by the other technical officers who were necessary to investigate the whole matter. Now the hon. member for Newton Park suggests that facilities have to be created so that these things can immediately be put into operation after disaster. Does the hon. member expect the State to put these things into operation and simply spend money without inquiring into it beforehand&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Do you have a solution for stopping the rain&#x003F; [Interjections.] The hon. member was unable to stop the rain in Port Elizabeth. The only possible way out for him is perhaps to move to Israel. [Interjections.] My constituency consists of two areas. There are the irrigation areas, and there is the rest of the constituency, an area which is plagued by gnats and mosquitoes. This is a plague which arose as a result of the large amount of water which has dammed up in the area. Besides that, the farmers are plagued by diseases on a large scale. Now the hon. members will once again ask what we are doing about it. These problems have existed for the past three years, and during those three years so much assistance has been provided and so much research has been done, especially in the field of rift valley fever and the plague of gnats, that this year, in spite of all the rain&#x2014;we have not experienced so many problems with rift valley fever and with Wesselsbron disease as was previously the case. Therefore progress has been made in these spheres. I previously mentioned that we experience problems due to the shortage of veterinary surgeons. You are aware of the problems, Sir, which the hon. the Minister experiences in this respect.</p>

<p>However, I can mention with gratitude that this year a start has been made with the training of double the ordinary number of veterinary surgeons at Onderstepoort. We can therefore face the future with the prospect that relief is also forthcoming in this sphere. Thanks to the sound advice we received from Onderstepoort, as well as the quantities of vaccine which could be made available to the farmers, animals could be vaccinated in time. Consequently the losses due to rift valley fever, blue tongue and other stock diseases were not so acute this year.</p>

<p>However, one&#x2019;s heart bleeds for the people on the irrigation holdings, people who have no other income. It is possible to possess a large farm and perhaps lose one&#x2019;s entire maize crop. However, if one has livestock, one may carry on. The hon. member referred to Vaalharts. Other hon. members will speak about that later.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to Rietrivier. When hon. members ask what is being done about problems there, I consider these to be stupid questions. The hon. the Ministers were there, accompanied by all the departmental secretaries, <span class="col_3721-3722" refersTo="page_0543"/>and the problems of all the farmers at Rietrivier were discussed. That Thursday afternoon all the people were quite happy and satisfied. However, on Friday afternoon, 112 mm of rain fell once again and everything was washed away. Hon. members must not ask such stupid questions now, among other things, what is being done about those problems. The situation also exists that, even the heavy machinery which the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs had brought from the P. K. le Roux Dam to help with the draining, is standing there idle and cannot be moved. The amount of mud is so immense that draining has become impossible. These Ministers went out of their way, and I believe they will also go out of their way in future.</p>

<p>In the short time available to me I want to ask that the procedure concerning applications for loans will be streamlined so that people will obtain crop loans more easily. I ask that the loans should not be repayable in one year, but that it would be possible to spread them over four years. I think that the co-operative societies are the bodies or persons that will best be able to exercise control over the loans. I also want to thank the hon. the Minister that a number of the holdings which have not become water-logged in that area, have been made available to the people who were hit most severely so that they can farm there in the meantime in order to support their families in this manner. In conclusion, I should like to ask that we should do everything possible to provide the people whose holdings have been damaged to such an extent that they will be unable to cultivate them in future, with work elsewhere in the meantime. Here I am especially thinking of the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, and I should like to know whether he could possibly accommodate them in the Orange River development area.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that the first speaker on the Government benches to reply to the hon. member for Newton Park should have taken the line that he did. The hon. member for Newton Park, with great restraint and responsibility, I thought, dealt with a serious situation which is affecting the country as a whole. He dealt with it constructively. The hon. member for Fauresmith has, in effect, said that the hon. member for Newton Park has come here to play politics with the misfortunes of others. That was an unworthy remark to make and it was not in accordance with what the hon. member said. I am, indeed, fortified in that criticism by the arguments of the hon. member for Fauresmith himself who, as I understood him, said that there had for three years been excessive rains and wet seasons, that for three years there had been bad crops or no crops at all, and that for three years there had been problems associated with stock disease and an excess of insect pests. It appears quite clearly from his own arguments that the Government has dealt with these matters each time on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and that long-term planning to meet contingencies of this kind, which we know arise seasonally from time to time, does not appear to be adequate. As I understood it, that was the very argument that was advanced by the hon. member for Newton Park.</p>

<p>I rise in the 10 minutes that are available to me to deal principally with the situation in Natal which, as hon. members will have seen from the Press, is very serious indeed. Firstly, what has happened&#x003F; We have had, at the end of a summer season, in which there have already been exceptionally good rains, an exceptionally heavy downpour over a period of two days and three nights. On my own property, from Thursday night until Saturday night, we had 11 inches of rain. When that situation arises on ground that is already wet, you are in for a tough time. It is not an exaggeration to say that there has been brought about, as a result of this, in Natal, throughout the province but in the coastal areas particularly, indescribable devastation to property and a heavy loss of life. The figure already stands at 25 dead, and I have no doubt that others will be found in the more remote areas when the waters subside. Major bridges have come down, and I have in mind the Illovo bridge on the national freeway to the south of Durban. There are numerous landslides impeding communications. I have in mind the 12 landslides on the new six-lane freeway from Durban to Pinetown, a distance, I suppose, of 15 to 20 miles. There are many main roads cut as a result of this. Water mains have been undermined and are bursting, telephone cables have been broken, communications have been disrupted, and what is more important, whole communities have been uprooted. I have in mind the so-called &#x201C;tin town&#x201D; on the Spring-field Flats within the municipal area of Durban. There is also grave industrial loss <span class="col_3723-3724" refersTo="page_0544"/>with premises flooded out, up and down the coast, to a remarkable extent. Agriculturally the matter has been dealt with by the mover of the motion, but there is large-scale inundation of low-lying farmlands, particularly on the north coast, and there is what one can describe as devastation of crops, particularly winter feed crops in the high-lying areas of Natal as well. I do not propose to elaborate on what the mover has said as to what that means. If there are no winter crops you cannot feed the stock, and if you cannot feed the stock, there is an immediate shortage of meat, dairy produce and milk.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I have noticed that the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs smiles &#x2026; [Interjections.] There is also great loss to the Government agencies of various kinds, the provincial authorities and the local authorities. That is what has taken place, and the next question is: What can be done about it&#x003F; The first requirement is an immediate top-level investigation to assess the damage and the loss of life, and to assess what can be done to help. I suppose the burden will fall principally on the hon. the Minister of Community Development and of Indian Affairs. I can assure him that he will have the utmost assistance from the Provincial Administration and the local authorities, particularly the municipality of Durban.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>We are aware of that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that he is aware of that and I am glad of it. A great deal has been done by those authorities up to the present time.</p>

<p>The next point is: What immediate emergency assistance is required&#x003F; From the floods which we have had on the north coast a year or two ago, we know that what is required are tents for emergency housing, blankets to keep the people warm, clothing, cooking facilities, transport and medical help and medicines. If those can be provided as a matter of immediately priority, then we are making progress. In the third place, the Government must act in a manner which rallies the local population. I notice that the Durban Corporation have already contributed the sum of R50 000 to the disaster fund launched by the mayor of Durban. I can say from my own knowledge&#x2014;the hon. member for Umhlanga, who I notice is not here, was intimately involved in it&#x2014;that after the floods we had in the Stanger area a year or two ago, the assistance, following upon the assistance from the Government, of the local people, in the sense of money, food, clothing, transport and willing workers, was quite remarkable. They came forward in a voluntary effort to such an extent that in a short while it had to be made known to the local people that no further help from those sources was required. That is the third field in which I believe the hon. the Minister can move and in which he can motivate help from the voluntary organizations.</p>

<p>I should like to pay tribute in passing to what has been done by the various arms of the civil defence in this tragedy. All reports indicate that in the Durban area and in the Pinetown complex their contribution has been noteworthy. To those who have taken the trouble to interest themselves in this, a word of thanks is due.</p>

<p>In the longer term&#x2014;and I speak particularly so far as the urban areas are concerned&#x2014;what should be done&#x003F; I think the main priority&#x2014;and this falls into the lap of the hon. the Minister of Community Development&#x2014;is the need to move the people permanently from the low-lying riverine areas where they are living in slum conditions, because this happens over and over again, particularly in the low-lying areas along the Umgeni River. I pause here, Sir, to say that it is not a particularly angry river any more, because it has two major dams on its course to impede the flow of flood-waters. Nevertheless, every 10 years or so it breaks through that area and thousands of people&#x2014;the estimate is of the order of 4 000 at the present time&#x2014;lose virtually everything in the flood-waters. They lose what pitifully few possessions they have. Their shanty buildings are swept away or damaged, and then you have the problem of looting when these people evacuate the area and the ne&#x2019;er-do-wells move in to rob them of what little is left. The only permanent solution to this is to move the settled population from <span class="col_3725-3726" refersTo="page_0545"/>those areas for good and all. I hope the hon. the Minister will give his attention to that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must say the hon. member who has just sat down, acted far more responsibly in this debate than did the hon. member for Newton Park. The hon. member acted more responsibly because to my mind, he was better informed on the subject he discussed than was the hon. member for Newton Park. The hon. member for Newton Park was kind enough to come and tell me, after he had visited the Western Transvaal, that he had also visited my constituency. Sir, if a member of the United Party pays a visit to my constituency, I always go back on his tracks a little, because I do not trust the United Party an inch. I then did the same as the hon. member for Newton Park did, and the information I obtained was obviously much more correct than his information. He hardly spent 24 hours in the Western Transvaal, and now he is pretending to be an authority on the flood damage in the Western Transvaal.</p>

<p>I should like to tell that hon. member that before he was even aware that there had been any flood damage in the Western Transvaal, I had already travelled through those parts. At that stage I had already been in contact with the various departments. Before the hon. member had been in those parts I had already flown over that area at my own expense and ascertained what damage had been caused. That hon. member can therefore forget about trying to make political capital out of a disaster like this one which has struck the Western Transvaal and other parts of this country. The hon. member told me that he was going to move a motion of this kind. He told me personally that he was not going to play politics with this motion. Once again I must say that I am disappointed, because the pattern followed has been precisely the same as the pattern followed by him in respect of the seven-year droughts which ravaged the Karoo. Was it not that hon. member who came up with a motion of this kind at that time too&#x003F; Sir, the members of the United Party should not try to catch us in such an obvious trap with a motion of this kind. If those hon. members really want to be serious, what they ought to be &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point should rather go and see how the United Party supporters are drowning in Durban. When we look at the flood damage in the Western Transvaal, it is very clear that the damage is on a vast scale. Morally or ethically speaking, it is perhaps not quite right to say this, but these flood damages have accumulated for three years as a result of excessive rain. This followed excessive rains in 1974 and 1975, rains which have now reached a peak in 1976. In former years action was taken in this regard by the Government, and especially by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. This is why the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure exists, and it is senseless for that hon. member and the member who followed him in this debate to say that the Government acts on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. In the Western Transvaal we approached the hon. Minister and the secretaries for the departments as far back as 1974, when there was flood damage in the vicinity of Hartebeesfontein. In that year we received the assistance of the departments. We did not ask for charity, because the farmers are not interested in charity. The farmers want to be helped to help themselves. We approached the department and proposed that we be given production loans, but that we should not be forced to repay those loans within a year. The hon. the Minister and his department considered all those requests favourably, and today those farmers are producing. In 1974 and 1975, when we suffered flood damages, we did not hear from the hon. member for Newton Park. However, now there is a by-election in Durban North and an election for them to lose in Alberton, and now they should at least pay a visit to the platteland. After all, friend Harry, who abandoned the &#x201C;deep&#x201D; platteland, is no longer there. The hon. member now wants to try to visit the &#x201C;deep&#x201D; rural areas again.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to be more serious now and leave the members of the United Party as far as this debate is concerned, because they only annoy one with their opportunistic politics. Since the hon. the Minister of Community Development is also present today &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am going to come up with very constructive proposals, including proposals relating to measures which are already in use and which we want to improve. I would like to tell the hon. the Minister, in the presence of the hon. the Minister of Community Development, that in 1974 and 1975 we had experience of what it means when an area is declared a disaster area. I want to say in all honesty that it only means something to those who live in urban areas when an area is declared a disaster area, because a farmer cannot claim anything from the Department of Community Development in respect of damage on his farm, except as far as his dwelling house is concerned. We should streamline our ideas and policy concerning disaster funds a little more. When we consider the situation of the farmer&#x2014;and I am now referring especially to the farmers between the Vaal Dam and the Vaalharts diversion dam, we find that if damage is caused to his irrigation equipment and/or his irrigation area, the Department of Water Affairs is responsible. Now we come to the really senseless aspect, i.e. that if this water pump has been damaged, Water Affairs is responsible for that, but if the pump building is damaged then the Department of Community Development is responsible for that. We get the situation that the farmer may only go to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services if his land, fencing, etc., has been damaged. I want to ask that where we have to deal with a disaster situation, we should not subject our farming community to this filling in of forms. Some farmers have to fill in up to four or five sets of forms to try and obtain compensation for the same damage. I think we should really give serious consideration to viewing the farmer&#x2019;s crop in the same light as the Department of Community Development views the dealer&#x2019;s stock-in-trade when he loses it and is paid out for it. Like the dealer, the farmer should be paid out for the loss of his harvest, because the harvest he has lost represents his stock-in-trade, just as the trader has a stock-in-trade. By taking a step of this kind, we should be making matters much easier for our farming community. We shall probably have to consider the fact that since we have had quite excessive rains for three years, we are bow probably going to have a situation in which we shall even have to withdraw soil from our dry land areas for the sake of soil reclamation. We should regard a situation of this kind in the same light as the stock withdrawal scheme, in <span class="col_3729-3730" refersTo="page_0547"/>terms of which livestock is withdrawn to reclaim the soil and grazing. We should consider adopting the same method in order to reclaim our agricultural land. The damage to crops in my constituency is between 30% and 40%. This represents vast crop losses. However, I am afraid the damage done to our soil is much greater than this. The time and expense involved in reclaiming this is great, and for that reason we shall possibly have to pay more attention to this particular matter.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs and the hon. the Minister of Agriculture whether they could not agree to our making use of DDT again under permit in the Vaal River, in the area of the Vaalharts Scheme, for a spray capable of dealing with the gnat plague in that area. This is the only really effective method available at the moment. I also want to tell the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs that we should have a completely new policy in respect of the Bloemhof Dam. It is unnecessary for us to follow the same policy in respect of the Bloemhof Dam as we do in respect of the Vaal Dam; i.e. a policy of always full because we are afraid that there may be a drought tomorrow. The Bloemhof Dam is only there to meet the water requirements of the Vaalharts scheme, and even if that dam were only 33% full, it could meet the water requirements of the Vaalharts scheme for three years. Therefore I do not think it is necessary to follow a policy of &#x201C;always full&#x201D; in respect of the Bloemhof Dam. We could make much better use of that dam in the flood control situation by maintaining it at a lower percentage throughout the year, in order to provide for a possible flood. This would cause the agricultural damages below the Bloemhof Dam to be so much more limited.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to place this important motion in a slightly different dimension. Fortunately, I do not come from one of the devastated areas of our country, nor do I represent one. I grew up in an area where droughts were a far greater danger than floods. However, in spite of this, I fully realize the implications of such a disaster. I should like to draw attention to its non-agricultural aspects, because the consequences of this disaster go much further than agriculture. The implications affect not only individuals and their possessions, but also the economy of the country as a whole, particularly as far as the export of produce and the production of food are concerned. We in these benches should like to express our sympathy with the families and individuals in those areas, those people who have suffered as a result of the flood, and, even worse, have lost relatives and friends.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Floods have a rather recurrently fluid place in South African history, and to me, who has tried to bend my mind to the problem in these past few days, it is astonishing that there appears to be no permanent machinery in existence to give relief when it is most urgently needed, when the disaster has struck. I am not trying to make any political capital out of it, because I do not think it is the fault of any particular Government. I think it is something that should have been put right generations ago.</p>

<p>I am particularly thinking here of non-agricultural interests. To show hon. members what a regular occurrence these disasters are, I find that the first recorded flood in South Africa took place in 1790, when the Orange River attained a width of several miles. Thirty years later, in 1820, floods caused such havoc in the Western Cape that the British Government had to give &#x00A3; 100 000 for relief and added &#x00A3;25 000 to repair churches and public buildings. In those days 25 houses and one church were damaged in Somerset West. I mention these facts simply to show that floods have occurred all over the country, down the years. They have happened in the Eastern Cape and in Natal, where I see that in 1856, elephants were swept into the sea down the Umgeni River after 686 mm of rain in four days. I am glad to say that Natal has been spared this in the past couple of weeks! There are places like Mafeking, Bloemfontein and Standerton which have had floods. In actual fact, there is no area in South Africa that has not periodically and very regularly been visited by these disasters. There is therefore nothing new in what has happened in the last couple of months, except perhaps in the intensity and extent of the tragedy of what has happened. In spite of the regular occurrence of all these things it seems, as far as I can find, that there is no special machinery to deal with these tragedies as they occur. We know funds are periodically established. For instance, one comes across the Central Boland Disaster <span class="col_3731-3732" refersTo="page_0548"/>Committee in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report of last year. This committee was appointed after the 1969 earthquakes and spent R8 million. The Centre Flood Disaster Committee of 1974, which was brought into being after the country-wide floods in February and March of that year, has a balance of over R2 million after having spent almost a similar amount in providing relief and financial assistance to the victims of the floods.</p>

<p>My point is that there are these funds and bodies, but as far as one can find out, there is no one centrally consolidated fund to deal with these problems as they arise, whether it be the result of storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc. This House should ask itself whether there should not be some permanent machinery which can go into action without any delay to administer funds and to take other necessary action in these kind of emergencies. Experience has shown that relief and aid is always given in due course. The compassion of the public manifests itself without any doubt, but it is immediate relief that is needed and this should be met by permanent machinery. As the hon. mover of this motion has mentioned, <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements are all very well and are usually made, but surely in an ordered society something far more permanent and longer ranging is needed. Does the Government have any specific plans in this regard&#x003F; I ask this because it seems to me as if there is an urgent need to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>Let us come nearer to the floods themselves. Since this is a country that we in the Free State call &#x201C;&#x2019;n land van buitensporighede&#x201D;, it is surely necessary that, for instance in the planning of towns or new townships for Whites as well as non-Whites, we should start from the assumption that floods or some other natural disaster are more than simply an outside possibility. Should there not be some kind of inquiry as to why it so often happens that townships are allowed to be built below flood level&#x2014;and here I am thinking of places like Vereeniging &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I am very happy to hear that, but we still have the situation at places like Vereeniging, Standerton and elsewhere along the Orange River where such townships exist. It is also the case, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana said, in large areas of Durban where this kind of thing has happened. It should never have been allowed to happen. What one would like to know now is whether there is any kind of supervision, in the planning of such residential areas, to ensure that flooding will not affect the lives of people. Similar considerations, I submit, apply to the planning and construction of roads and bridges. Anyone who has seen pictures, in the past couple of weeks, of roads and bridges washed away in the Western Transvaal will know what I mean. It seems to me that we too often work on the assumption that rains will be normal, whereas we know that too often the exception tends to become the rule.</p>

<p>What I should like to know, and what I think this House is entitled to know, is who is finally responsible for ensuring safety levels in this kind of situation. Is there not, a case to be made out for supervision of this kind of construction, particularly with floods in mind and also particularly in areas that we know are prone to this kind of disaster&#x003F; What tests are, in fact, applied when bridges and roads are being built&#x003F; Who lays down standards and who enforces them&#x003F; Is this done by individual local authorities or regional authorities&#x003F; Is there, moreover, any kind of overall supervision&#x003F; My point is a very simple one. We have the evidence of more than a century to prove that floods occur with almost predictable regularity over large parts of South Africa, and from that I therefore argue that there should be special and specific machinery to cope with the problems of the aftermath with the minimum delay, because that is when the need is really greatest. We know full well&#x2014;as has been said here this afternoon&#x2014;that local and regional authorities, including the Department of Social Welfare, the Police, the Army and civil defence do come to the aid of the hapless victims and they often render splendid service. However, I submit that all this effort needs co-ordination and special planning by somebody whose job it is. It must not simply emerge in a sudden emergency. My argument is that something ordered and planned is needed if we are going to&#x2014;as we should&#x2014; avoid needless suffering and hardship.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, provision has already been made by means of legislation, for many of the things <span class="col_3733-3734" refersTo="page_0549"/>requested by the hon. member for Parktown. Only last year legislation was introduced to ensure that people did not build houses in the low-lying parts of rivers, and so on. I shall not take this matter any further. I should like to emphasize that hon. members on this side of the House are deeply conscious of the vast losses which individuals, communities and the country as a whole are suffering and are still going to suffer because it is still raining. It is quite interesting that the hon. member for Newton Park gave notice of this motion as early as last week, but the major rains only occurred over the weekend. I wonder whether he is grateful for that. However, I have not heard from one hon. member opposite&#x2014;nor from the hon. member for Newton Park who has travelled the world so extensively&#x2014;that he had noticed that there had been blessings, too, resulting from these excessive rains of the past three years. Owing to the rain our grazing lands are better than they have been for years. Furthermore, our subterranean water resources have been replenished to an incalculable extent. In my part of the world, approximately 100 000 ha grazing were destroyed by fire during autumn and if it had not been for these excessive rains there might have been reason for the hon. member to discuss the matter in this House as a matter of public importance. However, what is the aim of this motion&#x003F; I should like to express my conviction that this is an extremely transparent effort to catch a political fish in the muddy flood waters for selling in Durban North and Alberton. [Interjections.] In 1974, too, we had floodwaters. At that time, too, there had been excessive rains. In certain parts of my constituency it rained more in 1974 than it did now. We had much worse flood damage then than now along the various major rivers. However, then they were not regarded as being conditions of public importance to which attention had to be called by means of a motion in this House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. M. VAN A. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>This was not only the case in 1974. I shall go further back and point out that such a serious drought prevailed in the country in 1966 that more than 800 farmers of the Vaalharts scheme were unable to reap a crop. As a result the Government was forced to pay out an amount of more than R1,3 million to them. These were oppressive circumstances of public importance; however, the hon. member for Newton Park was not concerned about them then. At that time he did not introduce a motion in the House stating that it was of public importance. While the hon. member is travelling around looking at the damage caused by an excess of water in the interior, he should bear in mind that he is chairman of the committee whose business it is to know that the hon. member&#x2019;s own area, the Southern Cape, was experiencing one of the gravest droughts in many years. Is the hon. member not aware of that drought, and does he not know that it has only now been broken&#x003F; However, it did not rain grass. Does he not consider this matter, too, to be of public importance&#x003F; Is it not necessary for him to wonder in that respect as well how our people are to be fed and what the price of food will be as a result of the drought&#x003F; It is senseless and heartless to go and see how people are having problems caused by too much water and not look at one&#x2019;s own region where people are having problems caused by too little water. We should really maintain our balance. For these reasons I can only come to the conclusion that this is cheap politicking. A party must really be politically bankrupt when it seeks to make a political capital out of circumstances such as these which are beyond our control.</p>

<p>I also regard this motion as a means to discredit the Government by implying that the ministers concerned are unsympathetic towards the situation. What are the facts&#x003F; On 21 January the then Minister of Water Affairs, together with the most senior officials of his department, paid a visit to Vaalharts. He also went to view the situation at Delareyville as well as the whole Harts River area as far as the Spitskop Dam. He instructed his officials to deal with the situation without delay so that immediate relief could be afforded. What is more, a team of three officials of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure not only visited the area on the same day, but carried out a thorough investigation of the needs of the farmers throughout the area and how relief could be afforded them by means of recommendations to the Minister of Agriculture. On 11 March the hon. the Ministers of Agriculture and of Water Affairs, as well as the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, visited that area in the company of the most <span class="col_3735-3736" refersTo="page_0550"/>senior officials and had consultations with the farmers, listened to complaints and heard and saw what their problems were. Only last night the hon. the Minister of Community Development announced that his officials had been instructed to go at once and ascertain the extent of the damage caused by the floods, with a view to distress relief. What do the hon. members expect to be done over and above what I have spelled out as having been done by the hon. Ministers&#x003F; Allow me on this occasion to convey my sincere thanks to the hon. the Ministers and the officials for what they have done and are still going to do.</p>

<p>How do the farmers&#x2014;I am not referring to the braaivleis farmers&#x2014;and our communities in general, regard the situation&#x003F; I should like to pay tribute to those people immediately for their fine attitude in difficult circumstances. I want to emphasize very strongly that the farmers of my constituency and the farmers of South Africa are not asking for or expecting charity from the Government. What do they expect&#x003F; They ask for a sympathetic understanding of the problems they are faced with in exteremely difficult circumstances. They are satisfied that they are getting that sympathetic understanding from the Government. They also ask the Government for financial support so that they may carry on their farming activities with self-respect once again after the disasters have passed. The irrigation farmers ask that their land be saved. The requests of the farmers are being attended to and we are busy meeting those requests. However, I am not going to elaborate on this; the hon. the Ministers will do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was interested to hear not only what the hon. member for Kimberley North has had to say this afternoon, but all hon. members who have so far spoken from the Government benches. It has been quite amusing to hear the reaction of these hon. members. We have now been accused of &#x201C;goedkoop politiekery&#x201D;. These hon. members see politics in every drop of rain that falls. [Interjections.] We have learnt that in South African we have a very inconsistent rainfall. Our seasons have always been inconsistent unlike those of many other countries, but we still lack long-term planning designed to meet all emergencies. We do not need to work on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. We realize and appreciate that nobody can be held responsible for acts of God and that is not what we are accusing the Government of. We know that a drought comes and that nobody can be held responsible. We have floods, tornadoes and fires which are all acts of God. We have seen this before. Despite all these facts, one thing is certain, if we are going to continue the way we are, there is going to be famine in South Africa by the year 2000.</p>

<p>Just the other day we had the pleasure of seeing a short film which was presented by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Some of us were lucky to be presented with a very nice book, too. The theme of the short film was &#x201C;Food for Thought&#x201D;. It certainly gave us food for thought. We have seen how desperately we are in need of food and also how much food is being wasted, not only in this country, but throughout the world. Few people appreciate this. We shall have to teach the younger generation how to conserve and appreciate good, healthy food.</p>

<p>I have mentioned certain inconsistencies. A few years ago this House passed a Bill legalizing weather modification. In terms of that law people who wish to induce rain to fall, have to obtain a licence to do so. I believe we shall soon have to think in terms of issuing licences to people to disperse clouds and do away with rain where necessary. In 1970 I witnessed a flood in East London where 44 inches of rain fell in 36 hours. What is more, only one large cloud was responsible for that flood.</p>

<p>During the latest emergency there have been floods in all four provinces. Indeed, at this very moment floods are being experienced in all four provinces. Strangely enough, the Western Cape has not been affected. In all four provinces heavy crop losses have resulted, as the hon. the Minister knows. Those of us who have travelled around the country have witnessed the damage. The country has suffered food losses as well. Let me quote the headlines that appeared in just three newspapers recently: &#x201C;Soaking rain threatens the Orange Free State and Northern Cape&#x201D;; &#x201C;Havoc in Flood areas&#x2014;Western Transvaal and Northern Cape&#x201D;; and &#x201C;Shortages and Drama as rain lashes the country&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Newton Park for having had the foresight today to discuss this very urgent matter. I look upon the reaction of hon. members on the other side as &#x201C;sour grapes&#x201D; because we <span class="col_3737-3738" refersTo="page_0551"/>happen to have taken the initiative; we have taken the matter seriously and we have come here with concrete and constructive suggestions.</p>

<p>If hon. members opposite knew that the country was in dire need of help, why did they not introduce this matter earlier, why did they have to wait for the official Opposition to raise this matter by way of a motion&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I have mentioned that we have suffered heavy crop losses. In many areas where farmers have been able to cultivate their land and plant their seed&#x2014;I am thinking of an area such as the Eastern Cape where I myself farm&#x2014;most of the seed has not germinated, but has drowned. Where the seed has germinated, the crops have drowned. In the Orange Free State we have recently seen maize which should be standing six foot or seven foot high, but which was only two foot or two foot six inches high&#x2014;a complete loss. We have seen wheat crops lost. We have seen oats and barley drowned. We have also seen well-established lucerne drowned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the floods have caught the agricultural industry at a time when the Reserve Bank has placed credit restrictions on commercial banks. In other words, to put it plainly, this emergency has caught the agricultural industry with its pants down. The hon. member for Kimberley North said the farmers were prepared to pay for the losses. Of course they are, but where are they going to find the money if we in this House do not provide them with it&#x003F;</p>

<p>These are nice words. I have always liked them! However, what will be the use of going to the department for a loan if they do not have the money&#x003F; We on this side of the House suggest that on 31 March the hon. the Minister of Agriculture must not ask, but tell the hon. the Minister of Finance that he must provide enough funds for Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure to be able to lend money to the farmers to repair the damage. The farmers are prepared to pay. We know the rates of interest are minimal. The farmer does not wany anything for nothing. They have learnt to pay for everything they have been able to get from either the Land Bank or the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. However, if by August or September this year, when the rains have stopped and the soil has dried sufficiently for the damage to be repaired, the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure and the Land Bank then turn around and say &#x201C;Jammer, Meneer, maarons het nie meer geld nie&#x201D;, this Government will never hear the end of it. I want to tell the hon. member for Kimberley North that we want long-term planning to be undertaken in order that the farmers may repair the damage which has been done. If such long-term planning is not undertaken, we are going to find that farmers are going to leave the land, and this we cannot allow. Surely, we have to keep the farmer on the land no matter what it costs.</p>

<p>The heavy rains have washed out the crops. The fertility of the soil has been lost temporarily. Fertilizer which is another important and expensive ingredient in agriculture has been washed out of the soil&#x2014;and into the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam, and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.</p>

<p>There is another problem which points to an inconsistency in agriculture. Why should an agriculturalist, when acquiring a new tractor tyre, find that he must pay R400 for the tyre, while if he goes to another village or town he can purchase the same tyre for R200&#x003F; Why should there be such a variation&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>This is the problem. And hon. members are prepared to let this state of affairs continue. We believe that all these factors should be taken into account in the long-term planning. Why, too, <span class="col_3739-3740" refersTo="page_0552"/>should maize seed be so expensive&#x003F; Why has the price of maize seed risen by 21%&#x003F; Here, again, the farmer will have to go to the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure to raise a loan to buy maize seed which, as I have said, has gone up by another 21%. We must find a means of keeping the farmer on the land so that we can produce the food required for our rapidly increasing population. By the end of this century South Africa will experience an annual grain shortage of more than 7,5 million tons. We shall also by then have to import approximately two million tons of vegetables to meet our local demand in South Africa. As hon. members know, even today we are importing red meat from South West Africa and neighbouring States. By the year 2020 the population of South Africa will have increased to more than 81 million people, and already we cannot meet the demand. This means that the agricultural industry of South Africa will have to double its production within the next quarter century. This requires long-term planning and no <i>ad hoc</i> decisions.</p>

<p>At present, while the cost of production has from 1960-&#x2019;75 more than doubled, while crop production has increased by 37%, South Africa is having to import about 25% of its red meat requirements from South West Africa and from neighbouring States. We must be positive. We on this side of the House want to be positive. We have made suggestions. I have already suggested assistance from Agricultural Credit, and there are many other ways in which to do long-term planning. It was only a few years ago that we had an invasion of locusts in the centre of our country and there again we were caught unprepared. We must do something. We are going to have the main budget on 31 March, and are we simply going to sit back and allow agriculture to deteriorate and see the depopulation of the platteland continuing&#x003F; No Sir, without good and wholesome food, we will fail to maintain the strong economy that we require in the defence of our country, both in the socio-economic field and militarily.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs_and_of_forestry">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, so far the debate has indicated that we are living in a country of extremes, extremes of climate and tribulations for our farmers and also for other sections of the community. I agree with the hon. member for East London North that one must be prepared. Indeed one can practically be prepared to a certain level. I do not have enough time at my disposal to set out everything my department has done, not only in connection with the floods, but also in connection with droughts. Sunday evening I returned from an area where there are problems with water. We must therefore look at these things in a very balanced way and accept that we are subject to extremes of nature and that this can cause problems for us because it is not physically or economically possible to take precautions against the extremes we experience from time to time. But what can be done, is definitely being done. This has been demonstrated by the visits of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture in particular, together with the officials of his department, by myself and my officials and also by my predecessor. I would not be doing my duty if I did not demonstrate my sympathy for our farming community in these circumstances, circumstances not only of flood waters, but also of droughts, because I have already come across farmers this year who have said to me: &#x201C;Look at my vineyards; if only I had a little water it would have helped a great deal.&#x201D; Their problems and distress are just as great as that of the other people. I therefore want to express my sympathy to both sides and give the assurance that this Government will do everything in its power to help these people who have suffered damages as a result of an excess of water, water-logged farmlands and the destruction of crops, as well as on account of droughts. I want to say immediately that I do this in the closest collaboration with my department and with the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, who has a fine record as far as his intense interest in the well-being of the farmers is concerned.</p>

<p>I would like to refer briefly to the flood in Durban as mentioned by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. There are naturally aspects which fall under the Minister of Community Development. The latter asked me just to indicate briefly what the Departments of Community Development and of Indian Affairs were doing. Together with the local bodies they immediately gave their attention to these floodwaters. He also asked me to apologize for his absence here today. Unfortunately he has an important foreign visitor whom he could not see at any other time, <span class="col_3741-3742" refersTo="page_0553"/>otherwise he would have tried to participate in the debate himself. I want to assure the hon. member that the regional representative of Community Development and of Indian Affairs is visiting the scene in Durban and that they have already taken steps in conjunction with the authorities concerned to provide homes for these people whose shanties have been destroyed there. The hon. the Minister also asked me to announce that he is considering, and has decided in principle, to extend the assignment of the existing Disaster Committee set up in 1974, so that it can handle deserving cases which arise now as well. I mention this with pleasure to indicate that all branches of the Government are paying attention to this problem immediately and as effectively as possible. However, this does not detract from what has been said here, especially by the hon. member for East London North. He wants to try and gain a little political prestige for himself and his party in spite of what the other hon. members have said. He said they were the first to draw their attention to this matter, but they should know that the Ministers and their particular departments were actively solving the problems. We cannot speak about a matter we are dealing with.</p>

<p>This goes without saying. It seems to me I should tell the hon. member the story the hon. the Minister of Agriculture told at Vaalharts, just to show how these people try to take advantage of problems of this nature for the sake of political prestige. The hon. member particularly mentioned prestige. They are trying to take advantage of it. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture told the story at Vaalharts about the Black man who was walking along with his small herd of goats, a herd which had practically been exterminated by the drought. He did not have the courage to slaughter yet another one. Besides, they were too thin. At that moment a rabbit jumped out and he killed it with his stick, and when he picked it up, he said: &#x201C;You are fat, aren&#x2019;t you, little bag of bones.&#x201D; This is how this kind of motion ends for those hon. members. They try to make political capital out of it. They present their case very dramatically, but when they pick up the rabbit, they see that they have not gained anything by it, because this Government, in all its branches is giving particular attention to the matter.</p>

<p>Sir, long-term planning was asked for here. I can tell you that in respect of Vaalharts, there is long-term planning by the Department of Water Affairs in conjunction with the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and that work is being continued. In certain cases, like Rietrivier, we brought heavy machinery to the scene. Under the present circumstances we can do practically nothing because it is too wet, but there is long-term planning for such a scheme in which both these departments are engaged. I just want to tell the hon. member for Umhlatuzana that if he listened to the news broadcast this afternoon, he would have heard that the Department of Health, in conjunction with local authorities, is attending to a possible outbreak of diseases such as gastric fever or other epidemic diseases, in that area. I also want to mention that the Department of Health is also busy attending to this matter in Klerksdorp, where there is an Indian community in particular who suffered damage due to the flood. At Ladysmith there were also floods recently, to which the hon. member for Parktown referred. He said that there should be long-term planning. Sir, the Department of Water Affairs has put an Act on the Statute Book and we amended it this year to ensure that future planning would take place after consultation with the Department of Water Affairs, because they have information at their disposal to undertake necessary planning against floods. Mention was also made of bridges and roads.</p>

<p>Any engineer who undertakes planning will consider what kind of bridge he has to build, and whether it has to be able to withstand floods over 10, 20, 50 or 100 years; this is normal procedure. Sir, we cannot build the bridges, roads or houses for floods which may occur during the following 1 000 years. In some cases the floods we experienced were more severe than any we have had in the history of our country. I shall furnish a few figures in that connection in a moment. I also want to refer to what the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke said. He spoke to me recently in connection with the control of the Bloemhof dam. We shall have to discuss it again, but at this stage I just want to tell him that his plan is not as simple as he thinks. My department informs me that if we have to make arrangements for that dam to accommodate a flood, as he put it, it is not going to work, because we shall experience a shortage of water in the Vaalharts area.</p>

<p>I am just mentioning this to indicate how <span class="col_3743-3744" refersTo="page_0554"/>members on this side of the House have already discussed this matter with myself and the department in a responsible manner before it was raised here in Parliament. I also want to thank the hon. member for Fauresmith for the timely attention he gave to this matter. He brought his people to me here in the parliamentary building before I and my officials were able to inspect the area.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is perhaps a good thing that the public should also know it. But the public knows this Government so well in any event that they know that the Government will take steps, whether or not the matter is discussed in the Parliament. I should say that it is important for hon. members on the other side to broadcast the little they do. They want to hold up that thin rabbit to the public and say: &#x201C;Look how fat he is.&#x201D; But I grant the hon. member for Durban Point that it could indeed be valuable to discuss it here. But now the hon. member should make a contribution himself by telling the public that this matter was discussed in Parliament on their own initiative, but that the Government indicated that they are indeed doing the necessary in all spheres and that, therefore, it was not really necessary for hon. members on the other side to raise the matter here.</p>

<p>There is also an area of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development which was flooded, an area at Vaalbossloot. The Commissioner-General acted so quickly there that we were reproached by the White farmers that, before we were able to do anything for the White farmers, we had already provided food to the Bantu at Vaalboschsloot by means of helicopters. This area really falls under Bophuthatswana and a permanent agricultural officer has now been placed there to see to those people&#x2019;s needs. I also want to point out that the planning of that area was originally undertaken by engineers, and this goes to show that conditions of this nature cannot even be avoided by means of planning. There will always be extremes in weather conditions, something which cannot be avoided by means of planning. Now there is the problem of mosquitoes which are attacking the people there, and we shall have to devise a plan in that connection. Man and beast are suffering as a result of this in large areas of the Northern Cape and the Western Transvaal, and we shall have to see whether anything can be done about it. However, this is not so easy. When floods occurred at Delareyville, I asked my department to send an engineer to investigage the floods there, and after we had received representations from the hon. member for Lichtenburg, we had pumps and pipes brought there. Within a few weeks 14 pumps were erected there in order to ensure that town&#x2019;s immediate future. Hon. members must take note that this town had already been established in 1910-&#x2019;2. The town has therefore existed for more than 60 years and has never experienced anything like that during that time. This shows how unequalled the present floods are.</p>

<p>As far as the Vaalharts scheme is concerned, we are planning this scheme as well as the Riet River government water scheme, while my department is also doing a great deal in connection with the floods in the Vaal and Orange Rivers. It is naturally better to plan things ahead, better than to rectify them afterwards. Therefore irrigation schemes have to be planned properly. My department uses the dams on the Orange and Vaal Rivers to combat floods like these. Indeed, I issued a Press statement in this connection in which I congratulated my department on what they had done in this respect. Let me tell hon. members what is in progress at the moment. The inflow in the Verwoerd Dam began to increase on Sunday night. On Saturday, 20 March, at 12 p.m., 3 300 cumec entered the dam. The following day, Sunday, it was 4 400 cumec. The following day, Monday, it increased to 7 000 cumec. The peak inflow ought to reach the dam at 12 o&#x2019;clock today and is calculated at 8 500 cumec. The peak outflow is calculated at 4 800 cumec and is expected to take place on Wednesday at 2 o&#x2019;clock as against that 8 500 cumec flowing into the dam. In other words, the outlet is equal to 56% of the peak inflow. Control such as this has been exercised this year and is again being exercised now. The peak inflow in Bloemhof Dam was 2 000 cumec last Monday at 8 o&#x2019;clock, while the outflow remained constant at 1 300 cumec over the past 20 hours. We are therefore also trying to keep the flood waters back there. Today the outflow was 600 cumec.</p>

<p><span class="col_3745-3746" refersTo="page_0555"/>Therefore the Department of Water Affairs has reduced the outflow so that when the floodwaters of the Orange River arrive, we shall be able to avoid a further disaster. The expected maximum water level at Upington is approximately 7,5 metres. It has already been 7,45 metres this year, and it is expected that the water level will rise a little higher with this flood. Available flood absorption is being used at both dams, and the following maximum dam content is predicted: At some stage the Verwoerd Dam will have an absorption equal to 131% of its capacity and the Bloemhof Dam an absorption of 115%. Hon. members will appreciate that these dams, besides water provision, can serve a very useful purpose provided this additional water is utilized correctly, and my department is doing just this in a very effective manner under the present circumstances. But hon. members should appreciate that rain may fall in the meantime and that this makes it very difficult for the department to exercise proper control. I may just mention that the necessary warnings have already been issued to owners along the Vaal River and Orange Rivers, but according to the weather report today the weather is clearing up and it is expected that the floodwaters approaching along the Orange River, will not cause any greater damage than what has already been caused this year.</p>

<p>I want to point out to hon. members that we have already provided for damages in the additional appropriation this year, among other things for weirs which were damaged, and in the Budget for the ensuing financial year, provision has already been made according to what has happened as a result of previous floodwaters during 1974 and this year. Our engineers and technicians have already planned what is to be done in the future.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that my department is giving effective and vigorous attention to these matters. But hon. members must also remember that this cannot continue indefinitely. For example, it has been estimated that my department will have to spend R16 million on the Vaalharts scheme in order to provide flood conduits and general drainage in order to safeguard that scheme. Ultimately it may lead to the doubling of the original construction cost of the scheme.</p>

This demands a comprehensive organization and profound study by highly qualified people. Therefore, we cannot rush in head over heels and say that we shall solve the problems overnight. But what can be done&#x2014; and I can assure the public and hon. members of this&#x2014;has been done.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have been reading since the beginning of this year of the storm, hail and flood damage recently suffered by large parts of South Africa. In the Parliamentary Library there are two bulky files containing newspaper cuttings about that damage. However, there have been very few references to what will in fact be done to assist the afflicted people in their troubles. [Interjections.] Nowhere do we find a comprehensive programme of what this Government is going to do to render assistance to those people. There have been casual references to investigations that are going to be undertaken, but nowhere is there any mention of any active steps which this Government is going to take to aid the afflicted people. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, we have had a fierce reaction here to the proposals made by this side of the House. We have been accused of wanting to play politics with this situation. However, the politics came from that side of the House. There have really been very few positive proposals from the Government side.</p>

<p>By way of illustrating the lack of interest, we need only look at the many empty benches on the other side. [Interjections.] They testify to the lack of interest in the fate of an afflicted group of people in South Africa. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House should like to express our serious concern about the <span class="col_3747-3748" refersTo="page_0556"/>people whose homes, whose business concerns, whose farms and fields have been flooded. We have already produced good, practical suggestions. We hope that all parties who are able to render assistance will in fact do so, and we also expect this Government to contribute its share to relieving the distress of those afflicted people.</p>

<p>We find it particularly shocking that people have been allowed in the past to build their houses in some low-lying areas next to creeks and rivers, and that some people have even been forced to do so by socio-economic conditions. There are many examples of this throughout South Africa. We know that legislation was promulgated last year which will prevent such things from happening in the future. We know that the Department of Planning will see to it that future township development and expansion will take place in suitable areas. Mr. Speaker, what about existing townships&#x2014;in many cases these are Indian residential areas in the low-lying parts of towns&#x2014;which are still vulnerable in the event of flood damage of this extent&#x003F; Places such as Ladysmith and Durban have already been mentioned. Twenty-five bodies have been found in Durban, and 2 500 people are homeless.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we expect a vigorous programme to be drawn up, as proposed by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, in terms of which these people are to be moved to higher terrain. We have been assured that the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs will investigate these problems. However, my experience of the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs is that he has been investigating Indian affairs for many years. An investigation of Actonville, at Benoni, has been going on for more than seven years with a view to making extra land available for occupation by Indians. The investigation is still continuing and nothing has been done. [Interjections.] At some places, seven families are living in one house. Can we expect that something will be done in the future to move these people living in low-lying areas&#x003F; It is true that we have had promises here that attention will be given to this matter. However, we know the kind of attention which is given to matters of this nature. We know that nothing will come of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are other areas as well which are suffering from flood damage. I want to refer in particular to the extensive damage done to salt-pans in the Northern Cape and in the Western Free State. Those salt-pans are flooded at the moment. They had barely recovered from the rain damage of the past two years, and I anticipate that the possibility of a shortage of salt in the future is not excluded.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we know how dependent the farmers are on salt licks for their stock. Our lambing and calving percentages are dependent on it. The growth capacity of our stock and the amount of red meat that farmers are able to produce annually are dependent on salt licks. We must combat lamb diseases by administering phosphates along with salt, and in spite of the assurance given by the hon. the Minister, there have been problems in the past in obtaining salt in certain parts of Griqualand West. We should like the hon. the Minister to have the matter investigated in order to ascertain the extent to which our salt-pans have been affected by the flood water and the extent to which the production capacity of the farmers may be affected by this in the future.</p>

<p>&#x2026; in the stock-raising areas of Griqualand West. That hon. member knows very little about this. That is why he is being so noisy and why he is finding things so amusing. There are farmers, especially in Griqualand West and in the Northern Cape, who are waiting to hear what <span class="col_3749-3750" refersTo="page_0557"/>this Government is going to do for them. Meanwhile hon. members, such as that one, sit here cracking jokes about the predicament in which our farmers in the country districts find themselves. The problem experienced by the farmers there is that large parts of their pasturage have been flooded. Percentages of between 30% and 40% have been mentioned here. There are farmers who believe that they are going to suffer greater losses as a result of this rain damage than they suffered because of droughts. I should like to recommend the hon. the Minister actively to consider applying exactly the same measures now and making the same relief available to farmers in areas suffering from flood damage as was done during the drought conditions. There are farmers who will need fodder. We should like them to receive subsidies for this. There are farmers who suffered tremendous stock losses as a result of the mosquito and gnat plagues. They lost large numbers of their young lambs as a result of the fact that black clouds of mosquitoes and gnats literally sucked out the blood of the lambs just after birth. Karakul and Dorper lambs are being picked up dead in the veld. While hon. members are sitting here laughing, we feel concerned about the production capacity of some fanners. [Interjections.] Because so many farmers do not have sufficient capital to rehabilitate themselves, we should like loans to be made available to them more readily at low interest rates, so that we may keep those farmers on the land and on the farms. We expect this Government to do something about that problem.</p>

<p>The farmers have been willing over the years to make their products available at low prices. As a result, they are not as well-provided with capital as we should like them to be. For this reason I believe that the farmers are entitled to expect this Government to provide them with the necessary aid.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was anticipating the query as to how much farming we do in Houghton. It is a pity that nobody has asked me that leading question, because I wanted to tell them that although we may not do much farming in Houghton, we certainly do consume a good deal of agricultural products. We are interested in the fate of farming because we also contribute, as do other taxpayers in the country, towards the Government subsidies that assist farmers, not only in times of need and emergency, but also throughout normal periods in South Africa. We have heard a great deal this afternoon about the damage which has been suffered by farmers due to the recent floods. My hon. friend from Parktown has already expressed the sympathy which we feel with people who have suffered such damage and also with people who have suffered loss of life, which is even worse. I have the feeling, however, that everybody in this House who has been talking about farmers, has been talking only about one type of farmer, and that is the White farmer in South Africa. This is very important, and I want to point out to the House that there are millions of Black farmers in South Africa. There are something like seven million people living in the homelands and the majority of the economically active members of that community, who are not working as migrant workers in the White areas of South Africa, are engaged in agriculture. These people have suffered considerable damage as well. The rain falls without discrimination in South Africa and when it falls heavily it falls on the Black areas as well as on the White areas. Throughout the country, be it in the Transkei, the Western Transvaal or the Northern Transvaal, great damage has been suffered by farmers farming in the Black agricultural areas in South Africa. I also want to point out that there are Indian farmers in South Africa. The last census estimated that something like 3,7% of the economically active members of the Indian community were engaged in farming. These people too have suffered very considerable damage. What I want to know is what steps are being taken by the central Government to aid Black farmers in their hour of need to enable them to rebuild the dams which have been broken, to enable them to get stock feed as they are not going to be able to grow stock feed, and to enable them, if necessary, to move stock from flooded areas to areas where stock can survive. Are they being given the same sort of assistance that White farmers are getting&#x003F; Are they, for instance, getting rail rebates in moving stock feed&#x003F; Are they given assistance in the from of a subsidy of something like 60% which is given to farmers to assist them in rebuilding irrigation areas&#x003F; These are the questions which I would like to ask the hon. the Minister. I know, of course, that the answer will most likely be that since these people are farming in the homelands, it <span class="col_3751-3752" refersTo="page_0558"/>is up to the homelands Governments to provide them with the additional assistance. I want to point out that the homeland budgets have been pared to the bone and that there is no additional money available in the homeland budgets to assist the farmers in the Black areas. If ever there was a time for a generous gesture, a gesture which could do enormous good for South Africa, it is now, at this time in our history. I urgently implore the hon. the Minister to give this matter his most serious consideration and to tell this House whether there are plans to give assistance to the millions, and there are millions of Black farmers in South Africa who have suffered very considerable damage as a result of the floods.</p>

<p>Bophuthatswana has been badly affected and there are areas in the Transkei, I am told, which are badly affected and where they could not plant the seed for next year&#x2019;s crop, and so on. There are also many areas which have been badly affected in the Western Transvaal and in the Northeastern Transvaal. Zululand has been affected as well because, as the hon. member knows, there are no areas where the homelands do not abut on the White areas and where there is complete consolidation, except in the Transkei, and even there the consolidation is not absolutely complete since the Transkei comprises three separate portions of land. Certainly Bophuthatswana and the other areas in the Northern and the Western Transvaal have been badly affected.</p>

<p>I want to say something in particular about one group of Black farmers that have been especially hard hit and I think that it is incumbent on the Government to take special measures in their case. I refer to the people who have been forcibly moved, and I use the word &#x201C;forcibly&#x201D; advisedly, for they have been moved against their will from one area to another, and to an area which they consider certainly not to be as good a farming area as the area they used to occupy, and which at present is certainly in a very bad condition.</p>

<p>It may have been a 100 years ago, but they remember it. The hon. Minister remembers the Anglo-Boer War, I bet he does. The Mayen people therefore remember when they were moved from the confluence of the Vaal and Orange Rivers which, is as I have said, coincidentally where diamonds were discovered just over 100 years ago. That may be one of the reasons why they were moved. They have been moved twice, in the first instance to Mayen and a few years ago, under tremendous protest from these people, to Vaalboschhoek, which is approximately 80 km from where they were, making life even more difficult for them. The land, in their opinion, is inferior to the land that they had. Some 2 000 people were involved in this, not just a handful. Quite recently a number of women took their children and left the area to which they had been moved and went back to Mayen, complaining that the land was sodden, that their children were dying because of the wet conditions and that stock was dying because they were plagued by mosquitoes&#x2014; the things that members have been complaining about in respect of the White areas&#x2014;and that the walls of their houses were collapsing. They were of course arrested for trespassing and they were hauled into court and some of them were sentenced to 60 days&#x2019; imprisonment, another group of women came down and they were also arrested, but fortunately the magistrate who tried that case bothered to go into the circumstances of the case and did not sentence them. He suggested that they go back to Bophuthatswana and that they find other people with whom they could live while the matter was being investigated. There the matter rests at the present time. I have put a series of questions to the hon. the Deputy <span class="col_3753-3754" refersTo="page_0559"/>Minister and he has told me firstly that conditions were found to be satisfactory. The second answer he gave me, following upon the case where clearly the magistrate had accepted that these women had been driven away from the areas in which they have been resettled by the rotten conditions there, was that the matter was under investigation. I think that something should be done about these people as an emergency measure. I do not know whether there are other cases which are identical to this. I would not be at all surprised if the people who were for instance removed from Doornkop to an area which they dislike intensely are also finding conditions very difficult in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>That is altogether a different problem. The hon. member raised further pointes relating to Bantu Administration. She said that those farmers should get the same 50% subsidy as was paid to White farmers. I want to point out that the Department of Bantu Administration is paying them subsidies of 100% on dams that are broken. In other words, they are getting 50% more than the White farmers.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Newton Park said that he was not going to play politics in this debate. I am pleased about that. We are not going to play politics. The hon. member said that if the farmers had obtained good prices they would have been able to manage on their own. This is not politics at all; the hon. member was only stating facts. I should be glad if the hon. member could just tell us what a good price is. But he did not do so; he just made a general statement. Furthermore he said that all our planning was being done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. I wrote down every point as the hon. member spoke. I repeat: He said that our planning in respect of agriculture was being done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Sir, speakers on this side of the House have pointed out that there are parts of our country that are being afflicted by terrible droughts, and that at the same time there are parts which are flooded. Then there are also parts of the country in which <span class="col_3755-3756" refersTo="page_0560"/>conditions are splendid and ideal. The hon. member for Parktown said that there was no long-term planning and that there was no system to provide for an emergency such as a cloud-burst. Sir, something like this can happen in Somerset East tomorrow, and in Nelspruit the day after. This is something which can occur everywhere. I want to point out that I am not quarrelling with the hon. member. I just want him to understand what the position is, because he made quite a number of statements. He said that assistance was not immediately available. Let us take the case of a farmer in Vaalharts. In fact, allow me to say something about the problem of Vaalharts. My colleague, the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, the members of the House of Assembly who are concerned with this, such as the hon. members for Fauresmith and Kimberley North, all our officials and I have gone to look at Vaalharts and Riet River. Sir, we did not build that Vaalharts scheme. That Vaalharts scheme was laid out the wrong way.</p>

<p>I am not going to say who built that scheme, because I do not want to play politics; however, we did not build it. [Interjections.] I am not making any reproaches. The scheme was built with very good intentions. However, we certainly would not build a scheme like the Vaalharts scheme today, as part of the Orange River scheme, for example. If we have to build a scheme, it will be quite different. No one foresaw at that time that that area could have five inches of rain within one night, and that this could be followed after three days by another four inches. That area got half its normal rainfall within a week. These are unprecedented conditions, and we cannot reproach one another for them. Now the farmer is there. He can only harvest in July or August. Even with the best sunshine conditions he would not have been able to harvest at this stage anyway. He would have harvested in July or August. He cannot move with a tractor, and he can hardly get to town. Now the hon. member says that aid must be available immediately. What kind of aid are we to give the man&#x003F; I can tell the hon. member that the Deapartment of Agricultural Technical Services is looking for solutions by means of internal drainage, and that facilities are being provided by my colleague,the Minister of Water Affairs. The hon. member said himself that he had been there. The Department of Water Affairs has to spend R8 million just on main channel drainage systems to drain off the water. We must remember, however, that it is an investment. There may be drought conditions again over the next five years and then it will be very easy to say:&#x201C;Why did you spend that R8 million on drainage&#x003F; Could it not have been used to build canals for supplying more water&#x003F; We have a drought on our hands.&#x201D; If the farmers have that internal drainage laid on, as the Department of Agricultural Technical Services &#x2026; Would the hon. member please listen&#x003F; If he listens, these motions will not be conducted in this way again.</p>

In respect of the other R3 000 or R4 000 it costs him to have the internal drainage installed, he received a loan at 5% from the Department of Agricultural Credit.

<p>The hon. member said that we should give more subsidies and that in granting these subsidies we should view agriculture as a whole. The hon. member said he had visited the area. I should like to refer to a meeting which was held by the farmers in that vicinity. This meeting was well attended. Meetings were held in several areas, but I am referring just to this one, which was held without any interference on our part by the S.A. Agricultural Union at Ottosdal on 11 March.

<p>But what are we to do at this time of the year&#x003F; The hon. member said that the farmers would not have been in this dilemma if the prices for the agricultural products had been right. Sir, we normally check all production costs at this time of the year. We look at international circumstances and at the national economy. We are a responsible Government. Next year we have to fix prices again. It is very easy to come here with popular slogans, but we have to go back to the farmers every time and we have to take them with us. We have to act responsibly, and we have a national economy that has to balance. Our farmers are aware of this. However, my attention is being diverted from what I want to bring home to the House. This was the standpoint of those farmers at this specific meeting. Do hon. members remember that our country had a maize crop of 42 million bags in 1973&#x003F; There had been a terrible drought. We then obtained R25 million from the Minister of Finance to lend to the co-operatives, apart from all other so-called <i>ad hoc</i> assistance to which hon. members refer. We lent R25 million to the co-operatives so that this amount could be lent to farmers, at a co-operative interest rate. Do hon. members know what is still owing on that R25 million&#x003F; On R893 is still outstanding. This is the kind of farmer we have in this country. I mentioned this just to prove that these people do not want subsidies and free assistance all the time. If the farmers find themselves in a financial dilemma because of circumstances beyond their control, they know where they can turn to for assistance.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for East London North says: &#x201C;Why wait for the Opposition to take the initiative&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, the initiative comes from the Opposition today&#x2014;that is quite right. Why did it not come from this side&#x003F; The hon. member for Brits came to visit me at half past seven this morning to tell me about a cloudburst that had taken place in his area. The Elands River was in flood and the belongings of the people of Koedoeskop were washed away yesterday. We decided not to go there until 29 and 30 April. We could go tomorrow, but then we might have to go again in a week&#x2019;s time. The normal rains are over by the end of April. Then we shall visit the constituencies of Brits, Schweizer-Reneke, Lichtenburg, Standerton, the Wilge River and the Vaal River, Parys, Bothaville in particular, Winburg, <span class="col_3759-3760" refersTo="page_0562"/>Hoopstad in particular, Heilbron, Villiers, on the river. Fauresmith and Vaalharts we have visited already, and the same applies to Kimberley North, but if it is necessary, we can go again. Even the hon. member for Marico came to say that the Marico River, too, was in flood. Now I ask why the initiative for such a thing does not come from this side. It is because the members of the House of Assembly who represent these constituencies are in close contact with the farmers and know what their problems are and because they have free access to me and to my deputy, day and night, for stating their difficulties. I do not blame hon. members for having raised this thing here today, but do not say that the initiative comes from their side only. The hon. member for Fauresmith rightly asked that we should not have the loans repaid after the first year. From Agricultural Credit a man gets a production loan of R8 000 at 5%, but he need only write a letter to say that his circumstances are such and such, that he has been having difficulties for five years running. Can hon. members name one person on whom we have brought pressure to bear under these circumstances because he has not been able to pay&#x003F; He has only to react and we shall give him respite. I must say the bad debts are minimal. As soon as the weather is on his side he pays back. The hon. member for Christiana suggested that farmers be compensated for losses on their crops just as compensation is paid when the stock of a shop has been washed away. Unfortunately, Sir, I can never accept the principle&#x2014;I should not use the word &#x201C;never&#x201D;&#x2014;that we are to compensate for losses on crops in agriculture in South Africa. There are farmers whose crops have been completely destroyed by hail, there are farmers whose crops have been flooded, and there are farmers whose crops have been destroyed by drought. One simply cannot remove the risk factor from agriculture, for by doing so one would be killing the farmer&#x2019;s initiative. I quite agree that the man who can produce must be enabled to do this, so that when he has a good crop, he is able to save something for the difficult years ahead. This has always been our idea. I think the hon. member feels that while this is done for the shopkeeper&#x2014;I must say it was done in a time when we were rather more indulgent&#x2014;it should be done for the farmer as well.</p>

<p>It is possible, but it could happen, as it happened during the 1973 drought, that damage amounting to more than R300 million may be suffered in agriculture. We do not have that kind of money. But we can discuss the matter. We would have to build up such a fund gradually, because that fund would be exhausted by loans. If they know that a large amount of money is being held for a disaster which may occur some day, the farmers will borrow it. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<p>I was very pleased to see how the hon. member for Kimberley North intervened on behalf of his people at Vaalharts. He wanted us just to hold out a helping hand to these people; they want to produce, and the area is a rich source of supply for our country, as is the Riet River scheme. His slogan here today was &#x201C;Save our land&#x201D;. By saving the land we shall be saving the farmer as well. This is why my colleague, the Minister of Water Affairs, and our officials have decided together with the Deputy Minister of Agriculture that if only we can get enough money, we are going to save that scheme.</p>

<p>What am I doing about it&#x003F; [Interjections.] Sir, my time has almost expired. I want to tell the hon. member that he has painted certain pictures here. We have a fantastic country which is able to produce all these requirements. The hon. member said that we would have to import 2 million tons of wheat by the year 2000. Sir, I predict that we shall not have to import it. We have the human material; we have the farmers on our side and we have the research at Agricultural Technical Services, and if we consider that our production has doubled within 10 years, I say that we shall yet see miracles in the next five years.</p>

<p>But the greatest damage was done in the Western Transvaal. In Hoopstad and in parts <span class="col_3761-3762" refersTo="page_0563"/>of Bothaville there has been 35% to 85% damage. But do you know, Sir, what our estimated maize crop is&#x003F; And normally we are not out by more than 5%. This estimate was made before the terrible rains this weekend and therefore it will have to come down a little. Last year it was 8,8 million tons and this year it is 8% lower&#x2014;8,1 million tons.</p>

<p>Let us first get the price. Sir, I receive reports from the teams who are fighting locusts. The hon. member said: &#x201C;The locusts will catch us unawares.&#x201D; Can you imagine, Sir, that the hon. member can say that the locusts will catch us unawares&#x003F; At the moment there are 6 anti-locust teams in the De Aar area; 15 at Fraserburg; 3 at Carnarvon; 3 at Vanwyksvlei; 5 at Brandvlei; 3 at Vosburg; 10 at Kenhardt; 8 at Calvinia East; 3 at Loeriesfontein; 4 at Kakamas; 5 at Pofadder&#x2014;a total of 65 in this area. In the Kimberley area there are three teams at Marydale and two at Prieska. Most loucusts have now reached the flying stage. Many of the units are not working and are awaiting further developments at the moment. Because the flying locusts move about over a quite large area, the surrounding districts may shortly be affected. Rain and damaged roads make it difficult to combat the, but we are ready for any further outbreak. But the hon. member says: &#x201C;They will catch us unawares. &#x201D; The year before last we spent R2,2 million on combating locusts. I think, Sir, that now and then, not for the sake of the ministry or of the Government, but for the sake of the men who do research work out in the veld and who go about with locust-spraying equipment on their backs, it would be a fine gesture if the Opposition were only once to express its thanks for the fact that we still have enough food to eat, in spite of all these things which threaten us. I do not mean to criticize the hon. member for Newton Park. He has every right to move a motion of this kind. There is nothing wrong with it, but we must see it in the right perspective. We must always remember, in speaking about agriculture, that we cannot predict these things. Sir, there are farmers in the Eastern Transvaal who have a harvest of 115% this year compared to last year. These are splendid agricultural circumstances, but I am very disappointed and very sorry indeed for these men who are in financial difficulties because of the present weather conditions. But I may just tell them that this Government will always be sympathetic towards them because they are prepared to produce food in a country such as this one, where the conditions can never be predicted.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I react to what the hon. the Minister has said, I just want to put right, for the sake of the record, the statement made by the hon. member for Houghton a little earlier where she said that we concerned ourselves only with the White farmers of South Africa. I want to say that we never mentioned White farmers. We spoke about farmers generally, in fact, she ended her speech by associating herself with the plea made by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana for the Indian farmers on the flats of the Umgeni River.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has now replied and I am sorry that he has taken the line he had, because I believe the hon. member for Newton Park came this afternoon with a motion which he hoped would be to the benefit of the people of South Africa. I know it was his intention when he came with this motion to say to the hon. the Minister and to the Government what should be done, and I am sorry it is the hon. the Minister of Agriculture alone together with his colleague, the Minister of Water Affairs, who have to bear the brunt of this debate. I think what the hon. member for Newton Park was trying to say was: We have a problem; this is the problem as we see it and these are the suggestions we have for resolving those problems, but what is the Government doing&#x003F;</p>

<p>Is it aware of the problems&#x003F; What is it doing to combat those problems&#x003F; Can we perhaps get together and find some solution so that we can avoid the &#x201C;ramp&#x201D; we experience every couple of years in the same place&#x003F; The hon. member for Fauresmith will know of an area where this has been experienced three years running. For three years running the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, with his colleagues and staff, has gone there and made <i>ad hoc</i> plans to combat that particular problem, but the same problem is experienced all over again every year. What future planning has there been&#x003F; This is the question the hon. member for Newton Park raised.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to the <span class="col_3763-3764" refersTo="page_0564"/>question of financial assistance to the farmers. In so doing, he misconstrued completely what the hon. member for Newton Park had said when he referred to the reviewing of prices. What the hon. member for Newton Park in fact said, as the hon. the Minister would have known if he had listened, was that the farmers themselves said they would like to carry themselves through such periods, but that they were not in a position to do so because of the nature of the prices and because of their increased production costs. The hon. member for Newton Park merely asked the hon. the Minister to see what he could do about the situation, even if it should mean subsidizing consumer prices. That is what he said, and I do not believe that there is anything wrong with that at all. I believe the hon. the Minister must accept that in the same spirit. The hon. the Minister spoke of having travelled around. I wonder whether he undertook those travels only after he became aware of this motion, or whether he travelled through these constituencies before that. The hon. the Minister also said he could not undertake long-term planning in South Africa, since floods are experienced in one year and a drought in the next. I accept that, and we on this side of the House accept that it is very difficult to have long-term planning, in view of the extremes of climatic conditions experienced in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said we would not find one person in the stricken areas who has not been helped by his department. We concede that point, but he gives assistance on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. That is the crux of our criticism of the Government. We had hoped that the hon. the Minister or some member on that side would have told us this afternoon that the Government had in fact made plans so that, if a situation such as this should develop&#x2014; such conditions keep on recurring&#x2014;there would be somebody who could press a button thereby implementing plan A, plan N or plan X by means of which everybody would know what they had to do to combat the particular conditions that had developed. I know what is going through the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s mind: He wants us to come with suggestions. How many years in succession did the hon. the Minister not hear the former member for South Coast, Mr. Douglas Mitchell, plead for long-range weather forecasting&#x003F; Has the hon. the Minister gone into that&#x003F; He did not even reply to the same point made by the hon. member for Newton Park today. What has he done about long-range weather forecasting&#x003F; Something can be done. We can, for instance, make use of the American or some other satellites for such long-range weather forecasting. In that way we would be warned when something like this was liable to happen so that we could start taking the necessary steps. What about flood warnings&#x003F; What about anti-flood action&#x003F; Take the example of Ladysmith in Natal. Every few months the river there comes down in flood and every time it breaks its banks in the same place. When there is a flash rain in the mountains, we must have a squad to put down sandbags or to do something to prevent the river breaking its banks. What about the evacuation of people, and of animals, for that matter&#x003F;</p>

<p>No, Sir, there is no time. The hon. member had more time than I have. What about the mobilization of our civil defences&#x003F; I want to join the hon. member for Umhlatuzana in paying tribute to what the civil defence has done, particularly in Natal, where I know what they have done. They must make plans for the accommodation of the evacuees, for the transport of workers, for the maintenance of essential services and for the supplying of power, food, medical supplies and immunization. After that, the matter should be referred back to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs laughed when my friend, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, referred to the flood conditions and the fact that there was no forage in Natal.</p>

<p>Not at all. It is a fact. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs laughed and asked: &#x201C;What has that got to do with it&#x003F;&#x201D; He said the farmers must look after themselves. The point is that it is so wet that the farmers cannot reap any hay. They just cannot make hay&#x2014;there is no sunshine for them to make hay. It is raining in those areas! The question is what planning the hon. the <span class="col_3765-3766" refersTo="page_0565"/>Minister has done in this regard. Has he gone to those areas where there is a possibility of making hay to encourage them to establish fodder banks to keep our animal population alive during the coming winter&#x003F; Vast areas of Natal will have no hay this year. I think, for instance, of the whole constituency of my friend, the hon. member for Mooi River. There are areas in the Karoo where not a single bale of lucerne has been reaped. Parts of the Orange Free State and the Vaal Hartz area have no lucerne, as the hon. the Minister knows. What are the cattle going to eat if the hon. the Minister does not now start collecting grass in the areas where there is some grass&#x003F; During the severe drought experienced some years ago, even the land along the runways at the airport and along the railway lines was mowed to get some grass for the cattle. We expected to hear from the hon. the Minister that he had made this sort of plan and that the Government was aware of the problems facing the country and was taking the necessary steps. In exactly the same way that we expect to hear of this sort of plan to counter floods, the converse also applies. We hope to hear from the Government that they also have relief plans in the event of a drought or any other natural distasters that may occur.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister must not start talking of flash floods in localized areas. Nobody can control those and, naturally, we are very sorry for the few farmers who may be hit by such floods. I know that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department helps such farmers. We have not criticized the department or the hon. the Minister for that at all. However, I am talking of floods on a vast scale such as are being experienced at present. This is almost in the nature of being a national emergency. I am disappointed that we have not heard more from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Third Time.</block>

<p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to inform hon. members that I have decided, after consideration, to move amendments in the Other Place in respect of certain of the matters which we discussed during the Committee Stage. I should like to inform hon. members of this in time, with a view to the debate which may follow here. The amendments will be as follows: That in the long title the word &#x201C;in&#x201D; where it occurs for the second time be omitted and the word &#x201C;within&#x201D; substituted; that in the preamble, in the third paragraph after &#x201C;people and&#x201D; be inserted &#x201C;without prejudicing any further constitutional development of the territory of South West Africa&#x201D;; that in clause 10 on page 9, in lines 54 to 57, the following subsection be substituted for subsection (4)(a)&#x2014;&#x201C;(4)(a) Provision shall be made for the holding of elections by secret ballot, and every citizen of Rehoboth, whether male or female, over the age of 18 years, who has full citizenship rights in accordance with the customs of the Rehoboth Baster community, shall have the vote&#x201D; and, finally, that in the schedule on page 35, in item 52, after the word &#x201C;crime&#x201D;, be inserted &#x201C;in Rehoboth&#x201D;.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall deal with the amendments which the hon. the Minister intends moving in the Other Place, and which we welcome, a little later. In the course of the Second Reading debate, allegations which had very little to do with the Bill were levelled at me across the floor of this House. These came in particular from hon. members representing the White voters of South West Africa in this House. Naturally we shall have to seek other opportunities to reply, where necessary, to the allegations. However, I hope you will permit me to reply as briefly as possible to a few personal accusations which were made against me. The hon. member for Middelland quoted quite a number of passages from newspaper reports on what I had allegedly said recently at the symposium of the Federal Party in Windhoek. In not a single instance did he take the trouble to quote me correctly.</p>

The speech which I made in Windhoek during the symposium was written out, and this was what I said when I referred to the extraneous dangers threatening South West Africa, and to the necessity for timeous political adjustments within South West Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die voorhoede van revolusie, gewelddadige revolusie, staan reeds aan ons grense, en die omstandighede gaan &#x2019;n terugkeer tot vreedsame prosesse beslis nie maklik maak nie.

<p>The hon. member and various other hon. members almost had a stroke simply because I had allegedly said that we had passed the point of peaceful solution in South West Africa. Again this was a case of half a quotation; for this is what I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">En van die nadeligste ontwikkelinge vanuit die oogpunt van &#x2019;n vreedsame oplossing van die Suidwes-Afrika-vraagstuk is die aktiewe totstandkoming van Swapo se Namibian Liberation Army wat tans vanuit Angola en Zambie opereer. Hoe ons &#x2019;n einde gaan maak aan hierdie jongste terroriste-leier in Afrika, sal seker niemand van ons kan s&#x00EA; nie, maar soos ek die saak sien, het ons hier reeds te doen met een van die emstigste konsekwensies van ons ver-suim om die Suidwes-kwessie betyds op te los. Tot &#x2019;n jaar of twee gelede was daar nog nie &#x2019;n element van geweld van buite in die prentjie nie. Daardie element van geweld is nou daar en daar is ongelukkig geen rede om aan te neem dat dit sal verminder nie.</block>

<p>Inteendeel, hoe langer &#x2019;n oplossing vir Suidwes uitbly, hoe groter moet verwag word dat hierdie bedreiging sal groei &#x2026; Ek vrees ons het reeds by die punt verby getrek waar die oplossing geheel en al vreedsaam sal wees.</p>

<p>Various hon. members attacked me because I had allegedly offended members of the Windhoek constitutional conference and had allegedly said that none of them had any knowledge of constitutional matters and that assistance from overseas should be called in for them. This is not an entirely correct version of what I said either. I was replying there to a question from the audience, and I said that South West Africa was a multi-national country and that it was a pity there was not a single delegate at the conference who had undergone a study of the constitutions of other multi-national countries in the world, and of how other multi-national countries were resolving their minority problems. This is an ordinary statement of fact; it is true. I then added that it was the duty of the Government to cause delegates to the conference to be provided with advice by people who had sufficient knowledge and experience of the constitutions of multi-national countries, and that they should call in outside assistance if it was not to be found here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland angrily charged me with having an interest in the matter and wanting the conference in Windhoek to fail and miscarry. The hon. member had no ground whatsoever for making such an allegation. On <span class="col_3769-3770" refersTo="page_0567"/>what did he base it&#x003F; Apparently there are members in this House who believe they are entitled to say anything they like as long as it suits their propagandistic purpose. At the symposium in Windhoek I expressed myself very clearly in favour of the conference, and that is also the attitude of our party. The conference undoubtedly suffers from certain shortcomings which cannot be discussed now, but it is the very best development which could have taken place in South West Africa. But I want to tell the hon. member for Middelland that it is not I and the United Party who wish to cause the conference to miscarry; we welcome it. It is the hon. member who should be concerned, because his party are the people who will have to make adjustments.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I accept your ruling.</p>

<p>I must point out that a great many personal attacks were made here. I regret to have to say that in general the contribution of the few South West African members to the discussion of the Bill was of such a nature that they did not improve their position in this House. To them what was involved was to a far greater extent the ideology of their political party, rather than the general interests of South West Africa or of Rehoboth. Some of their speeches drew sharp reaction from non-White leaders in South West Africa, and helped no one. The last thing non-White leaders in South West Africa want is to be associated with the political policy and ideas of the governing party, for they do not want to be regarded as &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; of the Government. The South West African members in this House demonstrated during the course of the debate that they were completely out of touch with the situation and that they could not see any further than the immediate interests of their political party. As far as the general interests of South West Africa are concerned, they serve no purpose here, and I regret to have to say that it would be better if the present system of their representation here were brought to an end.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading debate we voted in favour of the Bill, and I do not think it is necessary for us to defend the standpoint which we adopted to anyone. The Bill seeks to give the territory of Rehoboth a form of local self-government. In fact, a form of local self-government which the territory formerly had and which is fully in accordance with the policy which we advocate and the direction which some of the principal population groups in South West Africa also advocate. In our opinion the principle of the Bill is contained in the legislative and administrative powers which are being conferred upon the Kaptein, the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council and the Legislative Council of Rehoboth. We have correctly advanced the argument that this is in accordance with the express wishes of the people of Rehoboth. We are always the first&#x2014;I admit this&#x2014;to criticize the Government if it does not consult a population group before coming to this House with legislation. In spite of the shortcomings, which we have pointed out, in the Bill and in the way in which it was formulated, the Government did consult the people of Rehoboth in this case, and we are satisfied&#x2014;we know this from our own knowledge of the affairs of South West Africa&#x2014;that the people of Rehoboth want this local self-government on the basis of the old Paternal Laws.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, during his reply to the Second Reading debate, seized upon a minor debating point and intimated that I had allegedly said that I was not interested in the wishes of the people of Rehoboth. However, that is not what happened. In my Second Reading speech I emphasized that the Baster community had been agitating for years for the reinstatement of the paternal laws, that they admitted that in many respects they were obsolete and had to be modernized, but that they wanted to do this themselves. I added to that that we sympathized with such an expression of desire to help themselves. With regard to the most recent election in Rehoboth, I also mentioned further that the party that was in favour of the reinstatement of self-government and the Paternal Law of 1872 had won the election convincingly. I made it clear on behalf of this side of the House that, in dealing with the Bill, it was an important consideration on our part that the wishes of the Baster community in Rehoboth should be complied with as far as possible. This was, in fact, one of the principal reasons which we advanced to indicate why we supported the Second Reading of the Bill, in other words the <span class="col_3771-3772" refersTo="page_0568"/>principle of the Bill. There is therefore no question of our not recognizing the wishes of the people of Rehoboth or of our not being interested in them. This is clear from all the speeches which were made on this side of the House. I am afraid the hon. the Minister misinterpreted a reply to an interjection which I gave him. I was discussing the position of this Parliament in respect of the international status of South West Africa. The hon. the Minister made an interjection referring to the wishes of Rehoboth. At that moment, however, I was not discussing the wishes of Rehoboth. I was discussing the position of this Parliament. I want to concede that the report of my reply could perhaps have created a misunderstanding, but the context ought to have been completely clear. In any case, it is of no great importance. The record makes it clear that our support for the Second Reading was based on the wishes of Rehoboth and the fact that the Bill expands local self-government.</p>

<p>As regards the Third Reading, we have already objected to the general formulation of the Bill, and particularly to the constitutional terminology which is being used in the Bill. The hon. the Minister has been accommodating in two respects, apart from the fact that he also accepted quite a number of practical suggestions which we put forward in the Committee Stage. He eliminated the racial clause, to which we had very serious objections, and in his reply to the Second Reading debate he said, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Bill has nothing whatsoever to do with sovereign independence &#x2026; and anyone who tries to suggest anything of the kind, is committing a crime against the people of Rehoboth.</block>

<p>I know the hon. the Minister was glancing over his shoulder while he spoke, because it was not we who suggested that the Bill had anything to do with sovereign independence for Rehoboth. The people of Rehoboth themselves said that they did not want this. Those of us who know Rehoboth, know that it can no more become an independent State than Mamre or Genadendal can become independent States. Therefore, that was never our problem. We did not fear that this was a step towards independence. We simply did not want terminology to be used which could cause confusion and misconceptions to arise in the outside world and could place ammunition in the hands of our opponents, particularly those at UNO. That was why we insisted that it should be written into the Bill somewhere that the self-government&#x2014;in the terms in which it is used in the Bill&#x2014;which is being granted to Rehoboth, should be within and as an integral part of the territory of South West Africa. The hon. the Minister did not comply with our request in so many words. A few minutes ago, however, the Secretary gave me the amendment which the hon. the Minister will move. Where the word &#x201C;in&#x201D; is now stated in the title of the Bill he will use the words &#x201C;within South West Africa&#x201D;, and will also insert other words to the effect that when self-government is granted to Rehoboth it will be done &#x201C;without prejudicing any further constitutional developments of the territory of South West Africa&#x201D;. That is very close to what we wanted. Therefore we welcome it, and I am grateful that the hon. the Minister has just said that he will effect that change in the Other Place. However, because he did not want to accept these amendments during the Committee Stage, we stated our standpoint very clearly on four occasions during the Committee Stage. We told the hon. the Minister that we did not want to accept co-responsibility for any hostile propaganda which could stem from the formulation of the Bill. This is also the reason why we asked for a division on some of the amendments.</p>

<p>Since the hon. the Minister is now going to effect these amendments in the Other Place, we feel that it would be wrong of us to oppose the principle of local government in the Third Reading and, as it were, to try to punish the Baster community for any shortcomings for which the Government may be responsible. In any event it is in our opinion only a question of time before this Parliament will no longer have any authority over Rehoboth or the territory of South West Africa. I believe the power will pass into the hands of the people of South West Africa themselves. The sooner this happens, of course, the better. In view of the standpoints which we have made clear at all the stages of the Bill, and in view of the amendments which the hon. the Minister has promised to introduce in the Other Place, we shall not oppose the Third Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, please afford me the opportunity of <span class="col_3773-3774" refersTo="page_0569"/>replying in just a few sentences to the first part of the speech made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, that part in which he referred to that revolutionary and evolutionary situation. The passages I quoted were taken from the hon. member&#x2019;s own newspaper, and if that newspaper reported him incorrectly, he must say so. That is all I want to say about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said it was time the representation of South West Africa in this Parliament was brought to an end. However it is not the United Party that will decide this, neither here nor there. The Federal Party in South West Africa&#x2014;as they call themselves&#x2014;wants the same thing of course, and that is why they have decided never again to oppose a single seat of this Parliament. That is quite understandable, for since 1950 they have never had a single seat in this House of Assembly. But I want to leave this matter at that.</p>

<p>With this legislation we have, in our opinion, reached a new milestone in the history of the territory of Rehoboth. This legislation is indeed a realization of a long cherished ideal. I do not want to delve too deeply into the history, but I just want to refer to a few important dates. Rehoboth had the right of self-determination until it was divested of that right on 26 July 1895 by the defence treaty, in terms of which absolute sovereignty over the territory was with any doubt granted to Germany, and under the provisions of which the German flag was hoisted over the territory. Subsequently they even went so far as to abolish the office of Kaptein completely in 1905. This is further proof that they divested the Rehoboth Basters of even that measure of self-government which they still had. In the place of the Kaptein they appointed a Gemeindevorsteher, as they termed it.</p>

<p>Even the Union Government of the time had many problems because it was not clear at that time precisely what the Rehoboth community wanted. It decided to appoint a White person as magistrate in that territory, who would then automatically be the Kaptein of that territory. In the well-known case, <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Christian</i> of 1922 in the Appellate Division (A.D. 101), it was ruled that South Africa had absolute sovereignty over Rehoboth. We cannot get away from that. The Union Government of the time gradually began to grant Rehoboth a certain measure of self-government over its own affairs. Firstly it promulgated proclamation No. 9 of 1928, which established an Advisory Council of six members, of whom only three were appointed by the Administrator. It was only in 1935 that proclamation No. 5 provided that all six members of that Advisory Council had to be elected. In this way a variety of Governments of the then Union from time to time confirmed the special status of the Rehoboth territory in South West Africa. Throughout its history&#x2014;and I am now speaking with a measure of authority because I have made a special study of this&#x2014;the Rehoboth community was not satisfied with the position in which they found themselves. From time to time they agitated for a greater measure of self-government. Recently, in 1969, they even agitated for full independence. I want to present hon. members with proof of this, for the hon. member for Bezuidenhout denied that they wanted it. I want to quote from <i>The Argus</i> of 20 January 1969. Under the headline &#x201C;Basters seeking independence&#x201D; it was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Council of the Rehoboth Gebiet, homeland of the Basters of South West Africa since 1870, is due to ask the Prime Minister, Mr. B. J. Vorster, today for independence with greater powers than the Transkei. Mr. Vorster, who is on an official visit to Windhoek, agreed to receive a deputation from the council. A spokesman from the dominant People&#x2019;s Party, Mr. Allan Louw, said it had prepared a petition in which it asked for control of justice, commerce, international affairs and immigration. He said the Rehoboth Basters wanted their own Cabinet under a chief minister or prime minister whose designation still had to be decided.</block>

<p>He proceeded to state his case, and subsequently said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The independence petition is the outcome of a series of public meetings held to explain the demands of the Basters.</block>

<p>In other words, as late as 1969 they were still striving after absolute independence. We have now, by way of this legislation, the Third Reading of which we are now dealing with, granted them their inalienable right of self-determination after they had asked us to make their Paternal Law of 1872 applicable to them <span class="col_3775-3776" refersTo="page_0570"/>again. It appeared over the years that it was a sore point with them that this Paternal Law should be regarded as part of their own culture. Therefore I am pleased that specific reference is being made to it in this legislation, in the Preamble. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas it is the desire of the citizens of the &#x201C;Rehoboth Gebiet&#x201D; that self-government be granted to them &#x2026; (a government) &#x2026; will maintain law and order in Rehoboth and will ensure justice to all; will promote the material and spiritual well-being of Rehoboth and its inhabitants; will protect and develop their own traditions and culture; will propagate the ideals of the Christian civilization; and will strive after peace with and goodwill to the other inhabitants of the territory of South West Africa.</block>

<p>They have regarded their own culture and identity throughout as their right of self-determination. That is why we are coming forward with this legislation to restrore to them those ancestral laws&#x2014;whether we agree with them or not&#x2014;for they have a right to self-determination, and for that reason we must give them what they are asking for. That Paternal Law of 1872 is more than a 100 years old, and I do not want to maintain now that the measure of self-government which it confers complies with the modem requirements of a constitution. In fact, I do not think there is any constitution in the world which is drawn up with the object of never being changed. Britain is the only country which has no constitution whatsoever. Its entire administration is based on practice. But consider how many important amendments have had to be effected from time to time to the American Constitution. Just think of our own South Africa Act. How many times has it not been necessary to amend it&#x003F; For this reason I do not want to say that this legislation is absolutely perfect. But at least it lies within their right of self-determination to ask for it. I do not believe that this legislation, as it reads at present, is the alpha and the omega for the Rehoboth community, and it is certainly their full and alienable right to ask this Parliament to amend this legislation from time to time. I would recommend that we comply with their wishes at all times, except if it appears that, as they quarrel among themselves and one party is replaced by another, it is as a result of the whims of one party that they suddenly want a change in the constitution. Then I would say that we should stand by the original legislation. Surely hon. members can understand that it will be of no avail our altering this legislation every year, or whenever another party comes into office.</p>

<p>There are various aspects of this legislation which we would normally not have embodied in a modem constitution at all. Take, for example, the case of the head of Rehoboth, who is called a Kaptein. Among us, in terms of modem constitutional law, reference is made to a Head of State, Prime Minister, Chief Minister, etc. Why, then, is mention made in this legislation of a Kaptein&#x003F; However, it is to a certain extent their right to want it like this. The word &#x201C;minister&#x201D; of course comes from the Latin word <i>ministri,</i> which refers to the office of a minister. That is why we refer in English to a preacher as a &#x201C;minister of religion&#x201D;. Even the word &#x201C;Kaptein&#x201D; has a Latin origin, i.e. <i>capitaneus,</i> which means &#x201C;headman&#x201D;. I could go further and say that the word &#x201C;colonel&#x201D; comes from the French word <i>collonella</i> which means &#x201C;head of a colony&#x201D;. However, they may retain their use of the word &#x201C;kaptein&#x201D;; I do not want to argue about that. In this legislation, for example, we speak of a Kaptein&#x2019;s Council, but in modem constitutional law we would prefer to refer to it as a Cabinet. We have a Cabinet, if we think of our own history, which stems from Britain. The word &#x201C;cabinet&#x201D; had indeed never been mentioned in any Law of the Parliament of Britain, except in the Crown Act of 1937, therefore only recently. It arose as a result of tradition. It is interesting to see how the cabinet system developed there. I am referring to this because I want to return again to the question of the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council. Henry VI who lived between 1422 and 1461, established the Privy Council. I hope the hon. member for Mooi River is here, because it seems to me that he is the only person on the opposite side who knows something of British history. Charles I decided in 1625 to turn the Privy Council into a smaller body because the Privy Council at that stage already consisted of more than 50 members and it was impossible to ensure secrecy in such a big and clumsy body. He then selected a small group which met before the Privy Council meeting, a kind of vestry meeting, and from that the Cabinet system arose. It is interesting to see that <span class="col_3777-3778" refersTo="page_0571"/>originally the Cabinet members were not members of Parliament. Only in the year 1662 did two members of Parliament, Bennet and Coventry, become members of the Cabinet. Until 1714 the King in person was always chairman of the Cabinet. In those years when King George I became king of Britain, he was unable to speak a word of English. At his first Cabinet meeting, because he was unable to speak English, he switched over to German and no one could understand him. Then he switched over to French, but then Robert Walpole could not understand him, and then he switched over to Latin and Lord Somers and Lord Cowper could not understand him. Because they could not understand him, they then appointed a Chief Minister, a Prime Minister, with the name of Lord Walpole to act as chairman of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>I am merely drawing a comparison. At the same time you could learn something. In this way the custom arose of the Prime Minister being the <i>primus inter pares,</i> and so, in fact, our Cabinet system developed.</p>

<p>As regards the question of the House of Assembly, it has many designations. Personally I like the term &#x201C;Volksraad&#x201D;, but it is not used throughout the world. The Americans use the term &#x201C;House of Representatives&#x201D;, the Russians the word &#x201C;Soviet&#x201D; which means a meeting, and the French use the word &#x201C;Assembl&#x00E9;&#x201D;, which also means a meeting. In this way there are many designations one could use. The most important point is that this legislation, if it is passed at the Third Reading, expresses the desires of the Rehoboth community. However much it may perhaps be in conflict with modem constitutional law, it is the duty of this Parliament to give them what they want. Therefore I have no objection whatsoever to their wishing to see these designations, which they have taken from their own culture, applied in this legislation. With reference to the amendments which the hon. the Minister is going to move in the Senate, I want to make one recommendation, and that is in connection with clause 10, in which it is provided that persons over the age of 18 years who have full citizenship rights in accordance with the customs of the &#x201C;Rehoboth Baster community&#x201D; shall have the right to vote. I would recommend that we change the words &#x201C;Baster community&#x201D; to &#x201C;Rehoboth community&#x201D;, because nowhere in this legislation is there a reference to Baster community. I think it is time the Rehoboth people stopped calling themselves Basters, and called themselves Rehobothers. For that reason I would be glad if the hon. the Minister would consider, when he moves that amendment in the Senate, to consider the question of the designation &#x201C;Baster&#x201D; which does not occur anywhere else in the legislation.</p>

<p>Actually, I should like to take issue with the hon. member for Sea Point. He kicked up a great fuss about the so-called 3 000 Damaras. He quoted from something and said that those people had all been born in Rehoboth. I want to tell him that wherever his source for that statement is it is not true. In the second place I want to say this concerning those 3 000 strangers, as I want to call them, who are present in Rehoboth&#x2014;his object was that they should participate in the election of the Advisory Council&#x2014;and he should put this under his pillow tonight so that he can sleep on it. They never had citizenship rights in Rehoboth. In fact, they do not consist of Damaras, but also of Namas, Hereros, and there were even Whites in Rehoboth until recently, and even they did not have citizenship rights. In fact, none of the Damaras and foreign peoples living in Rehoboth&#x2014;and their estimated number is approximately 3 000&#x2014; were ever at any stage regarded as Rehoboth citizens, but worked for the Rehoboth citizens on their farms. They were servants, and that is the reason why there is in Rehoboth at the moment an entire residential area in which they are living separate from the Rehoboth people.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Sea Point has in the meantime ascertained what language the Damaras speak. Has the hon. member ascertained that&#x003F; I hope so. The hon. member for Rondebosch kicked up a great fuss about this legislation allegedly having been requested by a so-called minority party, and I think the hon. member for Sea Point also mentioned something <span class="col_3779-3780" refersTo="page_0572"/>of the kind during the Second Reading. I think that if we speak in terms of democracy, we should not concern ourselves too much about minority parties. We have three parties in this House. In 1968, during the election in Italy there were 73 registered parties that participated in that election. How many of them were not in the minority&#x003F; Nor should we claim, when the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council or the Legislative Council differ when they pass legislation as they inevitably will, that the world is coming to an end. This is the ordinary democratic process. We may say this in favour of the late Winston Churchill, i.e. that in 1942 he earned himself the distinction of obtaining the greatest majority in a motion of no confidence which any person had ever obtained in a motion of confidence, namely 464 votes to one. I want to refer to another interesting aspect, viz. how things can change. In 1874 the Earl of Halsbury was a candidate in the electoral division of Launceton in Britain, and received only &#x201C;a single vote&#x201D;, and the suspicion exists that that vote was cast by none other than himself. What is strange is that five years later he was returned unopposed in the same electoral division. That is how rapidly things can change. The hon. member for Rondebosch, and also the hon. member for Sea Point kicked up an enormous fuss about the rights of the requests of the minority not having been taken into consideration. Does the hon. member not know that one of the most important pieces of legislation in the world was passed with the smallest majority imaginable&#x003F; I want to refer for example to the Reform Act of 1832 of Britain, which extended the franchise to the ordinary member of the public. It cost seven night sittings, 71 members participated in the debate, and at the Second Reading the measure was passed with a majority of only one vote&#x2014;302 votes to 301. And no one is annoyed about that today. That just goes to show how they felt about the matter at that time. We are living in a changing world. Often there is an equality of votes. If this should happen in the case of Rehoboth, we should not be annoyed about it. We shall simply have to realize that this is part of our democratic process. The first equality of votes in a division which I was able to trace in British history was that of 14 June 1610. However, it is interesting to note that the Speaker of the time, when he had to use his casting vote, had to declare why he exercised his casting vote on one side or the other. In 1673 there was a motion in the House of Commons that the House do adjourn. On that occasion Mr. Speaker&#x2019;s simple explanation as to why he had exercised his casting vote in favour of the adjournment was this: &#x201C;Because I am hungry and I should like to have my dinner.&#x201D;</p>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker in the remaining ten minutes I should still like to complete my speech. We need not find all our examples in England. There were similar examples in our own country. I should like to bring this matter closer to Rehoboth, for then the hon. member for Rondebosch would also be able to understand it better. In this Parliament&#x2014;I am referring now to the Other Place, which consists of a small group of members and where there has frequently been an equality of votes&#x2014;an hon. member by the name of Friedlander moved a private Bill in 1941. When that Bill was eventually put to the vote during the Report Stage, the division was equal, 49 as against 49, and the Speaker had to exercise his casting in the manner described in the Standing Orders, to ensure that the matter was taken further and then negatived. In this way the Speaker still exercises his casting vote today. It was interesting to note that&#x2014;when this specific matter was put to the vote a second time&#x2014;the division was once again equal, 52 as against 52. Whereupon an hon. member requested that the House adjourn. Fortunately his motion was passed by 46 votes to 45.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what I should also like to say in regard to the legislation we now have before us&#x2014;and I must make haste because I see that time is marching on&#x2014;is that we have with this reached a very important milestone in the history of Rehoboth. I believe that in future Rehoboth and its inhabitants will be very grateful for this historical Bill which the hon. the Minister presented to this House. Since provision is in the first place being made&#x2014;and I find this commendable&#x2014;for a flag and a national anthem of their own, I asked myself why we were giving them these things. I mentioned a moment ago the long struggle of many years between the two groups of people in Rehoboth. First the one group was on top <span class="col_3781-3782" refersTo="page_0573"/>and then the other. So it went on. Now I want to say that this provision in the Bill, by means of which Rehoboth is being given a flag and a national anthem of its own, is the only method by means of which true unity can be brought about in Rehoboth. If this cannot be done successfully by way of this provision, that desired unity in Rehoboth will not be brought about by anything in the world. This Bill makes provision for the people of Rehoboth to be able to develop their own cultural heritage and their own pride, pride for their flag and their national anthem, a pride which is intended for every citizen of Rehoboth.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the Rehoboth community, the citizens of Rehoboth, on this important beacon which they have reached on their journey. I want to congratulate them on having become a nation with an identity of its own. Through this legislation we have set the seal on it, a special seal. I know the people of South West Africa, and I can only say that I do not know of any of the peoples of South West Africa who are not exceptionally proud of their own identity and who would not like to preserve their own identity. I am referring now to the Damaras, the Hereros, the Ovambos and all the others. Each of these peoples wishes to preserve its own identity, and this legislation affords the citizens of Rehoboth an opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>As I regard the matter, this legislation will not only have an influence in Rehoboth itself. As this legislation is aplied by the people of Rehoboth, as unity is established in Rehoboth, as political stability develops, as their political stability results in economic stability and as Rehoboth develops &#x2026; Believe me, Rehoboth has a tremendous potential; we need only consider the possibilities which mining there offers. There is gold and various other minerals. Rehoboth could become one of the richest areas in South West Africa. At present there are two mines which are being operated in the area. Both those mines could be expanded tremendously if the necessary capital were placed at their disposal. The local development corporation is also doing &#x2026;</p>

<p>Oh please, if that hon. member would only listen, he might perhaps learn something for once in his life. It is obvious that he does not even want to do that. Mr. Speaker, just the river which flows through Rehoboth alone presents tremendous possibilities. If a dam were to be built there, it would be possible to apply large-scale irrigation. Small farms and riparian plots, such as those situated around many of the larger dams in the Republic, could also be established there. This could contribute considerably to the development of Rehoboth. Thousands of people would be able to settle there and live prosperous lives.</p>

<p>I also believe that this legislation&#x2014;and with this I want to conclude&#x2014;will also serve as a guide-line for other population groups of South West Africa. The wonderful example Rehoboth is setting will encourage them to turn to this Parliament with the request that we should help them, too, to preserve their identities. It is not only Wambo that has that right. Nor does that right belong exclusively to Kavango. I believe that the Damaras, the Hereros, the Namas and all the other peoples of South West Africa also have that right. This will also be granted to Caprivi this year.</p>

<p>I believe that with this legislation Rehoboth will be able to set the pace, Rehoboth will be able to take the lead and will develop to the well-being of every man, woman and child in that territory.</p>

<p>But I should now like to make a request to hon. members on the opposite side of the House&#x2014;and in particular the members of the Progressive Party&#x2014;not to disparage this legislation, not to shoot the piano player. In that way things will never work out. If they did that, they would not only be doing the people of Rehoboth a disservice, they would also be doing each separate population group of South West Africa a disservice. The hon. members can take my word for it that we, the White representatives of South West Africa, have no intention of leaving. We are going to stay there. Not only are we going to stay there to maintain the White civilization, but also to ensure that it is made possible for each non-White population group to exercise its own rights, its human rights, its right of self-determination. The right of self-determination, as I have already said, is one of the principal rights of mankind. People can only be free and enjoy their human freedom if they have the right of self-determination.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we listened with pleasure and interest to the speech of the hon. member for Middelland yesterday afternoon. Although we might not have agreed with every word that he said, we want to concede that what he said, was not controversial, or not sufficiently controversial in any event for me to want to have a controversy about it this afternoon. Consequently we should like to express our appreciation for the special knowledge displayed by him, and for the interesting nature of his contribution. Mr. Speaker, the concession you allowed the hon. member might have been somewhat wide, but it meets with the approval of this side of the House because we enjoyed his contribution so much. We listened, with special interest to the hon. member for Middelland&#x2019;s discussion of Rehoboth affairs, and also to his references in connection therewith, which covered a much wider field.</p>

<p>Since this is an exceptional day in the sense that I am inclined to praise hon. members on the opposite side, I should also like to say that we welcomed it that the hon. the Minister was prepared to make certain concessions yesterday which we regard as being of vital importance to South Africa as a whole, particularly in view of its relations with countries abroad.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, the Bill which we are discussing today at Third Reading has certain problems inherent in its formulation and its content. We have discussed these now at some length, and we have pointed out that these difficulties which have arisen are both of a practical nature, in some respects, and of a constitutional nature, in others. During the Second Reading and the Committee Stage we drew attention to certain difficulties which we feel are implicit in the way in which this Bill has been formulated. We are not yet entirely satisfied that all these difficulties have been overcome. It is not a perfect Bill, but then how often does any Parliament pass a perfect Bill&#x003F; As I have said, we congratulate the hon. the Minister on the concessions he made yesterday. We believe that these go quite a long way to improving not only the content of the Bill, but also certain constitutional implications which arise from the Bill or which might be thought or seen to arise from the Bill. We believe, therefore, that by and large, on balance, and taking all these things into account, this is a Bill which we can support at Third Reading and which, in fact, we shall support at Third Reading.</p>

<p>The main considerations by which I think one should be guided in respect of a Bill of this kind are the following: Firstly, do the people of Rehoboth want this Bill&#x003F; We spend a great deal of time talking about self-determination, the right of peoples to decide their own destiny, and so forth. When we profess these principles I think we must have a real regard for what people want and not so much regard for what we might tend to think they should want. On balance, having considered the evidence, having heard the views of the people concerned and having discussed this with them, we feel that a fair case has been made out for this legislation. It is not necessarily a 100% case in respect of all the people who occupy that area, but there is a clear balance of advantage in favour of the conclusion that the people of Rehoboth do want a Bill of this nature. The second question we must ask ourselves is this: Is this Bill consistent with what is being done in South West Africa to achieve a constitutional agreement for the future of South West Africa&#x003F; Again, one can express certain reservations. Some of these reservations have been expressed by people who actually are participating in the constitutional conference. Other reservations have been reported in the Press. Statements have been made which do indicate that there is not <span class="col_3785-3786" refersTo="page_0575"/>yet total consensus on this matter. Nevertheless, we have had before us and we have discussed a declaration of intent which was produced by the members participating in the constitutional conference. If one examines this, one must conclude that the people who have signed this declaration of intent, including the representatives of Rehoboth, do not believe, on balance, that this Bill, which the latter have asked for, is inconsistent with their declaration of intent which they have signed as members of the constitutional conference. So, however much one may argue the details, it does seem that on balance, and in the main, the intent of the Rehoboth people to participate in the constitutional development of South West Africa is not seen by them nor, in the main, by the other participants, as being inconsistent with the terms of this Bill. In this regard we have been greatly encouraged by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s suggested amendments. We believed at the outset, and we believe more strongly now, that the hon. the Minister is in fact a reasonable man.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I would agree; that is what I am trying to say. The hon. the Minister, if he wishes, is a sport. He has seen the advantage of making certain changes to this Bill which will ease its passage, which will make it more acceptable and which will make it less thorny in its international aspects. In doing so I believe he has shown a broadminded and constructive approach which we on this side of the House greatly welcome. I think the third question we must ask ourselves is whether this Bill is in conflict with our international commitments in respect of South West Africa. One may examine this Bill as carefully as one likes, and one will not find anything in the Bill itself, in the actual wording of the Bill, as the hon. the Minister has pointed out and as we have agreed, which is in verbal conflict with our international commitments. If any conflicts should arise, it would be by implication rather than in the actual meaning of the words. One would have to look to external constructions placed upon this Bill rather than to the internal content of it if one were to look for such a conflict with our international obligations.</p>

<p>However, having said this, we have nevertheless thought it wise to make this even more clear by moving certain amendments and we still think it wise that those further amendments should be accepted, because they would take this Bill entirely out of the area of controversy which might surround it in the atmosphere which is prevalent at the UNO. Nevertheless, the hon. the Minister has, as I have said, agreed to certain amendments which I think will go a very long way towards meeting that difficulty. We very strongly welcome the amendments which he intends moving.</p>

<p>The last consideration is one which we obviously have had to look at. It is perhaps a slightly different one from those I have been discussing. We also have had to ask ourselves whether the Bill is consistent with our own policy, whether it is consistent with our own attitude in regard to the future of South West Africa. Without going into the detail of our federal policy, which will not necessarily be the same in South West Africa as it is in the Republic, nor would we wish to impose it in South West Africa where a separate option is to be exercised by a separate people, I must point out that we do think that there are certain fundamentals which need to be looked at. The first fundamental is the question whether it provides for the protection of minorities by giving them adequate control over their own affairs. In that respect we believe that the Bill meets that condition, whether or not the people of South West Africa choose a federal solution. We think they will, because the signs are that they are moving in that direction. However, if they wish to choose a federal direction, then we believe there is nothing in this Bill and certainly nothing in respect of the protection of, or the need to defend, the interests of minorities which is in conflict with that federal solution.</p>

<p>Secondly, as regards the decentralization of power we believe that any solution which will protect the rights of minorities, which will produce an acceptable solution to all the people of South West Africa and enable them to work together, must provide, amongst other things, for the decentralization of power: of executive, of legislative and, if necessary, even of judicial power so that the people may have the feeling that they are running their <span class="col_3787-3788" refersTo="page_0576"/>own affairs without interference in those matters which essentially concern themselves alone. In this respect, again, we feel that this Bill is not in conflict with that principle.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of geographical content. Geographical content is not something which is always attainable in total, because people in a modern world tend to move around and to settle in other areas or are compelled by industrial needs to move from their original area into other areas. This is a situation with which we are familiar in South Africa and a strong move in this direction is beginning to show itself also in South West Africa. However, to the extent that people can be given a geographical base, we believe it is important because it does help to establish a local jurisdiction and a sense of identity. Here again we believe that in giving local self-government to the people of Rehoboth to be exercised in their own area, it meets this very important criterion.</p>

<p>If there are hon. members in this House who still have reservations about this Bill, I think they should measure the merits of this Bill against the federal policy, concept or philosophy which is going to play a major part in the evolution of this sub-continent of ours. Eventually the question of representation in a central authority arises, because whichever way the constitutional evolution of South West Africa moves, there will be a need in South West Africa as there will be in South Africa, for the people who have the exercise of local self-government in their own areas, to work together and to agree on those matters which are of acknowledged common concern to them all. There is nothing in this Bill, as we read it, that precludes that happening. We believe there is nothing which precludes the people of Rehoboth, enjoying the rights of local self-government and enjoying their own institutions even under their paternalistic laws, modified as they may be in the course of time, from participating, firstly, in the constitutional talks that are now going on&#x2014;it may actually aid them to do so more effectively&#x2014;and, secondly, in a government established, if the people of South West Africa wish it, to look after the joint interests of all the people who live in South West Africa.</p>

<p>Therefore, in conclusion, we have looked hard and carefully at this Bill, and we have pointed out, at the Second Reading and at the Committee Stage, those imperfections which we thought should be remedied. We are grateful to the hon. the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations, for being willing to see our difficulties and for being willing to co-operate with us in a constructive way to overcome these difficulties. Although this Bill is no more perfect than any other Bill passed in any other Parliament&#x2014;there is no such thing as perfection&#x2014;it goes a long way towards meeting the basic requirements which I have outlined. We shall therefore have pleasure in supporting this Bill at the Third Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we moved a reasoned amendment to the Second Reading of this Bill and in that reasoned amendment we stated a number of points on the basis of which we objected to the Second Reading of the Bill. Some of these objections relate to issues which have again been raised by the hon. member for Von Brandis. I am not going to deal with them immediately, but I hope to deal with them during the course of my speech. The points we made in support of our objection to the Second Reading of this Bill, was because it was contrary to the stated policy of the Government that it would respect the wishes of the whole population of South West Africa and that it was for the inhabitants of South West Africa to decide their own future. This was our major point of objection. The second objection related to the fact that we felt there was insufficient evidence that the people of Rehoboth themselves accepted the contents of this Bill and that there was also insufficient evidence that the other population groups of South West Africa accepted this Bill as well. The arguments I presented during the Second Reading as well as during the Committee Stage have not been refuted or adequately considered by the Government or by the official Opposition. Rather than stating the arguments again in detail, I should like briefly to restate some of the major points which I made then. Against the background of these points I should then like to make some comment on the amendments which, as the hon. the Minister mentioned yesterday, it was his intention to move in the Other Place.</p>

<p>The first objection in our amendment relates to a fundamental point of policy in which a clear principle is involved. Negatively stated, this principle says that it is inappropriate for <span class="col_3789-3790" refersTo="page_0577"/>this Parliament independently to negotiate with a particular population group in the South West African territory. Positively stated, the principle says that it is for the population in South West Africa as a whole to decide their own future. Within this policy context it is in fact irrelevant whether the constitutional arrangements proposed in this Bill correspond to the policy of any particular party in this Parliament. I know the hon. member for Von Brandis makes quite a strong issue of the fact that the official Opposition feels that this Bill corresponds more or less to their declared policy. However, if this is so, it is more of a pleasant coincidence than having any significance. The real significance is whether the constitutional provisions of this Bill correspond to the evolving policy of the people of South West Africa. This is the crucial test, and in a sense it is irrelevant whether it corresponds to the particular political policy of any party in this Parliament. Secondly, it is also irrelevant whether the parties in the South African Parliament are satisfied that the constitutional arrangements in the Bill correspond to the wishes of the particular population group concerned. Of course, it would be callous of us to say that we do not take the wishes of any population group into consideration. What is important, is whether the contents of this Bill correspond to the wishes not only of the people concerned themselves, but also of the other population groups in South West Africa. The question is not whether we here are satisfied, but whether they there as a whole population, are satisfied.</p>

<p>If that is the case, the hon. the Prime Minister can indicate this to me, but I have studied the context very carefully. The point I want to make is that it is also irrelevant, within this policy context that I have just mentioned, whether this Bill enables the Rehoboth people to become independent, sovereign, self-governing or with a local administration. The reason why I say this is because some of these aspects appear to have become contentious during the Second Reading of the Bill as well as during the Committee Stage. We have had some remarkable arguments <span class="col_3791-3792" refersTo="page_0578"/>from members on the opposite side when they tried, laboriously, to distinguish between self-government, independence, sovereignty, etc., and many of these arguments were so tortuous that a number of these members ended up gazing rather despairingly and confusedly through the orifices of their own assumptions. These arguments did not make any sense to us. This is because the contentious issue during the Second Reading was not relevant within the context of this particular Parliament.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! May I point out to the hon. member that what is relevant today is the Third Reading&#x2014;in other words, the Bill as it comes from Second Reading and after having been dealt with in detail in the Committee Stage. That is what is before this House and that is all that is relevant.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I accept your ruling, Mr. Speaker, but I did mention that I was going to discuss this Bill against the background of the amendments mentioned by the hon. the Minister himself, amendments relating to our objection to the Second Reading and that I would explain whether we regard these amendments as bringing about any significant change in the contents of the Bill. The point I am trying to make is that if the people of South West Africa should negotiate with the Rehoboth people and eventually end up with one of these possibilities, viz. independence, self-government or sovereignty, then obviously we have no objection. We do object if this is done between the South African Parliament and a particular population group in South West Africa. If this is the case we have an objection in principle against declared policy. The second objection that we raised relates to the amendments mentioned by the hon. the Minister. This refers to the fact that we find that evidence is inadequate or insufficient on the question of the acceptability of this Bill to the Rehoboth people themselves as well as to the rest of the population in South West Africa. The first aspect of our second objection, namely the acceptability of this particular Bill for the people of Rehoboth themselves, is something I have argued extensively during the Second Reading, as well as during the Committee Stage, and there seems to be a fundamental point of disagreement on this between me and the hon. the Minister as well as the hon. member for Middelland. The hon. member for Middelland yesterday treated us to a truncated and rather eclectic account of British constitutional history, generously spiced with Ripley-like &#x201C;can you believe it&#x003F;&#x201D; anecdotes about voting patterns and voting deadlocks, the relevance of which I still fail to see as far as this Bill is concerned.</p>

<p>What this objection is fundamentally concerned with is the difference in purpose and in consequence between a by-election and a referedum, and the point that I repeatedly tried to make was that there is a difference, that if one tries to fill vacancies during a by-election, other aspects, other issues, come into play in the political process than when one confronts a population group with a clear-cut choice in terms of which they have to answer &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;No&#x201D;. The hon. member for Middelland, as well as the hon. the Minister, refused to accept this distinction for the purposes of this particular Bill.</p>

<p>The second aspect of our second objection was the question of the acceptability of this particular Bill and its provisions for the other population groups in South West Africa. I have stated that there has not been sufficient evidence given before this House to the effect that the rest of the population of South West Africa were adequately confronted with the contents of this Bill and were given an opportunity to express their support for this Bill. In that respect I find no reason why we should change our position. Our amendment and our objections are based on the principles of policy, rather than on the intrinsic merits of what is envisaged by this Bill. We do not deny any people the freedom or the right to ask for self-government. We do not deny them the right to commit themselves to their traditions and to their culture, but we do object when the very constitutional future of a country, faced by the most serious problems confronting any society in southern Africa, is contaminated or jeopardized by the actions of this Parliament, who in the first and final analysis is responsible for the effective solution of the problems of that society as well.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to return to the amendments mentioned by the hon. the Minister himself yesterday. These amendments have been accepted by the official Opposition with alacrity and with a great deal of enthusiasm. There are only two that could possibly be <span class="col_3793-3794" refersTo="page_0579"/>controversial. The first one relates to the fact., that within the long title of the Bill the word &#x201C;in&#x201D; is to be substituted by the word &#x201C;within&#x201D;. According to the dictionary definition, &#x201C;in&#x201D; is a preposition referring to the inclusion within space, time or circumstances of a particular aspect. If, in terms of the rules of definition and logic, one enquires into the meaning of &#x201C;within&#x201D;, one comes up with exactly the same kind of reply. So this is nothing but a semantic subterfuge. It does not change the logical contents of the Bill. It does not add any new dimension to it, but simply serves to placate the doubts that might have arisen in the minds of some of the members of the official Opposition. These doubts originated out of the content of the argument rather than from the intrinsic consequences of the Bill itself.</p>

<p>The second amendment of the hon. the Minister refers to the fact that in the preamble of the Bill it is stated that this Bill will in no way jeopardize any further constitutional developments for the area of South West Africa as a whole. Our whole argument was based not on what the future consequences of this Bill would be after it came into force, but on what the present consequences would be of introducing a Bill of this nature. Both amendments, therefore, only seem to serve the purpose of placating the official Opposition. While I understand why they accept it, I still maintain that in the last analysis these arguments become irrelevant in terms of the statement of policy on South West Africa. Therefore, not reluctantly, but if anything with added conviction, we feel that we cannot support the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I gladly take this opportunity of congratulating the hon. member for Von Brandis on his very reasonable approach to the Bill now before the House and to thank him for his congratulatory remarks as far as the hon. the Minister is concerned, and also for his support of the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>*But while one has great appreciation for the standpoint of the official Opposition in supporting this Bill, there are nevertheless a few matters which one cannot allow to pass without further comment.</p>

<p>In his Second Reading speech the hon. member for Bezuidenhout stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bill which is now before us supports the principle of increased local government.</block>

<p>Throughout the Second Reading, as well as the Third Reading speech, the hon. member consistently referred to the effect of this Bill as ostensibly being nothing more than the granting of increased local government to the people of Rehoboth. The hon. member could or would simply not perceive that what is involved in this Bill is for more than simply the granting of increased self-administration, and that what is involved in this Bill is in fact the granting of self-government to the people of Rehoboth on the basis of the Paternal Act of 1872. It is after all more than clear to any objective observer that the authorities and powers which are set out in the schedule to the Bill, comprise far more than purely local government powers. After this hon. member, and other hon. members of the official Opposition who had supported him in this standpoint, had repeatedly been corrected on this score in the Second Reading debate, and it had repeatedly been pointed out that on the fundamental issue this Bill was the right of the people of Rehoboth to self-determination and self-government, they introduced a series of amendments in the Committee Stage which were obviously aimed at watering down this Bill to such and extent that it was more or less in line with their preconceived interpretation of it, i.e. that what was involved in this Bill was merely local government.</p>

<p>In support of one of the amendments, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout used the argument that legislation of this House relating to South West Africa, was examined with a fine-toothed comb, as it were, and that it was therefore necessary to stress very clearly in the Bill that the unity of the territory of South West Africa was not being infringed by it. However, the hon. the Minister in his reply to the Second Reading debate clearly spelt out that this Bill aims at or implies nothing more than is stated in it in so many words. This Bill implies nothing more nor anything less than self-government for the people of Rehoboth. Any objective judge ought to be convinced by it that there cannot in this Bill, be any possibility of the granting of separate independence to Rehoboth or of the breach of any assurance which has been given by the Government concerning South West Africa. What better authority could be desired for the <span class="col_3795-3796" refersTo="page_0580"/>motivation or the effect of the Bill than the clear statement of the responsible hon. Minister&#x003F; Certainly not the misgivings of hon. members of the Opposition. In this respect I should like to refer the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to the reaction to a statement of his former leader, a statement which was also made in this hon. House. In a speech in this House in July 1925 the late Genl. Smuts made a most sensational statement concerning the relationship between the then Union and the territory of South West Africa. Although this statement was broached at the ninth session of the Permanent Mandate Commission, the commission&#x2014;in view of the fact that Genl. Smuts was not a member of the Union Government in 1925&#x2014;did not consider it desirable to make a formal statement on what was the opinion of a private individual. This was how it was interpreted. This is the reaction in international forums to statements of hon. members of the Opposition.</p>

<p>However, there is little, if anything, which can be done to prevent ill-disposed people from seeing malevolent motives or objectives in this Bill. As has already been said by an hon. member in the course of the Second Reading debate, the spider draws its poison from the same flower from which the bee extracts its honey. It simply depends on the attitude with which the Bill is approached. Nevertheless, the hon. Minister himself effected certain amendments to the wording of the Bill, to spell out what already was clear, even more clearly. Therefore, the responsibility for any misinterpretation of the motivation and objectives of the Bill will now rest squarely upon the shoulders of the ill-disposed people.</p>

<p>If ever there were a Bill which had been built upon a sound foundation, then it is this Bill. What could be a better basis for legislation of this kind than the emphatic request of the people concerned and the recognition of a people&#x2019;s right of self-determination&#x003F;</p>

<p>However, the hon. member for Rondebosch is questioning the fact that this Bill has the support of the people of Rehoboth. He is suggesting that the reinstatement of the paternal laws is taking place at the request of a minority of the people of Rehoboth.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I never said that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Now the hon. member is saying that he never said that, but he waxed lyrical here about the percentage of votes polled by the different parties in Rehoboth during the elections. With that he implied that there was no proof&#x2014;he has just repeated it in his speech&#x2014;that there is a majority in favour of this legislation in Rehoboth. It is of no avail to try to bluff one another with words here. Surely the clear implication of the hon. member&#x2019;s whole argument was that we have no proof that there is a majority in favour of this legislation. To allege now that he did not say this, is merely to play with words.</p>

<p>As I have indicated, the hon. member implied that the reinstatement of the Paternal Law of 1872 was taking place at the request of a minority of the people of Rehoboth. He criticized the hon. the Minister because a referendum had not been held on this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that I said, but I did not say what you alleged just before that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>This is a very na&#x00EF;ve argument. Surely the hon. member knows that Parliamentary democracy does not work in this way. The hon. member may argue equally well that a prior referendum should be held on any other legislation for the implementation of Government policy, for otherwise it would not be clear whether the majority of the electorate supports the legislation in question. After all, this is why every party has to set out its policy during elections or at least ought to set it out, i.e. so that support for the party at the ballot box may be regarded as approval for the implementation of the policy of that party, by legislation or otherwise. In this way the parties of Rehoboth during the most recent election also adopted standpoints on the reinstatement of the Paternal Law of 1872. It became clear that, apart from differences in respect of other matters, the overwhelming majority of the enfranchised people of Rehoboth were in favour of the reinstatement of the Paternal Law, and they still are. Consequently it is hardly realistic to expect that the opinion of the people of Rehoboth should be tested by means of a referendum on this matter.</p>

<p>During the course of his speech the hon. member for Rondebosch also remarked that <span class="col_3797-3798" refersTo="page_0581"/>the Bill is not supported by all the people of Rehoboth. I do not want to quote him out of context, but, he did make that statement. I only want to say that I cannot believe that the hon. member expects that all the people of Rehoboth who have the vote should express their support for the reinstatement of the Paternal Law before we continue with the present Bill. After all where in the world has there ever been 100% support for any measure&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I agree.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says he agrees, but he made that statement nevertheless.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also intimated that he agreed that the desires of the people of Rehoboth should be complied with as far as possible. It is not clear to me precisely what the hon. member meant by the qualification &#x201C;as far as possible&#x201D;. To me it seems suspect and very much like a repudiation of the principle of the right of self-determination which every nation has. But since the hon. member and his party is supporting this Bill, a Bill which is a clear manifestation of the right of the people of Rehoboth to self-determination, it does seem as though the hon. member does not want to take his aforesaid qualification too far and that does after all endorse the principle of self-determination. Therefore I shall leave his remarks at that.</p>

<p>I am sorry the hon. member for Houghton is not here at the moment, because I should also like to address a few remarks to her. If she is interested, she could look it up in Hansard, or otherwise other hon. members could convey it to her. Why this hon. member participated in the Second Reading debate, was even less clear to me after her speech than before. What was clear, however, was that she had no knowledge, neither of the people of Rehoboth nor of the background to this legislation. For her information I should like to quote briefly from the official year book for 1975 states. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hulle is &#x2019;n enige gemeenskap. Daar kleef geen smaad aan die benaming &#x201C;Basters&#x201D; nie. By geboorte word lede van die Re-hobothgemeenskap op hul eie versoek as &#x201C;Rehoboth-basters&#x201D; geregistreer. Etnologies is hulle &#x2019;n gemengde groep &#x2026; maar hulle dring daarop aan dat hulle as &#x2019;n</block>

<p>afsonderlike gemeenskap erken word. Hulle praat byna almal Afrikaans en is afstammelinge van &#x2026; Blankes en Namas. Die Basters het die Oranjerivier in nagenoeg 1868 oorgesteek om hulle in Suidwes Afrika te vestig. Die gebied wat hulle betree het, het lank gebuk gegaan onder verwoestende stamoorlo&#x00EB; tussen die Namas en die Herero&#x2019;s wat sedert die 19de eeu in &#x2019;n voortdurende onderlinge stryd verkeer het. Die Basters was nietemin vanaf die jaar 1871 <i>de facto</i> in beheer van die Rehoboth Gebiet.</p>

<p>From this it becomes irrefutably clear that, firstly, the community of Rehoboth is a remarkable and practically unique community and can hardly be dealt with on the same basis as other peoples or population groups. It is a group of people with an identity, tradition, history and structure of their own. They are proud and jealous of their distinctiveness and their own identity. A second fact which becomes clear from this, is that the Paternal Law of 1872 dates back to the period immediately after the settlement of the Basters at Rehoboth and may therefore rightfully be regarded as their constitution. It is no subsequent, incidental law which had simply been accepted in passing. On the contrary, it is indeed the constitutional foundation of the community of Rehoboth. Thirdly: The people of Rehoboth have been in <i>de facto</i> control of the Rehoboth area since 1871 and the present Bill is now granting judicial recognition to this factual situation. When it is taken into consideration in the face of what onslaughts and under what difficult circumstances the people of Rehoboth have maintained their <i>de facto</i> control over the years, they definitely have every right now to claim <i>de jure</i> recognition of what has factually existed for many years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to repeat what I said in my Second Reading speech, i.e. that this Bill is a progressive action which testifies to faith in the people of Rehoboth and which creates wonderful new vistas of self-realization for them. For that reason I gladly support the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I followed the speech of the hon. member for Mossel Bay with great interest, and in general <span class="col_3799-3800" refersTo="page_0582"/>I do not find any fault with his view of the background of Rehoboth. It is correct and I agree with him wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>I want to comment in passing on the points which the hon. member for Rondebosch made and upon which the PRP&#x2019;s opposition to this Bill is based. As I understood the hon. member for Rondebosch, their chief objections were the following: Firstly, that the other nations in South West were not consulted about Rehoboth. I think the hon. member for Rondebosch went even further by saying that the other nations or communities of South West oppose this Bill. [Interjections.] I am speaking under correction, but this is the impression I received.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I said that there was no evidence that it was acceptable to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that there is no evidence that it is acceptable to them. However, the criterion the hon. member for Rondebosch should have used, was not whether there was evidence of acceptability, but whether there was any sign that the other nations in South West opposed the Bill. It is very clear that the Bill was published quite some time ago. There was therefore sufficient opportunity, if any of the other groups in South West had felt so strongly that they were convinced that the granting of self-government to Rehoboth in terms of this legislation was contrary to their own conception of South West, to register their opposition to this Bill. However, I am unaware of any opposition to the Bill having been expressed at all, whether by the conference or any other body or person in South West. This is as I know the situation there, and it therefore seems to me that in fact this point, upon which the hon. member for Rondebosch has based his opposition, is not valid.</p>

<p>The second point of opposition was that the other people resident in Rehoboth&#x2014;the few thousand Damaras and others&#x2014;were not consulted in this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not say that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I apologize. It was the hon. member for Sea Point who said that. However, I think that the hon. member for Rondebosch repeated it. Naturally, in a certain sense one would of course have preferred everyone to be consulted, but if one knows the history of Rehoboth and knows the attachment of the Rehoboth nation to their territory, it nevertheless seems that the argument that a minority group which is resident there on a largely temporary basis and will therefore not have a permanent say there, should give an opinion on the future of the area, is not valid either. When I consider the Bantu homelands and the policy of the party to which the hon. member for Rondebosch belongs, I want to say at once that since the homelands are also going to play a part in that party&#x2019;s policy, the PRP will surely not let the future of the homelands, in terms of their policy, be determined by a small minority of people belonging to other tribes or even by a small group of Whites who may be resident in the homelands.</p>

<p>The third point which the hon. member raised was that although the Rehobothers were consulted, in fact there was no proof that the vast majority of the people supported the Bill. Although I respect this standpoint, nevertheless in essence it attests to a lack of knowledge concerning the whole course of history we are dealing with in the case of the Rehobothers. I shall return to this later.</p>

<p>The fourth point was that this Parliament was not competent to take matters into its own hands in connection with any measure in respect of any specific group in South West. At this stage this Parliament is the only competent body which can act in this connection; no other body has that power. The measure being adopted by means of the Bill, does not in any way hinder any future negotiations which the Rehobothers may conduct with whatever authority may come into being in South West. It will be possible for negotiations to be conducted with such an authority about the constitutional future of Rehoboth or that of the whole of South West. It therefore seems to me that there are no grounds for this argument either.</p>

<p>What seems very strange to me, is the statement by the hon. member that the policy in respect of South West which any of the parties in this House may have is not really to the point. This is a point which escapes me entirely, because if it had in fact been a well-formed argument, we should nevertheless have to say that neither the Government, nor <span class="col_3801-3802" refersTo="page_0583"/>my party, nor the PRP had the right to formulate any constitutional policy. What is strange to me, is the fact that although this is the hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint, a few months back the PRP itself presented constitutional proposals for South Africa and, by implication, for South West Africa too.</p>

<p>I now want to return to the argument concerning the lack of relevancy, that is, if I understood the hon. member for Rondebosch correctly. If I understand the constitutional policy of the PRP correctly, the basis of it is, in the first place, a geographical federation. Therefore, if we assume that in essence or to a very large extent, the conditions in South Africa correspond to the fundamental situation in South West, and that we are struggling here, as we are there, with the problem of effecting a political reconciliation among a large number of groups within one constitutional context, then surely the situation in South West is relevant, and the policy is relevant too. In the first place, as I have already said, the PRP&#x2019;s policy is based on a geographic federation. This is put very clearly as the fundamental point of departure of that party&#x2019;s policy. The PRP has also put it very clearly that their policy differs in that respect from the policy of this party. I cannot imagine anything better than this very type of legislation for the purpose of affording the Rehoboth Gebiet, the greatest possible degree of integration in a broader political federal structure based on the geographic concept, particularly in view of the course of its history. This therefore gives effect to the policy of the PRP.</p>

<p>A second principle which is basic to the policy of the PRP, is the recognition of the right of existence of minority groups. It is the recognition of the right of every minority group to uphold its culture and its identity. Surely this is very clearly stated in their proposals In this connection I also want to point out that this Bill constitutes a striking implementation of that same principle, because what we are doing by means of the Bill, is granting recognition to the Rehobothers as a group. We are also giving them the opportunity to maintain themselves, their culture and their identity.</p>

<p>A third principle which is basic to the policy of the PRP, is that there will be a large-scale decentralization of power. It is clearly stated in their policy that the chief element in their geographic federation, is the existence of several states. This is clear in their proposals that &#x201C;the maximum legislative, judicial and executive powers&#x201D; be granted to the government of every state. In all honesty, Mr. Speaker, this, after all, is all that is being done here. Under the circumstances, maximum legislative, judicial and executive powers are being granted to the people of Rehoboth. If we were now to accept the argument that it is totally irrelevant which policies a party advocates and applies in respect of this matter, then I want to ask: What contribution did these constitutional proposals by the PRP make in respect of the whole situation&#x003F; If we may use the concept &#x201C;irrelevancy&#x201D; in respect of South West, then we can also use it in respect of the Republic itself.</p>

<p>Nonsense!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the comment which I want to make on those points. Therefore, in all honesty, I want to say that to me, the particular points which the hon. member for Rondebosch stated and upon which his objections to the Bill are based, indeed lack any validity in this connection.</p>

<p>I want to refer in passing, without unnecessarily wasting the time of the House, to the principle &#x201C;self-determination&#x201D; which was used by the hon. member for Middelland and has also just been used by the hon. member for Mossel Bay. I want to concede at once that it is entirely correct to say that this Bill envisages granting of a large degree of self-determination to the people of Rehoboth. I do not think any one can doubt that, but nevertheless I now want to put it very clearly that we must not introduce an element of absoluteness to the principle of self-determination, because the meaning of that principle cannot be clearly defined. In other words, self-determination is something which lies along the road to sovereignty, but although it may be sovereignty, it need not necessarily be so. All I want to say is: Let us concede that a degree of self-determination is being granted to the people of Rehoboth here, but let us not elevate it as if we are dealing with an absolute concept, or with a term which may be properly <span class="col_3803-3804" refersTo="page_0584"/>and precisely described. In this connection I just want to point out that there is no question of sovereignty here. When we speak of self-determination, we must also recognize the supreme authority of this Parliament, because this Parliament has the right to repeal this Bill if it wishes; this Parliament is entirely free to do so. It is not the people of Rehoboth who can do so. Indeed, yesterday the hon. member for Middelland indicated that even if the people of Rehoboth should make a specific request themselves, this Parliament, if it was convinced that that request did not represent the will of the people properly under certain circumstances, would be fully within its rights to refuse that request. In other words, the right of self-determination is once again being made subject to certain limitations.</p>

<p>In the third place, legislation passed by the legislative authority of Rehoboth, must still, as always, be submitted to the State President of the Republic for approval. The State President acts according to the advice of the Cabinet of the Republic and not according to the advice of the Kaptein&#x2019;s Council. In other words, in this connection too there are limitations on the right of self-determination of the people of Rehoboth. There are also limitations as far as the legislation is concerned. The legislative authority of Rehoboth can only pass laws in respect of those items set out in the schedule. Therefore it is not an unlimited legislative authority like that of the Parliament of the Republic, for example.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, in terms of the Bill, the Minister is authorized, if circumstances demand, to exercise all powers in connection with the administration of Rehoboth. In other words, as far as the legislative authority too, is concerned, that self-determination is not sovereignty and it is subject to limitations.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if I understand clause 32 correctly, there is no free and complete right of self-determination for the people of Rehoboth in respect of the judicial authority either. Let us therefore be careful about elevating the right of self-determination as if we are dealing with an absolute principle, because it is not absolute. It is a degree of self-determination and although we are indeed dealing with a large degree of self-determination here, there is no question of a complete right of self-determination.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Von Brandis indicated, with reference to the assurances given by the hon. the Minister, that this matter had nothing to do with independence. Because of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s willingness to include amendments, of which he informed us yesterday, in the Bill, I want to say at once that any objections which we had and which we raised during the Second Reading debate, have disappeared to a large extent. Therefore I want to identify myself with the standpoint taken by my party, namely that we are going to support the Third Reading of this Bill. I want to add that I appreciate the reasonable attitude which the hon. the Minister has adopted in this connection.</p>

<p>If one knows the history of Rehoboth, one will know how much those people have suffered, one will be aware of the opposition on their part towards tyranny by others, and one will also know about their battle against the Germans at Kubis in 1915. On that occasion they grouped the women above 60 years together and asked them if they would accede to the ultimatum of the Germans to fight on the side of the Germans or to hand their weapons over to them. When they asked the women above 60 years in the tribe for their opinion, those women said: &#x201C;Not a damn!&#x201D;&#x2014;pardon the language. In other words, they decided that they would not accede to the ultimatum of the Germans. Besides that, we must take into consideration that they only surrendered to the Union Forces in 1925 after Sir Pierre van Ryneveld&#x2014;as he subsequently became&#x2014;flew over the Rehoboth Gebiet. The people there, mindful of what had happened in the case of the Bondelzwarts rising, then came to the conclusion that it would not pay them to oppose the Union Forces as well. We must also take into consideration that during the &#x2019;fifties Hans Beukes approached the UN time after time with a one-man petition for the independence of Rehoboth, and that in 1969 the Rehobothers wanted to seek legal advice to put their case for self-determination to the World Court. If we take all these things into consideration, it ought to be clear that we have no choice in the matter. To say now that not every Rehobother agreed with it, is not to the point. The whole history of those people is like an open book for those who want to read it. I can only say that one can and must treat the struggle for self-assertion of those people through generations, with a great deal of compassion and sympathy. In that sense I then want to say that <span class="col_3805-3806" refersTo="page_0585"/>I associate myself entirely with the idea that we shall give final approval to the Bill during this Third Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I really think it was a pleasure for us to listen to the hon. member for Edenvale, except on a few occasions when he tried to compare the policy of his party with that of the Progressive Party. For the rest his speech was a lesson to the members of the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>What my hon. friend here said is correct; it was his knowledge of the subject which emerged. I think this was the major deficiency on the part of the Progressive Party which caused them to oppose the legislation. Nevertheless, I shall return at a later stage to the speech made by the hon. member for Edenvale. I have appreciation for the speeches made on both sides of this House, except of course the irrelevant sounds which emanated from the Progressive Party. I have appreciation for the observations made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, the hon. member for Von Brandis and also the hon. member for Edenvale. To prove how reasonable I am, I want to indicate that, apart from the amendments which were agreed to during the Committee Stage, I shall effect further changes in the Other Place.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This is somewhat in contradiction with the remarks made by a journalist, a certain Mr. John Scott, who called me a &#x201C;non-sport&#x201D; for not being prepared to accept all the amendments proposed by the hon. member for Edenvale. I am sure I did not do it because I am a non-sport. On every particular occasion I explained to hon. members why I could not accept any particular amendment.</p>

<p>*Nevertheless it seems to me as though the entire debate we had here this afternoon and yesterday proved that if people of differing political persuasions at least have some knowledge of a matter they are discussing and debating, together with the good intention of bringing about what is best for the community concerned, in this case the people of Rehoboth, and also for our country with a view to the international position of South West Africa, then one can go far. Therefore I was prepared&#x2014;as I indicated when I moved the Third Reading&#x2014;to effect certain amendments in the Other Place myself, amendments which would have the same effect as I as well as members on the opposite side of this House wanted to achieve. However, it will now be done in a better way, and without complications. Therefore I think this entire debate has been worthwhile, and will also indicate to the people of Rehoboth that we in this country are able to act sensibly and co-operate if we want to.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Middelland&#x2014;and I think this must have made an impression on the hon. members of the Progressive Party&#x2014;furnished an account of the growth over the years of the system of government in Rehoboth. I think that that was of tremendous importance here. The hon. member for Edenvale, too, gave indications in his speech of a wide knowledge of those developments. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout stated unequivocally that he and his party were satisfied that the people of Rehoboth had been consulted at all times, and that the necessary evidence existed to prove that the legislation was an expression of the will of the majority of the people of Rehoboth. I cannot understand now why the hon. member for Rondebosch allowed himself to become entangled in such a situation as he found himself in this afternoon. Is it because the hon. member has to think and argue as other hon. members in the front benches of that party think and argue&#x003F; Said with all due respect, what the hon. member proclaimed here this afternoon&#x2014;and I am familiar with the hon. member&#x2019;s career&#x2014;was surely at variance&#x2014; apart from the political standpoints&#x2014;with the hon. member&#x2019;s entire academic background. The hon. member&#x2019;s speech had then to testify to ignorance, as the hon. member for Edenvale said, although I cannot believe that it was ignorance in his case. Perhaps the hon. member has not visited the Rehoboth territory very frequently but as a student I believe he must have learned enough about the circumstances of Rehoboth. Therefore I can only conclude that under the authority of his hon. leader and his defective knowledge &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point. The hon. member for Rondebosch was in that way manoeuvred into the position in which he found himself this afternoon. Surely the hon. member for Rondebosch will recall that a year or two ago the hon. member for Sea Point also discussed matters affecting South West Africa, not Rehoboth, but South West Africa here. The former hon. Minister of Community Development then asked him, with the object of testing the knowledge of the hon. member, who has travelled so widely in Africa and is so ready to discuss South West Africa, what language was spoken by the Damaras. The hon. member for Sea Point sat there dumbstruck. The hon. Minister went further and asked whether the hon. member for Sea Point could say how many population groups there were in South West Africa, and once again the hon. member for Sea Point was dumbstruck. After all, I cannot believe that the hon. member for Rondebosch shares that ignorance. In other words, he has therefore been manoeuvred into a position in which he has to defend an unjustifiable standpoint. A moment ago the hon. member again wanted to know why a referendum was not held. I shall return at a later stage to the other points which the hon. member raised. Does the hon. member not understand that this legislation gives effect to the will of the people of Rehoboth&#x003F;</p>

<p>They went through all the channels, and asked for it. I am now going to take the trouble&#x2014;although I doubt that the hon. member is ignorant of it&#x2014;to furnish the entire background so that the matter may be placed on record. Surely the people of Rehoboth were able to and had to decide for themselves how they would give expression to their will, whether by way of a referendum, by way of an election, or by way of requests which, over the years, had to be endorsed by elections. Therefore it was surely arrogant of the hon. member to have come here and told me that I should have allowed them to hold a referendum. Surely that is not what is at issue. Since the hon. member is implying that the other population groups of South West Africa should have been consulted about this legislation, I want to tell him that surely it is appalling, even in terms of the policy of that hon. member&#x2019;s own party, that others should express their opinion on matters affecting the people in the Rehoboth territory. Surely it is appalling to propose such a thing. Suppose the hon. member were in my position. Would he have said: &#x201C;No, Rehobothers you have to wait; I first want to discuss all the other people of South West Africa&#x201D;, and then have held a referendum throughout the whole of South West Africa to decide what constitution Rehoboth should receive&#x003F; Can hon. members see what the hon. member for Rondebosch is becoming entangled in&#x003F; To clear the air, I am now going to attempt to indicate to hon. members what the irrelevant arguments which the hon. member advanced here were concerned with. They were concerned with these matters because the hon. member attended a symposium held by Mr. O&#x2019;Linn in Windhoek about three weeks ago. The symposium was also attended by people from Rehoboth, but the majority of those people were members of the Volksparty, the minority party. Those people cannot endure having been defeated&#x2014;I have nothing to do with their quarrels&#x2014;but they found in the hon. member for Rondebosch a sounding-board to come here and profess that they had not really been defeated. I know that the members of that party, who comprised the majority at the symposium, spoke to that hon. member. In other words, they were his source. He obtained no information on the views of other people. I am going to quote to hon. members a short report from which either ignorance or other motives is apparent. It appeared last Sunday in the <i>Sunday Times</i> under the headline &#x201C;Basters are split on constitution&#x201D;. It was written by a certain Alf Wannenburgh, and read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Second Reading of the Rehoboth Self-government Bill will come before Parliament this week &#x2026;</block>

<p>This man&#x2019;s knowledge is so impeccable that he does not even realize that the Second Reading was disposed of last week already.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but developments at the Windhoek Constitutional talks suggest that the South West African Basters no longer accept the proposed constitution. The leader of the Bastervereniging, Dr. B. J. Africa, last year accepted the constitution.</block>

<p>He did not accept the constitution; he brought it forward&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3809-3810" refersTo="page_0587"/>&#x2026; saying that he had a mandate from the electorate to do so, but five of the delegation of the twelve Basters have so far walked out of the talks in Windhoek.</block>

<p>It has a great deal to do with the hon. member. He then referred to the leader of the minority party, with whose people the hon. member for Rondebosch spoke, and this is what is relevant&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Stellmacher &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the leader of the Volksparty, the minority party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; however claims that the election &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is last year&#x2019;s election&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; was won on emotional appeals and misrepresentation of the Volksparty as wanting to swamp Rehoboths with Ovambos.</block>

<p>He then continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The community has now seen through this ruse and that if a new election were held, the Volksparty would regain control of the raad &#x2026; The fact that five of Dr. Africa&#x2019;s delegation have so far walked out of the Windhoek conference in protest suggests that Dr. Stellmacher&#x2019;s claims may not be wishful thinking.</block>

<p>You see, Mr. Speaker, this is how the hon. member for Rondebosch also argues. He was influenced by these people&#x2019;s tales and now he, too, thinks that these people have a case and that a majority is not really in favour of the constitution. Surely, the fact of the matter is that the people attending the conference have nothing to do with a specific political party. The 12 people from Rehoboth at that conference are not all Dr. Africa&#x2019;s people, and if five of them are no longer there, it does not prove that the people of Rehoboth no longer want this constitution. But I think it is necessary for me to give a full account, for the information of the hon. member and his party, of what led up to this legislation which we have before this House today, and for that reason I want to quote <i>verbatim</i> from a statement issued last week by Dr. Africa the leader of the majority party in the present Advisory Council of Rehoboth. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Rehoboth-Bastervereniging, wat die meerderheid setels het op die Adviserende Raad, reageer soos volg op die aankondiging dat &#x2019;n wetsontwerp vir selfregering vir Rehoboth in die Parlement ingedien is: Die wetsontwerp is die produk van uitgbebreide onderhandelinge met die Adviserende Raad van Rehoboth. Dit is gebaseer op die historiese Vaderlike Wette van 1872, en vir die inwoners van Rehoboth het hierdie historiese Wette groot sentimentele waarde. Kaptein Hermanus van Wyk het reeds in 1885 &#x2019;n traktaat van vriendskap en be-skerming met die Duitse Regering onderteken en in &#x2019;n mate die sogenaamde so-wereiniteit van Rehoboth prysgegee, maar nogtans was die Basters vreeslik geheg aan die vaderlike wette. In 1923 het die destydse Administrasie van Suidwes-Afrika gepoog om &#x2019;n ooreenkoms aan te gaan met die Basters, maar dit is verwerp deur die Basters. Sedert die instelling van prok-lamasie nr. 28 van 1924, was daar groot ontevredenheid onder die Basters omdat, volgens hierdie proklamasie die magte van die Kapteinsraad en die Volksraad kragtens die 1872-wet oorgeplaas is na &#x2019;n Blankelanddros wat <i>ex officio</i> opgetree het as die Kaptein van die adviesraad.</block>

<p>That is still the position today&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sedertdien is daar nog altyd verto&#x00EB; gerig sodat die Basters meer direkte seggenskap oor hulle eie sake kon kry.</block>

<p>Does the hon. member now accept that there have been representations over the years to the effect that they wanted to return to that earlier system&#x003F; The statement continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie verto&#x00EB; was van die hand gewys omdat daar ges&#x00EA; was: &#x201E;Die Basters is nie eensgesind nie&#x201D;. Hierdie Stelling word nie deur ons aanvaar nie omdat dit in sommige opsigte net normale opposisie was. Ordon-nansie nr. 20 van 1960 het toe in &#x2019;n later stadium voorsiening gemaak vir die verkiesing <span class="col_3811-3812" refersTo="page_0588"/>van &#x2019;n Kaptein en Volksraad, maar die Basters wat in hierdie stadium met agterdog vervul was, wou dit nie aanvaar nie. In Januarie 1969 het die Eerste Minister, Mnr. Vorster, die destydse Basterraad in Windhoek ontmoet en is die Basterraad versoek om self &#x2019;n grand wet vir Rehoboth op te stel.</block>

<p>You see, Sir, the request for those people to come forward with what was their own therefore came from the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Basterraad het toe ook gevra vir &#x2019;n eie departement. Rehoboth het toe wel sy eie departement gekry, maar daar is nie met die grondwet begin voor 1973 nie. In 1973 het die Basterraad, wat toe uitsluitlik op daardie tydstip uit die Volksparty se lede bestaan het, in oorlegpleging met die departement begin met die optrek van die grondwet.</block>

<p>And, as I told hon. members the other day, at that juncture the magistrate of Rehoboth addressed one meeting after another to explain to the people what was being contemplated with this Bill. The statement continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die wetsontwerp was al in 1974 gereed vir indiening in die Parlement. Gedurende September 1974 was daar egter &#x2019;n verkie-sing vir lede van die Adviserende Raad en drie jonger mans wie se belange meer by die Namibia National Convention was, is verkies saam met vier van die ou raadslede. Hierdie sewe raadslede was almal lede van die Volksparty. Daar was toe verdeeldheid op die Basterraad oor die vraag of die Basters, genoegsaam oor die wetsontwerp geken was.</block>

<p>The question then was not whether such a draft constitution should be prepared, but whether the ordinary citizens had been sufficiently consulted on the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Vyf lede van die Basterraad, lede van die Volksparty, het in Februarie 1975 bedank sodat die Basters se gevoelens getoets kon word.</block>

<p>But now the hon. member for Rondebosch wants to prescribe to me that a referendum should have been held, and that because this was not done, he is not satisfied. Dr. Africa went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar was &#x2019;n skeuring in die Volksparty en die twee lede van die Basterraad wat nie bedank het nie, het die Bevrydingsparty gestig, alhoewel hulle aanvanklik deur die Volksparty gekies is. Hierdie wetsontwerp was &#x2019;n uiters belangrike punt gedurende die April 1975 verskiesing. Dit was eintlik &#x2019;n tussenverkiesing vir die vyf vakante setels.</block>

<p>Now I want to explain to the hon. member once again that there are no electoral divisions. All seven members are chosen simultaneously by all the voters, and if one has a by-election for five members then all the voters of Rehoboth, the entire territory, are involved in that election. Then Dr. Africa went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie wetsontwerp was &#x2019;n uiters belangrike punt gedurende die April 1975 verkiesing vir die vyf vakante setels. Die uitspraak van die verkiesing was oorwel-digend ten gunste van die wetsontwerp in die sin dat vier lede van die Rehoboth-Bastervereniging en slegs een lid van die Volksparty verkies was. Die nuwe Basterraad het verdere wysigings aan die wetsontwerp aangebring, en tydens &#x2019;n on-derhoud met die Minister van Kleurling-, Rehoboth-en Namabetrekkinge op 25 April 1975 te Kaapstad is ooreengekom dat die wetsontwerp by die eerste geskikte geleentheid ter tafel gel&#x00EA; sou word, wat wel gedoen is. Die Basterraad was toe alreeds so saamgestel soos hy vandag is, nl. vier lede van die Rehoboth-Bastervereniging, twee lede van die Bevrydingsparty en een lid van die Volksparty. Tans is die posisie nog net so sedert 1924 waarin die Basters geen direkte seggenskap in hulle eie sake het nie. Die wetsontwerp onder bespreking maak nie voorsiening vir onafhanklikheid vir Rehoboth nie, maar wel vir &#x2019;n grater mate van selfregering. Hierdie wetsontwerp is nie perfek nie en daar word voorsiening gemaak vir wysigings en veranderings in die toekoms. As daar in die nabye toekoms &#x2019;n veranderde opset in Suidwes-Afrika tot stand kom, sal daar aanpassings aan hierdie wetsontwerp aangebring kan word om in te pas. Dit sal selfs kan inpas by die idees van mnr. Kapuuo se konsepgrondwet.</block>

<p>So widely has the Bill been drawn up. Therefore I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that if the hon. member for Rondebosch still had <span class="col_3813-3814" refersTo="page_0589"/>doubts on the question of whether the people had been sufficiently consulted, then I have now tried to the best of my ability to indicate to the hon. member that this was in fact the case. This afternoon the hon. member referred in his speech to a letter which was sent to the Secretary-General of the UNO. The hon. the Prime Minister told him, by way of an interjection, that he need only look at the <i>South West Africa Survey</i> of 1967, and he would find the reply to his statement there. For that reason I am going to quote it to the hon. member. It is on page 49 of this publication, which appeared in 1967. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, at this stage it is impossible to foresee with any degree of accuracy the ultimate interaction of the various population groups.</block>

<block name="quote">Circumstances will alter radically.

Meanwhile, South Africa&#x2019;s task and solemn duty is to help the diverse peoples of the territory to advance economically, socially and politically to the stage where they themselves will be able to decide for their own future, wisely protecting, guiding and helping them in a spirit of trusteeship until their emancipation has been attained.</block>

<p>It is 1967. So one can continue to indicate that Dr. Africa said at the symposium recently held in Windhoek that one of the greatest mistakes that had been made in the past with the mandated territory of South West Africa had been that the population had not been trained to govern a country themselves. Now we are coming forward here with legislation with which we want to restore to the people of Rehoboth what they had a hundred years ago. But then the hon. member for Rondebosch advances arguments to the effect that the people of Rehoboth were not sufficiently consulted. He said that the evidence that the majority had been in favour of the measure was inconclusive and questioned the acceptability of the measure to the other population groups in South West Africa. This comes very close to being, I almost want to say, derogatory towards the people of Rehoboth, they who have traditionally developed the furthest, while other peoples have lagged behind. The hon. member for Rondebosch now wants to call in some of the other groups there to tell the Rehobothers, they who at least have the most knowledge of these matters, how to manage their own affairs.</p>

<p>With justification the hon. the Minister of Defence is saying that the hon. member has thrown his own ancestral laws overboard. I want to conclude by thanking those hon. members who made a positive contribution to this debate. I believe that greater knowledge and understanding will emerge from these discussions, for the people of Rehoboth and their aspirations as well. As a matter of interest I could mention to you that last year a pupil of the Rehoboth High School was one of the four pupils to obtain the highest points among all the population groups in South West Africa in the matriculation examination. He was among the first four. In addition, there is a woman in Rehoboth who has already obtained a degree in agriculture in an overseas country and is at present studying further in that direction. I could also mention that the choir of the Rehoboth High School, at their first attempt last year, came third in their first participation in a country-wide competition for school choirs organized by the SABC. This was a great achievement for those people. Whatever we are able to do and say to promote an understanding of those people in their circumstances can only be for the best. That is why I am grateful for the positive contributions which were also made during the course of this debate.</p>

<p>I would like straight away to express the appreciation of this side of the House of the fact that this amendment, which we regard as an important amendment, has been accepted by the hon. the Minister. This is the clause which establishes the Trade Practices Advisory Committee, a committee which is going to play a key role in this legislation. It plays a key role in that it provides the safeguard that the very extensive powers which are taken by the hon. the Minister in this legislation, powers to regulate the giving of benefits, powers to regulate advertising practices and powers to regulate injurious trade practices, are exercised in a reasonable manner, and more important, that they are exercised in a manner which will protect the interests of the affected parties. The Trade Practices Advisory Committee does this because it is given the power in a subsequent clause to the effect that the hon. the Minister may not make regulations or determinations in respect of his powers unless he has the prior recommendation of this committee.</p>

<p>Therefore, as I said, this committee fulfils a very important function in this legislation, and as such it is important, first of all, that its composition be as strong as possible, and secondly, that the powers which it is able to exercise, and the manner in which it is able to exercise those powers, should be correct. The amendments which I have moved aim at improving the composition of this committee, and they aim to do so primarily by ensuring that the committee will be representative of the interests that are going to be affected by this legislation, will have people on it who will have the full confidence of the bodies that represent the interests that are going to be affected by this legislation, and will have the full confidence of members of the consuming public. The amendments aim to bring this about, firstly, by ensuring that members of the committee representing the categories set out in this clause, are chosen from nominees of recognized bodies representing the interests concerned, bodies such as the Handels-instituut, Assocom, FCI and Total. This will ensure that the representatives on this committee will be acceptable to these bodies, and I think it will also ensure that they will be men of high calibre, which is another very important requisite for this committee.</p>

<p>The second thing that the amendments will achieve, will be to ensure that the trading categories which are to be affected by this legislation, are afforded representation on this committee. The amendment will add to the trade categories already in the Bill, the business of mail orders, which is a very big business. I believe that there are no fewer than 1 500 businesses in this country which conduct mail order transactions as a specialized business. This is a type of business which is conducted on a very large scale with the less sophisticated members of our society. The mail order business is a business to which this Bill is going to have direct application in several respects. It will have direct application as far as the advertising procedures used by mail order businesses in their catalogues are concerned. It will have direct application as far as the use of coupons by mail order businesses is concerned. This is a practice which is quite widespread.</p>

<p>I believe that consumers are vulnerable to practices that are conducted by mail order businesses, and that the need for legislation in regard to this type of business consequently is quite great. I have been advised that no less than 10% of the complaints which are received by the Consumers Co-ordinating Council, are in respect of practices being followed by mail order businesses. I believe therefore that this is a business, a type of business, which should be represented on the Trade Practices Advisory Committee. The mail order business has a strong organization of its own: the South African Mail Order Association. It is a responsible body with its own code of ethics, and I believe that its representation on the Trade Practices Advisory Committee will strengthen that body.</p>

<p><span class="col_3819-3820" refersTo="page_0592"/>Thirdly, Mr. Chairman, these amendments aim at ensuring that there is a balance on this committee between trade interests and consumer interests. After all, this measure is basically a measure for the protection of consumers. I therefore regard it as important that there should be a reasonable balance in numbers between those members of the committee who are representing trade interests and those who are representing consumer interests.

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I comment on the arguments of the hon. member for Constantia, I believe you will allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the members of the Select Committee who have contributed to the fact that this Bill is before the Committee of this House this afternoon. Of course, everybody has been very aware of the necessity to place legislation on the Statute Book to protect the interests of the consumer. It is of course regrettable to have to introduce legislation of this nature, for one expects consumers to keep their eyes open when making a purchase. However, since many people are usually not able to protect themselves, we have agreed that this legislation is necessary to protect the consumers. I should therefore like to express my sincere gratitude to all the members of the Select Committee who assisted in drafting the Bill which is before the House this afternoon. We achieved a large measure of unanimity because all of us were inspired with the wish to afford members of the consumer public the necessary protection. The points on which unanimity agreement could not be reached, were points which were not really of material importance. The fact that we have indeed achieved unanimity is being emphasized further by the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister has now accepted an amendment here that was moved by the minority on the Committee. I do not wish to differ from the hon. the Minister now, for the changes that are being effected are not of material interest.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia had quite a lot to say about the importance of mail order business. We felt, of course, that mail order business could be classified very successfully under the head &#x201C;Commerce&#x201D;, the head which is indicated in the Bill. Surely mail order business is a commercial activity, and therefore we were of the opinion that it could be classified very successfully under that head. Therefore we did not introduce a separate category for it. I reiterate that I do not wish to argue about it. This aspect is of no material interest and the amendment may just as well be included.</p>

<p>Finally, I should also like to express my sincere gratitude to the officials who have assisted the Committee with so much conscientiousness and devotion to duty in the fulfilment of its task.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when my time expired on the previous occasion I was motivating the amendments to clause 2 standing in my name on the Order Paper. The final amendment is amendment No. 4 on the Order Paper, an amendment dealing with the period of office of members of the Trade Practices Advisory Committee. As the Bill stands at present there is no specific period of office laid down. The period of office is determined by an <i>ad hoc</i> decision by the hon. the Minister. I consider it to be much better practice, however, to lay down a maximum period of office, as happens in the private sector in appointments to boards, committees and councils and also in the public sector in appointments to boards and other bodies. This is the reasoning behind the amendment. I believe that by the acceptance of this amendment the position of a potential member of this committee will be greatly clarified, and by clarifying and specifying the position, one is likely to attract persons of the very best calibre to this committee. This is very desirable. I am therefore grateful that the hon. the Minister is willing to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I react to the argument of the hon. member for Constantia, I should first like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the members who served on the Select Committee and considered the legislation last year. I am concinved that if we had disposed of the legislation at that stage, we most probably would not have had 81 amendments, as we have now. But in my opinion the time which has elapsed in the meantime has not been wasted. Amendments have indeed emerged which in my opinion are acceptable.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I have already indicated to the hon. member for Constantia that these amendments <span class="col_3821-3822" refersTo="page_0593"/>are acceptable but I hasten to add, for the benefit of the hon. member for Paarl, that the amendment that was rejected in the Select Committee is not the same one that is now being proposed by the hon. member for Constantia. In the interim he also reconsidered the matter and has come to this House with an improved amendment which is, in fact, acceptable.</p>

<p>*There is an important point which I have to raise at this stage. Naturally, it is true that the Trade Practices Advisory Committee is going to play a cardinal role in the implementation of the objects of the legislation, namely to curtail trade practices which are harmful and undesirable. To my opinion, these principles are already contained in the legislation, apart from the amendments. If we want to achieve these objects, we should realize that we would have to intervene in a very drastic and direct manner in the activities of the private sector and the methods they apply in pursuit of the profit motive. I can find no counter-argument which indicates that we should not under the circumstances, take all the security measures to ensure that we do not unjustifiably prohibit a practice which should not really be prohibited. It is, secondly, important to know that this Trade Practices Advisory Committee fulfils a further important function. The Minister is unable to take any formal steps before the Advisory Committee has made a recommendation.</p>

<p>Therefore, the amendments are acceptable on the basis of the considerations I shall now mention. As I see the matter, the amendments will expand the composition of the Trade Practices Advisory Committee and will, therefore, make the committee more representative. There is another very important principle to which I initially gave prominence when the legislation was first introduced. I have the assurance, apart from the amendments which I am now accepting, that I would remain in very close contact with the private sector in regard to the people who will be appointed to this committee when the powers in terms of clause 2 were exercised. The amendments will therefore give substance to the two elements I have mentioned, namely the representativeness of the committee and consultation in the sense that names may be submitted to me. That principle will certainly apply in practice. Seen in that light, a strong case may be made out, in my opinion, for the acceptance of the amendments of the hon. member. The hon. member should understand, however, that it is a sense of reasonableness which is moving me to accept the amendments and that he will have an opportunity to show the same reasonableness in respect of the other amendments he has moved.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, now that the hon. the Minister has confirmed his acceptance of this particular amendment to clause 2, I should like to put a thought to him and direct an appeal to him in relation to the composition of the Trade Practices Advisory Committee and the appointment of its members, a function which will be undertaken by him. Subsection (2)(b), as amended in terms of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Contantia, stipulates that the Minister shall appoint as members of the committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; not more than eight and not fewer than two members competent to advise him on the application of legislation relating to the protection of consumers.</block>

<p>I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that, when he appoints people representing consumer interests, he give serious consideration to the appointment of somebody who is deeply involved in social welfare. I believe that someone who has been associated with social welfare would have a unique and special knowledge of certain habits which are prevalent among consumers. Such a person would be aware of certain trends and habits and would probably be aware of drink patterns, the possible increase in alcoholism, and matters of that nature. If any member of this House viewed the programme on television recently in which the subject of al-choholism was discussed, he will have noticed the contrast between the attitude of the producer of alcoholic products and the attitude of the people who work with alcoholics and seek to help and rehabilitate them. For that reason I think the hon. the Minister will realize that a person with such an ability would be very useful indeed. It goes beyond that, however. I believe that a person with those qualifications would also be able to detect purchasing trends in the home in regard to various other items such as furniture, and household equipment. In this regard I am <span class="col_3823-3824" refersTo="page_0594"/>thinking particularly of the less sophisticated members of the community, as my hon. colleague put it. A person so qualified may be able to detect, at an early stage, consumer trends which have been subject to exploitation by means of gimmick promotions. With those objects in view, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration, when he appoints the members of this committee, to the appointment of somebody who would have those special qualifications.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Berea is renowned for making highly appreciated pleas in respect of the maladjusted people in our society, and for being an advocate of the combating of social evils. I think there are very few hon. members in this House who would not endorse the sentiments he has expressed specifically and generally as well. At this stage I am naturally unable to commit myself to accepting this suggestion. I should just like to remark that, although, as I have already said, all of us endorse the sentiments which the hon. member has expressed, the legislation which is before us deals specifically with abuses in trade practices, and I am therefore unable to apply it in order to eliminate social evils. I hope the hon. member will understand that. Nor am I able to use this legislation to protect malpractioners, but only to protect consumers. The hon. member will understand that there is a big difference. Nevertheless I shall still bear in mind the suggestion which the hon. member has made. Of course, it is true that somebody involved in social welfare, is indeed aware, not from habit, but from experience, of certain malpractices which exist. This could perhaps be of assistance to us.</p>

<speech by="#aronson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. ARONSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 7, to add the following further proviso at the end of subsection (1):</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">Provided further that no person need furnish any information which will incriminate him of an offence.</block>

<li>(2) on page 7, to add the following subsection at the end of the Clause:</li>

<li>(3) Information furnished pursuant to subsection (1) shall not be disclosed to any person save for the purposes of this Act, or in a court of law in a prosecution arising in terms of this Act.</li>

</ol>

<p>The hon. the Minister kindly intimated to me that the second amendment is acceptable to him. I shall therefore deal with it first. In the circumstances I shall be fairly brief about it. I think that if I dealt with it at any length, the hon. the Minister could accuse me of being inflationary. The second amendment has the effect of assuring a person who is furnishing information that the information so furnished will only be used for the purposes set forth in this Act or in a prosecution arising out of this Act. In other words, the information furnished could not be used for any other purposes. The person is therefore assured that such information is furnished on a privileged basis. He is also assured that that information cannot be used summarily in a civil case, but will only be used in a criminal prosecution. I believe that the second amendment has the effect of strengthening the Bill, and I want to thank the hon. the Minister for agreeing to accept it.</p>

<speech by="#aronson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. ARONSON</person>:</from>

<p>I hope he will at least listen with an open mind to my arguments in this connection and that there is a possibility that we can get him to change his mind. Concerning the first amendment, it is obvious that it can never be considered desirable that a person should be compelled to make what is tantamount to a written confession on request from the Secretary for Commerce, because that is what the Bill entails as it stands. In the circumstances, it is most desirable that my amendment should be incorporated in the Bill. The hon. the Minister has only one possible leg to stand on in his reasons for rejecting this <span class="col_3825-3826" refersTo="page_0595"/>particular amendment, viz. if the hon. the Minister were to argue, for example, that the person concerned can rely on his common law rights and that he can plead that, as the information required by the Secretary for Commerce is likely to incriminate him, he does not want to make it available. In view of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s training and background, however, I do not believe that the hon. the Minister would have this particular thought in mind or would use the argument of the person&#x2019;s common law rights.</p>

<p>I should like to point out why the hon. the Minister cannot use that particular argument. In the first place, when this Bill becomes law, this particular Act will supersede the common law in regard to this matter. The Bill specifically provides that a person can be compelled to furnish all the information required by the Secretary for Commerce. It provides further, in clause 19, that if the person concerned does not supply all the information required, he is guilty of a contravention and an offence. Let me very briefly quote the first few lines of clause 6(1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The secretary may, from time to time, in respect of any matter specified in this Act, by notice in writing, sent by post or delivered, order any person to furnish in writing, before a date specified in the notice, to the secretary any information requested in such notice and relating to the business of such person.</block>

<p>Should the person concerned fail to provide the information required and try to defend himself by standing on his common law rights, what happens to him&#x003F; Clause 19 states that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding two thousand rand or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</block>

<p>I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that this is no common law at all, but that this is a most expensive law for the man who does not comply with the request by the Secretary for Commerce. If he does not obey the order of the Secretary for Commerce, he can naturally be asked by the Secretary to write out his own confession and, if he fails to do that, it would cost him up to R2 000 or two years&#x2019; imprisonment, or both. This clause, as it now stands, is a most onerous clause and even offensive. I therefore believe that the hon. the Minister should agree to have it deleted or amended as proposed by this side of the House.</p>

<p>The first amendment specifically states that no person need furnish information which incriminates him of an offence. Clause 6(1) allows the Secretary to obtain such information as he may require from a person in writing before a specified date. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether there are going to be any time limits imposed by the Secretary in regard to furnishing of information. Obviously there will have to be some form of time limit, but I do suggest that where onerous information is required, the time limit should be longer while it could be shorter when simple information is required. I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister that the Secretary must err on the side of generosity towards the person from whom the information is required. Presumably the Secretary will in the majority of cases write to the businessman concerned as a result of a substantial complaint which has been lodged and in this regard I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister that when the Secretary writes to the businessman, he should inform him of the complaint which has been lodged. This would give the businessman an opportunity of replying fully to the Secretary because he will know what the basis of the complaint is. If the businessman could see from the complaint lodged against him that he was embarking upon the wrong tracks, it will have the further advantage that the businessman will have the opportunity of desisting immediately. If the businessman has to wait until the decision of the trade practices committee is made known, it may take many months after the date on which the complaint has been lodged for him to become aware that he has embarked upon the wrong tracks. It is therefore in the general interest that the businessman should be informed of the basis of the complaint lodged against him. If the businessman is immediately advised of the complaint against him, there is an opportunity, as I have said earlier, of rectification on his part.</p>

<p>I should also like to point out to the hon. the Minister that in terms of clause 7 there is provision for inspectors to obtain all the <span class="col_3827-3828" refersTo="page_0596"/>information which they require. That is another reason why this amendment should be acceptable to the hon. the Minister. In the circumstances I do not see the reason why the hon. the Minister wants the person in reply to a letter from the Secretary for Commerce to give a written confession. The hon. the Minister can obtain whatever information he requires through his inspectors or by means of other procedures laid down in the law. Unless the hon. the Minister accepts this amendment, the businessman will be compelled to give the Secretary a written confession which, as I have indicated earlier, could lead to the businessman being charged and convicted on his own admission.</p>

<p>I should like to state very clearly that if in these days a businessman should offend against this Bill after it has become law, we believe that he should be charged and be punished. What we are pleading for is that there should at least be a fair hearing. I think the hon. the Minister must be reasonable in this regard. Surely, if one looks at the existing machinery in conjunction with clause 7, all possible formation can be obtained without any difficulty whatsoever and without denying the businessman of his common law rights. With his legal background and training, the hon. the Minister should have no difficulty in accepting this amendment. Although he has indicated previously that he is not in favour of the amendment, I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to change his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree with the hon. member for Walmer as far as his second amendment is concerned, because I think there may be some justification for the idea that publication of this information ought to be limited so that it goes no further than necessitated by the purposes of the Bill, and also that the information should be disclosed only in a competent court of law.</p>

<p>I now come to the first amendment moved by the hon. member. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; provided further that no person need</block>

<p>furnish any information which will incriminate him of an offence.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with such an amendment, nor can I agree with the hon. member&#x2019;s interpretation of the matter. After all, clause 6 provides specifically that the only thing which may be done, is to request certain information. It is clearly not the idea that the person who is requested to furnish the information, should incriminate himself in any way or should make a confession which amounts to an admission of guilt. Therefore, I am of the opinion that his statement in this regard as well as his allegation that this provision supersedes the common law, is incorrect. In order to support my opinion I should like to refer the hon. member to the case of <i>Heimann, Maasdorp and Barker</i> v. <i>The Secretary for Inland Revenue,</i> WLD 1968 (4), in which the learned judge said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore, a litigant cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself &#x2026;</block>

<p>In this case, too, this is the test and the crux of the matter. A person cannot be compelled in any way to give evidence against himself. The learned judge went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This well-established rule is to be found throughout our jurisprudence and has repeatedly been described as sacrosanct and inviolate.</block>

<p>Therefore this is a predominant concept which we must accept and for that reason I do not believe the hon. member may rightfully argue as he did. From Steyn&#x2019;s <i>Vertolking van Wette</i> I quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie vermoede bring mee dat &#x2019;n Wet sover doenlik so uitgel&#x00EA; moet word dat sy bepalings met die bestaande reg ooreenstem.</block>

<p>This is the very thing that will happen in this case as well. This Bill must be interpreted in a way which is consistent and not in conflict with common law. In the light of the case to which I have referred, it is very clear that in this instance no person can be prejudiced in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to deal briefly with the two amendments.

<p>I should like to get to the clause. Both these amendments were moved in the Select Committee and they were both turned down. However, we supported both the amendments and we still support them. Because the second one has been agreed to, there is no need to debate it, but I should like to put our case very briefly on the first amendment. The Select Committee, and now again the hon. member for Ermelo, has come to the conclusion that, although in so far as the amendment is concerned it is agreed to in principle and in spirit, it is not necessary.</p>

<p>That, Sir, is the argument. The argument is that because there is no obligation to furnish information which will incriminate a person, therefore it is unnecessary to say so in this piece of legislation. The hon. member for Ermelo relies on the authority which was quoted in the Select Committee by the department and I want to concede immediately that there is a possibility of two interpretations in respect of the matter. It may well be that in the circumstances of this particular clause, framed in this particular manner, a person is not obliged to answer a question which may incriminate him. But it may also be, bearing in mind Maasdorp&#x2019;s case and bearing in mind the other authorities, that the court may come to a different conclusion on this clause. I think the argument in favour of this amendment, is that it is common cause in the House that nobody should answer questions which may incriminate him, and therefore there is no reason why the amendment should not be accepted. But if in fact the hon. the Minister is intransigent and does not want to accept this amendment, then I think he should at the same time give the House the assurance that despite the fact that he will not accept this amendment, no one will be required to answer questions which will incriminate him of an offence and that there will be no prosecution asked for by reason of a refusal to answer a question on these grounds. Sir, if he gives that assurance, as far as I am concerned the matter can perhaps be accepted, as he puts it, because then the same result will come about. Sir, there are questions which may be asked in terms of this clause which have no bearing whatsoever on any possible prosecution, because questions can be asked for example to ascertain whether a particular trade practice should be declared one that is undesirable. There are a hundred and one things which can be asked which do not relate to a prosecution. In the circumstances I also want to say that in so far as the department is concerned&#x2014;and here I refer to what the hon. member for Walmer has said&#x2014;my own experience of the department and the experience of many businessmen is that the department in fact writes letters in advance of complaints, gives businessmen the opportunity to explain what is involved, and that they do not rush into prosecution if it can be avoided. I have seen this in many cases and I think it is necessary to say that in fact the department acts in a very understanding fashion when it comes to the manner of dealing with matters of this sort. I know, for example, that people who deal with price control matters receive very fair treatment. They may not always agree with the decision of the department. That is another matter, but I think there are very few people who can complain that they are not given an opportunity of putting their case to the department. So we support this amendment. We think it is necessary, but if the Minister will give this assurance we will be satisfied on these benches.</p>

<p>Order! Before calling upon the next hon. member to speak, I should like to make an observation for the guidance of hon. members of the Committee. There are 81 amendments to be considered by the Committee and these would take us a few weeks to deal with if all of them were to be discussed at length. However, it is clear that the hon. the Minister is going to accept several of the amendments. Therefore, it would be unnecessary <span class="col_3831-3832" refersTo="page_0598"/>to discuss at length those amendments which the hon. the Minister accepts. This would serve no purpose. I do not want to give a ruling in this regard, but I do want to recommend that when a clause is put and there are amendments to it, the hon. the Minister should give the Committee an indication at once of what amendments, if they are put&#x2014; because at that stage he will not yet know whether they will be put&#x2014;he is prepared to accept, and that any subsequent discussion is confined in the main to those amendments which the hon. the Minister does not accept, unless an hon. member is opposed to such an amendment. I think hon. members will agree that the Committee will find this procedure more convenient and that we shall expedite business in this way.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. member for Yeoville spoke in the first instance I was not quite sure whether he was discussing political practices between himself and the hon. member for Walmer, or whether he was discussing trade practices, which is the subject of this Bill. Sir, I have indicated that I am prepared to accept the second amendment and I shall therefore accede to your request not to discuss its merits. But I would suggest that the hon. member for Walmer is completely wrong. Let me say quite frankly that I think he is exaggerating the position in his terminology. There is nothing in this Bill that compels anybody to furnish the Secretary for Commerce with a signed confession. I think the hon. member for Yeoville was quite correct. The substance of this particular clause is that the Secretary for Commerce must be in a position to obtain certain information. I would suggest at this stage that most of the information he would require would not relate to any prosecution or criminal offence, because that would in any event be something for the Police to investigate. But it is also obligatory that if we have to make this Bill effective, the Secretary must be entitled to get certain information. The essence and substance of this clause&#x2014;I am referring to clause 6(1) now&#x2014;is for the Secretary to obtain certain information subject to the proviso in subsection (1). The amendment proposed by the hon. member for Walmer in fact wants to add a second proviso to clause 6(1).</p>

<p>*The hon. member argues that because clause 6(1) authorizes the Secretary to obtain certain information, and because clause 7 grants inspectors certain powers to obtain information which the Secretary requires, the proviso which he would like to have added, is necessary, because in terms of clause 7 the inspectors may in any event obtain the information. But if that argument were correct juridically, this proviso to clause 6 would not assist us, because he himself argues that in terms of clause 7 the inspectors may obtain the information. But the fact of the matter is that if he looks at clause 7, he will find that in terms of clause 7 inspectors may obtain only such information as the Secretary may require in terms of clause 6. I want to emphasize this. But in the second place his further argument is that because nothing is contained in this clause which protects a person from having to furnish incriminating evidence against himself, he may, in terms of clause 20, i.e. the penalty clause, expose himself at once to prosecution. But surely, Sir, this is not true. In the first instance it is an accepted legal principle that the fact that the Secretary may request information, does not in any way detract from or prejudice any person&#x2019;s common law right not to give evidence against himself, and for this purpose any proviso, such as the one he requests, is totally unnecessary. May I refer the hon. member to Hiemstra&#x2019;s <i>Suid-Afrikaanse Strafproses</i>&#x003F; I should like to refer specifically to the comment on section 234 of the Criminal Procedure Act on page 283. The learned author first deals with the position of a witness and then states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Geen getuie in &#x2019;n strafsaak is, behoudens die bepalings van hierdie Wet of enige ander wetsbepaling, verplig om op &#x2019;n vraag te antwoord waarop hy op die 30ste dag van Mei 1961 (die datum van die Wet) nie verplig sou gewees het om te antwoord nie omdat sy antwoord die strekking mag he om aan horn enige nadeel, straf of verbeuring of aan &#x2019;n strafregtelike aanklag bloot te stel, of om sy goeie naam aan te tas; Met dien verstande dat, ondanks andersluidende bepalings in hierdie artikel, daar aan &#x2019;n beskuldige wat op eie versoek ingevolge artikel 227 as getuie opgeroep word, enige vraag tydens kruisverhoor gestel kan word, al sou dit die strekking h&#x00EA; om horn te <span class="col_3833-3834" refersTo="page_0599"/>inkrimineer ten aansien van die bewys wat horn ten laste gel&#x00EA; word.</block>

<p>He continues by saying in a note&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hierdie artikel behels die &#x201E;voorreg teen selfbeskuldiging&#x201D; vir sover dit in die getuiebank geld (artikel 234).</block>

<p>Then he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die verwysing na die reg soos dit op 30 Mei 1961 bestaan het, is deur artikel 21 van Wet No. 92 van 1963 in die plek gestel van &#x2019;n verwysing na die Engelse bewysleer &#x2026; In die algemeen mag iedereen swyg wanneer hom gevra word of hy hom aan &#x2019;n misdaad skuldig gemaak het, en buite die getuiebank bestaan di&#x00E9; voorreg in sy voile omvang.</block>

<p>For that reason, Sir, the inclusion of a proviso to the effect requested by the hon. member, is totally superfluous.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I am quite prepared to give the assurance to the hon. member that this particular provision does not mean that any person can or will be required to give information that will incriminate himself. Secondly, I submit that if it were the intention that persons would, in terms of clause 6(1), be required to give evidence which might be incriminating to themselves, specific provision would have been made to that effect. In this regard the hon. member can refer to the Price Control Act of 1964. He will find that in that Act there is a specific provision which takes away the common law protection which a person would normally have. In that case no person may avail himself of that common law privilege and right not to incriminate himself. In this particular case a proviso such as that proposed in the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is in my opinion completely superfluous. In any event, I want to give the undertaking that that is not the intention of this provision.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not agree with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reasoning, but I am prepared to accept the undertaking that he has given that a person may avail himself of his common law rights and will not have to incriminate himself. Although I accept his undertaking, I think his argument is fallacious when one refers to the phraseology of clause 6. The hon. the Minister said that the Secretary may obtain certain information. He is wrong in saying that, because the Secretary may obtain any information, in terms of this clause. Therefore, if he can obtain any information, it follows that the person who is called upon to supply the information is in a most invidious position when he receives a letter from the Secretary calling for information. The hon. the Minister knows that once a person has written in reply to the Secretary&#x2019;s request for information, that letter can be used in a criminal prosecution against him. However, in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister has given the assurance that he has given, I shall accept the position as such.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 7, in line 48, after &#x201C;secretary&#x201D; to insert:</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">in relation to a specific business and a specific alleged contravention</block>

<ol>

<li>(2) on page 9, to insert the following subsection to follow subsection (2):</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(3) Any inspector referred to in subsection (1) shall, before he exercises or performs any power or function under this Act, produce and exhibit to any person affected thereby, the inspection authority referred to in subsection (1).</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_3835-3836" refersTo="page_0600"/>I am sorry that the hon. the Minister has indicated that he is unable to accept these two amendments. This clause defines the powers of inspectors. I readily acknowledge that inspectors are necessary to administer this legislation and that those inspectors have got to have the power to inspect if the Act is going to be properly administered. However, as it stands at present, the Bill confers on inspectors very wide powers indeed. In fact, in the opinion of this side of the House, those powers are too wide. They allow an inspector to enter any place of business to which this Bill refers&#x2014;in practice that would mean virtually any place of business&#x2014;in order to inspect goods in that place of business, to inspect books and documents and to seize and retain books and documents. I do not consider that it is necessary for the good administration of this legislation for inspectors to have such wide powers. Businesses and persons are not, as the Bill reads at present, being afforded adequate protection against the unreasonable exercise of these powers.</p>

<p>I should like to submit that this legislation, in its practical working, is not like other legislation such as the Price Control Act, the Wages Act or the Industrial Conciliation Act, where regular and comprehensive inspections are appropriate and desirable. Offences envisaged under this legislation, such as false and misleading selling and advertising methods and the use or misuse of trade coupons, will be of a spasmodic nature and will not be detectable by regular inspections. I believe that offences under this legislation are going to come to light not as a result of general inspections of businesses, but as a result of complaints lodged by members of the public who have suffered as a result of these practices. This has been the experience in other countries that have had consumer protection legislation, and the legislation in other countries has been framed to deal with specific complaints lodged by members of the public, and not to provide for general inspections to detect complaints. I therefore feel that inspectors do not need to have <i>carte blanche</i> powers to enter any premises at their discretion and to conduct the general type of inspection which is envisaged in this legislation. The first amendment standing in my name accordingly proposes to limit the powers of inspectors to inspections that are specifically authorized in respect of a specific alleged contravention. I believe that in practice this limitation of the powers of inspectors will in no way prejudice the effectiveness of this legislation.</p>

<p>As far as the second amendment in my name is concerned, this deals with the obligation on an inspector to show his authority to inspect. I believe it is only right and proper that an inspector should exhibit his authority to the person who is being inspected, before he starts his inspection. A lot of industrial sabotage and espionage is taking place at present. Competitors are keen to learn the secrets of other people and it is essential if this legislation is going to work smoothly, to dispel any suspicion when an inspector enters premises that the inspector may not be what he purports to be. This can only be done if he exhibits his authority before he starts the inspection. I believe, also, that it is very necessary for the smooth working of this legislation that there should be a good relationship between the inspector and the inspected. This can only be achieved if what I propose is embodied in this legislation. It is something that we on this side of the House have consistently advocated in all types of legislation, and by and large it has been accepted by the Government. For instance, this principle has been accepted in the Hazardous Substances Act, the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act, the Medicine Control Act and only yesterday in the Plant Improvement Bill. I very strongly urge the hon. the Minister, in view of the fact that he will not be creating any precedent and that it is a sound practice we are advocating, to accept my second amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not move the first amendment which stands in my name on the Order Paper, because I gather that it involves a question of expenditure. On the other hand, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider at an appropriate time the question of compensation for innocent people who are put under the powers of these inspectors. However, I should like to move the second amendment as it stands in my name on the Order Paper as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 9, to add the following subsection at the end of the Clause:</block>

<ol>

<li>(7) Nothing contained in this Act shall be deemed to compel the production by an attorney of a letter, report or other document containing a privileged communication made by or to him as an attorney, or to authorize the seizure or retention thereof.</li>

</ol>

<p>In effect it follows on what the hon. member for Constantia has already said in an attempt to bring down the powers which are granted to these inspectors to something reasonable and to something which businesses would be prepared to accept. Hon. members will remember that these inspectors can, without a warrant or without an inspection authority, enter into any place where they have reason to believe there is something to inspect. It is therefore appropriate in relation to the amendment I have moved, that as far as we on these benches know, it is the first time that the question of legal privilege between an attorney and his client, which might be a letter, correspondence or a file, can be broached in terms of the proposed legislation and that is why we have moved this amendment to simply exclude that which has up to now been a sacrosanct principle.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to reply to the standpoint of the hon. member for Johannesburg North. Once again I am quoting the case which I quoted a moment ago, namely the Heimann, Maasdorp and Barker case. The legal position is that an attorney who deals with confidential information and documents on behalf of a client cannot be forced to reveal those documents, provided that the documents are legally in order. The attorney&#x2019;s position does not extend any further than the position of his client, and <i>vice versa.</i> In other words, as was clearly ruled in this case, the position is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An attorney cannot refuse to hand over a document which, if in the hands of his client, the latter would be obliged to hand over.</block>

<p>If the client can be forced to hand over that document, then the attorney is also forced to do so. Therefore I do not think that the amendment which the hon. member has moved is valid, because what is actually being provided and decreed here is that an attorney will be able to do certain things which he normally may not do in terms of the Act. Therefore I cannot support the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to support the hon. member for Constantia particularly in regard to the second amendment he moved, the amendment concerning inspectors. First of all I should like briefly to refer to clause 5, which has already been accepted by the Committee. It says <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The secretary may (b) designate officers of the Department of Commerce as inspectors &#x2026;</block>

<p>In this particular clause, clause 7, dealing with the powers of inspectors, it states&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Any inspector furnished with inspection authority in writing by the secretary may conduct investigations &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>It is not my intention to repeat the comments which the hon. member for Constantia made in regard to these broad powers, but something I find a matter of concern, is that I can see nowhere in this particular clause any provision that an inspector shall, even on demand, produce his authority to inspect. I am aware <span class="col_3839-3840" refersTo="page_0602"/>that on page 9 of the Bill subsection (4)(d) says that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall (d) falsely hold himself out to be an inspector referred to in subsection (1).</block>

<p>As far as I can see, there is no obligation on the inspector to show his authority even on demand. I know that in most of the laws which operate in South Africa that particular condition applies, namely that an inspector shall on demand exhibit his authority. We on this side of the House have always said that it is an extension of our philosophy that the State exists for the individual and not the individual for the State. That is why we believe that not only should the inspector have an authority, but that before he carries out his powers under the Act, he shall exhibit his authority.</p>

<p>I would like to endorse what my hon. friend from Constantia says, namely that there are examples of legislation where this particular provision is already embodied in the law, that the inspector &#x201C;shall&#x201D; exhibit his authority prior to conducting an inspection. We have it in the Atmospheric Pollution Act, in the Dental Mechanicians Act and we have it in the Plant Improvement Bill, which is still being discussed in the Other Place. We also have it in the Abattoir Industry Bill which is due for discussion in the Other Place shortly, but the hon. the Minister has accepted a similar provision in this House. I believe that in this particular Bill the position concerning the inspector is even weaker than in other legislation. The public is not being protected, because they cannot ask for a certificate of authority and, furthermore, those to be inspected, the manufacturers or marketers, are also entitled to some form of protection under this Bill. They are entitled to protection from imposters, as my colleague has already indicated. I believe it is the responsibility of the State in this particular instance, as this is a Bill to protect both those to be inspected and the public who require the inspections to be made to ensure that as consumers they are not being exploited.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is a feeling of deep disappointment about the fact that the hon. the Minister is not prepared to accept the two amendments moved by the hon. member for Constantia. I can only endorse what that hon. member and the hon. member for Berea have said regarding the second amendment which asks that the inspector, before exercising his duties, should show some form of identification. I want to stress particularly the point the hon. member for Constantia made regarding industrial espionage and industrial sabotage which is taking place. I believe that the hon. the Minister should accept this amendment for the benefit of his department, in order to show the <i>bona fides</i> of his department and in order to get the co-operation and full trust of the trading public, the traders, with whom the hon. the Minister is particularly concerned.</p>

<p>Regarding the first amendment moved by the hon. member, I believe that what he is trying to do here is to say to the hon. the Minister that as this clause reads at the moment, the inspector may investigate and may conduct investigations to gather such information as the secretary may require. This is tremendously wide. The secretary may desire any information, not necessarily information connected with this particular legislation. The amendment which the hon. member has moved, i.e. that it shall relate to a specific business or to a specific alleged contravention, attempts to get the power which the inspector may exercise at the request of the secretary, in some way bound to this particular legislation. I believe that it is a perfectly reasonable request. We have not, unfortunately, heard from the hon. the Minister, having heard only the argument of the hon. member for Constantia. Perhaps the hon. the Minister may indicate by a nod whether &#x2026;</p>

<p>He shakes his head to show that he has not changed his mind; he does not nod to show that he has changed his mind.

For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 7, in line 49, after &#x201C;information&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">in respect of any matter specified in this Act.</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) Any inspector furnished with inspection authority in writing by the secretary, may conduct investigations to gather such information, in respect of any matter specified in this Act, as the secretary may desire &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>I believe that this is perfectly reasonable and I do not believe that the hon. the Minister really can have any objection to that limitation, which is in fact no limitation if we are to accept the undertaking which the hon. the Minister gave in respect of the previous clause. He said there that the secretary would only act in terms of the provisions of the Act. If we look at the previous clause, the one we have just approved, clause 6, we will find that the secretary may from time to time, in respect of any matter specified in this Act, by notice in writing, demand certain information. All that I am asking now is that the hon. the Minister should put that same provision into clause 7 as he himself has inserted in clause 6. I believe that this is perfectly reasonable and that it does not in any way defeat the intention of the hon. the Minister or the intention of this Parliament with the passing of this Bill. I do not believe that it will hamstring or hinder his inspectors in any way and I believe that it can only do good in that it will go a long way towards gaining the confidence of the people with whom the inspectors are going to be concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am afraid that I must disappoint the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, but I want to say immediately that I cannot accept his amendment. The hon. member must now give me a chance to explain and not put on a disappointed face, because then I cannot argue with him.</p>

<p>&#x2020;If the hon. member refers to clause 7 of the Bill, he will find, firstly, that the insertion of the words that he proposes is completely superfluous because it is just a repetition of words that are there already. I will read the clause&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Any inspector furnished with inspection authority &#x2026; may conduct investigations to gather such information as the secretary may desire or to determine whether the provisions of this Act are being or have been complied with &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, the qualification which the hon. member intends to insert is there already. The hon. member wants me to insert the following words in line 49: &#x201C;in respect of any matter specified in this Act&#x201D;. I suggest, with due respect, that these words are just a repetition of what is already in clause 7, because the authority which can be given to the inspector must be related to the information which the secretary requires in order to establish whether the provisions of this legislation are being or have been complied with. For that purpose he has the other powers. If I was not sure that what the hon. member wants to insert is there already, I would have accepted his amendment immediately. But I give him the assurance that it is there already.</p>

<p>*We must differentiate between the identification of an inspector and a letter of authority for a specific inspection. I am prepared to consider providing that an inspector carrying out his authority in terms of clause 7 should identify himself on request as being an inspector. I am prepared to do this. Let us now look at what the hon. member for Constantia expects of me. In the first instance the secretary is authorized to obtain certain information in terms of clause 6. Naturally he can only request information which enables him to apply the Act. Therefore the limitation on the information which he can request is imposed by the objectives of the legislation itself, as they are described in the long title, <i>inter alia.</i> We come to clause 7 and define another method by which the secretary may obtain information. The issue here is no longer the extent or the range of the information which he wants to obtain, because this is determined in clause 6. This provision concerns a second method by which he may obtain it. This is by making use of inspectors. The inspector exercises his powers in terms of clause 7 directly under the authority of an instruction by the secretary. Therefore clause 7 says very emphatically that it takes place at the instruction of the secretary. Consequently the problem which hon. members see does not exist. The effectiveness of the legislation depends, in the first instance, on the effectiveness <span class="col_3843-3844" refersTo="page_0604"/>with which the secretary and his staff can gather information.</p>

<p>The second point which I want to make is that the information which they want to gather must refer to practices which are alleged to be undesirable. Therefore to concede on the one hand that in principle there must be legislation to protect the rights of consumers, and the following moment, when it comes to the functional implementation of the authorities granted by the legislation, to impose so many restrictions on the persons who have to enforce the legislation, makes the legislation ineffective and meaningless. Allow me to say&#x2014;and I do not apologize for it&#x2014;that this legislation is intended to combat abuses. In addition, I want to point out that the ingenuity of cunning businessmen knows no bounds. This is something which I want to emphasize.</p>

<p>Let us now look specifically at the amendments of the hon. member for Constantia. Before I deal with those amendments in detail, I want to repeat my offer to the hon. members. The hon. member for Constantia argued that when people try to discover other people&#x2019;s secrets, the possibility exists that people may pose as inspectors or as people with the authority to make inquiries, while they do not have that authority. In this respect I am prepared to meet him. I am prepared to move an amendment in the Other Place myself by means of which occurrences of this type may be prevented. However, I want to qualify this by saying that I shall make an amendment by which an inspector will be forced to identify himself to any business concern as an inspector so that no doubt may arise about the authority upon which such an inspector is acting. In this way, I believe, I would also cover the argument of the hon. member for Berea as far as identification is concerned. However, I cannot accept the arguments of the hon. member for Constantia. Just look at what it means. In his first amendment the hon. member proposes that authority in writing be granted to inspectors by the Secretary for Trade, in accordance with clause 7(1), in respect of the specific business undertaking. Remember, we are inspecting a practice, and if I inspect one trade practice which may possibly be undesirable, I must inspect all other business undertakings which are suspected of engaging in the same sort of practice. It is not practicable for me to give a list to an inspector of all the business undertakings which may be involved. I can only send him to a town with the instruction to inspect all the business undertakings and to establish whether a certain practice is indeed being engaged in. I cannot possibly give him a list of specific business undertakings.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks that I should otherwise give the inspector an authority in writing concerning a specific offence. I want to repeat that when this stage of an inquiry into alleged offences is reached, it becomes a matter for the Police, not for me nor for my department. Therefore I cannot say that I am going to investigate a specific offence. I cannot formulate any offence before I have gathered the necessary information concerning that alleged offence. I really feel that, in the light of the experience which the business community in general has had of my department&#x2014;and that is that my people do not abuse their powers&#x2014;as well as in the light of the particular responsibility which we all have to protect people from unscrupulous exploitation, hon. members will agree with me that we must not make these people unable to perform their work. I undertake to ensure that, should it be brought to my attention that any of my people are abusing their powers, I shall be the first to limit their authority. I shall do this by means of legislation, and I believe that hon. members know that my record in this respect is clean.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>When I am no longer there, you may proceed with your amendments. Mr. Chairman, I want to take the matter further. The proposed amendments actually mean that a business undertaking must already have been identified, that an offence must have been identified, and that I must then give a written authority to the inspector to inspect something of which I already know. I cannot do this. It is not possible. Furthermore it means that whenever an inspector has to go and inspect a matter, he must have a warrant in respect of the specific business undertaking where he must conduct his inspection. In my opinion, the amendment as it stands is impracticable. For this reason too I cannot accept it.</p>

<p>However, the hon. member moved a further amendment, namely that on page 9, in clause <span class="col_3845-3846" refersTo="page_0605"/>7, the following subclause be inserted after subclause (2)&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(3) Any inspector referred to in subsection (1) shall, before he exercises or performs any power or function under this Act, produce and exhibit to any person affected thereby, the inspection authority referred to in subsection (1).</li>

</ol>

<p>This is not only the general inspection authority, the right which an inspector has to make an inspection, but it is the inspection authority which is contained in the first amendment which the hon. member moved. Therefore it is the inspection authority which limits an inspector to the inspection of a specific business undertaking or of a specific offence. I shall read the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any inspector referred to in subsection (1) shall, before he exercises or performs any power or function under this Act, produce and exhibit to any person affected thereby, the inspection authority referred to in subsection (1).</block>

<p>I cannot accept the amendment in this form. However, allow me to design a method&#x2014;and I shall submit it to the hon. member for Constantia before I take it to the Other Place&#x2014;by means of which the identification process may take place. From a practical point of view, and for the reasons which I have advanced here, I cannot accept the amendments of the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>In all reasonableness I grant that a need may arise for a method by which my officials may be identified when requested to do so. I am prepared to make the necessary arrangements for that.</p>

<p>This brings to the amendment of the hon. member for Johannesburg North. He did not move his first amendment. However, I want to refer to the amendment which he did move. The hon. member for Ermelo dealt with the argument quite effectively. The Bill which is before us does not detract from the relationship of confidence between an attorney and his client. Whether this amendment is accepted or not, the legal position remains entirely clear. The hon. member for Ermelo referred to the case of Heimann, Maasdorp and Barker. I am not going to repeat this. It was made very clear in that case that in matters of this type, the usual legal rules must apply. Therefore I can assure the hon. member that it is not necessary to accept this amendment because the position in this connection is not changed by this legislation. An attorney will not be forced to provide information without the agreement of his client. I hope that he will accept this.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to put our case in connection with clause 7. Firstly, there must be certain powers given to inspectors so that they may carry out their functions in order to see that the law is obeyed. However, it is equally important to us that the rights of the public should be protected and that there should be no question of excessive authority on the part of inspectors. One of the problems we have with this piece of legislation is that we believe that clause 7 does grant excessive authority. We endeavoured in the Select Committee to have certain amendments accepted, but in each case we were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I also have a problem in regard to the amendments moved by the hon. member for Wonderboom. I endeavoured to question him about these because I think they need some elucidation. Firstly, he has moved an amendment to delete all the words after the word &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; in line 51 up to and including the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in line 54. As a result of that amendment the clause will read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any inspector furnished with inspection authority in writing by the secretary, may conduct investigations to gather such information as the secretary may desire or to determine whether the provisions of this Act are being or have been complied with, and may for that purpose at all reasonable times</block>

<p>The deletion of these words and the telescoping of subsections (1) and (2) will mean that the powers, granted in the original subsection (2)&#x2014;for example, the power under subsection (2)(b) on page 9 of the Bill to inspect anything under this Act for what may be a variety of purposes&#x2014;are now limited. When the hon. member drafted this amendment, I wonder whether it was his intention to limit the powers which inspectors had over and above the purpose originally envisaged in subsection (1). I doubt that that was his intention. The powers <span class="col_3847-3848" refersTo="page_0606"/>of the inspectors are now going to be limited with respect to other aspects of the Act which, to my mind, are equally important in relation to the collection of information not related to prosecutions. While one is desirous, on the one hand, of limiting powers in the public interest, one is not desirous of limiting powers needed for collecting information which would be necessary in terms of the Act. I would ask the hon. member to very seriously consider withdrawing this amendment because it does not achieved its purpose.</p>

<p>What amendment are you referring to&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to the first amendment of the hon. member.</p>

<p>I also have a problem with his second amendment. For some reason or other he wants to add the word &#x201C;manager&#x201D; to the words &#x201C;agent or employee&#x201D;. I have always understood&#x2014;and I do not think anyone understands it differently&#x2014;that an employee includes a manager and that a manager is an employee. I really cannot understand why the hon. member wants to do this, unless he now, in accordance with the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule, wants to limit the meaning of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; solely to those individuals in the top employment bracket such as managers. If that is his intention, I think he should tell us. However, I cannot understand why he wants to insert this word at all.</p>

<p>The third point I want to make is that we support amendment No. 1 of the hon. member for Constantia since we moved a similar amendment in the Select Committee. We support this amendment because we believe it is wholly undesirable to have warrants at large. The hon. the Minister made the point that he may want to investigate a whole series of businesses, but that can be specified. What worries us, however, is that an inspector can have a written authority and, as such, can then do anything he likes. He may inspect anything in terms of this authority. Inspection is not limited in any way, as can be seen from clause 7(1) which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any inspector furnished with an inspection authority in writing by the secretary, may conduct investigations to gather such information as the secretary may desire or to</block>

<p>determine whether the provisions of this Act are being or have been complied with &#x2026;</p>

<p>In other words, he can go on a jaunt on his own and decide that he is going to investigate whether the Act has been complied with irrespective of any particular mandate he may have been given. We believe that warrants at large and general warrants are contrary to the traditions of common law and are not desirable in these circumstances.</p>

<p>I now wish to refer to the second amendment. As I see merit in the argument of the hon. the Minister that the authority should rather be produced on demand than before the commencement of the inspection, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 9, to insert the following subsection to follow subsection (2):</block>

<ol>

<li>(2) Any inspector referred to in subsection (1) shall on demand exhibit to any person affected by the exercise or performance of any of his powers or functions under this act, the authority referred to in subsection (1).</li>

</ol>

<p>Unless this clause is amended to make it more acceptable within the basic concepts of the common law, we shall regrettably not be able to accept it.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was under the impression that the hon. the Minister, in considering the amendment moved by my colleague, the hon. member for Constantia, was prepared to meet him halfway. I thought he was prepared virtually to bring this Bill into line with many of the Acts in which that provision had already been established. However, I ask him to go further than that. If I understand the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville correctly, however, he is virtually reverting to the <i>status quo</i> that exists in the legislation to which I have referred. I would draw the attention of the hon. member for Yeoville to the fact that earlier this session a similar clause was debated. We on these benches then moved an amendment indicating that we felt it was desirable for an inspector to produce his authority, not on demand, but prior to inspection. In that instance we were supported by the hon. member for Bryanston. This was when we were considering the Plant <span class="col_3849-3850" refersTo="page_0607"/>Improvement Bill. He actually spoke in support of our amendment, which was subsequently accepted in the Other Place. With respect to the hon. member for Yeoville, I do not believe this amendment goes far enough. It still leaves a negative situation. I have quoted before what the then hon. Minister of Health said about liking a positive approach. He was all in favour of a person saying:&#x201C;I am an inspector, this is my authority and I wish to perform certain duties under the Act.&#x201D; What this hon. Minister wants is for the inspector to arrive, declare himself to be an inspector and then to require the person being inspected virtually to question openly the <i>bona fides</i> of the inspector because, if he has the slightest doubt in his mind, he must ask the inspector for his authority. I believe that is detrimental to human relationships because human beings being what they are, resistance will immediately be built up in the mind of the inspector. His reaction will be: This man does not trust me; he does not trust my <i>bona fides</i> and does not accept me, so I will make things difficult for him; I will therefore use my authority to the full extent permitted by the Act. We on this side of the House therefore ask the hon. the Minister to adopt the spirit of sweet reasonableness which many of his colleagues have adopted, some even during this session, and to bring the provision into line with the provisions in other legislation that has already been accepted.</p>

Let us say that a man arrives at my store, a man I have not seen before, and introduces himself as Joe Soap. He may say: &#x201C;I am an inspector of the Minister of Economic Affairs and I have come to have a look at your place in terms of the Trade Practices Act.&#x201D; I might reply: &#x201C;I am very pleased to meet you. How do you do&#x003F; Have a cup of tea. Tell me where you come from. Have you been in this job long&#x003F;&#x201D; In so doing, I shall be trying to ascertain the <i>bona fides</i> of the man who has suddenly appeared and introduced himself as Joe Soap, an inspector of the department&#x2014;a man I see for the first time. Consider what he can do in terms of the Bill. He can come to my store and demand that I open every package in the shop; he can demand that I produce every book that I have and open it for him to see; he can take goods away; he can demand every invoice I have; and he can demand every copy of every advertisement I have in my shop.

<p>If that hon. member made a pleasant noise, we might still put up with it. A few days ago we considered the following amendment which was moved by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture in the Other Place to the Plant Improvement Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where an officer acting under the written authority of the registrar carried out any inspection in terms of subsection (1) in the presence of any person affected by the inspection, the officer shall first produce such written authority to such person.</block>

<p>What could be more reasonable than such an amendment&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister does not like the present wording of the amendment, we are prepared to accept an undertaking from him that he will move an amendment along these lines in the Other Place. However, immediately when he introduces the element of the shopkeeper or the person being investigated demanding the inspector&#x2019;s authority of him, I am afraid we cannot go along with him. I believe it should be on a voluntary basis. My experience is that the inspector arrives and says: &#x201C;Good afternoon. I am Mr. X. Here is my authority.&#x201D; In such a case one does not <span class="col_3851-3852" refersTo="page_0608"/>even look at it. I have never looked at such proof. One accepts his <i>bona fides</i> straight away and one replies: &#x201C;Yes, Mr. X, what can I do to help you&#x003F;&#x201D; That is the attitude one immediately adopts, an attitude of co-operation. The hon. the Minister is going to defeat his own ends if the inspector can simply walk in and snoop around without even introducing himself. In terms of the Bill, he need not even say: &#x201C;I am an inspector of the department.&#x201D; He can simply walk in, snoop around and demand to see one&#x2019;s books, etc. without saying a thing.</p>

<block name="quote">Any inspector furnished with inspection authority in writing by the secretary, may conduct investigations &#x2026;</block>

<p>He can conduct such investigations with two objects in mind. The first is &#x201C;to gather such information as the secretary may desire&#x201D;. In terms of the wording, that is as wide as the world. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that concerns the second object of such an investigation. Let me tell him what it is. As I have said, the first is &#x201C;to gather such information as the secretary may desire&#x201D;. The second object is &#x201C;to determine whether the provisions of this Act are being or have been complied with&#x201D;. Those are the two functions the inspectors have. As the hon. the Minister knows, my first reaction was to take out the first function and to say that it would be adequate if this were amended to read that &#x201C;any inspector &#x2026; may conduct investigations &#x2026; to determine whether the provisions of this Act are being or have been complied with&#x201D;. If we follow the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument, the inspector does not need to gather information. However, I accept that the inspector should have to carry out these two functions, viz. to gather information and to determine whether the provisions of the Act are being complied with, but when such an inspector seeks to gather information, he should then be limited to the provisions of the Act. It must not be an unlimited provision. The hon. the Minister referred me to the long title. It simply says that the Bill&#x2019;s aim is to see that there are not improper trade practices taking place. That is all the long title says. I do not believe that the hon. the Minister is right in his argument. I do not believe either that our amendments are unreasonable or that they will affect the operation of this legislation in any way. I believe that the hon. the Minister should accept our amendments.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to repeat that I am not prepared to accept amendments to the legislation that would completely impede its practicability. I have already indicated that I am prepared to introduce an amendment in the Other Place which would provide that the inspector has to identify himself, but I am not prepared to go any further than this. I have said this before, so I do not want to debate this point any further.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I do not agree with the hon. member for Yeoville that the powers of inspectors are excessive. I should rather suggest that the abuses which we want to deal with are excessive. Therefore I am not going to handicap inspectors or allow them to be handicapped. Let me go further. The powers of inspectors are not excessive and I have <span class="col_3853-3854" refersTo="page_0609"/>certain reasons for saying that. Firstly, they execute those powers in terms of an authority from the Secretary for Commerce. The Secretary for Commerce derives his own powers in terms of clause 6(1) of the Bill. Hon. members agreed to clause 6. In other words, if a limitation had to be placed on the powers of inspectors, a limitation must of necessity also be placed on the powers of the Secretary. If there had to be such a curtailment, hon. members should accordingly have moved an amendment to clause 6.</p>

<p>Just a moment. The fact of the matter is that in terms of clause 5 the secretary can delegate certain powers to these inspectors. In terms of clause 6 he has the right to obtain information. Clause 7 does not go beyond a particular point; it merely establishes how information is to be obtained.</p>

<p>Wait a moment. I want to reiterate that I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia because it would mean that in the case of every inspection and every request by an inspector, the inspector not only has to identify himself by producing his authority as an inspector, but must also produce a specific warrant. Secondly, he must have a specific order to investigate a specific business.</p>

<p>*It serves no purpose for hon. members to agree with me on the principle of protection on the one hand and then, when I have to create the mechanism for implementing it, to restrict me to such an extent that I am unable to do it properly. I want to repeat, to make my position quite clear, that I am prepared, not to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville as it stands, but to accept its spirit and to consider, in the light of the request made by the hon. members for Berea and Pietermaritzburg South, whether the authority which the inspector has for acting in that capacity should be produced when he wants to inspect a business. When I have done that, I think we shall have gone far enough.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to react very briefly to the hon. the Minister. For him to say that we should have voted against clause 6 &#x2026; [Interjections.] Clause 6 gives completely different powers. In clause 6 there is no power of entry as there is in clause 7. There is no power of seizure as there is in clause 7. With great respect, the matter is quite different. What the hon. the Minister will not appreciate is that in the first instance the rights to property are sacrosanct. Basically we talk about people&#x2019;s homes being their castles. It is only when you have valid public reason that you can break those sacrosanct rules and even then there must be safeguards in favour of the public. The difficulty we have with this clause&#x2014;and we cannot understand why the Minister is so intransigent&#x2014;is that he refuses to give the safeguards which the public are entitled to when you encroach upon what has from time immemorial been a sacrosanct right. As I said right in the beginning, we accept that there must be powers to inspect, as we accept that there must be the right to obtain information, but we also stand by the fact that when you break into these sacrosanct rights which, as I have said, have been there from time immemorial, the rights of the individual, of the public, are entitled to be safeguarded, and that is what unfortunately this clause does not do.</p>

<block name="quote">On page 11, to add the following subsection at the end of the clause:</block>

<ol>

<li>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of subsection (1), one or more of the following, however expressed, constitute a contravention of the prohibitions therein contained:</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(a) A representation that the subject of a sale or lease has sponsorship, approval, performance characteristics, accessories, ingredients, quantities, components, uses or benefits that it does not have.</li>

<li>(b) A representation that the seller or lessor has a sponsorship, approval, status, affiliation or connection that he does not have.</li>

<li>(c) A representation that the subject of a sale or lease is of a particular standard, quality, grade, style or model if it is not.</li>

<li>(d) A representation that the subject of a sale or lease has been used to an extent that is different from the fact.</li>

<li>(e) A representation that the subject of a sale or lease is new or Unused if it is not or if it is deteriorated, altered, reconditioned or reclaimed.</li>

<li>(f) A representation that the subject of a sale or lease has a particular prior history or usage if it has not.</li>

<li>(g) A representation that the subject of a sale or lease is available for a reason that is different from the fact.</li>

<li>(h) A representation that the subject of a sale or lease has been made available in accordance with a previous representation if it has not.</li>

<li>(i) A representation that the subject of a sale or lease is available, if the seller or lessor has no intention of <span class="col_3857-3858" refersTo="page_0611"/>selling or leasing or otherwise disposing of the subject as represented.</li>

<li>(j) A representation that a service, part, replacement or repair is needed if it is not.</li>

<li>(k) A representation that the purpose or intent of any solicitation of, or any communication with, a consumer by a seller or lessor is for a purpose or intent different from the fact.</li>

<li>(l) A representation that a sale or lease involves or does not involve rights, remedies or obligations, if the representation if false or misleading.</li>

<li>(m) A representation such that a consumer might reasonably conclude that the subject of a sale or lease is available in greater quantities than are in fact available from the seller or lessor, unless the limitation of availability represented by the seller or lessor has been given prominence.</li>

<li>(n) A representation as to the authority of a salesman, representative, employee or agent to negotiate the final terms of a sale or lease, if the representation is different from the fact.</li>

<li>(o) Where an estimate or quotation of the price or rental of a sale or lease is materially less than the price or rental of the sale or lease as subsequently determined or demanded by the seller or lessor, and the seller or lessor has proceeded with his performance of the sale or lease without the express consent of the consumer.</li>

<li>(p) The use, in any oral or written representation, of exaggeration, innuendo or ambiguity as to a material fact, or failure to state a material fact, if the representation is false or misleading.</li>

</ol>

<p>I believe that this amendment is probably the most important one that I have on the Order Paper in so far as this legislation is concerned. Clause 9 is probably the guts of this whole piece of legislation. It is this clause which makes it an offence to make a false or misleading statement in connection with any advertisement, any sale or any provision of service. I believe that it is this clause that will cover the majority of undesirable trade practices which this Bill is designed to stop. The Bill is primarily aimed at protecting the consumer and where the consumer needs protection most, is in respect of wrong, false or misleading statements, misleading information given in advertisements or given when a sale is made. However, the nature of these offences is so wide that it covers an enormous variety of types of deeds. It covers, for instance, misleading descriptions in mail order catalogues. It covers false claims by secondhand motorcar salesmen. It covers gross exaggeration by encyclopaedia salesmen. It covers gross exaggeration in advertisements of patent medicines and so the variety of possible offences goes on. It is for the reason that the variety of offences is so wide, that this clause has had to be framed in very wide and general terms and in very wide and general wording. I believe that as a result of the generality of the definition of the offence in terms of this clause, it is going to be extremely difficult to prove guilt and to obtain convictions in respect of these proposed offences. At very best, I regard this clause as being a deterrent against the commission of these offences and I sincerely hope that it will be a strong deterrent. However, I believe that this clause would be very much more effective both in proving guilt and as a deterrent against the commission of these offences, if those offences were to be spelt out in more detail than they are at present.</p>

<p>During the recess I had the opportunity of attending a seminar in Toronto on the subject of trade practices. On that occasion I was able to learn what the provinces in Canada were doing in regard to consumer protection and trade practices and I also had the privilege of having discussions with some of the provincial ministers involved. As a result of those discussions, I learnt that the Canadian experience had been that it was very, very necessary, in order to make the legislation effective, to spell out the offences in regard to false and misleading advertising and selling practices. Those offences should be spelt out in detail and one should not rely on a general clause.</p>

<p>The amendment I have moved is an <span class="col_3859-3860" refersTo="page_0612"/>adaption of the British Columbian Trade Practices Act and as hon. members will see, in addition to the general clause, it spells out 16 specific offences. I believe it is very important that this is done. I believe that this is the only way in which we are really going to give teeth to this clause and, as I have said, this clause probably covers the great majority of potential offences to be dealt with by this legislation. It may be argued that there are legal technicalities against the acceptance of this amendment. My colleagues, who are better versed in legal technicalities, will, if necessary, deal with that subject, but I do want to appeal very strongly to the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to this amendment. I believe that if it is accepted, it will bring about a very great improvement to this legislation. It will give it the necessary teeth both to enable prosecutions to be made in terms of the Act and to make this legislation a far greater deterrent against the commission of offences than it will be as long as the offences are described in terms as general as they are at present.</p>

<p>He does not seem to be. The effect of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia is that he wants to add a new subsection (2), providing for specific offences, subject to the general provisions and without prejudicing the generality of the provisions of subsection (1). I want to say at once that the amendment is not acceptable to me for one reason only, i.e. that in terms of the existing legal rules, the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule, it is a fact that if we were to amend this clause as the hon. member has proposed, the interpretation of the general clause would be limited to offences similar to the specific ones mentioned by him. Therefore I want to repeat that I have no fault to find with any of the specific offences. I think the hon. member will agree with me that there may be other offences in addition to these he has specified which may also have to be prohibited or which could be prohibited. I understand the hon. member&#x2019;s problem in this connection. It is a fact that if I stick to the general provision, any specific offence which can be accommodated within the general provision can be an offence. However, as soon as a general provision is followed by specific offences, as the hon. member has proposed, the interpretation of the general provision is limited to acts similar to the ones specified. Although I can understand the motive of the hon. member, that&#x2014;as he puts it&#x2014;he wants to give teeth to this provision, and although I support him in this, he will understand that it is my duty, in evaluating it, to see whether we would be strengthening or weakening the clause by accepting this amendment. The statement has been made that the proposed amendment would detract from the effectiveness of the provision in the sense&#x2014;this is what I allege&#x2014; that the general provisions would have to be interpreted in a restrictive way in accordance <span class="col_3861-3862" refersTo="page_0613"/>with the particulars of the specific provisions. Let us say that my argument is wrong, in the sense that it is not a foregone conclusion that I am right. Let us say that I may be wrong or that it is at least debatable whether I am right or not. The hon. member for Jeppe agrees with me.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Very well. If there is any doubt, I run the risk of having a court rule against me, do I not&#x003F; However, this could not happen if I were to retain only the general provision. Surely this is so.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The position in terms of the law of interpretation is that, when a general provision in an Act is followed by a specific provision, the interpretation of the general provision is limited, under the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule to those that are related to the specific provisions.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member in all fairness: Why leave this clause, which, as the hon. member correctly says, is the crux of this Bill, in doubt&#x003F; The best that can be said for the other side of the argument is that there could be doubt. I am prepared to state here and now that all these specific provisions which the hon. member wishes to introduce into the Bill represent for me&#x2014;as I interpret the general provisions of clause 9&#x2014;contraventions of clause 9. Therefore it can be accommodated under the general provisions of this clause. I want to ask the hon. member whether he will not agree with the fairness of my point, namely to accept my argument that the general provisions are adequate to cover the specific ones. Why limit the interpretation of the general by the specific&#x003F; Because that is the law of interpretation.</p>

<p>*Surely we all want to make the ambit of the Act as wide as possible in regard to this aspect. No one would argue about that. Secondly, we want to ensure that there will be no dispute or doubt as to the interpretation of the section, and if we are agreed about that, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to the hon. the Minister, I want to say, firstly, that we owe a debt of gratitude to the hon. member for Constantia for having taken advantage of an opportunity whilst he was abroad to attend the seminar on trade practices and to acquaint himself with what is going on in other countries, because it is very important, particularly in the law of commerce, that we should learn something from other countries, especially the large countries which are engaged in commerce on a very extensive and vast scale. With regard to what the hon. the Minister has said, I realize the logic of his argument from an interpretation point of view, but on the other hand we have the difficulty that in clauses of such a general nature, the hon. the Minister will find that defences will be put up in the most ingenious manner by that small group of people which he has maintained acts to the detriment of commerce generally. They will use every ingenious form of defence in order to skirt around the general terms of the three paragraphs that make up this provision. When you talk about &#x201C;false and misleading in material respects&#x201D;, there is a field that is wide open as to whether it is material or not. I am reading from line 2 on page 11, just to give an example. Just as you might be limiting the scope of the Bill by certain specific provisions, as he himself suggests, so on the other hand the wide scope of the Bill may defeat the objective that we have in mind. When you have an extensive list of this nature, which to a very large extent will cover some of the malpractices that take place, some of the very things that we wish to protect as far as the style of trade practices is concerned, then you have a better chance of taking action. That is why the hon. member talks of giving teeth to the Bill, and why he regards it as so important, because then you have at least a better opportunity to ensure that certainly to a very large extent you will have covered the contraventions that can take place in terms of this statute. Although the hon. the Minister may be technically correct in his argument, in practice this is not necessarily so; and if one becomes almost absolute, thereby avoiding the rule of <i>aude alteram partem,</i> the accused will not be able to put up a reasonable defence at all. Therefore you have both those particular aspects on the wide spectrum. The objective of the hon. member is to ensure that, as far as possible, a large measure of the contraventions will be covered. Whilst I realize that the words &#x201C;without prejudice to the generality&#x201D; may be strictly interpreted, because I know the strict interpretation of the courts, I nevertheless do <span class="col_3863-3864" refersTo="page_0614"/>feel that in the case of this particular Bill, the objective that we have in mind is to make a very serious and sincere effort to list the possible contraventions. To that extent I think it will be worth while for the hon. the Minister to consider seriously the acceptance of this amendment.</p>

<p>I do not think that will harm or weaken his case in this matter. I do not think it will actually weaken the effect of the Bill. I do not think it weakens the Bill, because, as I say, it is impossible to make it completely absolute on account of the other difficulty that presents itself immediately. Therefore I believe this is a reasonable amendment. It is obvious that other countries have considered this type of thing, where this question of trade practices has been a worrying problem over a number of years, and it is quite clear that in a large part of the world, this form of risk of limitation is being accepted. To as large an extent as possible at least, we feel it covers the contraventions which flow from this type of Bill.</p>

<p>That hon. member has apparently not been overseas yet. The hon. member has taken his amendment out of the Canadian legislation. He would be the first one to concede that this is not an exhaustive list. I think he will agree, and the hon. member for Jeppe will also agree. Having thus agreed with me in this respect, I want to tell them that I have only two alternatives: Either I have to put in an exhaustive list, or I have to put in a general provision. Those are the two alternatives I have.</p>

<p>Surely, the hon. member will appreciate that, if those are my alternatives, the application of the Bill will be restricted should I accept this amendment. That is the only case I am trying to make out. I do not mean this unkindly to the hon. member for Constantia. I have indicated that I accept his nine specific examples of actions which we want to declare contraventions. However, having conceded that this list is not exhaustive, and also accepting the legal principle in respect of which&#x2014;as the hon. member for Jeppe says&#x2014;I am technically correct &#x2026;</p>

I do, however, suggest that he accept the authority of the authority, and that is L. C. Steyn in his work, <i>The Law of Interpretation.</i> He will find the relevant passage on page 30. I therefore want to repeat what I have said. We now know some of the specific cases that the hon. member has in mind as constituting contraventions. I agree with him on that. I agree with him that these instances should be regarded as contraventions. I also agree that the list is not exhaustive, but I ask him in all sincerity, having accepted his argument, not to place the provision and its interpretation in doubt because that legal principle of interpretation exists whether we like it or not.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understood the hon. the Minister to say, when he first spoke on this clause, that he did not accept the amendment for one specific reason.</p>

<p>I made a note of it. The reason was that the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule would detract from the effect of the generalities in the clause itself, as printed in the Bill. If, however, I can satisfy the hon. the Minister that the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule does not apply here, will he then agree to allow the amendment to go through as it stands&#x003F; I ask the hon. the Minister to look again at what Steyn has to say in <i>Uitleg van Wette</i> and to see if he can find there any decision given in regard to the preamble as set out in the amendment namely &#x201C;without prejudice to the generalities of the provisions of subsection (1)&#x201D;. This eliminates completely the operation of the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule, and I shall tell the hon. the Minister why. This type of clause has been used on many occasions in various other types of legislation. The <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule is used in the interpretation of a statute when there is some confusion as to how it should be interpreted. In this particular amendment, however, it is clearly without prejudice. In other words, what the legislation is saying is that without detracting from the powers of the generalities, the following should also be considered as contravention of the statute in question. I shall give the hon. the Minister an example. Let me refer him to legislation we passed yesterday in connection with Rehoboth self-government. That legislation contained the same type of clause. Let me quote section 39(1) of what is to be the Rehoboth Self-Government Act. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All such executive powers, authorities and functions as are necessary to be exercised in terms of this Act for bringing this Act into operation and, if necessary, for ensuring the continuation of the administration of Rehoboth in terms of this Act, may be exercised by the Minister.</block>

<p>Now let me quote from section 39(2) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of subsection (1) the Minister may in the transition period &#x2026;</block>

<p>We then have a whole list of acts or operations which the Minister can carry out without prejudice to the generalities of subsection (1). Let me give the hon. the Minister another example a am now referring to a Bill which is going be discussed tomorrow, the Parliamentary Internal Security Commission Bill. Even in that Bill there is a &#x201C;without prejudice to the generalities&#x201D; clause. Let me quote it to him.</p>

<speech by="#bell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me as if the hon. the Minister does not want to listen very carefully here. Clause 4(1) of the Parliamentary Internal Security Commission Bill states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission shall investigate matters which, in the opinion of the State President, affect internal security and which are referred to it by the State President, and shall report thereon to the State President.</block>

<p>Then I go on to clause 4(2) which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of subsection (1), the State President may also refer &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_3867-3868" refersTo="page_0616"/>Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of subsection (1), one or more of the following, however expressed, constitute a contravention of the prohibitions therein contained.</p>

<p>My whole point&#x2014;and I am sorry if the hon. the Minister does not get my point&#x2014;is that once words are used in legislation clearly depicting the fact that the specific elements are without prejudice to the generalities, the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule does not apply. To go on from there, the reason why this amendment is being introduced is because of the fact that the general public, on reading the generalities, will certainly have some difficulty in deciding whether any specific act of theirs is, in fact, a contravention of the Bill itself or not. The idea of inserting these specific elements is to elaborate and thereby assist the general public to remain within the confines of the law itself.</p>

<p>This amendment follows the Canadian Act almost exactly, and as the hon. member for Constantia has pointed out, the Canadian Act has proved successful over a period of years. They have generalities as well; they have also got specific elements, which have been slightly amended by the hon. member for Constantia to fit in with this particular Bill itself. The fact that this type of legislation has proved successful in Canada, I believe, should be a factor in allowing the Minister to decide that this is a good amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the motive behind this amendment is a laudable one. I do not think there is any dispute about that. I also, with respect, agree with the hon. member for East London City on legal grounds because to my knowledge there is an English authority which specifically deals, not with the phrase &#x201C;without prejudice to the generality&#x201D; of the provision, but with the phrase &#x201C;without restricting the generality&#x201D; of the provision, which in effect is one and the same thing. It has been held in English courts that this excludes the <i>eiusdem generis</i> rule. I must therefore agree with the hon. member for East London City.</p>

<p>However, I have some other problems in relation to this matter, and I should like to list them. Firstly I think there might be a possibility that the public, on reading these specific provisions, may think that this is all that is being legislated against. I think this is a problem that does exist, and one must not create the wrong impression that this is all that is being legislated against.</p>

<p>My second difficulty involves the provision that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not stated, however, that all the factors listed must be material representation or that they must be material in other respects. The authorizing main clause, on the other hand, states that a representation must in material respect be misleading. If it were stated at the beginning of this clause that the provisions had to be material, there would be no problem. The way this is drafted, however, it means that a representation, even though it may not be material, will, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as a contravention of the main general section. This, I regretfully submit, is an omission. Let me just take a couple of random examples. Let me take the one marked as (m). It reads&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">A representation as to the authority of the salesman, representative, employee or agent to negotiate the final terms of the sale or lease, if the representation is different from the fact.</block>

<p>I think that the lawyers in this House will concede that where there is a representation as to authority, then that authority cannot be denied, there will then be an estoppel. This particular paragraph (n) is therefore a complete irrelevancy because, if one represents the authority, one will be estopped in law from denying the authority, and I think the hon. member for East London City will be the first to agree with that in terms of legal interpretation.</p>

<p>The amendment deals with some of the problems which I think will arise from dealing with specific instances of misrepresentation. May I again draw attention to the fact that it is necessary in the proposed amendment, if it were to be accepted, to make it clear that all the alleged representations would be material misrepresentations. Without that serious problems <span class="col_3869-3870" refersTo="page_0617"/>would arise. I do not want to go into details about each of the items which have been listed in the amendment, but I would like to draw attention to comparative law. This amendment has been taken from a Canadian statute and I want to draw attention to the fact that it is not a general practice in all countries that all the specific items are listed. If I may, for example, quote the provision of the German law relating to this. It says that any person who in the course of business activities for purposes of competition, commits acts contrary to honest practices, may be enjoined from completing such acts and held for damages. Here again it is done in broad, and not in specific, terms. I think there is substantial advantage in having a provision in broad terms as opposed to setting out all the details. I am not suggesting that we adopt the German example. I am merely pointing out that the German law does not give specific instances.</p>

<p>In regard to the American statute, there the practice must be misleading or deceptive of the public. Here again it is not specified in detail. So whereas we have no problem in accepting an amendment which sets out details. There are certain essential requirements. In the first place the details must be clearly accurate, so that there is no question of any one of them creating a problem, and secondly, the representations must in each case be material. However, we do feel that the position is covered by the broad section which is presently in the Act, and if there is to be an amendment it will have to be very carefully considered to make sure that the public is not led into the trap of believing that the stipulated instances are the only instances for which they can be prosecuted. So, with respect, while we have no substantial objections to the amendment, in its present form, it would create difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. the Minister and I are in principle in agreement in regard to the object of the amendment I have moved. The hon. the Minister appreciates that if in addition to the general clauses it is legally possible to include specific clauses, this legislation will have more teeth and will be more enforceable than presently drafted. I appreciate that the Minister has legal difficulties in this respect and that he fears that the specific offences which are enumerated in the amendment I have proposed will, if included in the Bill, destroy the effectiveness of the general clause. Well, I have listened to arguments for and against the Minister&#x2019;s thinking. The hon. member for East London City was, in my opinion, very convincing in his arguments against it. Since the adjournment I have had the advantage of some very, very sound legal advice, and I would like to put to the Minister a proposal which I feel will satisfy his as well as my difficulty. That is that this whole clause 9 should be redrafted and that the specific offences which I have enumerated in the amendment be included as offences under this clause, but to them should be added as further offences to three general clauses appearing in the Bill as presently drafted. I appreciate the argument raised by the hon. member for Yeoville in regard to the fact that all representations, all false or deceptive representations, should be material. My proposal to the hon. the Minister would be that he should reconsider this whole clause and redraft it to include the amendments I have proposed and the suggestions that have been proposed by the hon. member for Yeoville, retaining, as I have suggested, as additional subsections the three general provisions at present in the Bill. I believe that if he were to accept this, we would be greatly improving this measure, we would be greatly improving the effectiveness of it while at the same time satisfying both sides of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Constantia impressed me. He indicated before we adjourned that he thought that the hon. member for East London City had a very good argument. However, in the adjournment he had the benefit of sound legal advice and now believes that there is an alternative for this clause.</p>

<p>*Sir, let me say immediately that the hon. member for East London City asked whether, if he was able to convince me that my argument in respect of the Interpretation Act was wrong, I would accept it. But he did not convince me, because all he did was to quote other legislation which contains a similar provision. I do not think he will disagree with me when I say that this is not convincing proof. Be that as it may, the point is that hon. members are arguing against each other. What <span class="col_3871-3872" refersTo="page_0618"/>the hon. member for Constantia wants, is specific examples of the offences, but he still wants this to be covered by a general provision. The hon. member for Yeoville said quite rightly that when one reads only the specific examples, it could be regarded as if the general provision does not exist. The fundamental objection I have to the amendment, remains, i.e. that the general provision is qualified by the specific instances. It is possible for the specific instances to be mentioned and then conclude with a general provision. I am quite prepared to give the assurance now that I shall reconsider the provision. However, I am unable to accept the amendment as it reads at present.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, again the hon. the Minister has disappointed us. He says that we on this side are arguing against each other. Sir, I do not know how he can say that. Then he goes further and says that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia would have the effect of reducing the generality of the provisions of clause 9. I do not claim to have had the years of experience in the practice of law that the hon. the Minister has had, but I can claim to have had a few years&#x2019; experience of interpreting the law from the Bench and I want to say just this to the hon. the Minister, that where we have had provisions like this in the courts, the courts have used such a clause as a guide in determining whether or not an offence was committed. We have in clause 9 a general clause which leaves a large discretion to the court in deciding whether or not certain offences have been committed, whether or not there have been transgressions of a particular Act. All that the hon. member for Constantia is moving here is a list of items which will help the courts in determining whether a particular alleged offence does in fact constitute a transgression of the provisions of clause 9. However, there is another aspect to this and that is where I as a practical trader come in. Today, if I as a trader who has no knowledge of the law were to read clause 9, I would not know exactly what is not allowed and what is allowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall confine myself to the clause. Obviously the hon. member for Newcastle knows nothing about the clause. A trader, a person who can be affected by this Bill when it becomes law, finds some assistance in the form of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia, because the amendment will help him to decide exactly how clause 9 should be interpreted. The hon. the Minister concedes that clause 9 is very wide. It is deliberately framed to cover a wide field. It is like casting a net in the hope of catching something. That is what the hon. the Minister is doing in clause 9 as it reads at the moment. The hon. member for Constantia, however, is saying to the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Look, tell those fish that you are looking for, exactly what you are going to do with the net you are casting wide.&#x201D; I believe that on those two grounds alone the hon. the Minister should at least consider this amendment. He has said that he will consider a similar amendment in the Other Place, but once the Bill has gone from here, we have lost control. I do not think there is any need for the hon. the Minister to consider anything. I believe that what the hon. member for Constantia has placed before the Committee this evening, is what is needed in this Bill. I believe the hon. the Minister should accept the amendment.</p>

<li>(a) in connection with the sale of any goods or the rendering of any service, supply or give, or offer to promise to supply or give, any trade coupon if it is a condition of such trade coupon that the person to whom it is supplied, given, offered or promised, must buy or hire any goods or make use of any service in respect of which he must give any consideration, before he is entitled to receive, or to participate in any competition for, any relevant benefit.</li>

</ol>

<p>This means in effect that the ordinary coupon that has been given before and in regard to which there has been no problem in using it in order to get a discount on goods or to enter a competition, is now being done away with. What is remarkable is that this is in contradiction to an amendment agreed to by the Select Committee to add para, (i) to clause 11.</p>

<p><span class="col_3875-3876" refersTo="page_0620"/>Nobody then suggested that that paragraph should be deleted, and the effect is that we are now amending a clause in such a way that it becomes contradictory to another clause. I maintain that such an amendment will be contrary to what the hon. the Minister said during the Second Reading when he indicated what he wanted to achieve. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South spoke at great length about the desirability of having the type of coupon which we are now banning. The hon. the Minister agreed that such coupons should exist.

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to reply to the argument raised by the hon. member for Yeoville. On page 13 of the Bill there appears clause 12(i), to which the hon. member for Yeoville referred. According to the legal opinion I obtained, that provision is altogether in conflict with clause 10, because in para, (i) it is specifically laid down that a trade coupon may be issued, while clause 10 lays down that it may only be issued provided no consideration has to be given if someone wants to participate in a competition. All that is being done now, is that another provision is being inserted in clause 10 and when we come to clause 11, it will be moved that para, (i) be deleted. Therefore, what is being envisaged, is to remove the contradiction from the Bill. In terms of clause 10(a) as it will read when the amendment has been accepted, it will not be possible for a trade coupon to be issued if it is issued on condition that the receiver has to give a consideration in order to participate in a competition. It is a fact that clauses 10 and 11(i) are not reconcilable, and the amendment I moved merely intends to remove this contradiction. There is no change in principle embodied in the amendment whatsoever.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to furnish hon. members with a supplementary explanation to that furnished by the hon. member for Wonderboom. If the hon. member for Yeoville considers the amendment the hon. member for Wonderboom intends moving on clause 11, he will find that it really amounts to provisions being transferred from a certain clause to another. The provision embodied in his second amendment which the hon. member objected to&#x2014;the hon. member should just stop shaking his head; he should listen to what I have to say&#x2014;is really inserted here instead of in clause 11(i), as has been said by the hon. member for Wonderboom. The implication of it is that clause 10(a) now makes it clear that the use of trade coupons is prohibited if it is a condition of the coupon that the holder thereof has to give a consideration in respect of the goods or services before he is entitled to receive, or to participate in any competition for, any relevant benefit. If fact, it only seeks to remove a contradiction which exists at present. In other words, the provision in clause 11(i) will be deleted and inserted in clause 10.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if what the hon. the Minister said were correct, I would have no difficulty with it but unfortunately it is not correct. Any reading of this measure makes it clear that if, for example, one gets a coupon which entitles one to a discount on another purchase one makes, that is now disallowed in terms of the amendment which is being suggested. That is the effect of it. It is no use the hon. the Minister contorting his face, because that will not change the Bill. The Bill will remain the same whatever the shape of his face. It is unfortunately only the amendment that can affect the Bill. With great respect, Sir, in the circumstances this amendment goes contrary to what was said during the Second Reading, it goes contrary to what was decided in the Select Committee. It restricts the availability and use of trade coupons for a purpose which, in fact, everyone has accepted as being quite legitimate. I regret that I cannot support this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as has been pointed out by the hon. member for Yeoville, this is a matter which I discussed with the hon. the Minister at the Second Reading. The hon. the Minister is on record in Hansard as having accepted this very principle to which the hon. member for Yeoville has drawn his attention. The effect of the amendment was pointed out by the hon. member.</p>

<p>If I may be allowed briefly to refer to paragraph (i) of clause 11, one finds that clause 11 deals with exceptions. Certain exceptions are provided for to the generality of clause 10 which, in turn, provides for prohibitions <span class="col_3877-3878" refersTo="page_0621"/>in respect of trade coupons. In terms of paragraph (i), &#x201C;the supply or giving or the offer of a trade coupon, whether or not it forms part of an advertisement relating to goods or a service&#x201D;, shall not be construed as an offence. That is why it is placed in clause 11. It is placed there to provide an exception. However, in terms of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Wonderboom, this measure will be taken out of the &#x201C;exceptions&#x201D; clause and placed in clause 10 which provides for the prohibitions. Paragraph (a) of clause 10 will accordingly stipulate that no person shall &#x201C;in connection with the sale of any goods or the rendering or provision of any service, supply or give, or offer or promise to supply or give, any trade coupon if it is a condition of such trade coupon that the person to whom it is supplied, given, etc.&#x201D; first purchase some goods.

In such a case an exception should be allowed in terms of this legislation. The hon. the Minister conceded this at the Second Reading, but now this amendment seeks to negate that very provision in spite of the undertaking given by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think hon. members are seeing ghosts where there is no cemetery. What the amendment amounts to is that coupons may no longer be issued, except under the exceptions laid down in clause 11. It is being made quite clear that a coupon may not be issued as a consideration to be able to participate in a competition. In other words, the objection raised by the hon. member falls away completely, because there is no substantial change of approach. The provision is merely being transferred. Whereas paragraph (i) forms part of clause 11, it implies that trade coupons may in fact be issued, but this is not the case. They may only be issued under the exceptions contained in clause 11.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me first deal with amendment No. 16 moved by the hon. member for Wonderboom. Let us just read what we are deleting from clause 11. As it stands at present, the position is that the provisions of clause 10 shall not be so construed as to prohibit&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the supply or giving or the offer of a trade coupon, whether or not it forms part of an advertisement relating to goods or a service, provided it is not a condition of such trade coupon that the person to whom such trade coupon is supplied, given or offered, shall purchase any goods or make use of any service in respect of which he has to give any consideration, before he becomes entitled to receive, or to participate in any competition for, any relevant benefit.</block>

<p>This was designed to create the situation that one could enter into a competition and be given a coupon as a result of which one could then be awarded something. That was what this was designed to do and this is what the select committee agreed upon. In terms of the amended clause 10 to which we have just agreed, we now have the situation that no person is allowed, in connection with the sale of any goods, to give any trade coupon if it is a condition of such coupon that before the person concerned is entitled to receive anything, he must purchase goods. If a coupon is given on which goods can be obtained at a discount, how can one get that discount if one never buys any goods&#x003F; It is ludicrous! Obviously one has to buy goods in order to get the benefit of the discount. That is why amendment No. (16) of the hon. member for Wonderboom is absolutely unacceptable to us.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I now wish to move the amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 11, to omit paragraph (c) and to substitute the following paragraph:</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">(c) (i) the supply or giving to any person of a document or token entitling the holder thereof to receive upon the purchase of particular goods a stated discount on the purchase price or after having made a purchase to receive on demand a sum of money bearing a proportion to the price paid for such goods; or</block>

<ol>

<li>(ii) the supply or giving to any person of a document or token entitling the holder thereof to receive a stated discount on the price to be paid for the rendering or provision of a particular service or after having used a particular service to receive on demand a sum of money bearing a proportion to the price paid for the rendering or provision of such service:</li>

</ol>

<p>Provided that the proportion, and the person by whom and the place at which such discount will be granted or such sum of money will be paid, shall be clearly set forth on the document or token;</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) On pages 11 and 13, to omit paragraph (e) and to substitute the following paragraph:</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_3881-3882" refersTo="page_0623"/>(e) (i) the supply or giving to any person without consideration of a document or token entitling the holder thereof to receive on demand without payment or other obligation goods or services specified therein;</li>

<li>(ii) the supply or giving to a purchaser of any goods, of a document or token entitling the holder thereof to receive on demand, at his option, either a sum of money or goods specified therein:</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">Provided that&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(aa) the goods so claimable have been distributed, imported, produced or manufactured by the distributor, importer, producer or manufacturer of the goods purchased and are of the same kind as the goods purchased or have been manufactured from materials substantially of the same kind as the materials from which the goods purchased were manufactured; and</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">in respect of services rendered by any</block>

<p>Let me say what the object of these amendments is. The first is that one may give cash tokens which allow a discount or a cash benefit when a purchase is made. If I understood the hon. the Minister correctly&#x2014;it now appears that perhaps we did not understand him correctly&#x2014;he indicated in the Second Reading that he had no objection to this. I have outlined the effect of amendment No. (1). That is all that that amendment seeks to achieve. Amendment No. 2 seeks to provide that, instead of merely being able to give goods which one has manufactured oneself and which are of a similar nature, the goods which may be so claimable should be goods which are either distributed, imported, produced or manufactured by the person concerned. In other words, these goods need not be manufactured by that person, and do not need to be identical in form to the goods purchased. This benefit will also be able to be extended to people who import or distribute goods which they have not manufactured themselves.</p>

<p>My third amendment will have the effect which I understood the hon. the Minister wanted to achieve, namely to allow tokens to be supplied to people who could then issue them. In terms of the legislation before us you have to be the manufacturer of the goods in order to be able to supply the tokens. The effect of this amendment is to enable people who are not themselves manufacturers to supply tokens to distributors so that they may in turn issue them. My fourth amendment is consequential upon amendment No. 3.</p>

<p>The fifth amendment is aimed at making provision for a type of business which presently exists, and which we think is quite legitimate. I refer to the practice where you say to a man: &#x201C;In return for a consideration you will get from us a guarantee to render services.&#x201D; There seems to be nothing wrong with being able to give such a guarantee. Let us take the case of a motor-car. You get a guarantee not from the supplier of the motor car but from a third party that if there is anything wrong with the car, they will repair it. The effect of the legislation as it reads at present is to exclude that practice. For these reasons I move the amendments standing in my name on the Order Paper.</p>

</ol>

<block name="quote">of documents or tokens referred to in paragraph (c)(i) or (e) to a business to be issued by such business in connection with the sale of goods by such business.</block>

<p>The first amendment relates to clause 11(e)(i) which, as it is framed at present, makes provision for a coupon to be exchanged for goods, provided that those goods have been produced by the same producer who has produced or manufactured the goods purchased, and that they are of the same kind or are made of similar materials. Mr. Chairman, I believe that that provision is far too restrictive. I can see no benefit accruing to the public as a result of such a limited provision. If it could be widened in the way in which I propose in my amendment it should be widened, the public could only benefit. I cannot see that the purpose of the trade coupon provisions in this Bill will in any way be destroyed if this exemption is widened in the manner in which I propose it should be widened. The manner in which I propose it should be widened is that a coupon should be able to be exchanged not only for goods manufactured or produced by the producer of the goods purchased, but also for goods produced or manufactured by an associate or a subsidiary, or for goods especially manufactured for the supplier of the original goods. I can see no harm resulting from this. In fact, the public can only benefit if this provision is widened to that extent. At present, in the light of modem business practice, where many groups are composed of subsidiaries and associates, I think it is only reasonable to include in the exemption goods manufactured by associates or subsidiaries. I go further. I believe that the exemption should also include goods whose use is closely related to the goods originally purchased. For instance, I can see no harm in giving a coupon for shoe polish when you buy a pair of shoes. I can see no harm at all in giving a coupon for a film when you buy a camera. The purpose of my second amendment is to allow the giving of coupons for good which are so closely associated in use to the goods originally purchased.</p>

<p>The third amendment I have moved relates to clause 11(f). This amendment does not change the meaning of the paragraph as it is presently worded, but I believe that as it is worded at present this paragraph repeats itself. The fact that documents or tokens are circumscribed by subpara, (i) of para, (c) and para. (e) renders quite superfluous the wording in para. (f) from &#x201C;on condition&#x201D; in line 8 to the end of the paragraph. I therefore propose the deletion of those words.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 11, in line 60, to omit &#x201C;and&#x201D; and to substitute:</block>

<p>The intention of the exemptions which are granted in terms of this clause would appear to be to permit the manufacturer of a specific category of goods, or a variety of goods, to issue other goods produced by him at a reduced cost, or at no cost at all, to the purchaser of the original goods. Of course we realize that such a manufacturer or producer of goods cannot supply goods in this way if those goods are produced by another manufacturer, or if they are not of the same kind or of substantially the same material as the original goods purchased. The hon. the Minister is, however, as well aware as I am that there are a number of companies which have subsidiaries, and my amendment attempts to make provision for them. The hon. member for Constantia went further and referred to associates of groups, but my amendment simply refers to a holding company or a subsidiary company. I hope, when the hon. the Minister comes to reply, that he will give us a reason why this provision should not include a reference to a holding company and a subsidiary company.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, allow me to say immediately that the hon. members have apparently not understood the meaning of <span class="col_3885-3886" refersTo="page_0625"/>clause 10. The essence of clause 10, which we have accepted, is in fact to impose a ban on trade coupons, except in the case of the exceptions mentioned in clause 11. The whole concept of clause 10 would be destroyed if I were to accept the amendments of the hon. members for Yeoville, Constantia and Johannesburg North, because we should then be making a farce of provisions we have already accepted. The whole idea is that trade coupons may only be accepted in certain exceptional circumstances. Now what is the purpose of the limitation of the use of trade coupons&#x003F; There is a twofold purpose, Sir. The first is that we should try and limit injudicious purchases by the public, and often, too, by the less informed sections of the public. The second purpose, at which the Trade Coupons Act was aimed, was to prohibit instigated sales. In other words, we want to prevent coupons being issued in advance encouraging people to buy in a shop articles they do not need, for the sake of the benefit of the coupons. With all respect, surely we are making a farce of our support of the principles of this legislation if, by way of exceptions, we want to strip the legislation of its effect completely. Therefore, apart from the detail of the amendments, they all signify an extension of the exceptions to a prohibition we have already accepted. Since all these amendments, except those of the hon. member for Wonderboom, are calculated to extend the effect of the Trade Coupons Act, I am quite prepared to have a look at the provisions of the Trade Coupons Act as contained in this Bill during the recess.</p>

<p>Let us now examine in detail what the hon. members&#x2019; amendments involve. I shall begin with the hon. member for Constantia, who moved three amendments. I want to emphasize once again that we are now dealing with exceptions to a principle that we have already accepted, i.e. that the Committee has actually decided against the trade coupon as a method. I do not think there is any dispute about that. The first amendment of the hon. member for Constantia seeks to permit the use of trade coupons, which would then give the holder the right, in exchange for one or more other trade coupons&#x2014;and I want to emphasize this&#x2014;to receive goods which have been manufactured by an associate or have been specially manufactured for the supplier of those goods. In other words, the whole limitation to the effect that it should be the same business or that the goods should be more or less the same, falls away. The second amendment of the hon. member for Constantia permits the use of trade coupons and gives the holder the right, in exchange for one or more trade coupons, to receive goods which are directly linked to the use of the purchased goods. In other words&#x2014;if I may mention an absurd example&#x2014;if the purchased article were to be a motor-car, then one should also be able to provide petrol. The argument of the hon. members for Yeoville and Johannesburg North is that if one were to sell an aeroplane to someone, one could also give him a motor-car as a present. Then it would surely be an absolute farce still to have limits on trade coupons. As far as the third amendment of the hon. member for Constantia is concerned&#x2014;and if he does not agree with me, he should tell me where he differs&#x2014;he wants to permit the use of trade coupons that are sold, supplied or given to a business and which are issued by the business concerned in connection with the sale of goods. These are not the same goods, but goods that are distributed by that specific business. I want to ask the hon. member: If we were to accept that, what then is the purpose of any limitation on the use of trade coupons&#x003F; It may be&#x2014;and I want to admit it immediately&#x2014;that circumstances may exist in which we should consider extending the use of coupons, but I am thoroughly convinced that the Committee Stage is not the place to use exceptions, after we have decided against trade coupons in principle, to render the application of the principle completely ineffective.</p>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member for Johannesburg North permits the use of coupons that give the holder the right, in exchange for one or more trade coupons, to receive goods produced by the holder of a subsidiary company or by their own company, regardless of what goods they may be. Once again the limitation on trade coupons falls away completely. This also applies to the amendments of the hon. member for Yeoville. I am prepared to look at this during the recess. In the meantime I cannot accept the amendments, except those that I have indicated.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, apart from the amendments which have just been dealt with by the hon. the Minister, there is something else which I think should be said in regard to clause 11, namely that it is the <span class="col_3887-3888" refersTo="page_0626"/>only clause in this Bill which refers to a person as being a purchaser. I believe that this concept is one which rather bedevils the whole thinking on clause 11. It is quite apparent to me that I am not the only one who thinks so, because if one looks at the amendment which has been accepted to clause 10, one will see that the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; appears nowhere in it. If one refers to clause 11 (i), which was included by the Select Committee, one will see that the draftsman there also avoided the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D;. I think the reason is obvious, because &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; as a concept is something quite different from &#x201C;a person&#x201D; where it is generally referred to in this Bill. I should like to suggest that wherever the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; appears in clause 11, it should be omitted and the word &#x201C;person&#x201D; substituted for it. This is going to cause a little difficulty to draft, because some of these clauses do not respond to the deletion or omission of the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; and the substitution of the word &#x201C;person&#x201D;. I should like to explain to the hon. the Minister the reason why I do not like the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D;. I think everyone on the Select Committee did not like the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; because it implies that it is a person who has purchased, whereas I believe that the whole of this Bill refers to persons generally and not only to persons who have purchased. By putting a definite value on a person who has purchased in clause 11, the effect is to bedevil the actual thinking in regard to that clause.</p>

<p>Hon. members will notice that when we come to clause 1, I have an amendment on the Order Paper suggesting that &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; should include &#x201C;prospective purchaser&#x201D;. If the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; is removed from clause 11, it is quite obvious that I do not need to move an amendment. The amendment is to get round the difficulty that the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; is used in clause 11, whereas if the word &#x201C;person&#x201D; had been used in clause 11 throughout, that &#x201C;person&#x201D; would obviously include a purchaser and it would also include a prospective purchaser&#x2014;in fact, anybody who has received a coupon, token or document. I believe one could thereby clear up a great deal of uncertainty about this clause. It caused a lot of unhappiness on the part of a large number of the members of the Select Committee who felt very unhappy about the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D;. Clause 11 is a graft from the Trade Coupons Act on to this Act. It is a very bad graft, and if it is going to be left like that I do not think it is going to be a good graft at all. I think it is going to wither and die. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that, although we cannot redraft clause 11 tonight, he gives the matter very serious consideration and comes with a redrafted clause 11 in the Other Place amending the clause in such a way that the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; does not appear in any part of the clause.</p>

<p>Just to give an example: We are dealing here with the exceptions to clause 10. Clause 10 does not refer to &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; in any of its subsections, nor does the amendment which we have before us. If we look at the second exemption in clause 11 we find that it refers to the allowance and the discount on the price paid or payable by any purchaser for any goods or to any person for the rendering or provision for any service or the offer to allow any such discount. To my way of thinking it would be very much simpler to interpret this para. (b) if the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; is not there at all. The paragraph would then probably read something like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The allowance of a discount on the purchase price paid or payable by any person for any goods or for the rendering or provision of any service or the offer to allow any such discount.</block>

<p>In this form it will be a very much simpler matter to interpret than at present. And so one can go through the various subsections. One finds the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; in para. (c)(i); also in para. (e) and in para. (h). In subclause (h) it may cause a little difficulty in redrafting because there it refers to &#x201C;the giving or the offer to any purchaser of goods&#x201D;. That may require a little ingenuity in drafting, but I suggest that it is not insuperable because one could say &#x201C;the giving or the offer to any person in relation to the purchase of goods&#x201D;, or &#x201C;to any person who makes use of any service of any warranty, etc. &#x201D; I do believe that it will improve the Bill immeasurably and it will take the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D;, which is an encumbrance at the moment, right out of the Bill. This will make for far better interpretation.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. the Minister rejected the amendments which I had proposed, he indicated that in his <span class="col_3889-3890" refersTo="page_0627"/>opinion, if these amendments were accepted, they would be destroying the effectiveness of the provisions regarding coupons. I asked the hon. the Minister in what way consumers were being harmed by the suggestions contained in my amendments. At present the exemption allows a coupon to be exchanged for goods manufactured by the same manufacturer or producer that are of the same kind and are of the same material. In what way is anyone being harmed by extending that to goods manufactured by associates or subsidiaries of the producer&#x003F; In what way is anyone being harmed if the goods that can be exchanged for the coupon have an associated use in relation to the goods originally purchased. Surely we are dealing here with a measure which has been designed in the interests of the consumer and if the interests of the consumer are not going to be harmed, but, in fact, can be benefited, why should an amendment such as I have proposed, not be accepted&#x003F; I would like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to another aspect of clause 11 and that is para, (a). I believe that the interpretation of the English version and the Afrikaans version can lead to some confusion. Para. (a) allows for the payment of commission or remuneration for services, in the English version &#x201C;to any person engaged in the sale&#x201D;. The Afrikaans version refers to &#x201C;iemand wat betrokke is by die verkoop&#x201D;. To my way of thinking the English version indicates a degree of continuity in rendering the service of selling by any person engaged in the sale, whereas the Afrikaans version also covers a periodic service or an irregular involvement in selling goods or selling a service. I would like to mention a case in point and ask the hon. the Minister for his views on it. He is probably aware that the Automobile Association offers a coupon to a member who enrols another member, a coupon which can be exchanged for a variety of goods. In this case the members who are entitled to receive the coupon, are selling membership only on a periodic basis and not on a regular basis, and it would appear to me that they would be exempted by the Afrikaans version of this paragraph, but not by the English version. I would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views on that. There is a further point on which I would like clarification and that is in respect of para. (e). I would like to know from the hon. the Minister what the thinking behind this paragraph is. Why is it necessary, when a coupon can be exchanged for goods, to give the option that that coupon can be exchanged for a sum of money&#x003F; There is no indication of what sum of money it has to be exchanged for and there is no indication that that sum of money must bear any relation to the value of the goods for which the coupon may be exchanged. To me the alternative compulsory cash seems quite pointless, and I would like the hon. the Minister to explain the purpose of providing this cash alternative.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened to what the hon. the Minister said earlier and I was particularly interested in the statement he made that he would review the whole trade coupon position during the recess. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not consider appointing a committee to hear the trade and to hear businessmen on this subject and to see what can be done to put this matter into a manner which is acceptable to the business community and yet gives effect to what the intentions are of the hon. the Minister and his department. I welcome the fact that he will consider it, but I think that he should have some views of the business community and the public as well on this issue.</p>

<p>The other point which I would like to make is that the hon. the Minister, while he fulminated at some length about the fact that these amendments were designed to destroy his Bill, did not actually deal with individual amendments. I would like to get a specific answer from the hon. the Minister on certain points. In the first instance: It is against the public interests that a third party should be able to give a warranty in respect of goods&#x003F; In other words, is it wrong, is there any harm that can come to our society if a third party, for example, can give a warranty, a guarantee, in respect of repairs that may be needed to a motor-car&#x003F;</p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with that&#x003F; And, if so, what&#x003F; What is the harm that he is seeking to repair by not agreeing to this type of provision&#x003F; The third point that I would like to hear him on is: In what respect is there a social harm, or a harm to the business community, if a company can supply tokens to dealers, which they can legitimately issue within the ambit of the restrictive provisos of this Bill, if they are not themselves the manufacturers of the goods&#x003F; What is the evil that he is seeking to do <span class="col_3891-3892" refersTo="page_0628"/>away with in prohibiting this particular matter&#x003F; These are the effects of amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 4, which go together with No. 5. As far as amendment No. 2 is concerned, there I can at least see the point of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument, even though I disagree with it, because there he says: &#x201C;Well, by allowing you to supply other goods, you are extending the ambit of this Bill. &#x201D; Even though I do not agree with him on the merits of it, as far as I am concerned I can at least follow that argument. However, I cannot follow the argument on the other three points, particularly as he did not put forward any argument at all. So, presumably, there is no objection to the type of provisions, even though he said he would not accept the amendment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to begin with the hon. member for Wynberg. He advanced an argument in connection with an amendment that was not put before us. Actually he argued about his amendment to clause 1. But, in any case, he completely missed the point. The point is that the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; is used in order to ensure that the trade coupon will in fact be used in the sale, and not beforehand. This is because elicited sales are just what we want to prohibit. If one were to substitute the word &#x201C;person&#x201D; for &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D;, the limitation that reads that the trade coupon should be used at the same time as the sale, is destroyed. This, basically, is the difficulty with regard to the definition of &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; as well. The hon. member may disagree with me, but the <i>ratio</i> on the basis of which the word &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D; was used, is to be found in that. I believe he will understand the argument in this particular connection.</p>

<p>Oh no, show me the clause prohibiting this. Mr. Chairman, then the hon. member went on to ask me why a dealer&#x2014;and he used a car dealer as an example&#x2014;cannot give an indication of who the manufacturer of a product is, except when it is himself. The same reasons apply here. The possibility again exists that the question of the enforceability of the warranty and the question of the benefits of the tokens, may be used to solicit or stimulate sales, i.e. that people who would not otherwise have bought a specific article, are now tempted to do so.</p>

<p>Whereas we now allow trade coupons to be used, we specify that they should be used between the parties involved in the transaction. The people who should be protected by legislation are not the sophisticated people to whom hon. members have referred. The <span class="col_3893-3894" refersTo="page_0629"/>legislation is meant to protect precisely those people who experience problems, in the first place, to enforce their rights, and in the second place, to protect those people who are not able to form an opinion or evaluate the unnecessary offers they sometimes receive. I therefore believe that the hon. members should accept my assurance that I shall investigate the question of trade coupons. The hon. member asked whether we could not appoint a committee to investigate this legislation. This legislation, clauses 10 en 11 included, were drafted in collaboration with organized commerce, with the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut and with the Association of Chambers of Commerce.</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 17, in line 7, after &#x201C;1(b)&#x201D; to insert:</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">, shall take into consideration any representations made to it by persons or bodies appearing to it to have or to represent a substantial interest in the subject matter of the reference, may hear such persons or bodies or their legal representatives, and may permit the leading and cross-examination of witnesses.</block>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_3897-3898" refersTo="page_0631"/>(2) on page 17, to add the following subsection at the end of the clause:</li>

<li>(5) The Minister may, and if so required by an affected person shall, after the expiry of a period of twelve months of the publication of a notice, request the committee to reconsider any matter contained in a notice published in terms of section 12, 14 or 15, and may, after complying with the provisions of this Act in respect of such matter, publish an amended notice or a withdrawal of the notice.</li>

<li>(3) on page 17, to add the following subsection at the end of the clause:</li>

<li>(6) Any person aggrieved by the contents of a notice published in the <i>Gazette</i> may appeal against the decision or declaration to the Supreme Court having jurisdiction in the area in which he is a resident.</li>

</ol>

<p>I now wish to briefly motivate the amendments. The reason for the first amendment is that there must be an opportunity for people who are affected to be heard and represented and for evidence to be tested by cross-examination.</p>

<p>In terms of the second amendment, when an affected person asks the Minister, after a period of 12 months, to reconsider the matter, the committee must be requested to reconsider it because quite obviously a decision may have to be reviewed after a period of time.</p>

<p>The third amendment aims at allowing a person who has been aggrieved by the contents of a notice to appeal against that decision to a court. That is in accordance with the principle we believe in, i.e. that there should be access to the courts. Since there has been comparison with legislation in other countries, may I also now draw some comparisons. In the United States the Federal Trade Commission grants hearings before hearing examiners when there is an appeal to the full commission, and if this is not complied with, judicial proceedings are instituted by the Justice Department of the Federal Courts. This is a precedent we might do well to emulate because they have had considerably more experience in this field than we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to Germany. In terms of the legislation in Germany, there is a special commercial chamber of the civil courts which is, in fact, established for this purpose. There is then final appeal to five judges of the Bundesgerichtshof, which is their appeal court. It is quite clear that here again access to the courts is granted, thus allowing the courts far greater latitude than we are making provision for here by way of appeal. In Germany the courts themselves decide what should be an honest practice in accordance with their legislation, as interpreted. In our view, therefore, there is an undisputable case to be made out for why access to the courts should not be done away with. The amendments I am moving here contains three fundamental principles. The first is that one does not pass judgment on anyone without giving that person an opportunity to be heard. In terms of the present legislation, however, there is inadequate opportunity for a person to be heard and for evidence to be tested.</p>

<p>The second principle is that once an order has been made, it may be necessary to reconsider it and there is no machinery in this legislation for reconsidering a decision which has been made and which has been running for some period and which may have been found now, due to changed circumstances, to be no longer applicable.</p>

<p>The third principle is that the access to the courts should not be done away with, but should be part of this legislation.</p>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_3899-3900" refersTo="page_0632"/>(1) On page 17, in line 7, after &#x201C;(1)(b)&#x201D;, to insert:</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">,shall take into consideration any representations made to it by persons or bodies appearing to it to have or to represent a substantial interest in the subject matter of the reference, may hear such persons or bodies or their legal representatives, and may cross-examine witnesses,</block>

<ol>

<li>(2) on page 17, to add the following subsection at the end of the Clause:</li>

<li>(5) The Minister may, and if so required by an affected person shall, request the committee to reconsider any matter contained in a notice published in terms of section 12, 14 or 15, and may, after complying with the provisions of this Act in respect of such matter, publish an amended notice or a withdrawal of the notice.</li>

</ol>

<p>When I spoke on clause 2 of this Bill in regard to the Trade Practices Advisory Committee, I mentioned that there were two facets of this committee in relation to this legislation which were important. The first was its composition, and the second, which is embodied in this clause, is the powers the committee will have and the manner in which it may work. Now as this clause stands at present, when the Minister publishes a notice in respect of clauses 12, 14 or 15, persons affected by that notice may make representations in writing to the committee and the committee, having considered the representations in writing, will make a recommendation to the Minister. I believe that the matters which this committee will consider are of such a complicated and important nature that it is unwise to provide that they should come to a decision only on written representations received. They are going to deal with things like for instance pyramid trading, a very complicated matter. They are going to deal with for instance things such as undue selling pressure, another very complicated matter. I do not believe that it is fair to the people who are going to be restricted in any way as a result of this legislation and I do not believe it is fair to the consuming public that decisions on matters as complicated or as important as these should be taken by a committee on only written representations made to it. It is very necessary for the proper and efficient working of this committee that it should be able to hear witnesses and cross-examine them to get the fullest possible information from the witnesses on the matters which are being discussed.</p>

<p>The second amendment deals with the power of the hon. the Minister to amend or withdraw a notice made in terms of any of the three clauses that I have mentioned. At present no power is provided in this Bill to withdraw or to amend a notice once it has been published. I would submit that in the matters which are to be dealt with by this legislation, we must take account of the dynamics of commerce and industry. Change is something which is inherent in business and legislation of this nature must be flexible enough to allow for notices published in terms of this legislation to be amended, to be changed or to be withdrawn from time to time. That is the object of my second amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have already indicated that the amendments cannot be accepted and I now want to indicate briefly why this is so. Looking at clause 16, one finds that before the Minister can place any notices in the <i>Gazette</i> under clauses 12 and 14, certain requirements must be met. The amendments by the hon. member for Constantia and the first two by the hon. member for Yeoville are in fact the same in principle and I shall therefore deal with them simultaneously. When one looks at amendment No. 1 moved by the hon. member for Constantia, one finds that certain things are envisaged in it. The purpose of the amendment is in fact twofold. In the first place, in terms of the amendment an obligation will be imposed on the advisory committee to take into consideration, in considering the documents submitted to it, representations made to the committee by persons or bodies appearing to it to have or to represent substantial interest in the subject matter of the reference, and to hear the legal representatives of such bodies or persons. Basically, this aim is similar to that of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. However, the Bill already provides that the interested parties may submit representations to the committee in connection with the provisional notification. They may therefore make representations to the Secretary <span class="col_3901-3902" refersTo="page_0633"/>for Trade and the advisory committee has then, in terms of the existing provisions, to consider the representations of the people which the hon. member wants given a hearing according to his amendment. All the amendment will do in practice is effect a duplication in the process in accordance with which the committee must hear the representations a second time, because provision is already made for interested parties to be permitted to make representations which the committee has then to consider.</p>

<p>In his second amendment the hon. member proposed that a subsection (5) be added at the end of the clause. In terms of the proposed subsection (5), provision will have to be made for the reconsideration of the notice at the request of the Minister if he is requested to do so by an affected person. Virtually the same thing is proposed in the second amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I want to put forward the suggestion that it would be better if the hon. the Minister were to deal with the amendments moved by the hon. member for Yeoville because if they are negatived, the amendments of the hon. member for Constantia will automatically fall away.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate your suggestion, but in principle the reply to all the amendments is the same. I want to make the point that there is an inherent right in terms of which a notice which has been promulgated may be reviewed from time to time. Since such a position already exists in terms of the legal provisions, the amendments envisaging such a review are unnecessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. I first want to make the point that provision has already been made in the legislation for the representations that people must be allowed a hearing. If we were to allow a cross-examination to take place when the committee considers the representations, then we should be changing the committee&#x2019;s function to that of a court of law. In fact the committee does not have such functions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>The committee will have to decide on written evidence.</p>

<p>That is correct.</p>

<p>Why can it not decide on oral evidence&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But if we were to introduce such a principle, we should surely be making the committee a court where people could be subjected to cross-examination. The hon. member is well aware that what is contained in the legislation forms part of our administrative law.</p>

<p>I now come to the third amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. The hon. member is requesting by means of the amendment that we should accept that certain people affected by a notice be afforded the right to appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision or declaration. What &#x201C;decision or declaration&#x201D;&#x003F; Nowhere in the Bill is there reference to a &#x201C;decision or declaration&#x201D;. It is therefore not clear to what decision or declaration the hon. member is referring in connection with the clause under discussion. As the hon. member knows, the existing legal provisions already make provision for the circumstances in which an administrative action by any person may be the subject of a court case. Since on the basis of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment it is not clear to which decision or declaration he is referring and there is no doubt in law as to the circumstances in which an affected person has the right to go to court about an administrative decision, I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to deal briefly with what the hon. the Minister has said. In so far as amendment (1) is concerned, there is a fundamental difference, as he knows and as everybody else knows, between the right to put up written objection or to make written representations and the right to be heard, i.e. the right to test what is being put before the committee. What is being overlooked in this matter is that the entire existence of a man&#x2019;s business can be destroyed as a result of an order or a declaration in terms of clause 16. A man can be completely put out of business, but the sole remedy he has in terms of the legislation is that, when he sees a notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> he <span class="col_3903-3904" refersTo="page_0634"/>can put in written representations. He cannot test the allegation, which is being made, that there may be an undesirable practice in his business. We know and the hon. the Minister knows that very often all sorts of representations are put up in writing which persuade people to take certain action, but when one tests the representations by way of cross-examination, one finds that they are of no substance. This is the situation here, because what we are doing, is that we are creating machinery in terms of which the entire existence of a man&#x2019;s business can be destroyed as a result of a declaration in the <i>Gazette.</i> The hon. the Minister is not even prepared to give the man a chance of testing, by cross-examination, the allegations against him. It is almost like the piece of legislation with which we may be dealing tomorrow because there, too, it is not allowed that allegations be tested. The hon. the Minister knows from his own experience how many times there have been people who, having been prepared to make allegations, fall apart when they are tested by means of skilful cross-examination. When you have a piece of legislation which is as far-reaching as this and you only give a man an opportunity of putting up written representations, I think it is not in accordance with the principles of justice as we see them.</p>

<p>In regard to amendment No. (2), the hon. the Minister says that he has the right to reconsider in any case. I do not think he has that right. The second point is that even if he does have that right, the man who is affected does not have the right to request that his case be reconsidered. In terms of this legislation a man does not have that right. The amendment is aimed at providing such a right so that, after a period of 12 months has expired, a man can come along with the request that the committee reconsider his case. We have chosen 12 months because we do not want frivolous applications every few minutes. Where a man is affected, where he is being put out of business, I think he must be given the opportunity to say that he wants the committee to reconsider his case. The hon. the Minister laughs. He thinks it is very funny, but it is not his business.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The third amendment relates to the question of an appeal to the courts. The remedy, I believe, is clearly set out in this amendment, but here we differ from the hon. the Minister. In our view you do not lightly take away access to the courts. That is something which we believe in and, indeed, which is fundamental to our belief. Here again a situation is being created where a man can be put out of business and where his livelihood can be destroyed, without him being given the opportunity of having access to the courts. In other countries they have access to the courts. The hon. the Minister says that this is administrative law. Well, you can do anything by an Act of Parliament, but that does not mean it is right. The truth is that people who may be very adversely affected and who can be completely destroyed economically are having their access to the courts removed, and this we cannot go along with.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to support the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2019;s amendment, which is the same as the first amendment of the hon. member for Constantia. I want to say that it is not simply a question of making written representations. What the hon. members are asking for in their amendments is that bodies&#x2014;they have in mind representative bodies such as Assocom and the Federated Chamber of Industries&#x2014;should be given an opportunity to appear and to give verbal evidence, and to cross-examine any witnesses which the committee may decide to call before it, if necessary. That is the point at issue, and that is the difference between what is in the Bill and what is proposed in these amendments.</p>

<p>With regard to the second amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville, to coin a phrase, we in these benches have a problem. I refer to the limitation of 12 months which the hon. member places on this question of review. I really do not know why the hon. member for Yeoville has introduced a time element into his amendment.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I can see what the hon. member for Yeoville is aiming at, but I think that in his attempt to stop frivolous and continuous applications, as he puts it, he is possibly going to create a genuine hardship in <span class="col_3905-3906" refersTo="page_0635"/>the case of an affected person, who will then have to wait 12 months before he can apply for the decision to be reviewed. I wonder whether the hon. member for Yeoville has perhaps thought of that. Frivolous applications, I can accept, will be a nuisance to the committee, but perhaps some limitation could be placed on this by regulation. I wonder whether the hon. member for Yeoville has really thought of the hardships which could be caused in genuine cases, because in such a genuine case a person would have to wait 12 months before making his application. I wonder whether, in the light of that, the hon. member for Yeoville would not consider withdrawing his amendment in favour of the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Constantia, so that in genuine cases persons will have the opportunity of having their cases reconsidered within a period of 12 months.</p>

<p>No, all of them. I have already accepted the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia on the previous clause, and that amendment makes the committee more representative. As a result the committee will represent those interested persons to whom the hon. member referred.</p>

<p>Furthermore I just want to say that there is a fundamental difference between my point of view and that of the hon. member for Yeoville. The fact is that before a final order is made, a provisional notice must first be placed. These people are afforded an opportunity to put their case. However, if we were to abolish these provisions, there would have to be a court case as a result of representations. I am therefore not prepared to accept the hon. member&#x2019;.s amendment.</p>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_3911-3912" refersTo="page_0638"/>(1) On page 17, to add the following subsection at the end of the Clause:</li>

<li>(5) The committee shall make a recommendation referred to in subsection (1) only after having given notice publicly of its intention to do so and after having heard such persons as have indicated their wish to be heard.</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(1) on page 17, to add the following subsection at the end of the Clause:</li>

<li>(6) The secretary may at any time withdraw a notice published under subsection (1).</li>

</ol>

<p>This is a clause which provides that temporary notices may be published in the <i>Gazette</i> by the hon. the Minister in respect of clauses 12 and 15. Those notices may only be made as a result of a recommendation by the Trade Practices Advisory Committee and the purpose of this clause is to take care of situations where urgent action is deemed necessary. I believe that even where urgent action is necessary, the persons who are going to be affected by that urgent action should have the opportunity of being heard and of making representations to the Trade Practices Advisory Committee before the action is taken which may affect their businesses. I do not believe that the first amendment which I have moved, need unduly delay action being taken, where urgent action is indicated, because in any event the Trade Practices Advisory Committee has to meet to consider what action they should recommend. If they have to meet to consider that action, they can also at the same time hear recommendations from persons affected. As was the case with the previous clause, there is no provision in this clause for withdrawing or for amending any notice made in terms of it. My second amendment allows for that omission to be corrected.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to start with the second amendment of the hon. member for Constantia. He suggests that the secretary should be able to repeal a notice published in terms of subsection (1). There is no need to move such an amendment, since the secretary already has such powers in terms of the existing statutory measures. I hope the hon. member will accept this. As far as his first amendment is concerned, he wants to add, in terms of what he proposes, a new subsection (5) to the existing clause as it stands. The provision the hon. member wants to make in terms of his proposed subsection (5) is that, before the committee makes a recommendation in terms of the subsection, notice of it should be given to the interested parties concerned. I should like to point out to the hon. member that the procedure laid down in clause 17, provides for a provisional notice by the secretary. He should bear in mind that this clause will be used by the secretary under circumstances where there are very clear indications that it is essential to place a provisional limitation upon an activity pending the investigation of the committee. If we were to do what the hon. member is asking for in this particular case, we would never be able to obtain a final order, because then we would be getting an extension of the procedure by means of a provisional order, which would prevent us from eventually publishing a final notice. I should like to assure the hon. member that, from the nature of the case, the Secretary will use these powers when steps have to be taken and when it would otherwise take too long to complete the investigation first. I should like to assure him that we shall not use the clause to prejudice people simply on the basis of rumours.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find it difficult to see how the procedure contained in my amendment is going to seriously delay the issuing of urgent notices in the <i>Gazette.</i> The urgent notices provided for in this clause can only, in terms of the Bill, be issued after a recommendation has been made by the Trade Practices Advisory Committee. If the Trade Practices Advisory Committee has to meet to consider a matter and to make a recommendation, I do not see why at the same time they should not hear representations from the people that are going to be affected. These people may be seriously affected, even though it is a temporary notice. In a period of six months a business can be very badly injured if a notice has not been properly considered. I appeal to the hon. the Minister to reconsider his attitude towards my first amendment.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the following be a new Clause to follow Clause 17:</block>

<block name="quote">18. Any person who is financially affected by the subject of a notice or provisional notice published under section 12, 14, 15 or 17 may&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) in writing require the Minister to furnish the reasons for such notice or provisional notice, which shall be furnished within 30 days of such request:</li>

<li>(b) appeal to the Supreme Court on motion against the publication of the notice in question, in which case, if such person can prove on a balance of probability that the Minister&#x2019;s reasons do not represent good and sufficient justification for the notice in question, and that he will be materially prejudiced by such notice, the court may set aside such notice.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is a fairly general feeling on this side of the House that the procedure in respect of the notices which are covered by the four clauses which have been mentioned, namely clauses 12, 14, 15 and 17, gives a very wide discretion both to the hon. the Minister and to the secretary. Indeed, the discretion given to the hon. the Minister or to the secretary or to those to whom they may delegate those powers, is so wide and so far-reaching that it may have extremely serious effects upon the conduct and profitability of businesses. Obviously, in this respect, we think in particular of the smaller businesses in South Africa. As the hon. member for Yeoville pointed out, the business of an individual could in effect be destroyed.</p>

<p>What is more, the hon. the Minister or the secretary can do so in circumstances in which the individual concerned has no right of access to the courts, and has no right to ask for the reasons in writing. Mr. Chairman, it is for this reason that we have proposed this new clause. It has already been mentioned that the principal objection of the hon. the Minister and of that side of the House is that in certain circumstances it is in their view necessary to act urgently. Therefore an amendment, such as that previously proposed by the hon. member for Constantia, or the one we are proposing, would mitigate against that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister and members on the other side of the House who were members of the Select Committee, have never given any reason why they need to act so urgently that no person can, upon request, be given reasons in writing as to why he should be put out of business. Secondly, they have given no reason why such a person should not be allowed to appeal to the courts. The hon. member for Yeoville has pointed out that what the hon. the Minister is proposing here does not stand up to what is practised elsewhere in the world, and therefore we look forward to hearing from the hon. the Minister, in the hope that he can convince us, that he will give some reason as to why it is necessary to act so urgently that nobody can be given reasons in writing, and secondly, why it is necessary to act so urgently that nobody can have the right to appeal to the courts, for the hon. the Minister and the secretary are taking the right to put an individual out of business at their discretion.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.Chairman, the amendment proposed by the hon. member, viz. the insertion of a new clause 18, really amounts to the following: The proposed clause provides that any person who is financially affected by a notice published under section 12, 14, 15 or 17 of the Bill may in the first place require the Minister to furnish the reasons for any such notice in writing within 30 days. Secondly, the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment provides that an appeal can be made to the Supreme Court for the setting aside of a specific notice on the basis that the Minister&#x2019;s reasons do not <span class="col_3915-3916" refersTo="page_0640"/>represent sufficient justification for the notice in question.</p>

<p>However, in order to evaluate the amendment, we must take note of what the clauses which are referred to in this envisaged amendment, involve. Clause 12 of the Bill provides that the giving or supply of any benefit in connection with the sale or lease of goods or the provision of a service may be prohibited.</p>

<p>In terms of section 14 the Minister may prescribe what information may or may not form part of an advertisement. Clause 15 of the Bill provides that the Minister may prohibit certain trade practices.</p>
