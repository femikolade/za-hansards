<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is deeply conscious of the important and strategic role that the agricultural industry has to play in our national economy and the continued security of the country, and therefore urgently requests the Government to take the necessary steps in order to ensure the largest measure of stability and growth in the industry.</block>

<p>It is very clear that when the security of a country is being threatened a number of questions arise, especially questions such as: Where will one be the most vulnerable and what should one&#x2019;s priorities be to withstand hostilities? In a period such as the one in which South Africa finds itself at present, it is clear to me that dozens of matters and tasks should receive simultaneous attention for the most effective action to be taken.</p>

<p>It is not only the question of the arms supply and general military preparedness which is of importance in a period like this. I think it is accepted axiomatically that any military effort should be supported by a highly productive economy. We know something of this kind will cost money. Moreover, many of our entrepreneurs and workers will be out of the economic life of South Africa in a period like this. For that reason we as an agricultural group thought it fit to move this motion so as to give us an opportunity to discuss the question whether our agricultural industry will be able to play its role effectively, so that we may establish what the role of the agricultural industry should be.</p>

<p>Whatever I am going to say about the agricultural industry today, however, I want to qualify right at the outset by saying that no matter what shortcomings might exist in the industry, experiences from a number of world wars have taught us that although our agricultural industry produced a large percentage of <span class="col_1137-1138" refersTo="page_0585"/>the military manpower, nobody actually starved in that period. There were in fact shortages, but these one can understand. There were few producers, while many mouths had to be fed in that period. For that reasons I want to say to the hon. the Minister that in spite of the shortcomings which might exist in our agricultural industry I nevertheless have confidence that if this could be done at that time, there is no reason why it cannot be done in the future as well, provided that we are prepared to prepare the South African public and provided that the planning in our agricultural industry is correct.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Nobody has doubts about the possibility of periodic military excursions around us in the near future. We know that we will not be able to stay out of it all the time, but the possibility also exists that such excursions will take place into South African territory or into areas for which we are responsible. The last time we had hostilities on South African soil, was during the Anglo-Boer War, and that was a long time ago. We also had the battles in South West Africa in 1914 to 1918. We shall therefore have to look very closely at countries which have had experience of continuous hostilities over the last decade or so. In this respect, I particularly think of countries like Israel and, a little closer, of a country like Rhodesia with a tremendous upsurge of terrorism which has virtually kept the country in a state of war. Whether we are going to have terrorism on a large scale or a shooting war, makes no difference. From both the lesson is apparent that physical attacks invariably take place in rural areas, on the border, and are easily extended into our extensive farming areas. Difficulties is therefore bound to occur and arise in farming and rural areas. In Israel it has become the deliberate policy to establish agricultural settlements, or as they are called, kibbutzim or moshavim, as closely as possible to the border of enemy territory.</p>

<p>It is done for security reasons and, as it is, some of the most important battles in which Israel was involved, took place around the kibbutzim and the moshavim. They are all in the front line. I have seen some of them myself and I have seen where some of the battles, especially during the Six Day War, took place. They are in the front line and have become protective fortresses. The Israelis, as I have said, are deliberately settling people in the rural areas. When they settle them there, they do so for a dual purpose: They not only produce food, but also form this defensive line of which I have spoken.</p>

<p>If we now take a closer look at South Africa, let us ask ourselves what we have done. What have been allowed to happen in this country? For years our rural areas have been allowed to become denuded of White people, so that the population of rural areas today consists largely of Blacks who, as the terrorists&#x2019; attacks in Rhodesia have shown, normally become an easy prey for such attacks. When you have a couple of terrorists&#x2019; attacks among the rural Black population, you immediately have confusion and chaos because they are people with easily impressionable minds. I believe that the depopulation of our rural areas as far as the Whites are concerned, has been a serious mistake and that this trend must be reversed. I am going to mention examples of where countries are thinking in the direction of countering the depopulation of their rural areas. In America, for example, you find today that sociologists and leaders in commerce and industry are realizing that they have to do something about this trend. Since the &#x2019;forties something like 30 million Americans have moved to the cities, and now they want to reverse this trend. Instead of establishing new towns in the country areas, the idea is to repopulate existing depopulated villages and towns, thereby giving them a new lease of life. An article has been written in the <i>Financial Gazette</i> during September last year by Dr. Peter C. Goldmark, who is apparently a very important inventor and physicist in America, the man who has been responsible for the first colour television system, the long-playing record and many other facilities. This particular person, as industrialist and physicist, is now, apart from heading the Columbia broadcasting system, trying to build a new society in a tent town rural area with 65 000 people in north-eastern Connecticut known as Windham Region. Anyone who reads this can see for themselves that it is possible to embark on a scheme of this nature. They have found that something like 70% of the people who live in cities really want to live in rural areas. The hon. the Minister has recently received a report which is called the Du Plessis Report on Rural Reform. Will he make this report available to <span class="col_1139-1140" refersTo="page_0586"/>us or is it just going to be a departmental report?</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Good, Sir, if it is going to be made available to us, we would of course like to read it. We would like to go through it and would want to know from the Minister whether he is going to accept and implement the major recommendations of the report.</p>

<p>*Our rural population does not produce essential strategic food only, but also has to ensure that the essential Black labour force in its service has a satisfied and comfortable existence. A satisfied labour force is, after all, our best weapon against the terrorists or against any other enemy. An ever-increasing standard of living for our non-White labour force on our farms is of the greatest importance if we want to have growth and stability in our industry. I believe that the farmers are prepared to make sacrifices to combat inflation, because they too, endorsed the manifesto of the Minister of Economic Affairs. If we want to have stability and growth, the question remains: Can they continue to produce at the present producer prices. During the past year, for instance, there has been an increase of approximately 40% in the price of fertilizer. Initially there was an increase of 42%, then a decrease of 8%, and now again an increase of 6%. If one takes into consideration the fact that tractors and implements and other agricultural requisites and means of production increased in price by anything from 20% to 30% over the past year, it is not surprising to see that the wheat producers are now becoming just as dissatisfied as were the maize producers the previous year. This is because the Cabinet is not prepared to accept the price proposals of the Wheat Board. The hon. gentleman need only take a look at the report of the winter grain conference, which was held in Malmesbury recently. I have a cutting here from <i>Die Burger.</i> It reads (translation): &#x201C;Dissatisfaction with the Cabinet&#x2019;s repeated refusal to accept the prices as recommended by the Wheat Board was expressed here yesterday. &#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>But let us hear what Dr. De Swart of Sasko has to say. He states that the production costs of the wheat farmer rose by 24% between 1969 and 1973. However, between 1973 and the present it has risen by 110%, mainly as a result of the utilization of tractors, combines and other implements. Furthermore, Dr. De Swart holds out the prospect of a further increase of 30% before November this year. This being the situation, I ask the hon. the Minister to increase our agricultural production. In fact, everyone says we should do this. But how will the farmer be capable of doing this, if he is not given sufficient compensation or while this tremendous rise in production costs continues unchecked? This is the kind of thing about which the hon. gentleman should tell us what he thinks can be done. Because you see, Mr. Speaker, our agricultural industry&#x2014;and we put it like this in our motion&#x2014;is vital to the economic progress of this country. We know that had it not been for the R1 000 million in foreign currency which we earned through our agriculture last year, South Africa&#x2019;s balance of payments would not, in spite of devaluation, have been on as sound a footing as it is now. I say this is not an amount which can be disregarded. We know there are dozens of countries around us which lack food, and for that reason it could become our major weapon. The more food we have for others and for our own people, the stronger our position will be at the southern point of Africa. We also know that much of our agricultural products is exported in an unprocessed form, whereas we can earn much more with that unprocessed agricultural product if we process it here in South Africa. Not only would this provide more work for South Africans; it will also encourage the establishment of light industries in the rural areas of South Africa.</p>

<p>More and more experts are asking whether our agricultural potential is being developed to the full, and it is in respect of the homeland areas in particular that this is being asked. By the end of this century, in 24 years time, we shall have to double food production in South Africa if we want to meet our growing needs. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that this is a monumental task. He and I and all of us sitting in this House are here temporarily, but we also realize that we should make provision for the future of South Africa. For that reason I want to put to the hon. the Minister the question which I have put to him so often, and to which I have never been able to get an adequate answer or any satisfaction. The question is: When is he going to give us that agricultural <span class="col_1141-1142" refersTo="page_0587"/>planning board that has been requested? He told us he would be providing it. But it is no use simply telling us he will be providing it; we should like to see positive steps being taken to create such a body. And I want to tell the hon. the Minister that we cannot delay any further and consequently the hon. gentleman and his deputy should spell this out to us. In the past we have spelt out what the role of such an agricultural planning board should be, and the Minister can simply go and read it. If he does not wish to go to that trouble, he need only ask me again and I shall come and talk to him. Sir, South Africa will have to do this kind of thing, for its own safety and also in order to be of service to the world, and especially to assist the Black nations around us, because by the year 2000 the world&#x2019;s population will be 7,5 billion. The under-developed countries simply cannot supply their own needs, and those who cannot supply their own needs will have enormous social problems. And those of us who are in a position to export surpluses will be in a remarkable position of power. For that reason I want to say to the hon. the Minister, and I also want to conclude with that, because there are still many other hon. members on this side who want to discuss this matter &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town the other day gave the hon. members a bit of advice and he will probably do this again today. Sir, one can summarize the matter by saying that stability in agriculture can be brought about mainly by doing the following: Firstly, by adopting drastic measures to halt the White depopulation of the rural areas; secondly, by increasing our agricultural production considerably; thirdly, by adopting drastic measures to combat the effect of inflation in industry, and I believe that we shall only achieve stability in our industry if, fourthly, we were to induce more young people to enter our industry. I also believe that the losses in our agricultural industry due to pests and plagues should be limited to the minimum. We are told by experts that in some of the under-developed countries, agricultural production is reduced by 25% as a result of this very factor. It could even be much more, and we in South Africa also feel the effect of weeds, of pests, plagues and cattle diseases. One does not necessarily have to increase one&#x2019;s production by putting more into it, one can increase one&#x2019;s production merely by substantially limiting one&#x2019;s losses in this regard. I also believe that we can achieve stability in our agricultural industry if we process properly all by-products of the agricultural industry. Nothing should go to waste. I have here an article which appeared in <i>Scientiae</i> written by Dr. P. van Twis, in which he discusses the issue of important elements going to waste in, for example, the production of cheese. He says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from the valuable 13% protein content in whey powder, there is a 73% lactose content and for some people lactose is indigestible, but a possibility now exists that for the breaking down of lactose into glucose and galactose, one of the many applications of enzyme technology in food processing, namely the application of embolized enzymes &#x2026;</block>

<p>He says if this could be done with the proper research and if the correct processes could be applied, we could change this, too, into an acceptable food for man. Consequently I say that this, too, is a way of ensuring that nothing will go to waste in our agricultural industry. Furthermore, we would have to increase our agricultural production vertically to an increasing extent, instead of thinking in terms of bigger farms and fewer farmers. Recently I again saw that someone had predicted that in 20 years&#x2019; time approximately 80% of our farms would be in the hands of big companies and corporations. I ask myself whether this is necessarily the answer. I have already said to the hon. the Minister here that it has been proved scientifically that the moment an enterprise like agriculture becomes so big horizontally, one can no longer exercise proper control. The necessary increase in production per unit is lacking and one&#x2019;s production costs rocket.</p>

<p>In the final instance we shall have to encourage mechanization, which is essential but extremely expensive for the individual farmer. Farmers will have to obtain this expensive machinery in a co-operative manner, and we should encourage them to do this and, by so doing, to avoid unnecessary <span class="col_1143-1144" refersTo="page_0588"/>individual indebtedness caused by buying this type of machinery individually.</p>

<p>Sir, I believe that if the hon. the Minister would listen to a few of these proposals and give his undivided attention to them, it would pay dividends. We know the hon. the Minister and his Deputy. They are not unfriendly people. They are not indifferent to the farmers of South Africa. But I pity them from time to time, because they are perhaps the only two fighters in a Cabinet which does not always think as they do. We on this side shall lend them support wherever we can, because we are aware of the importance of our agricultural industry, we are aware of the role it can play in our economy and we are aware of the role it can play to keep South Africa safe and stable.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park introduced a very important motion. As part of my participation in this debate I should like to adopt a slightly different approach to this motion than the one he adopted. The problem with the approach the hon. member for Newton Park adopted to this motion was that he lapsed too easily into details, for example particulars such as the price of fertilizer, the price of wheat, etc. These are things which we can thrash out with one another in an agricultural vote debate. However, when we are dealing with a major subject here, namely the strategic role and value of agriculture for South Africa in Africa and in the world, we should take a broader view of matters, I am afraid, than the hon. member for Newton Park did. The hon. member began quite well by clearly pointing out how exposed rural areas are in times of war and against terrorist onslaughts. I agree with him. This is a military problem to which consideration will certainly have to be given. Even if one were to experience military and terrorist onslaughts on the rural areas of a country&#x2014;and these must inevitably affect our agricultural production&#x2014;South Africa&#x2019;s agriculture would still be in a very strong position, a position of preparedness. Let me mention just one example. Some of our boards, including the Maize Board, maintain a kind of Joseph policy for example. In terms of this policy approximately 10 million bags of maize are carried over annually. In other words, as far as food reserves are concerned, we are reasonably well protected.</p>

<p>This motion recognizes agriculture as an essential strategic resource. It is probably necessary for one to define what one means by the strategic value and strategic role of agricultural produce. Having done that, it is probably extremely important how one is going to utilize agriculture for the security and stability of the country. I agree that this strategic resource is very important, but one could utilize it incorrectly. One could utilize it in such a way that more harm than good was done. Stable growth and development in agriculture is essential, and I now wish to indicate the most important criteria in this regard. In the first place one has to determine what the population growth in South Africa is, in other words how many more people one has to feed annually. In South Africa our population growth&#x2014;here I am including all the population groups&#x2014;is 2,6% per annum, which our physical growth in agriculture over a period of 15 years has already been as high as 5% per annum. Therefore we are in a reasonably safe position. We have surpluses. We are prepared, and we could even feed people in times of disruption in agriculture.</p>

<p>What has given special prominence to agriculture, particularly in recent times, as a strategic resource, is the question of the grain contracts which we recently heard America had concluded with Russia. We know what the food position in the world is. As a result of the conference which was held in Rome in 1974, we know that there are many countries in the world that are experiencing problems with food supplies. In fact, the food reserves of the world have dropped to the lowest level in 20 years. During this food conference in Rome a very important analysis was made. It was found that 70% of the world population is living in the so-called developing countries, and that these developing countries are only producing approximately 44% of their food requirements. The remainder of their food requirements they have to obtain from the developed countries, <i>inter alia,</i> from the USA. One of the resolutions adopted at this conference was that attempts should be made to develop the food production potential of these countries further.</p>

<p>America is the country with the greatest agricultural production potential in the world. It is able, for example, to export 60% of its wheat, 50% of its soya bean and 20% of its maize production. At present America is responsible for three-quarters of the world&#x2019;s <span class="col_1145-1146" refersTo="page_0589"/>grain exports. It therefore has a powerful strategic weapon at its disposal while Russia, with its consumption of more than 200 million tons of grain, is experiencing shortages. During the past two to three years, Russia has only produced approximately 150 or 160 million tons of grain. In the nature of things Russia has therefore to rely on the American production for the food requirements of its people. Russia may perhaps be winning the arms race, but it will always have to look to the Western world for its food supplies. These facts demonstrate the strategic value of agriculture and food in the world.</p>

<p>At present a very interesting debate is being conducted in the USA. It revolves around how the USA should use its so-called &#x201C;food power&#x2019;&#x2019; as a political and strategic weapon. As example is being used the way in which the oil-producing countries used oil to acquire for themselves a position of power in the economic and industrial world. It is said that the Americans should adopt this same method so that they are able, with their food, to enforce certain rights for themselves, and if necessary, extort them. However, there are vastly different approaches to this question. Some people in the USA do not agree with this. The following, <i>inter alia,</i> is being said&#x2014;I am quoting from <i>Business Week</i> of 15 December, 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are crucial distinctions between food power and petro-power. The most obvious is the moral consideration. &#x201C;Can you imagine the repercussions of the US trying to play God with food?&#x201D; asks a White House official. Above and beyond that, there are practical limitations that do not apply to oil.</block>

<p>The moment one wants to use food as a means of extortion, one is using a very emotionally-charged strategic weapon, because food meets a very basic requirement of mankind. Some people proceed from the assumption that if America were to use its food in this way, it might be more detrimental to it internationally than its debacle in Vietnam.</p>

<p>South Africa is in a strong position as far as its food is concerned. We are producing more food than our population growth requires. We could easily export between three to four million tons annually, and then negotiate certain political advantages for ourselves in our neighbouring states. We have certain neighbouring states that might have a poor agricultural potential. We could blackmail them with our surplus food, but in my opinion it would be fatal to do so. There is one thing of which we should take thorough cognizance. Africa, and particularly Southern Africa, has an underdeveloped agricultural potential. Here we, as a highly developed country, have a very important role to play. However, I want to qualify the expression &#x201C;highly developed&#x201D;. I am not saying now that I shall challenge the hon. member, but there is something I do want to say. He must mention the name of one other country in the world to me, a country with such a limited agricultural potential as that of South Africa, in which almost 90% of the arable land has already been cultivated, a country with our natural conditions, in which only 3,3% of its land is highly productive, which was nevertheless able to have a growth rate of 5%. In some years our growth rate was even as high as 7%. Surely this demonstrates to us that we have some of the best farmers in the world. Surely this demonstrates that in our Department of Agricultural Technical Services, with the assistance which it makes available to agriculture, we definitely have something to give to the world.</p>

<p>We are aware of the political value of food, and we also realize what role it plays in the stability of various nations. In Ethiopia Haile Selassie, who ruled his country for decades and who was generally regarded as one of the strongest leaders in Africa, was eventually overthrown. Why? Because his people did not have enough food to eat. In Africa we have the position that food production is diminishing annually at a rate of 2% per member of the population. In some African countries it is diminishing by as much as 7% per member of the population. This means of course that a future of famine awaits African countries. One asks oneself then whether the time has not arrived for the African countries to begin to realize, in the words of the hon. member for Carletonville yesterday, that they should not allow themselves to be used and abused as revolutionary instruments to achieve communist domination in Africa. Has the time not arrived for them to realize that there are other important priorities which should be taken into consideration? Russia is not even able to feed its own people, but it is supplying certain people in Africa with arms and ammunition. <span class="col_1147-1148" refersTo="page_0590"/>When they have razed everything to the ground, there will be nothing for them to eat. What would this avail the African countries? I think it is in this direction that South Africa can play a major role.</p>

<p>It is essential that we should, in season and out, convey the technical assistance we have at our disposal and the results of the research we have undertaken to African countries through certain organizations, so that they can be helped to help themselves. However, there is something else which is very important, for if we can succeed in developing a common agricultural policy in Africa, and particularly in Southern Africa, such as the one which was developed in the European Economic Community countries, we will achieve a very strategic position. I want to quote a passage to indicate what the policy of the European Economic Community is in respect of agriculture&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(a) To increase agricultural productivity by promoting practical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilization of all factors of production, in particular labour &#x2026;</block>

<p>Labour is very important to agriculture, and particularly agriculture in Africa, for 80% of the African population is economically active in agriculture. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(b) Thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture.</block>

<p>In the EEC this objective has to a very large extent been achieved.</p>

<p>What is of fundamental political and strategic importance is the fact that since 1962&#x2014;i.e. since the implementation of the EEC idea&#x2014;an interdependence has developed among the various European states. I, and those of my colleagues who went to investigate the markets there, observed that the Germans cannot at present afford, as in former times, to make war against the French. Potentially Germany is a poor agricultural country. Its agricultural potential is not as high as that of the south of France for example. If the grainlands in the south of France were therefore to be devastated, the people in Germany, and the people in other countries who are also dependent upon that food, would suffer. I believe that if we are able to develop a common agricultural policy in Africa and particularly in Southern Africa, we will be able to develop a similar interdependence on our continent.</p>

<p>In practice peaceful coexistence cannot be better practised than by the very development of a situation of interdependence in the sphere of agriculture. This is in my opinion a matter which is as ripe and ready as can be. It is in particular a matter which we could consider in the light of the d&#x00E9;tente policy of the hon. the Prime Minister. Certain doors have now been opened to us in Africa, and we must talk to the States in question and acquaint them with our knowledge of the techniques of agriculture, of agricultural production under difficult circumstances. We must help them to develop; we have the necessary knowledge. At the same time we must discuss with them the question of marketing. There are many mouths in Africa that have to be fed. We should not only look to the Whites and to South Africa; we should also look to our neighbouring states and even to other countries and consider their position. We should try to establish, with their assistance, a common agricultural and agricultural marketing policy, so that an interdependence may be developed in that way as well. I believe that if we use our agriculture in this way as a strategic resource, we would be ensuring a great measure of stability for South Africa. We would be doing South Africa a service, not only in respect of the physical production of agriculture, but also in respect of the strategic value of agriculture in a world, which is at present in a very dangerous position.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I find it pleasant to follow the hon. member for Bethal. I think that both speakers made an exceptional contribution to our discussions during this debate this morning. One really cannot but congratulate them. Nevertheless, I think that although the hon. member for Bethal dealt with the strategic importance of our agriculture exceptionally well, he tended to avoid the bottlenecks in agriculture a little. He probably did this because he knows that his party is vulnerable when it comes to these bottlenecks. In his motion the hon. member for Newton Park <span class="col_1149-1150" refersTo="page_0591"/>dealt with them very thoroughly. He sketched the role of agriculture in our strategic set-up and the security of the country very thoroughly. He also pointed out the bottlenecks, and suggested solutions to them. All that is necessary now is for the hon. the Minister to listen to those solutions.</p>

<p>I want to approach this motion from a different point of view, for seen from the strategic point of view, everything which could be said has already been said. I want to approach it from the point of view that if we wish to be secure in our country, we should of course have a strong economy. In my opinion agriculture has made its contribution to the economy of South Africa, for although we contribute only 9% of the national product&#x2014;this is something with which we are constantly being reproached&#x2014;we are responsible for between 30% and 40% of the foreign exchange which this country earns by means of exports. That, in itself, makes agriculture a very important industry in South Africa. Hon. members will recall that when we had an exceptionally high growth rate of approximately 7% two years ago it was largely owing to agriculture. It is true that if we have had a good year in agriculture, South Africa finds itself in a good position, but if we have a bad year, South Africa&#x2019;s economy is in trouble.</p>

<p>There are three sectors on which the entire economy of a country such as ours is built, viz. agriculture, mining and industry. It is only those three sectors which generate capital, which produce something that can be sold. As they say in English, &#x201C;those sectors produce the cake&#x201D;. The other people are all living off the cake produced by these three sectors. It is true that other people make an exceptional contribution through the distribution of agricultural produce, etc., but nevertheless these people are living off the cake. They do not bake the cake. It is only industry, mining and agriculture which bake the cake, and therefore these three sectors deserve special treatment in South Africa. And indeed they are receiving special treatment. One thinks for example of the special treatment the gold mines receive when it comes to the low-grade mines. We saw how much money was poured in when Merriespruit was flooded. As far as industry is concerned, there are special import tariffs to protect our industries in South Africa. We also see that a tremendous amount of assistance is being rendered by means of income tax concessions for pre-service and in-service training schemes. The employer may deduct 115%, in other words, if he spends R1 000 on the training of a worker, he may deduct R2 250 for income tax purposes. We also see that industries can obtain inexpensive Industrial Development Corporation loans. It is no more than right and fitting that this should be the case, for those are the capital creating sectors. In view of this it is imperative that agriculture should also be regarded as a special sector which consequently receives special treatment in this country. Indeed, agriculture is more deserving of this than industry and mining. Mr. Chairman, as an employer &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. As an employer, the agricultural sector accommodates 28% of the economically active people in South Africa.</p>

<p>As far as boycotts are concerned, this country is vulnerable, but we can withstand boycotts provided we have food. However, if the country has no food, we cannot withstand boycotts. That is why agriculture is so important. Although South Africa is not a very fertile agricultural country, we have always been able, as the hon. member for Bethal said, to produce, and even export, the necessary food. As the hon. member for Newton Park indicated, agricultural produce comprises 30% of our exports. We are self-sufficient as far as agriculture is concerned. We are importing agricultural commodities to the value of only R50 million, and this consists primarily of tea to the value of R15,2 million and rice to the value of R11,3 million&#x2014;products which we could easily manage to do without. We are therefore completely self-sufficient in agriculture. Apart from that, agriculture provides this country with extremely cheap food. Our bread is the cheapest in the world. As far as maize is concerned, I want to point out that a maize farmer in South Africa supplies maize to the consumer at approximately R55 per ton; the prices are sometimes a little more or a little less. The world price, on the other hand, is R110 per ton today. The domestic consumption of maize amounts to 5,6 million tons. This means that the maize farmer is subsidizing the <span class="col_1151-1152" refersTo="page_0592"/>consumer to the tune of more than R300 million per annum.</p>

<p>I am pleased the hon. the Minister is saying &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;. That is why I found it so heart-rending to read what the hon. member for Orange Grove, the main speaker of the Progressives on agricultural matters at the time had to say. I see that they now have a new shadow Minister of Agriculture. We shall hear what he has to say this afternoon. I hope he will repudiate what the hon. member for Orange Grove said earlier, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The pipeline profits are excessive &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was discussing the oil pipelines&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but they are used as a cover up for uneconomic traffic. The profits on pipelines for the year 1973-&#x2019;74 were of the order of R58 million. One could well say that motorists were subsidizing the mealie farmers to the tune of R58 million. It is important that hon. members should know the facts.</block>

<p>He said this although the maize farmer is subsidizing the consumer to the tune of R300 million per annum. I hope that their new shadow Minister of Agriculture will rectify this matter today.</p>

<p>We should not be too confident. I just want to indicate what the position in agriculture is by mentioning a few figures. A tremendous population increase is taking place, not only in South Africa but throughout the world. The minimum requirement we have in South Africa is that we need 0,08 ha per capita for housing and 0,4 ha per capita for food. This is the minimum we require. As a result of the population increase in South Africa, projections show that in 1980 we will only have 0,54 ha per capita available for food. In 1990 we will have only 0,32 ha per capita for food. This is less than the minimum requirement.</p>

<p>If that hon. member were to read the reports of the food committee of the UNO instead of spending his time in the billiard room, he would also know these things. These figures simply indicate that we will have to give attention to agriculture. We cannot be too confident. The world projection is not much better. That is why Dr. Kissinger had to warn the underdeveloped countries the other day to get away from the idea of &#x201C;we breed them and you have to feed them&#x201D;. They will have to produce, and we in South Africa will also have to produce. That is why we shall have to give consideration to the bottlenecks in South Africa.</p>

<p>One of the bottlenecks&#x2014;the hon. member for Newton Park referred to it&#x2014;was that agricultural prices were not keeping pace with the prices of agricultural requirements. Nor had they kept pace with the growth in the other sectors. Or rather, the farmer&#x2019;s income is not keeping pace with the income in the other sectors. In this regard I should like to suggest a plan. The hon. the Minister should examine the Agricultural Prices Stabilization Scheme of Canada, a scheme which they considered in that country last year. Such a scheme would ensure that the farmer receives his fair share of the economy of South Africa. The scheme is in essence a kind of insurance, not for the individual farmer, but for the industry. A farmer pays 2% of his net income, up to a maximum of $500, to a stabilization fund. The Government then contributes to that fund in the ratio of two to one. They then take the average income of a group of farmers in an area in which the same kind of product is being produced. After that they take the average income over the past three years, they take 90% of this amount, and then multiply it by the rate of inflation. Suppose the rate of inflation is 10%. What it amounts to then is that they multiply by 10%. In this way agriculture keeps pace with the rate of inflation. The advantage of such a scheme is that one then has private enterprise within the framework of security. The amount is paid out to the group of farmers, and it is paid out <i>pro rata,</i> according to what they have produced, to the individual farmers. If one farmer has produced less, he is not paid out according to that formula, but <i>pro rata,</i> i.e. according to what he has produced. The money is paid into a pool. One therefore has private enterprise in <span class="col_1153-1154" refersTo="page_0593"/>agriculture within the framework of security. I recommend this scheme to the attention of the hon. the Minister. There are of course other bottlenecks, <i>inter alia,</i> labour, railway rates, estate duty and so on. Unfortunately my time is almost up and other speakers will therefore deal with these matters.</p>

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am going to give a very brief reply to what the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said. I think it would have been better if he had made the speech he made today, yesterday. His public image would definitely have been better. Today he acted in a more responsible manner.</p>

<p>I should like to mention one aspect on which the hon. member as well as the introducer of the motion dwelt, i.e. the increase in the prices of agricultural produce. I should like just one member of the Opposition to tell us why the price of agricultural land in this country keeps on going up and never down. They should tell us why the price of agricultural land has risen far beyond its agricultural value, if agriculture is unprofitable. It would be responsible of them if, in common with us, they would warn the agricultural sector against the unprofitable prices which are being paid for agricultural land today. I think it is necessary for a responsible body such as this to direct a timely warning to our farmers in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to deal with only one aspect of the motion, and this concerns production as well as production guidance and production research. I should like to sketch the very important role played by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services in the expansion of production in this country, and to refer to the valuable services and technical advice which is being made available to other countries, including countries in Africa. I want to try, by means of an evaluation of the activities of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, to prove to this hon. House that what has been requested in this motion, is already being done in this country.</p>

<p>The object of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is systematic agricultural development on a national basis which, in its turn, is aimed at optimal soil conservation and the protection of the natural agricultural resources. This policy encompasses three main principles. Firstly, agricultural production should take place in harmony with the natural environmental factors; secondly, agricultural production should not be engaged in at the expense of the agricultural resources; and thirdly, agricultural production should be economical for the entrepreneur.</p>

<p>To best carry out this policy, the department has been divided into four main branches, namely agricultural research, extension and information, training and controlled services. I maintain that no extension service or information service can function properly without having access to and being supported by sound basic and applied research. On the other hand, the advancement of agriculture requires an increasing measure of scientific understanding of the basic problems and the technological knowledge necessary to solve them. By means of research, a path must be found along which agriculture may develop, and through research the manner in which that path should be followed, must also be indicated.</p>

<p>To help it in its research and in the determination of priorities, the department has very successfully expanded a system of advisory research committees for the benefit of several production directions during the past years. Today there are already approximately 24 of these advisory committees, on which dedicated experts and knowledgeable agriculturalists are serving. In addition the research programme of the department is carried out by 10 research institutes. These institutes are engaged in specialized research in respect of certain disciplines and tasks, and the production of specific products.</p>

<p>Besides the 10 institutes, there is also the Institute for Field Husbandly and Grazing, which is not itself engaged in research, but merely directs researchers in the determination of priorities and co-ordinates in the above-mentioned context. Apart from this, each of the seven regional offices and South West Africa has a research team which, apart from their task of undertaking applied research in the particular region, are also responsible for supplying the agricultural colleges with training services. Time does not allow me to discuss this aspect. What I want to emphasize, however, is the fact that enough facilities exist to cover every possible agricultural commodity. There is sufficient co-ordination. Each ecological region is properly served and there is good interaction between researchers, extension officers and producers.</p>

<p><span class="col_1155-1156" refersTo="page_0594"/>Now we come to the extension and information services. I maintain that the agricultural extension services of the department have developed over the years into a comprehensive service, which reaches to each separate small part of our country and that together with the information services of the department it forms the cornerstone of liaison with the farmers. The service is provided on a regional basis and for this purpose the Republic has been organized into seven regions. South West Africa forms the eighth region. In addition each region has been divided into four to seven sub-regions and each sub-region into wards.</p>

<p>Another important service provided by the department to agriculture, is training. The most important is of course the training provided in our six agricultural colleges&#x2014;perhaps this will one day be seven, when the college at Nelspruit is opened&#x2014;with their two-year diploma courses. Over and above this task, informal training of the farmers is always taking place. This is extremely valuable and takes place with the aid of farmers&#x2019; days, short courses, etc. Continuous in-service training and refresher courses are also given to its officials by the department so that they can keep up with the latest knowledge in their particular disciplines.</p>

<p>Another important service is the control service. This consists of three organizations, namely the Division of Soil Protection, the Division of Plant and Seed Control and the Division of Veterinary Services. The achievements of the department are unequalled. Unfortunately time does not allow me to deal with this in detail. I shall content myself with mentioning only the breeding programmes for field husbandry and horticultural products and the creation of new varieties. Furthermore I also refer to Onderstepoort, which set up a new record in 1974-&#x2019;75 by manufacturing 170 doses of 40 different vaccines. Onderstepoort is, of course, known to be one of the most authoritative veterinary institutes in the world. There was also the development of a white-wool mutton breed sheep, and the stock reduction scheme which has brought about new schools of thought in the extensive small stock areas. These are merely a few of the outstanding achievements of the department.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has had a very good partner in carrying out its task, namely the South African farmer. I want to agree with previous speakers who said that in this country today we are blessed with the best farmers in the world. I have had the privilege to see how agriculture is practised in many agricultural countries. I take my hat off to the South African farmer when I consider the conditions under which he has to produce here. The department has succeeded in winning the confidence of most of the farmers. Whereas the visit of a departmental official was previously regarded as a nuisance, he is welcomed today and is hardly able to comply with all the requests which are made to him. There is an interaction, a cross-pollination, and slowly but surely science is sinking in and is being applied on practically every farm in the Republic. I do not want to elaborate on the assistance which we give to other countries, especially Africa countries, and our cooperation with them. In these days of political unrest one does not want to create unnecessary embarrassment. However, I want to say that we would like to share our knowledge on the agricultural level with other countries, as has often been said by the hon. the Minister. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services already provides comprehensive service on an international level. Indeed, statistics gained from reciprocal visits and correspondence even from behind the Iron Curtain is sufficient proof for me that our knowledge is much sought after in the world. The department is a member of approximately 15 international agricultural organizations in which it plays a very active role. Its contribution in Sarccus is of immeasurable value for our country.</p>

<p>I want to sketch briefly the role of agriculture in the South African national economy. The primary task of the South African agriculturalist is the provision of food for our internal population. However, agriculture is also an important provider of raw materials to the secondary industry and in the third place, through its export trade, agriculture has been a very important earner of foreign exchange. In spite of its limited natural resources, the industry has so far succeeded extremely well in its threefold task. Through the application of modem production methods and the increasing use of mechanical aids, the farming industry, with a few exceptions, has succeeded in providing the rapidly increasing population with sufficient food and also having surpluses available for export. This is no mean achievement <span class="col_1157-1158" refersTo="page_0595"/>if it is borne in mind that the South African population growth rate of 2,6% per annum is one of the highest in the world. The volume of field husbandry production in the year 1974-&#x2019;75 was in fact 111% greater than 15 years ago, while horticultural production increased by 87% and stock production by 37% during the same period. The total increase in food production during this period was 80%, while non-food production increased by 58%. The total population consists at present of approximately 25 million people and according to projections it will double by the end of the century and by the year 2020 will have increased to more than 81 million. If the changing eating habits of the bulk of the population, that is the change to high protein food, together with the population explosion, is taken into account, it is clear that food production in the Republic will have to be at least doubled within the next 25 years and within the next 20 years, more than the present production will have to be added to that doubled production. Experts are still optimistic that it will be possible to meet the increasing demand, but then our high potential soils, which cover only a meagre 3,5 million hectare and of which a large percentage are situated in the homelands, will then have to be utilized to a far better extent. It has been established that up till now the homelands have produced only a seventh of the production which was obtained on comparable land in the Republic.</p>

<p>Besides the role of agriculture as a provider of food, however, it is less well known what a large percentage of secondary industries are dependent on the existence of agricultural production. Approximately 33% of all industrial undertakings in the country make use of raw materials which are provided by agriculture, forestry and the fishing industry. This group of industries employs approximately a quarter million workers&#x2014;almost a third of all employees in industry. Agriculture&#x2019;s provision of raw materials to industry has increased considerably in recent times. Last year no less than 60% of the total agricultural production was taken up by industries, while industries which process food, took up more than 80% of this production. This is the second most important group in the manufacturing industry and provides 12&#x00BD;<i>%</i> of the total industrial production in the Republic. Owing to these facts it is generally accepted by experts that agricultural development in our country is still a prerequisite to industrial development. The pace at which industrial development takes place, is largely determined by the pace at which agricultural development takes place.</p>

<p>The third primary achievement by agriculture is its earnings in foreign exchange. During the six-year period until the end of 1974, the industry had earned almost R4 milliard from overseas markets. This was an amount which was sufficient to pay for more than half of our capital equipment imported during that period. Last year alone our agricultural exports reached the R1,2 milliard mark. Profits from agricultural exports at present contribute 30% to the country&#x2019;s total income from exports, excluding gold of course.</p>

<p>I want to refer to a last important role played by agriculture in the South African economy and one which must never be overlooked. This is that it is still the largest single provider of labour in the economically active section of the population, i.e. approximately 30%. I think that everyone will agree with me that this is truly an impressive achievement, especially when our changing natural conditions and limited natural resources are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Today, without fear of contradiction, I wish to maintain that our agriculturalists, together with our departments of agriculture, are ideally equipped to deal with this challenge before us, and are ideally equipped not only to feed and clothe our people, but to make sufficient agricultural products available to utilize them in the strategy of our country.</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the motion introduced by the hon. member for Newton Park reads: &#x201C;That this House is deeply conscious of the important and strategic role that the agricultural industry has to play in our national economy and the continued security of the country.&#x201D; What the hon. member for Newton Park is in fact saying is that we must examine the capability of agriculture in South Africa to provide the necessary food for South Africa&#x2019;s expanding population over the years that lie ahead and to continue to be able to provide that food in order to prevent the disastrous socio-economic and political results that will flow from the situation if South Africa&#x2019;s agriculture should fail in this respect. This is the experience of <span class="col_1159-1160" refersTo="page_0596"/>many countries in the world where sociopolitical disorders and revolutions have been heavily influenced, if not primarily influenced, by the failure of those countries to provide, via their agriculture, for the rising expectations and the demand for food and other services of its population. I am a friend of the Department of Agriculture and of the hon. the Minister and of the farmers. [Interjections.] I and my party are sympathetic towards and friends of the farmers of South Africa. We have many supporters in the agricultural sector and many representatives of our party at various levels of our organization in South Africa are connected with that sector.</p>

<p>Many of the aspects which are important to this debate have been effectively handled this morning. I would like to work towards a particular aspect and I want to start off by saying that I think one of the most important things that we in South Africa have to do is to put the Department of Agriculture and the practice of agriculture in the correct perspective and to relate it correctly to the other aspects of our national life. There is a very unfortunate lack of appreciation and understanding of agriculture by the vast mass of the population of South Africa, particularly the people who live in the cities. I think that a great deal of work can be done in this field to develop a correct and fruitful appreciation of agriculture and what it means to the country in terms of its economy, its life and its security.</p>

<p>I firstly want to say that agriculture is a primary industry. It is not some vague thing which involves only the farmers of the country. It is a primary industry of fundamental importance and significance to the country, unlike most other industries which mainly provide for the higher standards of material life of man. All the other industries are in fact aimed at providing higher standards of material life for man, in other words to improve his standard of living. There is nothing wrong with that and that is very important, but agriculture is the industry which provides for life itself as far as the people of the country are concerned. Agriculture is the primary industry which provides for life itself. It is in fact a matter of life or death for every man, woman and child in every country of the world. It is something which is occupying the minds and the thinking, not only of nations, but of the world as a whole, of United Nations institutions and of various other important organizations which have been established for this purpose.</p>

<p>The provision of food and the needs which apply in this field are almost directly proportional to the expanding and exploding population growth of the world. Two thousand years ago the world had only 200 million people. By 1850 this figure had increased to 1 000 million people, by 1930 to 2 000 million people, by 1975 to 4 000 million people and by the year 2000 it is predicted that the world will have to feed 7 000 million people. The population of the world is exploding; it is increasing according to an exponential rate of growth. The question which arises here is whether the world and its agriculture has any hope whatsoever of meeting that population growth in terms of food that has to be produced and provided throughout the world. There are many people who are saying that it is not possible and who are predicting the most dire consequences if agriculture should fail to provide those food requirements. A very interesting book which appeared recently dealt with a study that was made by the International Planned Parenthood Federation and indicated that in the developed countries the increase in the production of food and the <i>per capita</i> production of food were increasing at the same rate, but that in the developing countries, although the rate of production of food was increasing very fast, particularly as a result of the efforts of the developed countries in those countries, there is practically no increase in terms of the <i>per capita</i> production of food. Since 1973 <i>the per capita</i> production of food in most of the developing countries of the world has taken a disastrous plunge which has resulted in wide-spread famine throughout these countries. Agriculture is the only industry which produces all the primary food to sustain all human life on earth and that is what makes it one of the most vital and important aspects of our life. Agriculture should be seen as the most vital aspect of the utilization and the preservation of the environment. The nation must be informed and motivated to understand and appreciate the relationship between agriculture and man&#x2019;s survival and his well-being on earth. This can only be done, provided the Department and the Government project a dramatic and compelling presentation of agriculture through an environmental perspective and its significance to man. Many <span class="col_1161-1162" refersTo="page_0597"/>of the other aspects such as research, financing, agricultural efficiency and productivity have been dealt with and they are all very important and very significant. South Africa has made tremendous contributions to the world in terms of these aspects. If you travel in various parts of the world you find that apart from Gary Player and Chris Barnard, places like Onderstepoort and other agricultural departments and places where agricultural activities take place in South Africa, are equally well known. In Atlanta, Georgia, I found that Gary Player and Onderstepoort were for instance the only two aspects of South African life which were well known by many of the people in the legislature of that State.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one of the most important aspects of agriculture and one which is vital as far as the subject which we are discussing this morning is concerned, and that is the conservation of the soil. In 1971 Dr. Pentzhorn said that the Republic had 102 million ha suitable for agricultural purposes, of which only 15,3 million ha were suitable for ploughing. Of this 15,3 million ha, 4 million ha have already been destroyed by soil erosion. Jackson White, who wrote the book <i>The Rape of the Earth,</i> recorded that more soil has been lost from the surface of the earth since 1914 than in all previous human history. He commented that in South Africa the destruction of the soil was the worst observed anywhere in the world and that it would, in due course, lead to a national catastrophe. In South Africa, in particular, it was a tragedy in view of the appalling rapidity with which soil erosion followed inconsiderate farming. I am speaking on behalf of the good, considerate and intelligent farmer of South Africa and I may be very critical of the farmer in South Africa who is not using his land intelligently and who is not considerate and responsible in the use of his land. Dr. Kai Curry-Lindahl, Unesco&#x2019;s famous Swedish biologist and conservationist, records that during the past century water and wind erosion has destroyed an estimated 2 033 million ha of soil in various parts of the world, and that represents 25% of all the usable farm land in the world. Our own Mr. J. C. Ross has stated that in South Africa at least 25% of our original fertile soil has been destroyed. James Clark, one of South Africa&#x2019;s foremost and best informed environmental scientists, states that it takes nature 6 000 years to produce a ploughable layer of soil from rock. It must be taken into consideration that what it takes nature 6 000 years to produce, we are destroying in a matter of a few years. When Dr. Kokot compared water resources with land and soil resources in 1972, he said: &#x201C;Water is a resource which is annually renewed, but lost topsoil needs geological ages to be renewed.&#x2019;&#x2019; At the present rate of soil erosion&#x2014;and this is a fact and not an opinion, a scientific fact which has been deduced by extrapolation&#x2014;South Africa will lose all its topsoil by the year 2050.</p>

<p>Somebody could say to me that that is not true and that it may be only 85% or 90%, but in effect, at the present rate of the destruction of our topsoil, we may have lost virtually all our topsoil by the year 2050. John Adcock stated in 1966 that the country&#x2019;s stock-carrying capacity, i.e. its animal protein production capacity&#x2014;and South Africa&#x2019;s meat production only goes up by 1,5% per annum&#x2014;has been reduced by 75% of its original potential. Erlich has said&#x2014;and this is one of the points I want to make&#x2014;that while in 1882 9,4% of the earth was desert, by 1952 23% of the earth had become desert. John Adcock records that overgrazing has been the main cause of the Karroo&#x2019;s 290 km advance since the beginning of the century. In May 1973 the earth resources technology satellite showed that since 1953 the Karroo had advanced a further 70 km on to our grasslands. I think these are all exceptionally shocking statistics, which we should take into consideration. Prof. Midgeley of the University of the Witwatersrand has stated&#x2014;and many people contest this figure, but he has given it on sound scientific grounds&#x2014;that 400 million tons of our topsoil is being washed away annually. J. C. Ross said that that was equivalent to a six-inch layer of topsoil over 125 000 morgen. T. C. Robertson said that it was the ploughable soil of ten big farms, each of 1 000 ha. Do you know, Sir, it is estimated that the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam will be filled with silt over the course of the next 50 years.</p>

<p>What has been done by the Government and by South Africa as a whole? It is not only the Government&#x2019;s responsibility. It is the responsibility of South Africa as a whole to maintain and protect this most vital, most important and most valuable natural resource. It is more valuable than any of the other natural resources, because when the gold mines and all <span class="col_1163-1164" refersTo="page_0598"/>the other mines in South Africa have been exhausted, the natural resources of the soil must still be in a fit state to produce the food which is required to keep our people alive.</p>

<p>In 1946 the Soil Conservation Act was passed and in 1969 a further Act was passed. Heavy fines and prison sentences were provided for, but these have never really been properly applied in order to assist in the combating of soil erosion. T. C. Robertson concludes that persuasion, propaganda and education have failed to stem the tide of destruction, and he warned that we were living off the soil capital of our country. He said that errant farmers were in fact guilty of a very serious crime.</p>

<p>In 1971 Dr. S. J. du Plessis said that the 1946 Act had had no influence at all on soil erosion. He accused bad farmers of being guilty of treasonable activities.</p>

<p>*I quote what Dr. Serfontein, director of the Division of Soil Protection, said about this same matter recently (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Through recent aerial inspections and inspections on the ground, it was established that very few farm lands were protected by contour banks or stormwater furrows.</block>

<p>Now, 30 years after this 1946 legislation was put into operation, the director of the Division of Soil Protection finds it necessary to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In parts of the Eastern and Western Transvaal, the Eastern Free State, Southern and Western Cape which were visited, the first principles of soil conservation are in most cases not being adhered to.</block>

<p>In most cases the primary principles of soil conservation are hot being adhered to. I think it is a very serious matter if Dr. Serfontein has to say this kind of thing. I also think that urgent attention should be given to this matter.</p>

<p>&#x2020;What can be done about it? Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister agrees with me that this is true, that what I have been saying is true. It is generally agreed that it is true. It is not a political matter. It is a matter that is of absolute importance to everybody in this country. The hon. the Minister agrees that what the officials of his department say, is true. It is not only his department and it is not only Dr. Serfontein who say these things. The same comments have been made by Dr. D. W. Immelman, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. If what all these officials and all these scientists are saying is true, I think it is time that this country takes note of the situation, that the Government treats the situation with the necessary urgency and determination and that steps are taken to save this nation from this disaster which is descending on us.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the following should be done. We must take urgent, drastic and immediate steps to stop this situation. We must elevate the preservation and the conservation of the environment to a major discipline within the Government. It should have the responsibility and the functions of a coordinator and a controller of all these other activities, of which agriculture must form a major part. I think, Sir, that it may be necessary to scrap the existing legislation and bring in effective new legislation for environmental conservation, of which soil conservation will be a major function. Sir, this Government is prepared to spend vast sums of money to combat soil erosion, but what they have been spending up to the moment is a pittance as against what is required. I think it is time that South Africa should be reorientated to a national awareness by a vigorous and dramatic programme of education which should be introduced. The whole nation must become conscious of the urgency of this task. In respect of the homelands, too, the Third World which the hon. member for Carletonville spoke about, which is developing around and within us, I believe that an effective multi-racial and multi-national organization should be created to direct and control a comprehensive crash programme in respect of these matters for all of South Africa. The neighbouring States and the homelands and any other countries which form part of the southern African complex should be involved. How many training officers are provided in the homelands in order to combat soil erosion? How many people are trained there? Is it a fundamental aspect of the education of people in the homelands? We must get the job done now, Mr. Speaker, or we must accept responsibility for the total destruction eventually of the habitat of man in South Africa, and that will be a responsibility which will lie primarily on the shoulders of the Government, because <span class="col_1165-1166" refersTo="page_0599"/>they are the authority in the country, and also on the shoulders of the South African nation as a whole.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, where the hon. member for Bryanston said at the beginning of his speech that there was not enough appreciation in South Africa for agriculture and for the Department of Agriculture, I want to agree with him. However, if the hon. member for Bryanston shares the fear of the learned person to whom he referred, who alleged that theoretically speaking, South Africa&#x2019;s farming soil will have disappeared completely by the year 2050, I can give him this reassurance. I do not think the hon. member for Bryanston and his party know the spirit of the farmer of South Africa. Nor do I think that hon. member knows the quality of our Department of Agricultural Technical Services. I can give him the assurance, too, that never in the history of South Africa has so much been done, so much been spent and so much research been undertaken to establish and develop soil conservation in South Africa as at the present time. But not only do we in South Africa show a lack of appreciation for the agriculturist and the agricultural producer and our department; I think there is also insufficient recognition in South Africa of the strategic role which agriculture played in South Africa in the past; because many doors in Africa which have been open to South Africa have in fact been opened by the agriculturist.</p>

<p>Similarly, doors in South Africa are open to technicians from other countries who want to come and see how the work is done in South Africa. Sir, when we allege here today, as has been alleged by some of the members, that there is probably no better farmer in the world than the South African farmer, then these are not just hollow, idle words in praise of a small group of people in a particular occupation in South Africa; they are confirmed by the comments of other people. Sir Henry Plumb, the president of the National Farmers&#x2019; Union in Britain, recently visited South Africa, and in his parting speech this very gifted man said that from the nature of his work he came into contact with some of the best farmers in the world, but that he had never found any better farmers than those in South Africa. A well-known French banker visited South Africa three years ago with instructions to conduct certain investigations in South Africa, and when he departed, he told our then Minister of Finance, our present State President, that if he were to categorize the farmers with whom he had had dealings in the world, then he would place among the first five two groups of farmers in South Africa, those in the Boland and those in the Eastern Free State.</p>

<p>We must make use of this opportunity to pay tribute to all the farmers in South Africa, as well as to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and to the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. I also want to make use of the opportunity to thank our previous and our present Ministry for the development there has been in agriculture in South Africa. When we speak of the strategic value of agriculture and of food, we cannot help remembering that one of the first instructions we received was to till the soil. Those of us who were calm enough to listen to the marriage service will remember that it also says there should be something to give to the poor. We in South Africa are fortunate in not having known want for many decades. We in South Africa are fortunate in having been able for several years to give or sell goods to other countries which are in want. Over the last few years it has become increasingly clear that the strategic value of food and agriculture has become a popular point of discussion all over the world. Not only in South Africa, but all over the world, people must be careful not to allow the production and availability of food to be made a political bargaining factor in negotiations between nations.</p>

<p>When we look at the circumstances in the United States of America, I suppose that no one could deny that that country with its almost inexhaustible riches has been able to finance a large part of its development with the money obtained from the agricultural products it sold. I do not think the American was much mistaken who said that it was in fact food which had paid to have an American walk on the moon. The part which America plays in international politics today can also be related to a large degree to the part it plays in respect of the provision of food. In an investigation conducted by a certain Dr. R. L. Sandor, the chief economist of the Chicago Board of Trade, the following very interesting statistics emerged. The world exports of wheat rose from 26,5 million tons in the early fifties to 74,4 million tons in 1973, fodder grain rose <span class="col_1167-1168" refersTo="page_0600"/>from approximately 15 million tons to 75 million tons and maize and maize products showed an increase of 1,5 million to 40,3 million tons. After this man had made certain comparisons, he came to realize that the United States of America was presently exporting the products of one out of every four harvested hectares. This amounts to 34,4 million hectares which the United States of America can use for providing food to the world. Dr. Sandor then undertook a further investigation. He made a sample of 32 countries. He reduced to one single item the various foodstuffs exported to these countries from America. However, the assumptions he had to make were very conservative. He found that 28% of the people of Peru, 35% of the people of Venezuela, 17% of the people of Norway, 63% of the people of Israel, 36% of the people of Korea, 40% of the people of Taiwan and 53% of the people of Japan were fed by food from America. With this powerful weapon in America&#x2019;s hands today, one would expect this country to be regarded as one of the prominent powers, not only of the West, but of the whole world. And in many cases the world does respect America as one of the leaders today.</p>

<p>However, considering these resources which it has available, one would expect to be able to say categorically that America is the most prominent country in the world. But if we look today at America and its image in the world, we realize that the strategic strength of a country is not determined only by the availability of food, which can also be used in diplomatic negotiations. However, I shall come back to that. When I look at the achievements in the United States of America, I think that we in South Africa also have the right to be proud of what we have achieved up to now. That is why I feel free to pay tribute to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and to thank the present and previous Ministries.</p>

<p>When one looks at the population increase of 2,6% a year and one considers our limited resources&#x2014;last year, reference was made in a motion to the shocking lack of potential for further expansion of agricultural land with a high potential&#x2014;one realizes that it has in fact been an achievement for us to be able to provide enough food for 25 million inhabitants. But, Sir, we did not only provide enough for the 25 million inhabitants. As a result of this stable growth&#x2014;something which is advocated in this motion, and which according to our contention is already established in South Africa&#x2014;South Africa has also been able to export 29% of its maize products, 42% of its sugar, 45% of its citrus products, 38% of our deciduous fruit and eating grapes, 79% of our peanuts, 15% of our butter and 7% of our eggs. In the small number of cases where we are not self-sufficient, products such as coffee, tea, cocoa beans and other less important products are imported. However, when we look at the strategic importance of our agriculture, we must not ask in South Africa today how we can feed the world and this continent in the future. The responsibility of the hon. the Minister and of the department is first of all towards us, the population of South Africa. When one looks at the projections that are made, in which it is alleged that in 1985 South Africa is going to break even as far as its grains are concerned, one realizes that the strategic role which South Africa can play in the field of agriculture lies rather in making other countries self-sufficient. Consequently we have every reason to expect that the future will bring continued development along the course which has already been taken by agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal referred to the value of the EEC. I think that we in southern Africa also find ourselves on the eve of development in that direction. When one looks at the Treaty of Rome, which established the EEC in Europe, one notices that there are 19 fields in which these countries have tried to co-operate. Today, after several years have elapsed, there has only been progress in one field, and that is agriculture. For that reason the hon. member for Heilbron had reason to remark, when we conducted investigations in Brussels: &#x201C;These countries cannot afford to wage war on each other.&#x201D; I believe that we in South Africa will not only have to take the lead in stabilizing and implementing a common agricultural marketing policy or pattern in southern Africa, and subsequently in countries further to the north; we shall also have to go further in an attempt to stabilize and implement a common agricultural production pattern for southern Africa, and subsequently for countries further to the north. We are grateful for the work which is already being done by Sarccus. There are several countries that are making use of South Africa&#x2019;s skills, and <span class="col_1169-1170" refersTo="page_0601"/>several countries that are making use of the invitation issued by this department in the past.</p>

<p>However, there are fields to which we shall have to give attention in South Africa. Over the years we have developed a system in South Africa in terms of which the South African farmer and the various departments were ready to combat droughts. Perhaps the last few years have shown us that we shall have to give more attention to circumstances which may cause flood damage. When we have succeeded in South Africa in working out schemes for combating this flood damage and in implementing them in practice, we shall be able to share that knowledge with countries in Africa and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that there is one very important facet which we dare not forget. I have already said that the United States of America, with its powerful resources, could have been regarded today as the leader, not only of the West, but of the world, because it has the strategic potential for this. However, this goes to show us that the strategic power of a people does not lie only in the availability of food. For that reason we in South Africa dare not forget that in spite of the fact that we have food, and that we are likely to produce more of it in the future, we must go on looking for our strategic strength and developing it in our people; that we must make the food available not only to the scientist, the researcher, the worker, the farmer and the soldier, but that we shall have to keep on ensuring in South Africa that the relationship with the soil gives people something to make them strategically strong when they are threatened. The fact is that nothing binds a person more closely to his people and to his country than that relationship with the soil. We in South Africa shall have to guard against the danger of neglecting this relationship with our soil.</p>

<p>Another important point is that we shall have to ensure that we do not disregard one of the oldest rules of nature. One of the oldest rules is that man must work for his food. Naturally, development has meant that not everyone can be a producer of food, and that there are other occupations which have to be filled, but then we must remember in South Africa that those who do not produce food will pay for it. We in South Africa shall have to guard against the danger of becoming a welfare state where food is made so cheap that people lose their respect and appreciation for our food. May we realize in future that food is strategically important, but that the matter does not end there. The person in South Africa, as well the person higher up in the continent, must realize that although the food is available, that food has a price&#x2014;either labour or money. When we produce in the future and when we make our contribution in the future towards combating inflation and keeping the cost of living as low as possible, we shall also have to guard against making food so cheap that the standard of living will rise in respect of luxuries and unnecessary things. Let us realize our responsibility in respect of food, and let there be appreciation for what is being done in South Africa to keep our position stable and to make us strategically strong, bearing in mind what I have said.</p>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly agree with what has been said this morning by hon. members. I believe that hon. members have made very good contributions towards this debate this morning, which deals with a very important subject. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet wanted to know from us on this side of the House why the price of agricultural land continues to rise. Sir, I do not know of any land or houses or agricultural land in respect of which the price has fallen during the previous few years. On the contrary, the prices continue to rise.</p>

<p>&#x2020;My answer to the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet is that I can think of three reasons why the prices of agricultural land are continuously rising. The first is, of course, inflation and that we all accept. The second reason is that with the consolidation of land for the Bantu in terms of the 1936 Act much of our productive land has been handed over to the Bantu and has eventually gone out of production today. It is a case of supply and demand and today there is more land in demand than there was before. We heard about it a day or two ago from hon. members on this side. There are farmers who have to purchase other land in place of the land which the Government is now taking over from them. The third reason I can think of is that there are many of our agricultural units that are hopelessly overcapitalized. In many cases the farmer does not have a hope of getting his <span class="col_1171-1172" refersTo="page_0602"/>money back out of that unit. Many farmers are hopelessly in debt. They are carrying heavy bonds on their units. They can never under any circumstances sell their properties for prices that are higher than their bonds plus interest. In many cases interest in arrears also has to be paid. These are the three reasons I can think of offhand.</p>

<p>Economics is the strongest instrument of power we know of today. This has already been mentioned so often during this session. A strong economy is derived from stability. Stability is a must for both the producer and the consumer. It is something that everyone in South Africa desires, but it is not easily attainable, particularly in the farming industry. It is not easily attainable in the consumption and production of our foodstuffs. Everyone wants stability. Every agriculturist craves for stability. It is something we all desire and something we have been working for years. Security, we know, is a nice word, but we must realize that it goes together with a strong economy and stability. At the same time we have inflation. There is only one way in which inflation can be arrested, and that is by increased productivity. How do we increase productivity in the agricultural industry? We know that devaluation has increased the price of our export produce, but by the same token it has greatly increased the cost of production in agriculture. It has greatly increased the cost of imported machinery. It has also increased the cost of fuel and all lubricants, which are a must in the industry. Furthermore, devaluation has greatly increased the cost of repairs to farming machinery. We are passing through an era in which increased production is a must. There is an ever-increasing demand for food. The 25 million people in South Africa today&#x2014;I am not talking of tomorrow or the turn of the century&#x2014;enjoy the best living standards in Africa. However, our agricultural industry is going to be stretched to the limit. We see and know of the thousands upon thousands of refugees flocking to safety over our borders. Why are they flocking over our borders? Mainly because they are starving. One has only to look at the people to see how undernourished they are. They know full well that if they have to stay where they are, they will starve to death. They look to us for food, and our farming industry will have to provide the ever-increasing amount of food required. Not only do we have to provide food for the refugees, but we must also provide good wholesome food for our Army. Our increasing population must also be catered for.</p>

<p>Naturally, we have our problems. We realize what our commitments are, but due for instance to the extraordinarily high rainfall we are having at the moment, we are experiencing certain problems. The Wheat Board and the consumers are concerned about the serious damage to our grain crops. Wherever one goes, one hears of the crops having been damaged. Wheat fields, barley fields and maize fields have been flooded as a result of the heavy rain. The delivery of damaged wheat and grain to our mills and elevators is causing endless problems as well. We see that Russia has had a very bad wheat crop, but I am afraid that the prospects in South Africa for a good wheat crop are not encouraging either.</p>

He gave us many quotations and he mentioned the source of his quotations.

<p>I was talking about the shortage of labour and the problems facing industry when we suspended business for lunch. Labour is one of the serious problems facing industry today as regards productivity and production. I mentioned that farm labour was becoming more and more scarce and we could not account for this fact. There was a time when many of us had too many labourers on our farms and we had problems in disposing of some of them. Today the position is the reverse. Where they are all going to, we do not know. We realize that this will result in poor management and will of <span class="col_1173-1174" refersTo="page_0603"/>course reduce production.

<p>One thing we learned from that, and this was during the Second World War, is that our South African women can play a very important role in agriculture. For one thing, I do believe that our women are more methodical than most men. They are more meticulous, they are more businesslike and they have the ability to conserve. Our women have taught us one thing, namely that it is not the money you make which brings wealth, but the money you save. This fact was very marked during the last war. Many of our farmers had to leave the land and do their bit during the war years, leaving their farms to the sole care of their women, their wives.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Bantu, but under the control of the women. It was interesting to see that when many farmers returned to their farms after the war, their wives were able to show them a balance sheet free of debt and what is more, some of them had even paid off their bonds or at least reduced them. This has taught us that we should concentrate more on our womenfolk at playing their part in this very important industry, agriculture. In fact we must capitalize on this. Our women are very practical&#x2014;I have mentioned all the other good points&#x2014;and we must go out of our way to encourage women to come into the industry. We have very good financial institutions. I know of none better. We have the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, which is at the disposal of the industry, and we have the Land Bank. These are two fine institutions. We have mentioned the large amounts of money being spent on defence, and quite rightly so. I will not say that money on defence would be wasted, but we will not receive the full benefit of the money being spent on defence unless we can provide the essentials, namely good food for our Defence Force and for the nation. I make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to do his best with the hon. the Minister of Finance during the next Budget to make more money available for investment in agriculture through the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure and the Land Bank. The hon. the Minister knows that these two institutions need the money very badly. If we can obtain a substantial amount from the hon. the Minister of Finance through the budget, it will assist agriculture in South Africa tremendously.</p>

<speech by="#van_eck">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, earlier today we had a very interesting debate which ranged over a wide field, and it was interesting to see what degree of consensus was achieved on some of the major issues confronting South Africa today, challenges which we will have to deal with in the future. These are issues which can inherently influence the position of the White Western civilization here in South Africa, questions such as increased oil prices, inflation and the tremendous increase in South Africa&#x2019;s population, an increase which is accelerating to such an extent that it is gaining on us in spite of the increased production by the farmers. This is a problem as old as the world itself. 2 000 years ago Aristotle said that a nation without birth control was doomed to poverty, revolution and terrorism. And therefore, in my opinion, these two issues are very closely connected: To provide sufficient food for South Africa in the future and our tremendous population explosion here in South Africa. The farmer has played his part very well during the past few years b&#x00FD; means of increased production, by getting more from the soil, by making use of the scientific knowledge which is available. But there is still that great problem of an ever-increasing population, which gradually will overtake those basic natural resources which South Africa has at its disposal. This is one of the most important points to which we will definitely have to give consideration, and which is very closely linked to this matter. The other extremely great challenge which we considered, is that we must be strong in order to withstand the onslaughts of communism here in Southern Africa. We see in today&#x2019;s newspapers the problem of the 250 000 refugees on our borders who are looking to <span class="col_1175-1176" refersTo="page_0604"/>South Africa to be fed. In this year of floods and water-logged crops, problems exist which South Africa will have to face not only this year, but in the coming years as well. Food is power. A country which is economically sound and which can feed itself and be independent as far as the importing of food is concerned, is a country which possesses one of the most powerful weapons with which to confront the issues of the future. As an ordinary farmer, there is a serious problem which I often find disturbing. When I drive to the Northern Transvaal, I always find it disturbing to see how many unoccupied farms there are on both sides of the road. These are farms which have been ruined by bush encroachment. One sees hook-thorns for miles and miles and beautifully aloes in bloom, but very little or no cattle. If one goes further, into the Waterberg, one sees houses which are falling into disrepair, broken fences and grass this high at the end of the growing season. There are no cattle or sheep to graze on that grass. I can tell you there are many of those farms where there is not a soul at home, not even a non-White. Every year we have the phenomenon that after the first frost the veld fires start and then that beautiful grass, which should really have been served up at the tables of our city dwellers in the form of red meat, is destroyed. Every year the grass is razed to the ground. I should like to know why there are so many empty farms throughout South Africa. Most of them are in fact to be found in the marginal areas, where the land is sour and farming conditions difficult, but the problem is far more serious than this. The problem is serious in the first place because it reduces our production capacity and secondly, it makes us more vulnerable to terrorism and irresponsible elements. We had the case in the Waterberg where a few cattle thieves grazed 25 head of cattle on this farm and on other farms for a month, until they made the mistake of trying to market the animals. Then they were caught by the police of Naboomspruit. They wandered around for more than a month on these farms with 25 head of cattle. This is a serious problem, and I feel that it is essential that we investigate the matter.</p>

<p>The reasons for these unoccupied farms can firstly be due to the fact that some of these farms have been allocated for the consolidation of the Bantu homelands. Many of these farms are also unoccupied because the owners simply cannot keep their heads above water. They have struggled, they have ploughed and planted, but as a result of one bad harvest after the other when they tried to cultivate grain, they finally reached a point where they were unable to get the next crop planted. They were simply unable to afford it. They took out mortgages on their farms and many of them are today sitting in the towns trying to pay the interest on those mortgages from their earnings. These are circumstances which have an adverse effect on our food production and I am convinced of the fact that if we had provided a better education, many of those young farmers would still be active farmers today. Their problem is not that they are lazy, because I have seen some of them working from the early hours until late at night. But I believe that they do not always have the knowledge to know which type of farming to apply in that particular region. This is becoming a serious problem in large areas of South Africa, and if we are striving to achieve a goal of maximum production, i.e. to provide as much food as possible without veld deterioration and soil erosion, we will have to do something about this serious problem.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park has introduced a motion here in which he emphasizes the stability and the growth of agriculture. As the speakers on both sides have indicated, we are talking more or less the same language today. There are a few things to which I must reply, and I begin with the statement made by the hon. member for Newton Park when he suggested that we should look at the kibbutz system of Israel, at the depopulation of the rural areas and at the necessity for having more White farmers on our borders. He suggested that a system of collective farms, such as the ones in Israel, be established here as well. However, the hon. member must remember that the circumstances on our borders with the Black States are quite different from those in Israel. If our geographical situation is considered, one finds that our extensive stock farms are only found on the borders of the Black areas. It is difficult to have a collective farm there or to build up a community such as a kibbutz. With such a low rainfall and a region which is dependent solely on stock production, one cannot have a system such as the one in Israel. <span class="col_1177-1178" refersTo="page_0605"/>It is easy to make the statement, but to apply it in practice is not so easy.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that the rural areas are becoming Black. We have discussed this before. This phenomenon is not the result of Government action; it is the result of economic circumstances. I have spelt out our policy to you before, and it is not the policy of America or Australia. Their policy amounts to &#x201C;get bigger, get better, or get out&#x201D;. This is not our policy. We are a country with a free economy, and the major reason for depopulation is in fact&#x2014;and here I differ with the hon. member for Benoni&#x2014;not that the land is not being worked, but that the man has been bought out by his neighbour. This is not the result of action by the State, but something which takes place in the process of a free economy. The successful man has enlarged his unit. For what reason? Because the profitability per unit has decreased. I shall admit quite frankly that as a result of production costs and circumstances, the profit margin has become smaller. If one wants to succeed, therefore, one must have a bigger volume of business. In some cases one can no longer have a small farming unit today; one must increase one&#x2019;s turnover and have a bigger income. This one can only do if, instead of farming with 300 breeding cows, one farmer aims at farming with 400, 500 or even more. This is a normal economic law which is applicable particularly when one&#x2019;s profit margin is small. The man has bought out his neighbour as a result of his own action, and we do not have legislation to forbid this. The hon. member says that that depopulation was a big mistake, and I agree with him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Carletonville made a speech yesterday which to me amounted to the fact that the man who works and occupies the land will also own the land. It is important for us to retain the number of farmers we have, in so far as it is economically justifiable. The hon. member asked that we should have a revival in our country towns. Can the hon. member tell me what we can do to revive a town such as Hofmeyr? Can you give me a practical solution?</p>

<p>Now the hon. member talks about Dr. Du Plessis. Reference has been made here to the Du Plessis report on rural reform. It consists of three parts, and the first part has already been released. It will be freely available, because we do not hide agricultural matters. There is the problem of translating and printing it, but the full report will be published in the course of this year. But I want to tell you that the report does not give us a solution for injecting new life into a district consisting of units which are uneconomic by today&#x2019;s standards. Now the hon. member asks us to develop the industries in the rural districts. Only three days ago the hon. member for Constantia said that his party was opposed to decentralization. This is what the hon. member said the other day. I sat listening to him. The one says &#x201C;decentralize&#x201D; and the other says &#x201C;don&#x2019;t decentralize&#x201D;. I do not want to quarrel with you, but since we have consensus today, we must argue on the same level so that we can understand where we are going.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to production costs, and I really do appreciate that. The figures he mentioned were not quite correct, and in some cases they are even higher. I asked last year whether, if I were to try this year more or less to correct the prices of agricultural products after the 30% required by the inflation programme has been deducted from them, they would support me if the price of maize, for example, were to rise?</p>

<p>Yes, but I just want you to hear these words. I want them written over and over again in Hansard. [Interjections.] As <span class="col_1179-1180" refersTo="page_0606"/>far as an agricultural planning board is concerned, I have promised that as soon as we have received the report of the Wentzel Commission on the marketing board system, we shall look at the National Marketing Board and see to it that we get a body which will be able to help us with planning on the long term. I have told you before that you have to help me to get people on that board who will be able to tell me in which way we should plan. So I am not arguing with you on this point. We are going to try to do it more or less in this way. However, it is impossible for anyone to tell me today how much maize we have to export next year; that we must adjust our Joseph policy in such a way as to keep to the minimum because we may have a record harvest again next year. The members of that planning board will have to be people of marvellous insight. I would not have believed last year that we would have so much rain again this year and I think that very few of the Opposition members would have thought that we would have so much rain again this year. This kind of thing is completely unpredictable.</p>

<p>Yes, Sarge; I shall tell you later what it means. [Interjections.] That is not our policy either. These things which take place in practice originate in a problem of management. I do not want the hon. member to worry about that. He must not think that this is the direction in which we feel we should go.</p>

<p>All the assistance which we render by means of Agricultural Credit, which the hon. the Minister of Finance provides by means of the Land Bank&#x2014;we shall have a further discussion on this here this afternoon&#x2014;is deliberately aimed at providing the new entrepreneur, the young man, the man who wants to get into agriculture, with financial support from the State, at cheap, subsidized interest rates. A man with an economic unit can do whatever he likes, he will not get a loan from the State. The system is aimed at drawing younger men to the industry. The hon. member need not be afraid that we shall move in the direction of big enterprises.</p>

<p>I should like to congratulate the hon. member for Bethal. He referred to the achievement of the South African farmer and he said one very important thing. Germany is very well aware of the fact that if it were ever to hurt France as a member of the European Economic Community, it would lose the great source of food in the south of France. The German Minister of Agriculture admits this. He says that such an important source of food will not be cut off again as has happened in the past, because future wars are not going to be waged with guns only. One cannot fight on an empty stomach. The population explosions are in fact taking place.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that we were inter-dependent, and this can apply to the rest of Africa as well. If they can have a commonwealth of nations in Africa, similar to the European Economic Community, we could eventually play a much more important role here with food as a weapon. On this point I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. member for Bethal.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. Mr. Speaker, in all the time we have been sitting in this House together, today is the first time that the hon. member has made a positive speech in which he did not berate me once. I wish he could come and address a political meeting for me and say the same things there that he said here. [Interjections.] The hon. member says that we should not give special treatment only to the goldmining industries and to the other industries through the IDC. The strongest of the three legs which he mentioned here is definitely the agricultural industry. For this reason I feel that if the Opposition were to support us when we are sympathetically disposed towards agriculture and when we have to render assistance to a man who wants to produce food, this would be a positive contribution.</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned that the maize farmers contributed R300 million towards <span class="col_1181-1182" refersTo="page_0607"/>subsidizing the domestic consumer. The hon. member is making a mistake. The domestic price of maize is R56 a ton for the producer and the consumer pays R50 a ton. The world price fluctuates. It has been R111 a ton and last week it was R92 a ton. Freight and insurance are R17 a ton. The average price overseas is approximately R15 higher than here. We use only 5,6 million tons. So the hon. member should not say that the maize farmers subsidized us by R300 million. It will be approximately R121 million or R122 million this year. That is to say if he himself gets that price on the world market. However, it is only for the past three years that we have been exporting our maize at a profit. During the preceding eight years we exported our maize at a loss, which amounted to R64 million over that period. Where did this loss come from? It was because of the price abroad, which was R64 million lower than the domestic price. The Minister of Finance and the Stabilization Fund all contributed&#x2014;so did the maize farmer. We must see the matter in perspective.</p>

<p>I know the maize farmer is having a difficult time. I know his production costs are high, but as far as this matter is concerned, our figure must be realistic. I believe that the hon. member&#x2014;I almost said the hon. brother; this is how I feel about him&#x2014;will also help us this year when we come to determine prices. [Interjections.] This is coming to seem like a meeting of a church council to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have a list here of the research projects, of the tremendous task undertaken by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services&#x2014;the biggest research department in the Republic and in Africa, as I said the other day. The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet mentioned each of these achievements of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. Not that they are enough; according to the budget, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services will receive R58 million for research and information services. When the Minister of Finance looks at the essential economizing of every department, he is very sympathetically disposed towards this kind of appropriation which is related to the production of food. I thank the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet for the information he furnished.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bryanston said: &#x201C;He is one of my friends and also a friend of the department, the Ministry and the farmers.&#x201D; I wish to thank him for that, I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>If discussions can be held in this spirit all through the session, we are going to finish very early this year and we should be able to go home by next month. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>&#x2020;He said there must be a better understanding between the primary producer and the consumer&#x2014;the townspeople. I agree with him. I think the people in the cities take it for granted that they will always have food. They never think that the day might come when we shall have a population of 50 million in this country to feed. Losing an average of 30 000 to 40 000 ha of land annually to the building of highways and cities, we are not gaining one single hectare of land. This message should be brought to the townspeople. The hon. member can help me achieve that in Bryanston and surroundings where he has a few voters. [Interjections.] I believe the 40 million tons of soil that are lost annually through soil erosion is a bit of an exaggeration. There is erosion and we are concerned about it, but I do not think we should exaggerate it. The hon. member said the Karroo was advancing at a rate of approximately 25 km a year, devouring our grasslands. We are doing a lot towards soil conservation.</p>

<p>*I just want to read you this extract, Sir, in reply to what the hon. member said, namely that nothing practical had been done (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the winter rainfall areas, the farmers have made 11 000 km of contour banks over the past five years. In the highveld region, 1 200 km of contours and 634 run-off furrows were built. In the Transvaal region, 800 km of contour walls were made over the past year, and 80% more watercourses than the year before.</block>

<p>Within only one year, so much more was done because the farmers had an income and were able to do it. Before a farmer pays his income tax, he first makes contour walls. He then deducts the cost from his income tax. In Natal, contour banks of approximately 2 000 km were made, and on only 142 km of these a subsidy was paid. The rest the farmers did themselves. We shall deal with these matters in greater detail under my Vote.</p>

<p><span class="col_1183-1184" refersTo="page_0608"/>The hon. member for Bethlehem referred to the achievements in the agricultural field and made projections for the future and concluded by referring to man&#x2019;s relationship with the soil. Sir, he spoke the language of a man who makes his living from the soil. He is bound to the soil and that is why he made such a speech. I want to convey my sincere thanks to him. The hon. member for East London City spoke of the problems in agriculture. Sir, there will be problems in agriculture, but we are mechanizing so rapidly that unless there is greater industrial development in the homelands and in the White areas, I am afraid that in five to seven years&#x2019; time we shall have people who will go about looking for work, because of the speed at which we are mechanizing in agriculture today.</p>

<p>To the hon. member for Benoni I can only say, as regards those farms that are not being cultivated, that 15 years ago we had 8,8 million head of cattle and 31 million sheep. We introduced a reduction scheme to conserve the veld. We spent R56 million on restoring the veld by means of a stock reduction scheme. The stock numbers have been reduced. At present we again have 8,8 million head of cattle, and the number in regard to sheep is 30 million, but we have a smaller number of farmers. You should be glad when you drive about in the Waterberg and you see the grass in seed. Think of the time when that part of the world was dry and bare from over-grazing. Then one feels happy when one sees how beautifully the veld has recovered.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude. I think my time has expired. I just want to say that I have said before&#x2014;and here I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Newton Park&#x2014;that our motto at the Department of Agriculture is: &#x201C;Food for peace, prosperity and progress.&#x2019;&#x2019; I am glad that we have this feeling here today, because to fight communism one needs more than just guns. The first thing one needs is a shed full of wheat and enough cheap food, such as we produce. We must get our priorities straight. For that reason I am glad that we have discussed these things here today. I shudder when I think of famine and I am grateful for the blessings we have had over the past number of years, and when I look at the future, I say that we can feed 50 million people. We have the human material and we have the sympathy of the Government and today we have really and truly received sympathy from the Opposition side as well.</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) combating inflation; and</li>

<li>(b) increasing production.</li>

</ol>

<p>Sir, I am glad that I am in a position to come to this House this afternoon with this motion under these circumstances. Agriculture is a dynamic industry, in spite of the fact that there are perhaps people who think that this industry is dormant. But I say it is a dynamic industry which is developing, and in view of the increased costs and in this time of inflation in which we are living now, it is necessary that we should consider the position with regard to suitable financing for agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hazardous nature of agriculture in South Africa because of the varying climatic conditions and the high production costs, especially on land with a low potential, is well known. Only 3,3% of our land has a high potential, and, generally speaking, we have had a small profit margin recently. Therefore I am saying that the risk attached to agriculture in South Africa is high. Other factors which also contributed to making the matter even more difficult, is the injudicious subdivision of agricultural land, undesirable farming practices, disasters and setbacks over large areas in successive years and a small domestic market <span class="col_1185-1186" refersTo="page_0609"/>for a considerable time, with low world prices, especially of export products, and also seen in the light of the circumstances that agriculture is really a little separated from the ordinary economy of the country. It often happens that when economy in South Africa is flourishing, agriculture might be experiencing difficult times because of circumstances which apply within the industry, such as droughts or other disasters and setbacks. This is not to say that when all is well with the economy of South Africa, it also applies to agriculture. Often the reverse applies, because we had the experience in the past that when all is well with agriculture, things are also well with South Africa.</p>

<p>A further factor we have had to consider in recent times is inflation, the extremely high demands made upon the farmer and agriculturalist in this country, and also the financing policy of its Government to be able to provide in the needs of agriculture, in these urgent times when an increase in production is being envisaged. Sir, I emphasize here that we should have appropriate financing for agriculture in this country and that it is essential, in accordance with the policy of the Government, to determine our priorities and economic objectives, also as far as agriculture is concerned&#x2014;which constitutes a major section of our economy&#x2014;in order to ensure sound growth and stability by providing appropriate financing. During the past few years agriculture could have benefited greatly as a result of the positive financing policy of this Government, and, as background, I just want to deal with this very briefly.</p>

<p>After the problems in agriculture have been identified on the basis of various investigations, it was laid down, as policy, that all financial assistance which comes from the State, should be brought under one roof, i.e. the Department of Agricultural Credit. We have been enjoying the advantages of this sound policy for the past 10 years. But as far as appropriate financing is concerned, provision for agriculture should be made on three levels. On the first level is State aid, which consists of aid rendered by the Department of Agricultural Credit in various spheres. This is really meant for the farmer who is a beginner and, as our Minister of Agriculture said, who has only one of his feet in the stirrup, and who may perhaps also be in circumstances of economic need because of circumstances beyond his control and who may easily obtain assistance from other institutions, because of the fact that he is not economically strong and does not have a strong balance sheet. Nevertheless these are the people in whom this Government has confidence and who we know will be an asset because, as the Minister said a moment ago, we do not have a policy of &#x201C;getting bigger&#x201D;, but a policy of keeping the small man on the land and of providing in his needs. Recently the National Government has provided for those among them who are deserving cases and formulated a policy which provides him with finance at subsidized rates of interest, which resulted in the fact that we can tell many a success story of farmers who bought their first piece of land through the Department of Agricultural Credit. You know, Sir, in agriculture costs are high today and things are expensive. A few years ago an economic unit probably cost R50 000. Today it is well over R100 000. Therefore it is necessary that there should be appropriate financing from the State for these people with limited means in order to enable them to own their own land. Then we also have some of these people who are independent in their own right at present.</p>

<p>On the second level we have the Land Bank, which also provides in the needs of our people. This institution, the Land Bank, is probably one of the financial institutions in South Africa which we can be rightly proud of, because this task the Land Bank is fulfilling, is being carried out with the necessary ability to promote sound and stable growth in respect of agriculture, in the interests of South Africa. The beneficial influence of the Land Bank and its financing policy is a subject which could occupy us a whole day should we want to discuss it, because the Land Bank makes its financing policy felt over such a wide sphere. The Land Bank usually provides funds at a slightly higher rate of interest than that of the Agricultural Credit Board. Long-term loans are provided to farmers on first mortgage for the purchasing of land. Such a loan is usually covered by an insurance policy. Since the inception of this scheme, over R300 million has been paid out to estates. The Land Bank also provides interim capital to farmers in need of financial aid over a short term. Under appropriate schemes financing is also provided for the purchasing of livestock and implements and certain other means of production which <span class="col_1187-1188" refersTo="page_0610"/>qualify for it. The provision of the necessary capital to co-operative societies for the purchasing of means of production mostly falls in the category of short-term provision while certain long-term financing is also provided to co-operative societies. Medium-term credit is a major need in our agriculture. Over and above hypothec loans, which are really medium-term credit, the Land Bank often grants an extension of time to farmers who are unable to meet their obligations over a period of 12 months. A further 12 months are granted via the co-operative societies. This financing is really middle-term credit. The amount annually advanced by the Land Bank to cooperative societies and agents to buy in crops, is phenomenal. During the past year it amounted to approximately R1 400 million.</p>

<p>The broad spectrum of agricultural financing by the Land Bank is pre-eminently characterized by its appropriateness. The distribution is not only over a broad sphere, but also among various farmers with their respective means, so much so that it is the policy of the Land Bank that also the financially stronger farmer should receive financing with a view to obtain a regular feedback of funds to the Land Bank. The Land Bank is often also inclined and compelled to do long-term financing with short-term funds. For that reason there has to be a regular feedback of capital in order, that when agriculture finds itself in difficult times, the Land Bank is in a position to continue financing under those circumstances. The Land Bank also undertakes financing for the establishment of bulk facilities for the storage of grain. This is a very essential service. If this service did not exist, what would the cost of storage, handling and the distribution of our grain in South Africa not have been, and what would the inflationary effect on this service not have been?</p>

<p>We also have financing through commercial banks, financing companies and insurance companies. In this respect it is the policy of the Government that the more financially strong farmers should satisfy the bulk of their finance requirements on short and long term through these bodies. These institutions, together with other institutions, satisfy the needs for the financing of the agricultural sector.</p>

<p>From this plan of financing of the Government certain advantages originated which I would like to mention this afternoon. In the first place, the National Party Government has tried, through the financing of the agricultural sector, to afford private initiative an opportunity and to establish itself in agriculture, much more so than in other countries of the world. If there is one thing the South African farmer should be grateful for, it is for this Government&#x2019;s policy that private initiative should be recognized in the country, not only in other spheres, but also in agriculture and that it is in a position to play the optimum role. This resulted in the agricultural industry being one of the best developed and most competitive industries today; competition takes place between units within the industry itself. The hon. the Minister said a moment ago that one farmer buys out another. This is the healthy state of affairs if there is competition. If we want to combat inflation, there should be sound and strong competition. This is what we have in the agricultural industry in South Africa at present.</p>

<p>The fact that the prices of our products are on the whole based on an average production cost survey, means that inefficiency in agriculture in South Africa is not being subsidized. The policy of average cost gradually eliminates the inefficient man. This is a very important point of which we must take note. Recently we have eliminated many of the problems which exist in agriculture, among others by the consolidation of land to convert smaller units into economic units. For that reason a small number of farmers were able to produce more and more food, so much so that we are able to feed more than 27 million people and then still have some left to export. In many of our industries we can export over 50% of our production. Exports not only earn very welcome foreign currency for South Africa, but&#x2014;I want to put it very strongly this afternoon&#x2014;it provides farmers with an income abroad which they might not have been able to earn on the domestic market. Therefore, it is necessary that when a farmer earns something on the foreign market, we should not begrudge him that income. Some of my colleagues will elaborate upon this matter. I would like to discuss a few bottlenecks in this regard. One of the first bottlenecks I would like to discuss with you, Sir, is the high rate of interest pattern we have had in South Africa recently. It is a fact that farmers, new and small industries and houseowners are affected by this. I do not want to single out agriculture, but <span class="col_1189-1190" refersTo="page_0611"/>I think the time has arrived for us to talk sensibly and responsibly about the bottlenecks which are developing. We must spell it out and reflect on it a little this afternoon. As early as in 1970 the Franzsen Commission admitted&#x2014;and it is generally known to us&#x2014;that the agricultural sector is unable to bear the present high rate of interest in South Africa in view of the difficult circumstances in which she finds herself. At that time the rate of interest was only 8&#x00BD;%. I further want to make the statement that rates of interest of 12% and 13% are inflationary because they push up the cost structure. While agriculture needs large amounts of capital in the present difficult circumstances, part of the rate of interest is responsible for a major portion of the inflation with which the agriculturist in South Africa has to cope. I want to go further. Interest rates, being as high as they are in this country today, affect the normal flow of the capital in our various sectors. This causes uncertainty and strain and it creates an in equilibrium in the normal capital flow on our capital markets. This is a major problem. One needs confidence for stable growth, for the combating of inflation as well as for increased productivity.</p>

<p>I want to quote a single example to you. A few years ago some of our people took out mortgage bonds, especially with outside institutions such as insurance companies and commercial banks. At that time the rate of interest was 8% to 8&#x00BD;% and today it is 12 to 14%, but this increase did not form part of the calculations of farmers. In 1970 it was calculated that 36% of the loan capital required by agriculture had come from the Land Bank, Agricultural Credit and cooperative societies. 64% of the loan requirements was provided by commercial banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. At the end of 1974 those figures were slightly different. The 36% changed to 40%, in other words, there was an increase of 1% per year in the provision of loan capital by the Land Bank, Agricultural Credit and our co-operative societies. However, 60% of the capital still had to be provided by the other institutions, and this is expensive capital. Further, bearing in mind that 20% of our farmers provide 80% of the production of rates of interest of 12 and 13% mean on expensive capital, nobody must tell me that the farmer&#x2019;s own capital is cheap capital, because it is also expensive capital and it is just as expensive as that of the industrialist and any other person. I want to say that 80% of our production of agricultural commodities in South Africa is actually obtained through expensive capital, except that portion which is provided to bigger farmers by the co-operative societies.</p>

<p>I do not want to advance a plea for our bigger farmers, but for stability in agriculture, because our stability is very closely related to fortunes and misfortunes of the bigger farmers. I want to make say that we will have to consider again the position regarding interest in this new and complicated situation, because the increased interest rates of other institutions are also having a negative effect on institutions such as the Land Bank and agricultural co-operative societies because money is being taken away from the later institutions. While we have this fine co-operative agricultural movement in South Africa and because we have seen that agricultural co-operative societies overseas have, to a large measure, their own funds at their disposal and are being utilized by the authorities in the service of pastoral reform, I want our co-operative societies in South Africa to be left alone to form their own capital, because in future we will have to rely to an increasing extent on the Land Bank, Agricultural Credit and our co-operative movements for cheaper forms of financing in agriculture. Therefore, I want to point out this afternoon that the effect of increase in the rate of interest has a very detrimental effect on our co-operative movement and on an institution such as the Land Bank. The Land Bank has to obtain a large portion of its funds on the open market and they are jealous of its fine policy. They have not increased their rate of interest in recent years. Because its rate of interest is so much lower than that of other institutions, pressure is brought to bear upon the Land Bank for more and more funds, so much so that it had to introduce certain restrictions in its loan policy. I do not know of one single person who had qualified on merit whom the Land Bank was unable to help. The same applies to Agricultural Credit, except in recent times because great pressure was also brought to bear for more and more funds, and because funds to purchase land with, were exhausted. I think that we will have to give close consideration to these matters.</p>

<p>From 1970 to 1974 co-operative societies increased their assistance to agriculture from <span class="col_1191-1192" refersTo="page_0612"/>R112 million to R198 million. In this respect I also want to mention that other institutions have reduced the provision of credit to agriculture. Here I want to single out insurance companies which provided R102,6 million in loan capital to agriculture in 1970 and at the end of 1974, only R77 million. I do not think that this is altogether in line with the amount of business insurance companies do in the country districts.</p>

<p>We have a large variety of industries within our agriculture. We have industries which must necessarily import inflation to a large degree in the form of tractors, spare parts, weed killers, sprays and so on. Some of our other industries perhaps do not import so much inflation. Inflation which is imported, must be absorbed and discounted. Some of our other industries export a great deal. I think it is time for us to bear in mind these aspects as far as agriculture policy is concerned, and give credit where credit is due. We, at the southern extremity of Africa, are dealing with agriculturists and people who have shown that they participate in the manifest against inflation. They are co-signatories and are prepared to do their share, but they are also part of a country which has a strong economy, part of a country which should be the leader in Africa and we in South Africa will have to take the lead in the near future. I want to appeal to everyone who has something to do with agriculture, not only the authorities, but also our agriculturalists themselves, that we should put our shoulder to the wheel and do everything we possibly can to create a powerful agricultural industry within the policy of this Government and to act as leaders in the field of agriculture in Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the speech made by the hon. member for Heilbron put me very much in mind of the speeches we had from this side of the House during the past number of years in respect of agricultural financing. The plea advanced by the hon. gentleman in connection with the extremely high rates of interest prevailing at the moment and the fact that other financial institutions are no longer interested in investing in agriculture, have repeatedly been used as arguments by this side of the House. I do not want to blame the hon. member for Heilbron for doing so, because just as we are in a position to be able to determine what constitutes certain bottlenecks for our agricultural population, so that hon. gentleman, who is himself engaged in this industry, who represents a farming constituency and who knows the people, is in a position to do so. For that reason we on this side of the House want to welcome his speech today, because here a bottleneck&#x2014;as he called it&#x2014;is developing, a bottleneck which undoubtedly has to have far-reaching effects for our agricultural industry in the long term. It is as clear as daylight to me that the fewer private financial institutions&#x2014;and it does not matter who they are&#x2014;are interested in investing in the agricultural industry in the form of mortgage bonds, the more essential it will be for that vacuum they are creating to be filled by something else. The private financial institutions are in a position to make far more profitable investments in buildings and industries than they can in agriculture. The return they receive from such investments, is far higher and they can recover their capital much quicker and use it for a new investment. After all, agricultural investment&#x2014;and I have in mind particularly the purchase of land&#x2014;is a long-term investment. Those mortgages are often taken over by the children of the farmer after his death.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, after estate tax. Then the mortgage bond is usually still higher. After all, this is what happens. I think it is quite normal that one will find the situation that private institutions will be less interested in agriculture and be more interested in the immediate and quicker increase of their money and the more profitable investment thereof. When making his speech today, the hon. member raised the same point (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall have to rely to an increasing extent on the Land Bank and Agricultural Credit for loans and for assistance.</block>

<p>The hon. member made a good speech. There is no fault to be found with his speech. As a matter of fact, it is appropriate that he should have made such a speech. However, let us analyse the motion of the hon. member. The hon. member moves&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1193-1194" refersTo="page_0613"/>That this House takes note of the need for suitable financing for agriculture with a view to&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) combating inflation; and</li>

<li>(b) increasing production.</li>

</ol>

<p>It will not help us for the House only to take note of it. We have been taking note of it for a number of years. It will not help the hon. member and it is not going to satisfy me. I expected the hon. member to add the cherry to the cream. We should not merely take note of a situation. We should submit certain suggestions or recommendations to the hon. the Minister of Finance, the hon. the Minister of Agriculture or to the Government in general. Although we agree with the purport of the motion of the hon. member, I should like to move the following amendment thereto&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end &#x201C;and accordingly requests the Government to consider the advisability of establishing forthwith a Department of Agricultural Financing which will include, <i>inter alia,</i> the functions of the Land Bank and of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It is not our intention to belittle that what has been done by the Land Bank or the Department of Agricultural Credit up till now. As a matter of fact, we think these two bodies have achieved an enormous amount for agriculture since their establishment, in the year 1960 in the case of the Land Bank. Since 1966, when we amended the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act and established the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, both these institutions have, to my mind, done nothing but good. I do not believe they have ever done anything bad for the agricultural industry in South Africa. For that reason we have always agreed when amendments had to be effected to the legislation pertaining to these two bodies. However, a new situation is developing in South Africa to an increasing extent. During the past number of years the Land Bank has been trying to keep mortgage bonds to more or less within the R100 000 limit. Admittedly, such assistance is not to be sneezed at, but the amount will simply not be able to remain at that level. It is impossible. Neither will the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure only be able to think in terms of assisting the young farmer. I do not say they are doing this all the time, but that department will have to play an increasingly more important role to relieve the interest burden of farmers. To have a loan with the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is to my mind nothing to be ashamed of. Some people think that there is an enormous stigma attached to that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria Central should rather confine himself to matrimonial affairs. He is familiar with that kind of legislation. I would rather listen to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and the hon. member for Heilbron as far as agricultural affairs are concerned. The hon. member for Heilbron is quite right. There is not one single person who obtained a mortgage bond of R100 000 at 6% or 6&#x00BD;<i>%,</i> say, 10 years ago and who does not have to pay a rate of interest of 13&#x00BD;%&#x2014;in many cases 14&#x00BD;%&#x2014;at present. Therefore, the interest burden has increased exactly 100%. If one has been farming well and was able to pay off half the mortgage bond, it means that one&#x2019;s interest burden is still the same as the interest burden one would have had if one had borrowed the money from a private institution at that time. It is no use asking me: If industrialists and businessmen could pay this, why not also the farmers? Well, I have had differences of opinion with my own family on this matter. As businessmen and industrialists they borrowed money from private institutions, and then say: &#x201C;Yes, you farmers are fortunate. You can obtain loans from the Land Bank at 6%%, and from the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure at 5%.&#x201D; However, what those people do not bear in mind is that industrialists and businessmen are in a position to recover the money they have to pay as interest, no matter what such rates of interest are. In agriculture it is not always possible to recover that money. Those same relatives of mine, after they have started farming, admitted that I was quite right, because they could see for themselves what the position was. Personal experience has taught them that there is a vast difference between a person making an investment in industry or in the business world and the person making an investment in <span class="col_1195-1196" refersTo="page_0614"/>agriculture. For that reason it is not the idea of this side of the House&#x2014;and neither, so I believe, is it the idea of that side of the House&#x2014;to ask for a form of socialism in order that an exception could be made of agriculture and special assistance could be given to it. However, I must say that I welcome some form of socialism for the farmer, in this respect &#x2026; [Interjections.] I welcome it as long as it is going to help the farmers to become financially strong, to pay their debts with the Land Bank or the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure so that the farmer who comes next can be assisted to become financially strong, too, and to stand on his own feet. In this way one will create capitalists in South Africa by means of a small measure of socialist aid rendered to them. In this respect I do not think there could be anything wrong with this form of assistance. After all, the assistance does not remain with one person. As soon as he has paid his debts, the money is immediately used to help the next young farmer on his feet and for that reason there can be nothing wrong with this.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the motion moved by the hon. member for Heilbron does not quite satisfy us on this side of the House. I want to quote an example&#x2014;and in doing so, I want to conclude because my time in this debate has almost expired&#x2014;of what has happened recently at a settlement all of us know quite well. It is situated in the constituency of the hon. member for Kimberley North. This settlement was established years ago, in 1936. By means of State aid in terms of the old Land Settlement Act a large number of farmers were established there. Through the years all those people became prosperous. I think that the process of elimination which took place there through the years, proved that those farmers are an asset to the approximately 80 000 farmers we still have in South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, undoubtedly; I do not think they would do that. These people have experienced a problem recently, i.e. the problem of water-logged ground; there is an excess of water on their land. In this area certain steps will now have to be taken on the part of the State, on the part of the individual farmer and also on the part of, for example, an institution such as the local co-operative society. These people are dependent upon cash crops. If they do not have cash crops it is impossible for them to make a decent living in that area. Now, it is a fact that their crops have virtually been a failure and that they will have to spend a considerable amount of money during the following year in order to restore that land to its former condition. Now, the question arises: If those people were to approach private institutions to borrow money at 13&#x00BD;% or 14%, what would become of them? It is simply impossible. I also ask myself whether the State&#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Finance will be able to tell me&#x2014;is in a position to help these people at this stage, and to what extent it can offer assistance.</p>

<p>This is all very well, but one cannot sow seed and apply fertilizer to the soil if the soil is water-logged. This is no good. Special credit facilities will have to be created for those people to tide them over this period during which they will have no income, but only expenses.</p>

<p>All this case does, is to lend added strength to my argument that we need an institution such as a Department of Agricultural Financing which would be able to deal with this kind of problem irrespective of what the cost is going to be. After all, the long-term advantages this entails if we want to assist those people to be independent again, must be to the future advantage of South Africa and agriculture as a whole. For that reason we say that it will unfortunately not help anyone for this House simply to take note of this motion. I want to ask the hon. the Minister that he should once and for all consider the suggestion that a Department of Agricultural Financing be established and tell us whether he agrees with it or not. Let us reach the stage where we shall know that we have an institution, an institution <span class="col_1197-1198" refersTo="page_0615"/>which we can approach for long-term and medium-term loans, and an institution which will be able to help when disasters occur from time to time such as the one we had recently. Once we have the Agricultural Planning Board and the Department of Agricultural Planning, we would, in fact, have a development corporation for the agricultural industry in South Africa, and once we have that, I can only see a bright future lying ahead of us as far as the agricultural industry is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me to tell the hon. member for Heilbron, who introduced this motion, that we are highly appreciative of this motion. It is a great pleasure for me this afternoon to support the motion introduced by the hon. member for Heilbron. I also want to congratulate him on his very clear exposition of the present condition in which agricultural financing finds itself. I do not think he left any doubts about the matter.</p>

<p>At this stage I want to say that I do not intend covering the whole area he covered. I shall try to confine myself to a few particular aspects he mentioned. The hon. member for Newton Park said that he and his party support this motion, but on condition that something is added to it. I personally do not believe that we actually need a re-organization of the institutions which provide agricultural credit or agricultural financing. This is not our major problem. What we need, is money. The machinery exists and it is adequate enough. In 1976 agriculture finds itself before a challenge as seldom before, internationally as well as nationally. On the one hand the whole world is asking for food for its rapidly increasing population and, on the other hand, the world economy is in the throes of an inflation and, at the same time, a recession which almost borders on a depression. In order to stimulate production while at the same time containing inflation, is the dilemma of the governments of the Western world. As a result of various factors&#x2014;these were pointed out by the two previous speakers&#x2014;agriculture in the hands of the individual farmers has become an unpopular sphere of investment for the financial institutions. This is a fact; we cannot get away from it. Both the previous speakers drew attention to that fact. The reasons for it are obvious. On the one hand it is as a result of the risk attached to these investments and, on the other hand, a result of the small return. When considering the economic history of countries, we find that countries normally started with a predominantly agricultural economy and that the majority of citizens had to make a living out of agriculture and that the authorities therefore had to give serious attention to the welfare of the agricultural industry. Perhaps this constitutes the real reason for State interference in the free economy. Up till now I know of no single country in which agriculture operates without State support. The State is compelled &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. J. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>It is not socialism when the State supports an enterprise. The State is compelled to support the agricultural industry by means of various measures so that the rest of the population can be provided with sufficient food. Yet, the agricultural industry does not lend itself to nationalization or a totally socialist system. Proof of this is the extent to which the Russians made a failure of their agricultural industry.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to determine the optimum size of a farming unit. I believe that the agriculture of this country should be in the hands of financially sound individual farmers and not in the hands of large co-operative societies, trusts, or cartels. Also the hon. member for Newton Park expressed his concern about this matter this morning. In a recent report submitted to his Congress by President Ford, he said that he would endeavour to maintain the family farm. Our hon. the Minister said this afternoon he believed our agriculture should be in the hands of individual and financially sound farmers. I have already pointed out that agriculture in the hands of the individual has become an unpopular sphere of investment. But this has been the case for a long time and our farmers have realized this at an early stage. They began to realize that they should, to a very large extent, depend on their own capital and in cases where it was impossible for the authorities to grant financial assistance, they turned to the system of co-operative societies. I firmly believe that the present co-operative form of enterprise, together with the other partner, the State, has become the ideal partner of the farmer. I should like to point out briefly the role of the co-operative society as a <span class="col_1199-1200" refersTo="page_0616"/>short-term financing resource in agriculture. The agricultural co-operative society has two objectives. On the one hand, to provide means of production to its members at the lowest prices possible. The second objective is the handling of its products and to market these at the best possible prices. It is unfortunately a fact that in its endeavour to achieve this second objective, the agricultural co-operative society is being hampered by our system of control boards and its attendant price control. I do not have the time now to go into the merits of the matter; this should be dealt with in a separate debate. In view of this it is obviously imperative for the agricultural co-operative society to endeavour to achieve its first objective as efficiently as possible i.e. the provision of means of production at low prices. Now, the co-operative society has problems. Its major problem is capital. Agricultural co-operative societies granting credit to its members, need considerable working capital and as a result of inflation but also as a result of normal growth, the amount required by co-operative societies is increasing all the time.</p>

<p>I want to tell you, Sir, that in the case of a large co-operative society close to us here the outstanding members&#x2019; accounts increased by 40% during the past year, and I believe this is a tendency throughout the country because the prices of agricultural requirements increased phenomenally as a result of particularly imported inflation. For example, the price of tractors increased by 110% over a period of three years. The question is: Where do the co-operative societies get this capital from in order to finance agriculture? Let us consider for a moment the capital situation of an average co-operative society. Its share capital will amount to 1% of its total capital requirements; its reserves approximately 14% and its long-term loans with the Land Band 6%. Loans from members and members&#x2019; funds will be approximately 11%; overdrafts at commercial banks 17%; short-term financing loans with the Land Band 43%; and other creditors approximately 8%. These are the capital requirements of an average cooperative society which has to be satisfied. Own funds are cheap money. It is the cheapest money. Our aim should be&#x2014;and this should be the aim of every co-operative society&#x2014;to build up reserves. We should also guard against&#x2014;and there is talk of possibly levying a tax on co-operative societies&#x2014;not making it impossible for co-operative societies to build up their own funds. This is important. We should encourage members of co-operative societies to invest their savings with cooperative societies. We should also make it possible for them by giving them the necessary incentives. Furthermore, we should encourage members of co-operative societies to make less use of credit if this is in any way possible, or to pay cash for their requirements as far as possible. As I have said, the co-operative society is dependent upon the Land Bank for the bulk of its funds. The role played by the Land Bank in the financing of co-operative societies is extremely important. It is quite clear that the Land Bank is playing an important role in the financing of co-operative societies. One is extremely grateful for this institution, the Land Bank, and it is hard to imagine how South African agriculture could exist without the Land Bank. The hon. mover of this motion drew attention to the enormous amount the Land Bank was making available to agriculture. Attention has been drawn on cash credit loans, which amount to as much as R1 400 million this year. It is also interesting to note that, according to the report, it amounted to R1 200 million in 1974; it is an enormous increase. Just as the pressure on our co-operative societies for more credit is increasing, for more credit for their members, so the pressure on the Land Bank has increased for more funds for co-operative societies. High rates of interest is the main reason for this. Independent co-operative societies which have not made use of Agricultural Credit for years applied again. We want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance in all earnest&#x2014;while he is sitting here listening to this agricultural debate this afternoon&#x2014;that he should take good care of the Land Bank in his Budget. Investment in the Land Bank is anti-inflationary. It is anti-inflationary because this cheap money will enable our farmers, through the co-operative societies, to produce cheaply. This is what we are looking for in this time of inflation.</p>

<p>Investments with the Land Bank by control boards or co-operative societies, particularly when it can be done <i>en bloc</i> will make considerable funds available. A considerable cash flow can be obtained cheaply if we stand together and invest agricultural funds with the Land Bank. A shortage of capital in agriculture <span class="col_1201-1202" refersTo="page_0617"/>will lead to wasteful exploitation, inefficient production and inflation. We should be careful to utilize our funds correctly. I am concerned about the creation of monopolies in agriculture. I am concerned about vertical integration. I am concerned about capital used by large concerns which may lead to monopolies in agriculture. I am also concerned that, in our present system, we attach too much value to subsidies. Probably it has become necessary for us to reconsider the entire system of subsidies. I want to ask in all earnest this afternoon that we consider a subsidy such as the subsidy on white bread. I have never been able to find any justification for a subsidy on white bread. I think it is money we could save. We should give close consideration to this matter. It is estimated that the average farmer has to provide to an increasing extent for future expenses on machinery. For that reason I also want to ask in the final moments available to me that we should thoroughly consider funds for replacement, a replacement allowance, other than merely the normal wear and tear allowance on our agricultural machinery and that we should also consider special replacement allowances. If we do not do that, we are going to experience problems in agriculture in future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker &#x2026; The sound that comes from the other side of this House when I rise to speak reminds me of a kennel at feeding time when the inmates make a considerable amount of noise. I have listened, Mr. Speaker, with considerable interest to the various comments in the course of the debate in this House today. The points made by the hon. member for Malmesbury in regard to co-ops will, I believe, have general support because the co-op situation is complicated at the moment and the question of finance to them is most difficult. When he asks for a review of the attitude towards subsidization of the various products, I agree with him once more, although perhaps my attitude would be to approach the matter from a different angle, certainly when he talks about the subsidy for white bread. On this point, I agree with him, but when it comes to the subsidy on bread as such, and I am talking about nutritious brown bread, I think the hon. member must bear in mind that there are hundreds of thousands of poor people in this world and in this country who should be enabled to purchase this type of bread cheaply. If he specifically refers to white bread, then I would agree with him. I have listened, too, to the hon. member for Heilbron, who moved his motion dealing specifically with agricultural credit, the Department of Agricultural Credit and the Land Bank, and I also agree with him as does the member for Newton Park, when the people in agriculture are faced with interest payments at the rate of 12,13%, it makes it absolutely impossible for any farmer to operate. It is absolutely unrealistic in these days to expect this sort of interest rate to be paid. I am glad he also included the small industrialist and the house-owner, because they are feeling it just as much.</p>

<p>I want to approach this matter from a slightly different angle. The motion refers to suitable financing for agriculture with a view to combating inflation and promoting increased production. I think it is correct that we should look at the way we are spending our money at the moment, particularly the way in which the Department is spending its money because the question is whether this money is being well spent and whether it is a worthwhile investment. We in these benches would like to express our approval of the tremendous work being carried out by the various sections in the Department of Agriculture. We of course do not approve of the hon. the Minister himself, but this is a different matter. Perhaps we would approve of him as a farmer, but not as a Minister, although there have possibly been worse Ministers. We do not approve of any of his policies. As far as his department is concerned we consider this to be a very good department indeed. I am not being as effusive as the hon. member for Bryanston, who believes that he is a very good Minister. In spite of the hon. the Minister and his Government the department is doing some very fine work indeed. We have heard a great deal of discussion in this House today on the important role of agriculture in the economy and that if it is to receive the necessary financial stimulation, every cent of the available funds must be spent in the most effective way possible.</p>

<p>I would like to draw the attention of this House to the splendid work being done by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services in the field of agricultural research. Certainly, if money is made available, this is a field which brings considerable reward and constitutes <span class="col_1203-1204" refersTo="page_0618"/>a very fine long-term investment. Examining the work of the department&#x2019;s research team, it is most interesting to see what sort of matters are being examined. There is, amongst other things, the improvement of various field crops, such as wheat cultivars, and this has been of immeasurable benefit to South Africa. I found it tremendously interesting when driving through the Eastern Free State a few months ago, to see the huge area of arable land which is now under wheat. One only has to cast one&#x2019;s mind back into history, to the disastrous results of the attempts of the British settlers to grow wheat when they arrived in the Eastern Cape in 1820. We have come a long way and we have to understand just how far research has brought us and what it has meant to South Africa. I was interested to read the other day of a successful experiment in dry land wheat farming carried out in the bushveld areas of the north-western Transvaal. It apparently works very well, admittedly in a season when more rain than usual fell, but there seems to be considerable confidence that this could well work out successfully even in a year with a smaller rainfall. On the whole, research is having tremendous benefits for South Africa. I was also interested to see that research was producing gem squashes, &#x201C;lemoenpampoentjies&#x201D;, that do not yellow for up to three months. Last year, when I mentioned to the hon. the Minister that gem squashes were being retailed in Pretoria at a mark-up of approximately 600%, one of his excuses was that gem squashes which had turned yellow were virtually unsaleable to the housewife. The Minister&#x2019;s own department is now depriving him of the use of that excuse in future and he will have to think of a new excuse when he defends his marketing policy in future.</p>

<p>Talking of marketing, I believe that it is important that we should realize that if money is going to be spent well on agriculture in South Africa, we will have to produce a better marketing system, and I am pleased to hear on the grape-vine that the report on marketing is, at last, likely to appear before us. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us when. I asked the hon. the Minister a year or so ago whether it would not be possible for the commission at that stage to produce an interim report, because I believe that the question of marketing and the resultant effect on food prices in South Africa was so serious that it warranted an interim report. However we hope that the commission has come up with several suggestions and that the hon. the Minister will act very fast on those suggestions, because the situation is very serious indeed at the moment. I do not believe that our marketing system is good, because I believe that money is being wasted and that there is a proliferation of waste in the various marketing organizations which are at present in existence. I think that there are cheaper and better short-cuts.</p>

<p>Going back to the subject of research, I believe that this sort of expenditure is vital and that in any list of priorities, research expenditure is vital. I must urge the hon. the Minister that even in these inflationary times, cut-backs on research must be avoided. If we are to fight inflation by the production of cheaper and better foodstuffs, research must in fact be increased to give the farmer the opportunity and assistance to produce more and to increase his productivity. There are other ways in which research helps too, for instance in the field of plant protection against pests and the protection of animals against disease of one sort or another. This is of course a field which requires constant attention. I found it very interesting indeed that the integration of chemical and biological research and biological measures reduce the cost of pest control by a considerable degree. This is of course another blow in the fight against inflation, viz. first the anticipation of and then the solution of the problem. When it comes to the practical use of the results of research, I believe that the division of agricultural Production and Economics has a tremendously important role to play. I will again say that this is money well spent. I followed with a great deal of interest the activities of this division, for example the advice it makes available on field husbandry, horticulture and animal husbandry. This advice must be of immense benefit to the general efficiency of our farmers. The educative role played by the section dealing with information and training and the work done by regional economists in agricultural colleges, must inevitably lead to an improvement of farming standards and be of benefit to the whole country. Even the information gleaned from the mail-in record section, which I am not certain receives as much attention as it should, must be used to help farmers in the continual battle to keep prices low enough to suit the consumer&#x2019;s pocket and to keep them within <span class="col_1205-1206" refersTo="page_0619"/>reason. My point is that money spent by the department at present, is money well spent. The hon. the Minister must ensure that this continues to enable our farmers to improve productivity which, in turn, will keep inflation at bay. One must not of course forget the tremendous role being played by the Department of Water Affairs. Money spent on irrigation systems, resulting in increased productivity, is never wasted. It is money that is being spent to the benefit of South Africa.</p>

<p>My hon. colleague from Bryanston spoke at considerable length about the question of soil erosion. I do not think anyone can quarrel with the necessity of spending money on stopping soil erosion. The hon. the Minister seems to think that what the hon. member for Bryanston put forward is not such a problem, but one only has to look at our rivers to see the vast quantities of silt that are carried down every year and to realize that there is no room for complacency at all in this direction. I think this speaks for itself.</p>

<p>I support the hon. member for Bryanston when he says that the Government must do far more than it is doing at present in this direction. I know it is doing a very good job as far as things go, but I believe that more has to be done, and I agree that our list of priorities must ensure expenditure of every cent possible to preserve that which is virtually irreplaceable&#x2014;and that is our soil.</p>

<p>Looking at the money spent by the Department of Agriculture and by the Department of Water Affairs, the tremendous dedication and the ability of thousands of people in South Africa directed towards improving productivity and combating inflation in the agricultural industry, I think we must all agree that South Africa can be proud of what has been achieved. However, I am confident that the hon. the Minister is not going to become complacent, that he will continue to do his best and that the necessary finance will be found.</p>

<p>I have every respect for the hon. the Minister when it comes to the beautiful potatoes he grows. I saw a wonderful picture of the hon. the Minister with some of his own produce and it looked very impressive indeed. However, I would quarrel with some of his attitudes as a Minister, although I do not want to quarrel with him as an individual now. I want to quarrel with the whole Government, represented by the hon. the Minister in this debate, because we in these benches believe that the geographical area of southern Africa should be seen as a whole from the agricultural point of view &#x2026;</p>

<p>Somebody there is begging the question and making a very clever remark. Would he agree with the contention that it should be seen as a geographical whole or not? That hon. member has no difficulty with that. Obviously all the difficulties he has had to contend with over the past couple of years have been in other directions.</p>

<p>We believe &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member&#x2019;s comment that we have them now should be seen in the context of an ability to deal with situations. We can make effective use of what we have. It is obvious that the party on my right is quite unable to do anything with any of the material it has and is quite ineffective in using it.</p>

<p>I want to get back to the debate in hand, however, and forget about these extraneous matters. I would just like to repeat the point that I was making, viz. that we in these benches believe that the geographical area of southern Africa should be seen as a whole from the agricultural point of view. We further believe that effective stimulation of the agricultural industry should be applied to the whole geographical area within our present borders. We also believe that the services available to farmers in the Republic should be available to all farmers. It is so wasteful that services rendered to White farmers should have to be rendered to Black farmers by another department, the Department of Bantu Administration. In their own way they are doing a very splendid job and a very good job, but again I believe it is wasteful when one proliferates bureaucracy, when one has to have two departments doing the same job in the same geographical area. This, of course, is getting worse as we go along. As far as the Transkei, KwaZulu, Bophuthatswana and Gazankulu are concerned we have a proliferation of departments of agriculture throughout the whole geographical area of southern Africa, and this could only be wasteful.</p>

<p><span class="col_1207-1208" refersTo="page_0620"/>In our opinion, the only intelligent thing would be to avoid duplication of administrative operations and the resultant unnecessary duplication of costs, because there is a duplication of costs. It would be intelligent to operate all agricultural services for the country as one co-ordinated operation. I am aware that a considerable cross-fertilization of ideas takes place, and that there is co-operation, but inevitably there is inflationary waste because of duplication.</p>

<p>We not only believe in one economic policy for the whole of South Africa, but also in only one agricultural policy for the whole of the country. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me when I say that any farmer can tell one that, however good conservation methods on his own farm or in his own area may be, his solutions will not always be completely efficacious unless his neighbours also pay some attention to the problem and pull their weight.</p>

<p>One sees this in so many of our rivers, that originate outside our territorial borders and are already silt-laden when they get to our country. One sees this in so many areas. One sees it particularly in many of our Bantu homelands, where there are too many people on the land, where land is overgrazed and where a considerable amount of soil erosion is taking place. The rivers that flow through those areas are becoming silt-laden in those areas. This has an effect on the whole of the rest of South Africa. One cannot see these as individual little areas. Look at the geographical make-up of KwaZulu, for instance, where rivers flow through one area into another area and out again to another area. I believe it is of vital importance that one should have coordination and that money should not be wasted. One must have co-ordination, and this is best achieved by one department of agriculture.</p>

<p>I now wish to proceed to another point, and that is the question of education. I specifically want to talk about Black education in agriculture, and I am not referring only to the education of Black people within the homelands. I am referring to Black farm labour without which our farms could not operate. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister, and to members on that side of the House, that it is vitally necessary that money be spent on the education of Black people who are likely to be involved in farm labour. It has often been said to me by members of the other side of the House, and people outside the House, that much Black farm labour is only worth what is paid for it today. I believe that that is its worth simply and only because it is unskilled, untrained and uneducated labour. Such labour is perforce expensive labour. It makes it more difficult for the farmer to produce things cheaply. I believe it would yield us immense rewards in South Africa if we were prepared to invest our money in the education of our farm labour. I am not only referring to the White farmer himself, but also to the Black labourer. I do not think that enough is being done. I believe there are individual farmers who do a very fine job of education of labour, but unless this comes from the Government as a policy operation on a tremendous scale, our farmers are going to suffer because they will have to contend with unskilled labour which is expensive labour.</p>

<p>I would commend this idea of the hon. the Minister, because I think it is an important one. I would, incidentally, fault this Government on one other aspect of policy which affects the farmer to a great degree.</p>

<p>It may surprise hon. members, but I do have many farmer friends and supporters &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Boksburg, that rural constituency of Boksburg, of course knows all about farming. Many of the farm labour problems that are being experienced by farmers at the moment, are the direct result of Government policy, in that Black farm labourers know that if they remain farm labourers living in a White area, their children will find it very difficult indeed ever to go to an industrialized area in so-called White South Africa and get a job there. They will be restricted to that farming area to a large degree. Many Black labourers on farms are now going to the homelands to ensure that their children will have the opportunity of going to the cities and getting well-paid jobs. A lot of the problems farmers are experiencing in this field of farm labour are directly as the result of that. I believe that money is not being well spent on that sort of policy put forward by the hon. the Minister and his colleagues and this Government.</p>

<p>I listened to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Newton Park with fairly mixed feelings. I do not really think that it is necessary to have a Department of Agricultural Finance. I am always against the proliferation <span class="col_1209-1210" refersTo="page_0621"/>of bureaucracy, and I tend to think that the amendment moved by the hon. member would involve just so many more civil servants. I think at the moment the Department of Agricultural Credit, a the Land Bank and the other organizations which finance farmers are doing a reasonable job. I do not entirely agree with the hon. member for Heilbron when he says he knows of no cases at all which on merit have been turned down by the Land Bank. I think there are many meritorious cases which have been put forward and which have been turned down for reasons which I will not enumerate at this time, but of which I think many of us on this side of the House are very suspicious.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to make use of this opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for Heilbron on the motion he proposed and on the way in which he explained it to this House. The hon. member for Orange Grove joined the debate and praised the hon. the Minister of Agriculture for his research policy in the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. I found it very interesting that the development of gem squashes in particular had impressed him tremendously. Now one is inclined to come to the conclusion that this would be the reason why there are so many political gem squashes present in this House nowadays. In any case, the hon. member regarded this as money well spent on agriculture. The hon. member was further concerned about the fact that we do not have a uniform agricultural policy in South Africa. He wants South Africa to be seen as a whole and he wants us to have one Department of Agriculture which would serve the whole of South Africa, and I assume the homelands as well. This is typical of the arguments of those hon. members, because they do not know the mentality of the Bantu. They are unfamiliar with the type of farming he practises, the type of farming which is still at a developing stage. One has to make special provision for their farming and their agricultural circumstances under a special department, namely the Department of Bantu Administration. As he rightly said, they are making a good job of it, and I think the hon. member should leave them alone so that they can make a good job of it. It is not practicable to incorporate them under the same department. I just want to add that this surely does not mean that the Department of Bantu Administration never has any contact with the various agricultural departments. I think there is proper contact to help them in this respect. The hon. member also mentioned agricultural training. This is probably a very important facet to encourage productivity and to combat inflation by doing so. It is in keeping with this motion. I also want to tell the hon. member in this regard that large amounts are spent by the Department of Bantu Administration to establish agricultural training centres where Bantu can be trained, for instance to handle the expensive machinery which is used in agriculture today. In the Cape Province we already have such an organization, Komarie, where Coloured agricultural workers are trained.</p>

<p>But I would like to come to the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park. I find it interesting that the hon. member moved an amendment at this stage in which he asks for the establishment of a Department of Agricultural Financing. But the hon. member was very vague about this big idea of his. He did not explain to us how this department should function or where it should find its capital. Nor did he tell us, in advocating this proposal, in which respect he feels that there cannot be effective action in certain financing areas with the present financing institutions which we have. In other words, I do not see the need for it. He did not make out a case to me for the establishment of such a department. But we should look at the different areas of financing. We have quite a number of financing levels. Financing in South Africa with its special agricultural circumstances is extremely specialized. The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is a department which undertakes specialized financing for agriculture under particular circumstances, because, firstly, it finances the farmer who wants to enter into agriculture, at subsidized interest rates. But very important is the fact that it undertakes specialized financing in respect of emergencies such as we had during the droughts. The example of the stock reduction scheme which cost millions of rands was mentioned here today. There are also certain emergencies concerning flood damage, etc. In other words, there are special circumstances under which this capital is applied at special subsidized interest rates. There is for instance the conservation of the soil in South Africa, soil conservation. This is specialized financing. <span class="col_1211-1212" refersTo="page_0622"/>For that reason I think we should leave this type of financing with the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure.</p>

<p>But another very important principle is involved, namely that this type of financing can only be done by the Government. This is expensive financing and it is risky financing and it can only be the function of the Government and not of private financing institutions or even of a semi-Government financing institution like the Land Bank. They cannot do it; it is a function of the Government. But I think the hon. member&#x2019;s problem is that he feels there is not proper coordination between the different forms of financing. I want to give him the reassurance that there is in fact co-ordination in this field. If the hon. member wants to acquaint himself with the facts, he will remember that there was a recommendation in the third report of the Du Plessis Commission that an advisory coordinating council for agricultural credit should be created for the Minister of Agriculture. This council was introduced two or three years ago and it is proceeding with its functions and drawing up a programme for the very purpose of establishing co-ordination between all the financial institutions which are concerned with agriculture. The council exists of the Department of Agricultural Credit, which takes the lead. It is presided over by the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Board. He draws up the agenda. The Reserve Bank is also represented on the council, for a very special purpose. The purpose of this is to bring these institutions together so that the economic and monetary position in South Africa can be determined properly. The Land Bank itself, a very important financier of agriculture, is represented on this coordinating committee. Representatives of the commercial banks of South Africa also serve on it. Finally, its members include representatives of the S.A. Agricultural Union, in this particular case representatives of agricultural co-operatives. This co-ordinating committee meets time to time to discuss the financing needs in South Africa under the particular circumstances which prevail at that stage. From that committee the agricultural financing policy can then be conveyed to the Minister of Finance and to the Minister of Agriculture, so that financing can be done effectively in South Africa and so that it can contribute to the productivity of agriculture and the combating of inflation. But there are specific factors which have a bearing on financing. There are very specific factors which play an important part in determining a financing policy. In the first instance we have an agricultural policy in South Africa which is geared to vertical expansion. In other words, the object is to intensify agricultural production, which naturally leads to capital intensiveness. Capital intensiveness again involves greater risk. These are factors which should be considered very seriously. The other aspect which we should keep in mind when we are dealing with agricultural financing, is the policy which our Department of Agricultural Technical Services adopts concerning optimal soil utilization. This basically means three things: Firstly, that one should farm in harmony with nature; secondly, that one should not destroy the natural agricultural resources in the process; and, thirdly, that one should be able to farm economically in South Africa on these units. For that reason it is important that one should take the different aspects into consideration when one undertakes agricultural financing.</p>

<p>The Department of Agricultural Credit concentrates on the rehabilitation of farmers and on assistance to disaster-stricken areas. The Land Bank, which to my mind, and also according to the hon. member for Heilbron, is the most important financing institution in South Africa, also works selectively. It tries to adapt itself from time to time to the changes in the agricultural structure in South Africa. I want to allege that the Land Bank cannot undertake short-term and production financing effectively, unless it has the agricultural co-operatives as its partners in this process. Agricultural co-operatives in South Africa are directly concerned with the financial position, the production method and the particular farming activity of every farmer. Because the Land Bank finances the purchase of production means, like fertilizer, seed, etc., and because the co-operatives in turn have to recover the debt&#x2014;the law gives them the right of pledge, the preferential right to those claims&#x2014;it is their function to see to it that the capital is applied as effectively as possible. A very interesting development recently took place in the co-operative world. The cooperatives entered the field of agricultural guidance. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services now recognizes the cooperatives as partners and as institutions which <span class="col_1213-1214" refersTo="page_0623"/>can give guidance to the South African farmer on a rational basis.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>It is an extension of their activities. Where it is necessary to apply the funds effectively in the production process, the Land Bank can expect the co-operatives to invest their production means correctly and the question of intensiveness in agricultural production to be acknowledged.</p>

<p>We have one particular basic problem in the vertical development of agriculture. If we wish to increase production, we will have to invest more and more capital in mechanization. To replace machinery under inflationary circumstances in South Africa has become nearly impossible. The prices of tractors and agricultural machinery have increased tremendously during the past year. I want to point this out as one of the obstacles in agricultural financing. Last year the Land Bank made medium-term financing easier and more liquid by means of legislation, by providing that the farmer now only has to sign a promissory note. Therefore it proceeds from the standpoint that if the farmer&#x2019;s balance sheet is sound and he has a good repayment ability, he could probably qualify for this kind of financing under certain conditions.</p>

<p>My request to the hon. the Minister is that we should supply sufficient capital to the Land Bank so that the process of mechanization can take place more rapidly and can meet the enormous needs which are continuously developing. Here once again we have the co-operatives as partners of the Land Bank to see to it that the funds are applied correctly in the right production process. This capital should be applied correctly in co-operation with the Department of Agricultural Technical Services.</p>

<p>In conclusion: I think we have reached a particular stage in agricultural financing. I do not want to ignore the important service rendered by the commercial banks and the private sector in agricultural financing. In fact, I think they play an important role today, in spite of the enormously high interest rates. We have the situation that due to the intensifying of agricultural production in South Africa, agricultural financing is becoming too risky for these people. One has the position that the banks supply short-term financing to the farmers. The farmers may experience disastrous circumstances, and then the short-term financing becomes medium-term financing, and long-term financing if need be. This makes the private financing institutions, such as banks, hesitant to invest their money in agricultural production in the form of short-term financing. Therefore we shall have to expand by means of the Land Bank and the agricultural co-operatives to be able to meet this increasing need in future.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I agree with much that the hon. member for Bethal said, and I hope that I shall be able to enlarge on a few of the things he said during the course of my speech. I do not believe that there is much difference between what the hon. member said and what the hon. member for Newton Park said. While the hon. member was speaking, I wondered whether he would not concede, as a point for discussion, that the work of the department could be done far more efficiently if a department for the financing of the agricultural sector were to be established. The question boils down to one thing, and the hon. member for Malmesbury put it to us very clearly: How does the farmer obtain and retain his independence in spite of the present rates of interest? This is the question: How is it possible for anybody to farm these days with the rate of interest that has to be paid? There should be assistance from the State so that the farmer can develop his own capital by means of his farming operations, which should then be retained within the closed field of agriculture. If we cannot obtain the capital to assist the farmer in one way or another, the burden will be placed on the State to pay out subsidies to the consumer on a large scale. At the present rates of interest it is impossible for us in South Africa to produce food at a price which the consumer can afford. It is absolutely impossible. Therefore the motion which is before the House is in the very best interests of the agricultural industry and of the population as a whole.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It comes down to the problem of the capital structure of agriculture. Earlier on today the hon. the Minister mentioned the fact that big companies, e.g. Anglo American, who had gone into agriculture on a large scale, were now pulling out. The financing of <span class="col_1215-1216" refersTo="page_0624"/>agriculture by big companies is a very important factor. Not only is financing by big companies important, but also financing by people with a lot of money, people who earned their money outside agriculture. I wonder whether we have considered enough what is, to my mind, one of the most inflationary factors in the financing of agriculture, viz. people who have money earned outside agriculture and who invested part of their money in agriculture for the tax benefit they derived from losses on agriculture, set off against their income from other sources. Anybody who knows anything, for instance about the production of vegetables, will know&#x2014;I have been concerned with that for years and remember the finding of the SAPD, the co-operative which was designed to bring all farmers together to ensure that vegetables would be produced and marketed in a rational manner, etc., to help the farming community&#x2014;that it failed completely. The housewife in this country today eats vegetables at the expense of farmers who go broke or who are losing money by producing vegetables. I do not think that we have paid enough attention to people who can afford to lose money in agriculture because they can offset losses against something else which is outside of the agricultural sphere.</p>

<p>I believe that this is one of the problems which we shall have to look at, because at a rate of 15% interest one simply cannot produce food at a figure the housewife can afford. It is impossible, and one wonders whether we are going to reach a stage where there will be a closed capital pool inside agriculture, incorporating all the bodies concerned with agriculture, which will perhaps have to be supplemented by the department or by the State. However, we shall have to isolate the capital market, as far as agriculture is concerned, from the normal market rate of interest. That is the problem the hon. the Minister has got. How is he going to do this? We have the Land Bank today, which puts money in at a low rate of interest, and we have Agricultural Credit doing so at an even lower rate of interest. One of the problems, however, is that both those departments are being used today as rescue operations. There is the case of the perfectly ordinary farmer, a man who is economically sound, who may need money to expand because he has a bad harvest. This man has to find money immediately to carry him over the period of the next few years. As the hon. member for Bethal quite rightly said, short-term money suddenly becomes long-term money, and the perfectly ordinary farmer, who has a sound capital base, may have to go into debt at the rate of 12% and 14%, and this may render him no longer capitally sound. I do not think we have yet reached that plane of thought that we are going to have to reach, where the influence of the State, and the amount of money made available to farming, becomes much greater and goes beyond what I regard as rescue operations by Agricultural Credit, and to an increasing extent today by the Land Bank. I think that we are going to have to look at this very seriously indeed, because, as the hon. member for Heilbron mentioned there is a distortion in the capital market. The whole business of financing agriculture is totally distorted. The banks and ordinary private investors simply cannot afford to support agriculture by loans and this kind of thing, because inflation simply makes it impossible to pay off the ordinary commercial loans which have been undertaken by farmers. This has made farming not only a bad risk, but an almost impossible risk. The problem is that it destroys confidence in the whole of the farming operation as a business risk. I think the question raised by the hon. member for Newton Park about a department of agricultural financing is, one we are going to have to consider. I would welcome an assurance from the hon. the Minister that he will at least give serious consideration to this. Perhaps some kind of investigation could be undertaken.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I think it must come under the Minister of Agriculture, because, with all due respect to the hon. the Minister of Finance, at the head of affairs one needs a farmer who understands the particular concerns and problems visited upon farmers from time to time. One of the problems, of course&#x2014;and we had the question this morning&#x2014;is why the price of agricultural land is getting higher all the time. It is because people are buying it as a hedge against inflation. Another problem is that so much big money from outside farming is going into <span class="col_1217-1218" refersTo="page_0625"/>farming as a hedge against inflation. As I have said before, people are not particularly concerned with the actual return they get on their money. They invest it for the good name they get. One must confess that people living on farms have a very reasonable way of life. It is a wonderful way of life, and at the same time they can invest as a hedge against inflation to protect the price of their money.</p>

<p>One of the bulwarks of capitalism is landholding, but the ordinary independent small landholder today stands in very great danger of disappearing from the scene. I think we have to take the most serious cognizance of this fact. We had a debate on it only this morning. The hon. member for Newton Park was talking about the presence of White farmers on the land being the best guarantee of security for White civilization, the Black man and everybody else here in South Africa. I think we must have a very good look at the financing of this industry. The hon. member&#x2019;s motion does read that there should be suitable financing to increase production. The hon. member for Orange Grove mentioned research. I heard the other day that where one has a grain crop, which produces a certain amount of protein for human consumption, there is thrown away, in the leaves and stalks of that particular crop, seven times the crop&#x2019;s protein. This protein would be available if it could be recovered by technical processes. Seven times as much is thrown away in the stalks and leaves of the plant, as is available for use in the grain. These are the things we are going to have to take very serious cognizance of. I have raised the question of fattening cattle before, and want to know how long we can continue fattening cattle by feeding them grain when we have a population which is expanding and making demands on that very same source of grain. How long is red meat still going to be even a proposition for us here, and not only here but all over the world? We have spoken a lot about the agricultural planning council and the use of water. Recently there was a survey conducted in my constituency about whether one should plant timber or sugar. Which is of maximum benefit to the country&#x2014;with the use of water now&#x2014;timber or sugar, sugar which is an export crop, or timber which saves on imports. It was calculated that to plant timber is nine times more advantageous to the local economy of our country than to plant sugar. This is the type of problem one has to face in the agricultural industry, and I think it requires closer investigation, closer planning and detailed attention.</p>

<p>I welcome the chance to take part in a debate like this. One has so very few minutes in which to take part, but I welcome the chance to do so. I would like to commend the hon. member for Heilbron for introducing the motion. I also commend to the hon. the Minister the amendment which has been put forward by the hon. member for Newton Park.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest and very carefully to the speeches we heard this afternoon during this very important debate, and I must say that I found them very interesting. I want to extend my heartiest congratulations at once to the hon. member for Heilbron, who moved this important motion, not only on the motion but also on the way in which he moved it, especially with regard to the necessity of suitable financing, aimed at combating inflation and at the same time increasing production. The hon. members who participated in this debate will not take it amiss of me if I am unable to refer to everyone individually, although I nevertheless hope to be able to deal with their respective contributions here and there. I was really impressed by the standard of this debate. It is certainly not necessary for me to talk about the importance of the agricultural industry here this afternoon, because I think that this is generally accepted. However, I should just like to say that the agricultural industry is the largest employer of labour in the country. It is by far the largest provider of employment of all the sectors of South Africa. Another important criterion of an industry is whether it earns foreign exchange. The agricultural industry is one of our major earners of foreign exchange and it will continue to be so to an increasing extent. One must also look at the product&#x2014;food&#x2014;which is being made available to the public here. It is absolutely essential for man&#x2019;s survival. Therefore I want to raise an important point today, and I want to put the case very clearly so that everyone may know how I feel about it. I regard the agricultural industry, seen as a whole, as the most important single industry in the Republic. It is the most important industry in the economy. This is my approach in the discussion of an important motion like this <span class="col_1219-1220" refersTo="page_0626"/>one. The development of agriculture has a very long and honourable history in South Africa. The financing of the industry was undertaken on a reasonably broad basis in earlier years, but as the need for an organized and specially adapted system of financing at a reasonable rate of interest revealed itself more and more in the farming industry over the years, the demand for financing through the Land Bank and the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure increased systematically.</p>

<p>I want to come at once to the amendment moved by my friend the hon. member for Newton Park. In all the years that I have been in this Parliament, the hon. member for Newton Park has moved similar amendments.</p>

<p>For years he has been advocating a separate Department of Agricultural Financing. He does not, however, always give the same reasons for his proposal. This time he emphasized the matter of the settlers near Kimberley who had suffered losses because of the flood-waters. I can assure the hon. member that we shall look after those good people&#x2014;and also after others who have suffered losses as a result of floods or other disasters&#x2014;as this Government has always done. There will be money available for this. In my opinion, however, this does not justify this amendment. The hon. member said that it was not enough to say &#x201C;this House takes note&#x201D;, which is the wording of the motion. I must say that I find it very difficult to understand that argument. Here is the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, here am I, and there is the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, other Ministers and members of this House. When a motion such as this is moved, we do take note, but we do not simply leave the matter at that. A motion such as this is too important simply to be discussed here and then forgotten. Of course we shall take a motion like this further. I therefore do not believe that this is an argument which justifies an amendment of this type. The vital question to me is why the hon. member for Newton Park now wants to take a retrogressive step. He actually wants to go back 64 years, because he now wants to return to the system which we had prior to the establishment of the Land Bank. He wants to go back to the years prior to 1912. There was such a department at that time. The financing which is now undertaken by the Land Bank was in fact a function of a Government Department at that time. Sometimes our ancestors have more wisdom than we do.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that goes for the hon. member as well; not only for us. My hon. friend must not think that he has the monopoly when it comes to wisdom. In any event, our ancestors deemed it fit to establish an institution&#x2014;a State Corporation, a Land Bank&#x2014;and this was one of the most important decisions which they probably could have taken as far as the advancement of the agricultural industry in this country was concerned.</p>

<p>For a few moments I should like to concentrate on the Land Bank, this very important State Corporation, because in my opinion this is where the very crux of the dialogue on agricultural financing is to be found. In a private initiative economy such as ours, any farmer is free to obtain his capital requirements wherever he may think fit. I want to agree with what some hon. members have said&#x2014;I am thinking here specifically of the hon. member for Bethal&#x2014;when they referred to the important role played by commercial banks and certain other financial institutions. By far the most important institution in this respect is, of course, the Land Bank.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now I just want to refer very briefly to the short, clear speech by the hon. member for Mooi River. I doubt very much whether the solution to the very important issue raised here today, i.e. the financing of farming in South Africa on a reasonable basis and on a sufficiently large scale, can really be found by trying to isolate the whole agricultural activity, in particular the capital market. I think the economic history of the world shows that by <span class="col_1221-1222" refersTo="page_0627"/>trying to isolate certain sectors from the broad trends of the economy as a whole, in fact causes more distortion than any possible benefits. I think that what the hon. member was obviously emphasizing was that perhaps in that way one would get a greater concentration of attention on these problems. However, let me say at once that the House should have no illusions about the seriousness with which the Government views this matter and the attention being given to it. I want to assure the hon. member for Mooi River and others that the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture&#x2014;in the persons of my hon. colleague and I&#x2014;have a very close working arrangement as far as these issues are concerned, very close indeed. I do not think it could be better, and I am very pleased that that is so. This close working arrangement will certainly continue while I have the honour to occupy my present position and, I know, while he occupies the position he does with such distinction.</p>

<p>*At the time of its establishment in 1912 and for several decades after that, the Land Bank was entirely dependent on Parliamentary appropriation for its capital. In the nature of things adequate funds could often not be made available and this was one of the major problems. For that reason, amongst others, the Land Bank was established in 1912. Originally the Land Bank could not obtain sufficient funds in this way, i.e. through vast Parliamentary appropriation of capital. Then serious consideration was given to the question of how an improvement could be effected. The turning point actually came in 1959, because in 1959 the Land Bank Act was amended and the Land Bank was empowered to raise money for its activities by means of bond issues on the capital market. This was a particularly important decision. In the same year&#x2014;in 1959&#x2014;the Land Bank drew R30 million in new capital with its first bond issue which enabled it to grant no less than 7 657 long-term loans totalling R63 million to individual farmers in that year alone, as compared to the previous highest amount of only R10 million in the previous year. Since 1959 the Land Bank has raised a total amount of more than R1 000 million by means of bond issues on the open market and R446 million of this is still in use today. If this specialized, efficient institution, the Land Bank, with its highly qualified staff which has gained much experience over the years in this sphere, had not been established, would a Government Department have been able to make capital available to farmers on a scale approaching anything like this? This would been impossible. A Government Department cannot do bond issues on the scale on which the Land Bank is doing it at present. I think one should keep this in mind.</p>

<p>I do not want to bore hon. members with too many figures and I have only a few more minutes available&#x2014;my friend, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture will also participate in this debate&#x2014;but I want to quote a few more figures nevertheless. In 1960 the Land Bank made available R35 million in the form of long-term loans and in 1975, fifteen years later, it made available R77 million. What is the position in respect of medium-term loans? As the hon. member for Bethal rightly said, this is a very recent development in methods of financing and what we have done in the last few years in this sphere, is also very important. In 1960 medium-term loans to the amount of R9 million were granted and in 1975, R17 million. Now we come to the short-term loans which in the nature of things, are very important. In 1960 short-term loans to the amount of R132 million were granted from all applications received. In 1975, 15 years later, R1 558 million was granted. This is truly something which we should keep in mind. Over a period of 15 years short-term loans have increased from, say, R130 million to almost R1 600 million. If one takes all loans, excluding loans to co-operative societies, one finds that in 1960 loans totalling R176 million was granted and in 1975 loans totalling R1 652 million. I ask once again: Can one conceive of any other body or institution which can cope with financing on this scale at present?</p>

<p>There are a few other matters on which I also want to touch. I am very pleased that the hon. member for Malmesbury made it very <span class="col_1223-1224" refersTo="page_0628"/>clear today what a very important role the co-operative societies were playing as sources of finance for farmers in their activities. As far as the Land Bank is concerned, during 1960 it received applications for long-term loans to the amount of R672 000 from co-operative societies and control boards of which R631 000 was granted. In 1975 these applications amounted to almost R22 million of which approximately R16 million was granted&#x2014;as against approximately R600 000 of 15 years earlier. One could continue to supply all these figures, but I do not want to say too much about this.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to the question of rates of interest, because this is very important. This is a matter on which the hon. member for Mooi River also touched amongst other things. In past years, the Government has made appropriations from the Loan Votes to the Land Bank&#x2019;s capital funds at very low rates of interest for the very purpose of enabling the Bank to maintain its normal conservative rate of interest in the financing of agriculture, in spite of the upward trend we have been experiencing in past years, and, especially in the past two years, in the rate of interest pattern. Whereas the bank rate was increased in January 1974, the Land Bank did not increase its interest on loans to farmers. Only after that, when there were increases in the bank rate in August 1974 and again in August 1975, the Land Bank had to make certain adjustments. Hon. members will know what the rate of interest on commercial loans is today. The Land Bank&#x2019;s rate of interest on short-term loans to agricultural co-operative societies and control boards is 8,5% per annum at present, while the rate of interest on short-term and medium-term loans to individual farmers is 8% per annum.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say that, in my opinion, the South African farmer does not have a better friend than the Land Bank which is a State institution. I think that the few facts which I have mentioned here, prove this. Let me just say that the Government, the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and I myself will continue to do everything possible to look after the interests of our farming community at all times, because we realize the importance of this matter.</p>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was very nice to see the hon. the Minister of Finance take part in this debate. Now I have an idea why the hon. Minister did not take part in the Durban North by-election. He probably has ideas of fighting a farming seat now. Who knows, he may be the next member for Vryheid or Zululand.</p>

<p>I do not understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s logic when, referring to the institution proposed by the hon. member for Newton Park, he said it was rejected in 1912 and that our forefathers therefore showed a great deal more wisdom than we did. Conditions then were certainly not the same as conditions now. Such an institution may not have been suitable then, but we consider it suitable now. The S.A. Agricultural Union has also asked for it on subsequent occasions.</p>

<p>We agree that the finance of agriculture should be as cheap as possible. There can be no doubt about that and I am sure no one would wish to argue the case. In this regard we should like to point out that the 2&#x00BD;% subsidy that was granted on loans made by recognized financial institutions, is no longer effective today. Those interest subsidies which were granted on loans that carried an interest of say, 8&#x00BD;<i>%</i> or 9%, today apply to loans carrying an interest of 14% to 15%. We should like to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to consider the possibility of raising this figure. At the same time, if this figure were to be raised, I should like to ask whether some thought can be given to the possibility of stopping these institutions from also raising their interest rates immediately.</p>

<p>I should like to point out that there are other farmers beside the farmers involved in borrowing these large loans. To these other farmers the matter of financing is perhaps not a first consideration. There are many other factors that have caused the costs of production in farming to be raised, factors to which the Government could attend. I should like to <span class="col_1225-1226" refersTo="page_0629"/>point out that these factors also contribute to higher production costs. Let me just mention a few of these factors in passing. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture has a unique outlook on the solving of the problems of higher production costs. I should like to quote from a speech he made at Overvaal when he spoke of higher production costs. On the occasion he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Luister net: Verlede jaar toe ek met &#x2019;n verhoging in die pryse van wit en bruin brood gekom het, was daar mense wat my derms wou uitryg daaroor. &#x201C;Dink aan die mindergegoedes,&#x201D; het hulle gekerm. Toe s&#x00EA; ek: &#x201C;Laat die mindergegoedes dan nou maar hulle bruin brood koop teen die 13c waarvoor hulle tot nou nog wit brood gekoop het.&#x201D; En weet u wat, witbroodverkope is nog steeds 72%. Vervloek of hulle die bruin brood wil vreet!</block>

<block name="quote">*Now I wonder, Mr. Speaker, whether we can fight inflation if we pay heed to that speech of the hon. the Minister. Nevertheless, the consumer does blame the farmer for the rising prices of foodstuffs.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>But you tell them it is the Government&#x2019;s fault.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we do not tell them that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to say emphatically that we in the United Party are very fond of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and his department. During the recess I went from meeting to meeting defending this hon. Minister and his department when I found my farming constituents becoming obstreperous. By the same token, however, I went from meeting to meeting defending the farmers when the townsfolk became obstreperous. The townsfolk say to me: &#x201C;Look at the farmers all getting rich. They drive around in big Mercedes Benzes just like Cabinet Ministers while we cannot afford to buy food.&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we admit that the factors affecting agricultural costs are common to many sectors of South African industry. The question could be asked why we feel that the farming sector should be favoured above other sectors. The answer to that has been given several times today. The hon. the Minister of Finance has just given it again. The answer is simple. I feel, as do all of us, that food is more important than arms. Our first defence is food. If we cannot feed our people, it is no good trying to fight anyone else.</p>

<p>I should like to mention just a few of the causes of inflation as we, the small farmers, see them. The first, of course, is the question of imports, which has already been mentioned in this debate and has, in fact, been discussed the whole of this week. I must say that this matter baffled me completely, because we have been told by the hon. the Minister of Finance that devaluation was to the advantage of the South African farmer. One wonders how it can be to our advantage when agricultural machinery and the spares for that machinery are becoming more and more expensive. Farm requisites such as medicines and drugs, as well as many other things that are imported, are becoming more and more expensive and beyond the reach of the normal farmer. I should like to say that we feel the Government can do something in that regard. I feel that the high import duties on farming equipment should be removed or reduced a great deal. An exception should be made in respect of the importation of farming goods, including spares. While we have the opportunity of paying lower prices because of the recession overseas, spares should be imported to a greater extent so that a store of these goods can be built up. Mr. Speaker, it was possible only recently to import steel at a lower price than the steel produced at Iscor costs. Why could we not have stockpiled steel at these low prices, instead of stopping its importation? I am not an economist, but to me this is common sense, because when the price goes up and we are short of steel, we shall have to pay higher prices.</p>

<p>Another factor which is pushing up the cost of farming is, of course, the cost of ground. We were asked today why we blame the Government for the increased cost of ground. <span class="col_1227-1228" refersTo="page_0630"/>The answer is simple. The consolidation plan of this Government has forced up the price of farming ground, has made farmland scarce, has caused farms to lie idle, and, in the case of farms which are producing, has caused them to be quite inefficient. The cost of housing for farm labour is another factor. In Natal a great deal has been done in respect of housing for farm labour, but we feel that the standards laid down in various areas are completely beyond what is required. In my particular area, for instance, ablution facilities in the Native compounds have to have white glazed tiles. I am certain that it is possible to build adequate ablution facilities and eating houses without having to glaze the walls.</p>

<p>Another factor is the cost of farm requisites. Much was said at the last meeting of the S.A. Agricultural Union about the price of fertilizer. It was felt that the four firms producing fertilizer are in a combine and that they are taking the farmers for a ride. There is also a lot of unhappiness about the export of phosphates. It is said now that we are going to export phosphate fertilizers over the next 10 years to the extent of about 1&#x00BC; million tons. The price of phosphates has gone up overseas from about $41 per ton to nearly $300 per ton at present, and we will one day be buying back the very phosphates to produce our fertilizers. It is these things which we feel are causing inflation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I could hardly have imagined bearing in mind the fact that I have been in Parliament for ten years now, that I would experience a day like this, a day in which two very positive motions were debated for a full sitting-day. To begin with I want to thank the hon. member for Heilbron who introduced the motion, and then, too, all the members who took part in the debate. In the second place I also want to thank the hon. member for Newton Park, who did everything in his power to differ from us a little. But since all he did was drag out the old story of the agricultural planning board, we shall excuse him, because we believe that in fact he will still support the hon. the Minister as he promised to do this morning. We also want to thank the hon. member for Mooi River for his positive contribution. He was very serious about it and it was a very sound contribution. All these members have already been replied to by this side, and I must refer to the solid contribution by the hon. member for Malmesbury, a contribution which was undoubtedly appreciated by most members. The hon. member for Bethal, too, made an exceptional contribution in his usual thorough way. I should like to thank all of them.</p>

<p>Since at the end of the day I have an opportunity to say a few words, I want to avail myself of the opportunity to tell all the bodies and persons for whom it is a serious matter to report on the events in Parliament from day to day&#x2014;and that, of course does not exclude the Press&#x2014;the members of the House who are interested in agriculture, news media and radio and television, that today they have had the opportunity of listening to an agricultural debate in depth. Many facets of agriculture were discussed here today in a manner worthy of the House. If the news media want to do their duty towards agriculture, too, then they have had the opportunity today to take due cognizance of the standpoints raised in today&#x2019;s debate. If what was said here today is distributed by the news media, they will be performing a service to our country. Food is so important today that I want to go so far as to say that whereas it can often be seen or felt nowadays that agriculture is not really newsworthy, I foresee the time when people are going to prick up their ears at the sound of the word &#x201C;food&#x201D;. I do not want to be pessimistic. On the contrary. I regard myself as one of the optimists. The role played by research was rightly raised by the hon. member for Orange Grove, and although I have grave doubts as to his knowledge of farming, nevertheless his contribution was a solid one. I suspect, after listening to the hon. member for Bryanston, that they consulted the same source. Nevertheless they really made a sound contribution, although I had the feeling that they were not really at home in this field. But as I say, I was very impressed by the contribution made here <span class="col_1229-1230" refersTo="page_0631"/>by the hon. member in regard to the role played by research. I want to emphasize that we in this country are today in the position where the farmer will be able to provide ample food for this country as long as the finances are available and as long as the stakes are raised. There is no doubt about that. If I have interpreted it correctly, this was more or less the underlying theme, the thinking, behind every speech made today in this debate.</p>

<p>I do just want to refer briefly to the two legs of this motion. In the first place I should like to refer to inflation, because I believe that this is important. Because I have only a few minutes at my disposal and because I have already had to discard most of the good points I wanted to make, since they have already been mentioned, I shall only refer to them by way of summary. Basically, there are two aspects of the combating of inflation. On the one hand, an attempt is made to achieve a higher degree of efficiency in order to produce at a lower unit cost. Surely that is quite obvious. On the other hand, expenses must be reduced by limiting expenditure to essentials and by delaying other non-urgent and non-essential expenditure. I think that this is a neat summary and that it defines the situation very clearly. On the production side, the Government has always endeavoured to make economical farming units available to farmers by way of research and extension programmes and agricultural financing, in order to promote efficiency in agriculture. This is the endeavour of the Government and I believe that we are all agreed on that score, despite the few points of criticism raised here in the debate. Although all possible efforts have been made to cut Government expenditure, these measures do not apply in the case of essential services and services with specific purposes, whether it be research, extension or financial assistance.</p>

<p>At the moment the Government is introducing a system of target budgeting. Among the points of criticism raised here by certain members of the &#x201C;these benches&#x201D; party, was that the departments could still save here and there. This system is aimed at evaluating the utilization of funds and in addition, relating them to priorities in regard to research and extension in agriculture. In my opinion this is a very important step in the right direction.</p>

<p>It is hoped that in terms of this policy more attention will be given to the basic problems of agriculture. As far as financing is concerned, the judicious utilization of funds in order to promote production is given special attention. Here, too, higher efficiency and the lowest unit cost are aimed for. Interest subsidies, the provision of funds for the storing of grain and for the training of farmers, are further measures calculated to bring about cost savings for the farmer and promote higher productivity.</p>

<p>As far as farming requisites are concerned, the policy is to exercise control over the prices of these things, for example in the case of fertilizer, diesel oil, certain packaging materials, cattle fodder, etc. Furthermore, transportation rebates are granted on certain fertilizers.</p>

<p>A further point I want to discuss is research. Research is also aimed at money-saving measures on the farm. The agricultural engineering division of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services pays special attention to rationalization of the utilization of agricultural implements in order that they may be utilized efficiently. Close contact between this division and the Import Control Board has resulted in the importation of a variety of agricultural implements being limited as far as possible. For example, since 1961 the number of makes of tractor has already been reduced from 34 to 14 and the number of models from 200 to 100. This is an exceptional achievement, and if we can continue in this way and in other facets of the national economy as well, then we may as well do so, because a drop in production costs inevitably follows.</p>

<p>This division has also given intensive attention, over the past year in particular, to the planned use of labour and implements, which together are responsible for approximately 60% of the farmer&#x2019;s expenditure. In this regard, too, the Government has decided to assign eight training centres&#x2014;and the hon. member for Orange Grove said that nothing was being done&#x2014;to the agricultural industry, the first of which will be opened near Potchefstroom this year. Then, too, there is the training centre for Coloureds at Kromme <span class="col_1231-1232" refersTo="page_0632"/>Rhee. Taking into account these training centres, which are supplementary to those which already exist, special attention will be given to the training of farm labourers who have to handle mechanical equipment. This is a tremendous forward step, and in my opinion will satisfy everyone.</p>

<p>In addition, the division has recently given intensive attention to fuel conservation measures on the farms. An enormous task has been performed in this respect, and it is already paying dividends. On the marketing side, positive efforts have been made to combat inflation. Approximately 83% of agricultural production is marketed under the Marketing Act and a further 8% under specific legislation. Various boards have already effected savings without derogating from efficient marketing. In addition, various boards have made a positive contribution towards the combating of inflation by not insisting on full price increases for their products. I can only consider this to be an exceptional contribution on the part of the farmer.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that injudicious financing is one of the evils which promotes inflation. This is a very important aspect. That is why it is the policy of the Government to give attention to essential and purposeful financing, often indirectly, in order to allow normal agricultural development to continue at all times.</p>

<p>I still have a few minutes left and I should like to say a few words about productivity. The Government is in fact well aware of the importance of food production in the Republic, particularly in view of the factors mentioned in the motion. That is why constant attention is being given to the judicious exploitation of natural resources and to increasing the efficiency of agricultural production and marketing. I realize that the enormous amount of energy our officials have put into this has already yielded such results that owing to the fact that the yield per morgen has increased by so much, it has been possible for the boards and the Government to make downward adjustments in the prices of commodities. In this regard I want to mention one exceptional achievement. This concerns a scarce type of fruit which is not really of particular importance, but concerning which the results have been so phenomenal that it can in fact be regarded as an ideal to strive for. The fruit in question is the strawberry. Merely by making the strawberry planting material virus-free, it was possible to boost the yield to 40 tons per hectare. In the normal course a yield of 20 tons per hectare is regarded as an exceptional achievement. This increase was brought about merely by making the virus-free material available, something which can of course be done as a result of research. This is a pattern we should like to follow. We want the results to filter through to the farmer so that we may combat inflation in that way. I think that this is one of the most effective ways of doing this and, what is more, of utilizing the available land more intensively&#x2014;it is limited in South Africa and can only be extended through water conservation and which, as far as we can see, may reach saturation point by about the year 2000. We have no choice but to bring about higher production per hectare or unit, or else we shall not be able to feed the nation, and we shall in fact to able to do so if we operate in this way and if we provide our farmers with guidance so that they have the knowledge, as is the case today, and if we can influence all the other facets of society with a bearing on agriculture to co-operate. Finally, we must be able to persuade the consumer to be willing to pay a higher price for the sake of his own continued existence, and so that the farmer will be able to produce.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with this very sound quotation: &#x201C;In times of hunger, people sell gold to buy food, if they have got the gold.&#x201D; To me, this sums up the situation in the world today, particularly in Africa. If we have the gold, we shall in fact be in a position to produce the food, but it will be at a premium. Let us have no illusions about the fact that this is the direction in which we shall have to move, and let us believe that we shall succeed in this.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned on Thursday, I had suggested that the speech of our ambassador at the United Nations had created a watershed as far as political thinking in South Africa was concerned, from which inevitable consequences would flow. I said that firstly because there was a public acknowledgment from our ambassador, and I quote his words:</p>

<p>&#x201C;We do have discriminatory practices and we do have discriminatory laws in South Africa.&#x201D; Secondly, he expounded a completely acceptable philosophy when he said that the Whites of South Africa are as much concerned about the implementation of human rights, human freedoms, human dignity and justice as any other nation in the world. Thirdly, in the words of the ambassador, he said there was an acceptance that the Government of this country does not condone discrimination purely on grounds of race or colour, and that discrimination based solely on the grounds of the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin cannot be defended. These were public undertakings to the nations of the world that the Government of South Africa would do everything in its power to move away from discrimination based on race and colour. There was a further assurance from the hon. the ambassador, namely that there was no question of keeping apart people who wished to come together. These assurances were given to the world. These were expressions of intent. They were made some 15 months ago. We are entitled and, in fact, we are obligated today to inquire and to highlight what has or what has not been done to implement and to fulfil these undertakings.</p>

<p>Replying to the motion on Friday, 6 February, of the hon. member for Edenvale with regard to the setting up of a select committee to deal with questions of discrimination, and to identify them, the hon. the Minister of Justice made certain statements which need closer examination. He gave the assurance that the Government was completely aware of the statutes on our Statute Books which are no longer necessary, i.e. no longer necessary as discriminatory measures. Why then, in heaven&#x2019;s name, must the Prime Minister appoint a Cabinet Committee if the Government is so aware of this? Must he appoint a Cabinet Committee to decide what laws should be changed? Is it necessary to have a Cabinet Committee? Why, 15 months after the statement was made by our ambassador, do we still have the salary and pension discrimination between racial groups, between people in this country, purely on the grounds of the colour of their skin? Why the discrimination referred to in the report of Mr. Justice Snyman which has recently been laid upon the Table of this hon. House? More than a year ago the Government, on the instructions of the hon. the Prime Minister, appointed a Cabinet Committee to investigate&#x2014;and I quote the words of the hon. the Minister of Justice&#x2014;&#x201C;possible discriminatory measures with a view to their elimination within the framework of separate development&#x201D;. This is a committee to operate in the closed circle of the Cabinet without a single voice from the Black, the Coloured or the Indian people as to what they regard as discriminatory legislation. Secondly, the hon. the Minister argued that discriminatory practices exist in the rest of the world. That is no answer to the fulfilment of the undertakings of our ambassador. Thirdly, the hon. the Minister suggested that a Select Committee would not lead to agreement, but that there would be fundamental differences of opinion amongst the members of the Select Committee. I accept that as a fact. There would be fundamental differences between the hon. gentlemen opposite and the members who sit on this side of the House. I would have thought, however, that it would have been far better if those differences, whether they be fundamental or superficial, were aired and considered in a Select Committee chamber rather than across the floor of the House.</p>

<p>I find it extremely difficult to reconcile the statements of the hon. gentlemen opposite. The Minister of Justice said: &#x201C;Hierdie kant van die Raad erken mense se menswaardigheid.&#x201D; <span class="col_1235-1236" refersTo="page_0634"/>On the other hand, the newly appointed Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education had this to say: &#x201C;Black persons who are permitted to remain permanently in the White area of South Africa under section 10 cannot be accepted as a permanent part of our political or social structure in White South Africa.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister of Justice said: &#x201C;Ons evalueer elke mens op sy eie intrinsieke waarde.&#x201D; How can this be reconciled with the statement of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education? How can it be reconciled with the nonsensical conditions which the hon. the Minister himself has imposed with regard to hotels, the so-called international hotels? How can it be reconciled with the statement of the hon. member for Sunnyside who said that the job reservation clause was not a measure to be eliminated from our Statute Book because it affected only 2,8% of the workers in South Africa? Do hon. members opposite not accept and appreciate that it is not the extent to which that law is applied in South Africa which is the cause of concern, but the principle which is enshrined in the very existence of job reservation, namely that a man, irrespective of his ability, because of the colour of his skin, is precluded from utilizing his God-given talents for his advancement in certain avenues of employment? That is the effect of that law. But it is not discrimination, Sir. The hon. the Minister of Justice announced further in a most dramatic way that in his opinion there was a departure from the present restrictions in regard to access to hotels. I am very glad that he referred to &#x201C;international status&#x201D;&#x2014;in inverted commas&#x2014;in that statement, because one wants to examine what is happening.</p>

<p>I have limited time this afternoon to deal with this, but I want to say that the hon. the Minister, in the statement he issued, said that the granting of international status to the establishments mentioned meant that liquor, refreshments, meals or accommodation, as the case may be, were to be supplied to persons who were not White from 16 February at the discretion of the licensee. We would be very happy if there were such a discretion in the hands of the licensee. However, the discretion is so circumscribed, and I would like to refer to one issue, namely the nonsensical statement about dancing. Does the hon. the Minister know what he has in fact said? He has said that a Black man and his wife can go to one of these hotels with a normal restaurant with dance floor facilities, and that they can have a meal there, but that they cannot go on to the dance floor unless, of course, they are foreign Black people. In the month of February or March a Xhosa gentleman can go into the Heerengracht Hotel, but he and his wife cannot go on to the dance floor. However, after October it will be quite all right for that same gentleman and his wife to go on to the dance floor if they should wish to, because they will have come from a foreign state. [Interjections.] That is the position.</p>

<p>My time is limited and I would like to turn to the question of the elimination of discrimination. The hon. the Minister said it would be eliminated within the framework of separate development. I think the time is opportune for me to make a few comments in connection with the report of the judicial commission on the disturbances at Black universities in the North. I am referring to the Snyman Commission. I understand that there is a limited number of copies of this report available. I would like to suggest that it should be compulsory reading for every member in this House, because the learned judge gives a very graphic word picture of the frustration and the hatred which is growing amongst Blacks towards Whites in this country.</p>

<p>Obviously the hon. member has not read the report. He wants to know why. The judge spells out the reasons and causes for this unhappy and dangerous situation. First of all, he points to the rejection of the policy of separate development amongst the Blacks. Secondly, he mentions the growth of Black consciousness which, the judge says, is nurtured by grievances and frustration of lagging behind Whites in the development of human civilization in this country. Thirdly, the judge refers to the aggravation caused, in his own words</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; by statutory and traditional restrictions which have been imposed upon Blacks mainly in the interests of Whites.</block>

<p>Fourthly, he mentions the unpleasant personal experiences of the urbanized, westernized and sophisticated Blacks which impair their dignity. This is a class of persons which hon. members on the other side have never been <span class="col_1237-1238" refersTo="page_0635"/>ready to accept as even existing in our society. The judge adds, fifthly, that a source of antagonism is the fact that Black students regard the university as a product of separate development. Sixthly, he points out that the Blacks reject the ethnic groupings as seen by us Whites. Seventhly, the Black man does not see himself as part of a separate nation. He wants to be recognized as a part of the South African nation.</p>

<p>Nonsense!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members say this is nonsense, but I am quoting the findings of Mr. Justice Snyman. He goes further and says that the attitude of Blacks is aggravated by restrictions imposed upon them, which constitute a violation of their human dignity. These are his findings; these are the findings of a judicial commission. These are the facts which have led to the statement in which the hon. judge states that the state of affairs on the campus is now an agitator&#x2019;s paradise.</p>

<p>The hon. judge also dealt with the establishment of the Black students&#x2019; organization, SASO. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This organization not only plays a decisive role in student unrest on the campus of the University of the North, but is also engaged in subversive activities throughout the country.</block>

<p>He continues that SASO advocates violent revolution and that it promotes racial hatred in South Africa. The organization propagates Black consciousness, Black theology and Black power as the means towards the establishment of the political goal of Black socialism in this country of ours.</p>

<p>Further, the judge finds that SASO was led by the ideology of a new organization, which caused its birth and formation in the student body. The judge refers to the University Christian Movement which was inspired, as the judge puts it, by the UCM of the United States, by the American Committee on Africa and by the World Students&#x2019; Christian Federation which is described by the learned judge as a Marxist organization. He goes on to recall&#x2014;and I think it is as well that we should know this&#x2014;that it was during the 1968 annual conference of the UCM in South Africa that the first Black caucus was formed which led to the birth of SASO. It was at this UCM conference that, I recall, the hon. member for Pinelands was an official delegate as the leader of the Methodist Church in South Africa. The judge says that it is this UCM that introduced the ideology of Black power and that it introduced the principle of polarization of Black and White in South Africa. It was this organization, as the judge said, which acted as the midwife at the birth of SASO in South Africa. These findings are a sombre warning to our church leaders in this country, who should exercise more care in the selection of organizations which spring up here and which they are prepared to back. Many churches supported the UCM from its inception. At the 1969 conference the UCM adopted a resolution in which it reaffirmed its affiliated membership of the World Students&#x2019; Christian Federation, the organization which Mr. Justice Snyman describes as a Marxist organization. That motion at the conference in 1969 was introduced by the hon. member for Pinelands. [Interjections.] I refer to this, because these are the facts of an unhappier period of race relations in South Africa. The hon. member for Pinelands was not alone in this; there were members of various churches who were also supporting this organization at that time. I believe that if we value and look forward to peaceful coexistence in South Africa and if we desire economic prosperity, then we have to look at the set of circumstances which, as the learned judge has said, creates a fertile field in which organizations such as SASO can operate. We must see to what extent we can, by action, and I mean immediate action, fulfil the undertakings of our ambassador at the United Nations, and let the world see that we are intent on carrying out the undertakings of our ambassador. We must see to it that those undertakings are not put aside by us as the Parliament of this country, but that we accept the consequences of carrying out those undertakings which were given in our name by the ambassador at the UNO.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Green Point is known in this House to be a person who makes very good and well-balanced contributions, but I am afraid with this speech he has just completed, he proved to us that the presence of the Progressive Party in Durban North does not run through the life of that party like a golden <span class="col_1239-1240" refersTo="page_0636"/>thread, but like barbed wire which is separating them quite considerably. I want to say at once that if one had had appreciation for the contributions of the hon. member for Green Point in the past, one would have been very disappointed today. This hon. member told this House on Thursday that separate development could not succeed and that it had failed. I do not have the time this afternoon to deal with the matter in detail, but I would just like to remind the hon. member that we have reached the year 1976 and that we are on the eve of the attainment of independence of the Transkei. That event is certainly irrefutable proof of the success which the National Party has achieved in carrying separate development through to its logical consequences in South Africa. There are numerous other examples one could quote. I think the hon. member is being na&#x00EF;ve if he merely states that separate development cannot succeed and that he does not see it as the solution to our problems in this country. He went on to deal with discrimination and gave us a long discourse on it. This was not the first time the hon. member discussed discrimination. He did so about a week ago and about 18 months ago as well. On that occasion he said that the solution to our problems, the alpha and the omega, lay in the abolition of the prohibition on mixed marriages as well as the following: Group areas, bus apartheid, the prohibition on social mixing, separate universities, the prohibition of mixed trade unions and work reservation, to which he again referred this afternoon and to which I shall subsequently return. He also referred to the abolition of the parliamentary representative of the Bantu as proof of those things which should now be abolished. He said if these were abolished we would have an utopia in this country. Then there would be peace and quiet and the world would be very fond of us.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary to go into these matters very deeply, for surely we know that these steps will not solve the matter. However, I think that, with reference to the discourse he presented today, as well as to his 1974 speech, it is necessary that we put a few pertinent questions to the hon. member. I want to ask him whether it is the standpoint of the United Party that the prohibition of mixed marriages should be abolished. [Interjections.] He agrees with that. We shall have to confront our voters with that and I honestly hope the United Party will not hesitate to tell the voters of Durban North and Alberton that the United Party advocates the abolition of the prohibition on mixed marriages.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether it is the standpoint of the United Party that the arrangement which is made in terms of the Group Areas Act should be abolished, so that mixed residential areas could be created. Should there be places in Durban North where the different colour groups could live together? Should they come and live amongst the Whites in Alberton and Green Point as well? I think the voters of Alberton and Durban North are entitled to know where they stand with the United Party in that respect. I also think we should know whether the hon. member for Green Point is speaking on behalf of the United Party when he says that he is in favour of Black people having a representative in this Parliament again, for he advocated in 1974 that that measure should be repealed and that the Bantu representatives should return to Parliament. If the hon. member says he is in favour of it, the voters of Alberton and Durban North, in fact the entire country, is entitled to know what his view is, on behalf of the United Party, in regard to the question of how many representatives the Black people should have in this House. If he is not prepared to supply these details, then one is forced to say&#x2014;Mr. Speaker, you will probably call me to order here&#x2014;that the United Party is hypocritical, that they distort matters and that they are misleading the voters of this country.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member this afternoon delivered a recitation on discrimination here. Now it is right that he should also hear, from the National Party side, where the latter party stands on this matter&#x2014;as opposed to the standpoint of the United Party.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall now tell you. I cannot do it better than in the words of my esteemed leader, who is not only the leader of the National Party, but also the leader of every thinking, and I almost want to say decent, person in this country, and whose leadership is appreciated far beyond the borders of this country. My leader said in 1974&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I see it as my constant task to get away from discrimination. I have devoted my energies to that ever since the first day I filled this position. I shall devote my energies to that until the last day that I sit in this House.</block>

<p>This is what he said. There is not one hon. member on this side of the House who can rise here this afternoon and say with a clear conscience that he cannot see where the hon. the Prime Minister and the Government are carrying into effect this statement which the hon. the Prime Minister made in this House. I think the actions of the Government in this respect, are meeting with a response throughout the world.</p>

<p>On that occasion, however, the hon. the Prime Minister also made another statement, of which we should also take note. On that occasion he asked what the United Party wanted to do and where they want to go with the standpoint they were adopting on discrimination. Where do they want to take the nation? What is their idea? What are they trying to suggest to the Black nations of this country? Are they not suggesting to the Black people that under their r&#x00E9;gime things will be done which they know in their hearts they will not be able to do.</p>

<p>In this way they create expectations among the Black people. If people create expectations under such circumstances, I think it is right that we, as the voters of Alberton and Durban North, can draw our own conclusions about the motive behind this standpoint, the attitude which they adopt and the policy which they advocate. I think the conclusion one should draw from that motive, is that they do not see their way clear.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I put a question to the hon. member?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately my time is limited and the Whips will not allow me any more time. I say that the voters should draw the conclusion that the United Party is creating expectations among the Black people for one purpose only and that is to spur Black people on to a certain point. Pedagogically it is correct that by repeating something over and over again, people will eventually believe it. Therefore, if the hon. Opposition were to keep on repeating things to the Black people, as for example that they are being discriminated against, they will begin to believe this in the long run, and would eventually reach a point where they are no longer able to endure it. This would inevitably lead to incidents, for then there is going to be confrontation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, is this not the conclusion we should draw concerning the motive of the United Party? Should we not draw the conclusion that they are heading for such a confrontation for the sake of what may be a little political advantage? I think the voters of Durban North and Alberton are intelligent enough to make sure that after the respective polling days there will be no occasion for the United Party to say that they made progress.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, I would like to express a few thoughts this afternoon on a few labour matters which were raised here from time to time. On Thursday we sat here waiting for the hon. member for Maitland to say something about labour, but he just never got around to it. All he did was make a few vague statements <span class="col_1243-1244" refersTo="page_0638"/>which he could not prove, and I could have challenged him to present his proof here to this House today, but now there will be no time for that this afternoon. But the hon. member for Maitland is a person who finds it very easy to say that the Government ignores the Black labourers and that thousands of people&#x2014;these are the words used last year&#x2014;want to work but do not have any work. Sir, he must be a Rip van Winkle for surely that kind of attitude does not hold water. It does not correspond to what is actually happening in practice. After all, there is no question of there being thousands of people who want to work, but who do not have any work. As a matter of fact, there is over-employment. In spite of all the problems we have, we are fortunate in this country not to have any unemployment. The hon. member went further and said that we see the entire labour question solely as a political problem, and he said that we should stop looking at the colour of a person&#x2019;s hands. Work reservation, he said, should finally disappear from our vocabulary. I do not even think it is necessary for me to say here this afternoon that those were ill-considered statements which cannot be proved, and which are far from the truth and are of no significance. But these things are being said with a view to eliciting a little acclamation in a number of Progressive Party seats, because there is a perpetual struggle in progress between the Progressive Party and the United Party. The United Party is already on the run in the few seats they still have. [Interjections.] The hon. member who made that interjection is very wary of the Progressives in his own constituency. They are only too keen to bid for the support of the people, because they feel the Progressive Party is breathing down their necks. At the same time I must say that the Progressive Party is at least trying to be honest, when they try to adopt a standpoint here. [Interjections.] Sir, it would do us no harm to consider three basic aspects. One of their arguments is that Black trade unions should be recognized in this country. The second statement they make is that job reservation should be abolished.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland says that that is correct. In the third place it is their standpoint that the kind of measures which are being taken to bring about racial harmony is harmful and that more should be done in the form of training for the Black workers.</p>

<p>As far as the recognition of Black trade unions is concerned, I can, of course, understand the United Party adopting an attitude of this nature, because they are certainly very conscious of the fact that a trade union is an instrument which may be used for political purposes, and I can well understand that the United Party is so badly in need of a little more assistance in future that they would use any method or medium to realize the hope they cherish of making progress in future. Sir, I want to accuse the United Party this afternoon of not being honest towards the Black workers when they say that they are in favour of the recognition of Black trade unions, and I shall furnish proof of this in a moment. In the second place, they are not being honest towards the White worker because they are not telling him what the implications of such recognition would be. That is the point. They are being dishonest towards the Black worker as well as the White worker. [Interjections.] It is now being asked that I should furnish proof that they are dishonest towards the Black worker. They are being dishonest towards the Black worker, because they qualify that approval. They say they would be prepared to afford only so much power; the real power they would continue to keep in their own hands. But surely, one cannot give a person something and only allow him to go so far. What they should do, is to elucidate to the Black worker the standpoint they advocate. They are being dishonest towards the White worker because they tell him that they are protecting his position within the work context. I want to ask them how they are going to do this. If the position of the White worker were to be threatened, would they afford that protection with force or brute force? If the Black trade union has negotiated for a lower wage, are they going to guarantee the present wage of the White worker to enable him to maintain the same standard of living, or are they going to be prepared to sell him out to the other person as long as they are able to derive a little political advantage from it? A great deal can be said about that. While there is a National Party Government in this country, however, nothing will be done to jeopardize the position of the White worker unnecessarily. <span class="col_1245-1246" refersTo="page_0639"/>There must be no doubt about that. The United Party can carry on and shout as loudly as it likes. They will simply have to reconcile themselves to this situation.</p>

<p>On the other hand the Government admits that there should be channels of negotiation for the workers, whether they are Black or White. The Government is thoroughly aware of that. For that reason the Government took the necessary steps several years ago to create these channels for the Black worker. Today it is history that that instrument is being used very effectively, and thanks to that instrument which has been established by the Government, confrontation and strikes have become a thing of the past. I think the United Party should admit to the Government that they have great appreciation for this fact, and that they are unanimous in their support of the Government for the further development of those channels that have been created.</p>

<p>Nor should the United Party have any doubts about work reservation. Without work reservation the White worker would not be prepared to allow his work to be reclassified. It is a fact in this country, and we have to accept that, owing to economic and other circumstances, it has become necessary to reclassify certain work from time to time. Up till now, however, the White worker has always co-operated on the basis of the fact that he knows his position is safe in the hands of this Government. But I repeat that the White worker will not agree to reclassification of any type of work he is doing if he is not protected by work reservation.</p>

<p>This Government has the finest record of any previous Government in respect of the training of workers. [Interjections.] But of course that is true. I just want to furnish a few particulars. There are 350 different trades in 18 industrial apprenticeships. In this way this Government has expanded and developed this aspect. Inspectors were appointed by this Government to supervise the training of apprentices, with the result that the pass rate among apprentices rose by more than 200%. At present the retraining of White workers, which is an essential matter, is being investigated. At present we have more than 37 000 apprentices in this country. Does this not prove that this Government is providing the necessary well-equipped labour force in this country?</p>

<p>As far as the Black workers are concerned, the State itself has made provision for eight centres or institutions at which Black workers can be trained. A further eight, at which Black workers are being trained, are privately controlled. Is this not a contribution by a far-sighted Government? In spite of this the United Party comes forward, in season and out and presents a picture which implies that nothing is being done in this country. The United Party is being extremely presumptuous in attacking the Government on this score. There should be nothing but appreciation and respect for what is being done by this Government.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down had a lot to say at the beginning of his speech about Durban North and the concern of the UP about fighting the Progressives. All I can say is that whatever hopes the Nationalists may have thought they had there, have been dissipated now by his efforts. Sen. Worrall in Durban North and &#x201C;Pik&#x201D; Botha over in America must be shaking their heads. It was quite clear to us that what the hon. member is really concerned about, is the Alberton by-election. He is trying to convince the Hertzogites over there that they are still verkramp in the NP too.</p>

<p>My time is limited and I want to raise another matter in the House, so I shall not spend any more time on the hon. member. Despite the communist threat in Angola and Southern Africa, the public has centred its interest on something else. It has centred its interest on a possible internal scandal which has to do with the purchase of land at Port St. Johns. Port St. Johns is a picturesque, attractive village peopled by worthy citizens. Heaven knows why they must continue to receive slap after slap from this Government. They were living happily and developing a popular holiday resort on the strength of promises made by this Government. These promises turned to pie-crusts. The whole way of life in Port St. Johns has changed. A happy community became a troubled and insecure community. Successful businessmen found their livings dying on them as all development was stopped. All of a sudden property had no value because there was only one possible buyer and that was the Bantu Trust. The community looked to the Trust to recompense them for the losses they could see ahead of them. They also looked to the Government to <span class="col_1247-1248" refersTo="page_0640"/>see that they got a fair deal when the rush came on of people who wanted to dispose of their properties.</p>

<p>Then came rumours of a scandal of preference being given to two strangers to Port St. Johns. They were not residents who had come to settle there in the normal course; they were two speculators whose speculations had gone wrong. Preference was given to them above the interests of the genuine residents who also sought relief but who did so in terms of the rules laid down by the Government itself. The public outside Port St. Johns also pricked up its ears, remembering irregularities in Government spending disclosed in public inquiries a short while ago. In addition, this story of Government spending seemed incredible in the face of the Government&#x2019;s exhortations to the public at large to tighten their belts and cut spending.</p>

<p>These two deals have been given a great deal of publicity. The facts as stated in the Press are well known and, until they are denied by the Government and other facts are given to the public, the public will have to accept the facts stated in the Press because these facts have been bandied about daily for ten days and no Minister or department has gainsaid them in any credible way. Because of the reluctance shown by the hon. the Minister on Friday to enlighten us, I have to deal with the facts as stated in the Press.</p>

<p>Well, his suppositions have proved correct. The people have made a big thing of this and it has &#x201C;come to that&#x201D;. Therefore, he should tell us what the position is. I do not for one moment question his honesty. What I do question is his efficiency. I say he has been lax in dealing with public funds. He has been taken for a ride. A member of Parliament whose memory is so much at fault should not have been entrusted with or allowed the influence he apparently had in spending public funds. At one stage, too, his faulty memory embarrassed his colleague, the Deputy Minister, Mr. &#x201C;Punt&#x201D; Janson. Mr. Raubenheimer had said that he had dealt with only one matter, viz. the Schoeman matter and that Mr. &#x201C;Punt&#x201D; Janson had dealt with the other.</p>

<p>He now says that right from the first he was not quite sure, but that makes it even worse. His memory must be failing him. Surely, he is not telling us that he handled so many cases involving R1 200 000 that he cannot remember whether he handled it or not? Surely he must remember whether he gave instructions to his department as to what should be done with regard to this transaction? At that time there was a shortage of funds. We were experiencing a financial crisis. Other offers that had been made to farmers in the Ciskei were withdrawn because the Government did not have the necessary funds. Yet the hon. the Minister wants to tell us he cannot remember whether he authorized that this property in Port St. Johns be purchased for R1 200 000, and not from a farmer but from a speculator. It is also incredible that he could forget that he gave instructions to his department that the matter had to be treated on a priority basis. When questioned by a particular pressman about priority having been given to these two gentlemen, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I suppose their case was looked into by the department and it was found they qualified for priority treatment.</block>

<p>He supposes that the matter was looked into by the department and that they were given priority treatment! Then, to another paper, he said he had instructed his department to give these two gentlemen priority treatment. Why were they given this priority treatment? The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said that he was going to deal with the question of priority. I hope that both of them are going to deal with it, and especially the then Deputy Minister, because he apparently is the one who authorized this priority.</p>

<p>In August last year the secretary of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development wrote to the people of Port St. Johns that the purchase of the Port St. Johns area would be attended to when it had been zoned by the department. Those owners who wished to dispose of their properties could then offer them to the S.A. Bantu Trust after zoning had been completed. After an inquiry by a one-man commission, a Mr. Grey who went to Port St. Johns to consult with the people&#x2014;I was invited by the Government to consult with him&#x2014;Port St. Johns was zoned in terms of a proclamation published on 14 November. From that date on the people in Port St. Johns could offer their properties. However, Mr. Henning&#x2019;s deed of sale was signed on 9 September. His deed of transfer was registered on 18 November. Mr. Schoeman&#x2019;s transfer was registered on 21 November, which means that the transfer papers were with the conveyancer in Cape Town by the end of September at the latest. The negotiations with these two gentlemen were therefore going on at a time when the Government was still telling the people of Port St. Johns that the place was going to be zoned and, indeed, the Government was going through the fa&#x00E7;ade of consulting them about the zoning while, in fact, it had already concluded agreements with these two gentlemen. [Interjections.] Those negotiations must have taken several months because, according to the Press&#x2014;I want the hon. the Minister to confirm the reports&#x2014;the valuators were not sent from Umtata, but apparently one came from Pretoria and the other one from King William&#x2019;s Town. The valuator usually used in the Transkei was not used in this instance. All this was done while the Government was putting up this fa&#x00E7;ade.</p>

<p>On Friday the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development told Parliament that no priority list had been prepared and he said that he would deal with the question of priority today. In reply to another question he said that no basic priority scheme had been determined for the area. I think the hon. the Minister speaks in ignorance of what was happening in the Transkei. A circular letter dated 1 December 1975 was sent to all property owners in Port St. Johns. I can give the hon. the Minister the reference number should he wish to have it. In that circular letter it was clearly stated that the department was compelled to acquire a priority scheme in order to give preference to the most urgent cases. It also stated that such priority scheme was already in operation and that the cases covered by it were aged persons, chronically ill persons, insolvent estates, widows, persons <span class="col_1251-1252" refersTo="page_0642"/>in dire financial stress, etc. One takes it that the order of urgency was as set out, viz. that first priority would be given to the aged, to chronically ill persons, then to insolvent estates, and so forth. I know that there are aged and chronically ill persons in Port St. Johns who had made their offers but who had been by-passed by the committee and I am sure that will not be denied.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the only possible provision in terms of which Schoeman and Henning could have been given priority. That would be cases of &#x201C;financial stress&#x201D;. What financial stress could there have been in these two cases? This question is fundamental to the whole situation and the hon. the Minister must not tell the House that he cannot give details since the matter is confidential.

<p>Let us take the case of Mr. Henning first. According to some, Henning bought the property for R49 000. However, others dispute that statement and say that he bought it for less, but I do not intend going into all the details. The fact is, however, that Henning was paid more than R1 200 000.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I do not agree that he was in financial trouble, but I should like to know why, if he was in such trouble, he was not treated on the same basis as Mr. Upton, another name mentioned by the hon. the Minister. Upton was in financial trouble&#x2014;it is common knowledge down there. The department gave a guarantee that it would pay the amount he demanded, but it has not taken transfer of his property and it has not paid him the balance of the purchase price. The department met his financial problem, but his was a genuine case. From other sources we find that Henning is a man with a varied career. He has been insolvent. I am not sure whether it was once or twice, but he has been insolvent. Henning owned several companies which have been liquidated, companies interested in the purchase of properties in Port St. Johns. A Mr. Oosthuizen phoned me the other day&#x2014;I mention his name because his name has now appeared in the Press. Henning admits that he owes Oosthuizen R10 250. He says that he will see Johannes, whom he knows well, and will come to some settlement with him. A lady phoned me this morning. I am not going to give her name; I shall give it to the hon. the Minister if he wants it. This lady lives in Steynsburg. In 1972 she bought a property from S.A. Vakansiebelegginge. She gave me a description of the property and I can also give this description to the hon. the Minister. She bought the property for R9 500. She paid R950 in cash and has been paying quarterly instalments of R285. She has paid these regularly, but on one occasion her letter with the cheque was returned to her by the Post Office marked &#x201C;address unknown&#x201D;. She was worried and got into touch with her attorneys in Pretoria. She wanted to know what was happening. The attorneys investigated the case and eventually she found Mr. Henning in a fish and chips shop. I do not know whether he was working there or what he was doing there. She then inquired about her instalments and Mr. Henning replied that she should send them to another company, the address of which he gave her. Since then she has continued paying her instalments. However, she did not send instalments for November and December because she saw in the Press what was happening. What worries her is the question as to whom she should pay instalments to. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether, since his department has paid out Mr. Henning, he knows about this woman who has been paying instalments for a plot and if he does know about her, why has she not been notified that she should pay instalments to the department and not to Henning?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I suppose she will only get transfer when the plot is proclaimed in the township.</p>

<p>When the hon. the Minister dealt with the valuations for these properties, he was asked by the hon. member for Walmer if the valuations had been based on a proclaimed township. The hon. the Minister replied &#x201C;Of course&#x201D;. When it was pointed out to him that <span class="col_1253-1254" refersTo="page_0643"/>the township had not yet been proclaimed, the Minister said that it was partly proclaimed. One cannot have a township partly proclaimed. Do you know why the township was not proclaimed? It was not proclaimed because the municipality of Port St. Johns would not agree to it until provision had been made for sewage and the proper construction of roads. My information is that the roads have been roughly constructed, that the surface is un-cleared bush and that there are no services for those properties. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether all those aspects were taken into consideration, as well as the extra costs which would be involved in establishing a township there. Did they take that into account when the prices of R800 000 and R1 200 000 were fixed?</p>

<p>In any event, as regards Henning&#x2019;s financial position, I should like to point out that he said he saw Deputy Minister Raubenheimer two years ago. He said then that he would try to give the business priority. What hurts the people of Port St. Johns is that neither Mr. Henning nor Mr. Schoeman live in Port St. Johns; but Mr. Henning is not leaving the area now that he has sold; he is going on with his business. He has a very lucrative business too. He is paying R5 000 per year for a business which has cost the Government R1 200 000; in fact, he is paying 0,5% of the value of the property in rental. What does Mr. Henning&#x2019;s son say? He says that this is a very profitable business; it is the most profitable coastal resort business from Durban to Port Elizabeth and he is making net profits of R60 000 to R80 000 per year. This does not sound like a business which is in dire financial straits. [Interjections.] Mr. Henning is very lucky. From the figures which he has supplied&#x2014;he has to pay off a bond of R150 000 and he has to pay out R100 000 to people who have bought property which he owned&#x2014;he will have R1 million left to himself to invest. He can invest that amount at 10% and he will receive all the interest. He has all these advantages, and he has a lucrative business for which he pays R5 000 per year. He may be financially embarrassed, but he is not embarrassed because of the property at Port St. Johns. Henning has many other coastal resort interests and that is why he is financially embarrassed, but why should the Port St. Johns property be called in to rescue this man?</p>

<p>What about Mr. Schoeman? A former director of his, a Mr. Wakefield, said that the Government paid out four times more than the developers expected to make. What was his case? Mr. Raubenheimer said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He is no friend of mine. I saw him years ago on two occasions about buying township land for development. I told him that, should Parliament decide to buy the land, he might lose a lot of money.</block>

<p>However, he went ahead and bought the land. Why must a man like that be protected? He was warned by the Government and by the hon. the Minister that he might lose money, but he goes ahead and speculates with the land and now he gets preferential treatment. All Mr. Schoeman said, was: &#x201C;Those who criticized did so out of envy.&#x201D; How right he is! There are many people who are very envious of Mr. Schoeman. Of those who are envious, there are especially the old widows, the sickly persons and the businessmen in Port St. Johns who have lost their incomes and have nowhere to turn. Why are these gentlemen favoured? As far as procedure is concerned, the hon. the Minister, Mr. Botha, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am satisfied negotiations took place according to prescribed procedure.</block>

<p>However, what did he say about procedure in the south? Was the procedure carried out in this case? No, it was not. A comprehensive statement of procedure was issued by this department to all landowners. It stated quite clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An undertaking was given to the Transkei Government that before any owner of land situated in a Reserve township area offered such land for sale to the South African Bantu Trust, he would be required to advertise his property for sale.</block>

<p>It goes on to set out the requirements for the advertisement, etc., and through which source it must be submitted to the adjustment committee. That procedure was not adhered to at all. I would like the Minister to explain what he meant when he said that it had gone through the normal channels.</p>

<p>There was a form that had to be signed, yes. How simple can the hon. the Minister be? [Interjections.] Sir, in addition to this the hon. the Minister said the following, which does not seem to read quite correctly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In determining the purchase prices the valuations were properly scrutinized and did not exceed the valuations. The prices paid for the two properties were, as far as the department and the Bantu Trust were concerned, considered to be favourable.</block>

<p>I take it that means it was favourable to the Bantu Trust. If the appraisement was favourable to the Bantu Trust, I assume the hon. the Minister will continue to use these two valuators, because they are valuing the properties at less than their value. Will the hon. the Minister now give us the assurance that when the rest of the properties at Port St. Johns are offered, these two valuators will be sent to make valuations at Port St. Johns on the same basis as the valuations which were made on these properties? I will tell the hon. the Minister why I ask that. Once before I had experience of this, when the farms around Umtata were to be sold. Dr. Verwoerd sent a valuator and bought a leading Nationalist&#x2019;s farm at an exorbitant price. When the other farmers found out about this, they held a meeting and said that Dr. Verwoerd could buy all their farms provided he sent the same valuator. I mentioned this to Dr. Verwoerd, who laughed and said that he would not send that same valuator again. The other farmers got much less for their farms which were valued on a different basis altogether. That is the reason why I would like an unequivocal statement from the hon. the Minister that the same basis of valuation will apply to the remaining properties at Port St. Johns. I would also like the hon. the Minister to assure the people of Port St. Johns that they will not have to wait another year before they are paid out. Those people are in a desperate position. The hon. the Minister does not realize the antagonism towards him and this Government for what has happened there where cases that deserved treatment have been left in the cold while these two speculators were given preference.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Griqualand East took up a great deal of the time of this House for his speech and among other things, he reproached me mildly because on Friday I did not deal with the specific problem with which he dealt. I could have dealt with this matter on Friday but, as the hon. member said, I did not furnish the details on Friday. I waited because I wanted to hear what the hon. member for Griqualand East had to say on this matter. However, it was not at all necessary for me to wait for his speech, because the hon. member said nothing more than what can be obtained from a collection of newspaper cuttings. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your assistance I would like to come to arrangement with the Opposition. All they must do is to listen to me as quietly as I listened to them. I shall answer any question which they might ask, but only after I have finished speaking and not in between. I want to come to an arrangement that I am going to put my case first. I have facts which I want to mention this afternoon. I do not have newspaper clippings and fabrications. However, I would like to be given a hearing. This is a very reasonable request.</p>

<p><span class="col_1257-1258" refersTo="page_0645"/>I am going to answer all the minor points in the assertions of the hon. member for Griqualand East, especially those of his mentors which he obtained in the newspapers. Before starting with my actual speech, I would like to tell the hon. member that I do not know why he complained about the fact that no Minister &#x201C;gainsaid&#x201D; it. The hon. member quoted from my Press statement about Port St. Johns, which I made eight or ten days ago. He said no Minister had said anything about this, but nevertheless he quoted from my statement. Hon. members will hear that basically I have very little to add to that statement. Nevertheless the hon. member said nobody had spoken about this. My hon. colleague, the hon. Minister of Water Affairs and of Forestry, the former Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, also replied to it. I will also deal with the position of the lady referred to.</p>

<p>Quite a fuss has been made in recent times. Lately the Opposition has made many attempts to make political capital out of the situation. The most recent attempt was the one made five minutes ago in this House. While everything possible is being done to try and put the Government in an unfavourable light on the basis of what has happened here, let us consider the facts. It is a great tragedy, but the fact is that a great many facts have already been shot to pieces. They have been shot to pieces by the sharpshooters of the Press and of the Opposition. Many others have had their teeth drawn and I do not know whether all of them are going to recover. However, I want to spell out the facts very clearly, in far greater detail than I did in my statement to the Press. My time is, however, limited and I hope that, at the end of my speech, I will have time to answer relevant questions. Fortunately there is also a Third Reading debate.</p>

<p>It is a very easy matter for me to explain because everything happened in a straightforward and proper manner. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We start right now, and I wish that the hon. member would wake up.</p>

<p>I am going to use the names of Mr. Schoeman and Mr. Henning. The fact is, however, that in both cases companies were involved. The names of the two companies, however, are very similar, and therefore it is more convenient to refer to Henning and Schoeman. For the record I just want to say that Prof. P. J. Schoeman&#x2019;s company is registered as Tweedestrand Eiendomme (Edms.) Bpk., and that the registered name of Mr. Henning&#x2019;s company is Tweedestrand Hotel en Vakansie-belange (Edms.) Bpk. I therefore prefer to speak in terms of Henning and Schoeman, because they were the owners of companies. Schoeman and Henning separately approached the department and the then Deputy Minister on behalf of their companies after it had become clear to them that the inclusion of Port St. Johns in the Bantu homeland area was being strongly mooted. They came to inform us of their position there and especially of one fact which was of great importance to us, i.e. that township development was taking place there. It appears that township development was taking place on the properties of both these men and that a certain number of plots had already been sold in those developments.</p>

The hon. member for Griqualand East, who is a lawyer&#x2014;I will say more about his being a lawyer later&#x2014;ought to know that throughout the whole country many properties are being developed as townships and that sales take place before they have been proclaimed as such. This however takes place on condition that transfer can only take place after proclamation. This was also done in this case. Surely, the hon. member knows this.</p>

<p>Very well. I am glad the hon. member says he knows it. There are however a great many of his colleagues who pretend that they do not know it. In fact, I think a whole crowd of them do not know it at all, and are just stirring up feelings. [Interjections.] The hon. member should contain himself a little. The developed areas were being sold out and the people informed us about it. They told us that there were some developed areas&#x2014;the hon. member for Griqualand East referred to this&#x2014;in respect of which the local authority had laid down certain requirements in connection with services that had to be provided there. There was especially the important service of waterborne sewerage which had to be laid on according to the demands of the local authority of Port St. Johns, which does not even have it in their own town yet. We discussed this matter among ourselves and I was present. The hon. member need not think that the Deputy Minister would have gone about these things like a wild bull of Basan. On the contrary. As I said in my statement, I was constantly kept informed of matters and I constantly made decisions with them and gave certain indications where these were necessary. I was present at the discussions when the Deputy Minister and certain of our officials discussed the position and decided that further township development should be stopped if the area was to be incorporated into the Bantu area later. We advised them to stop it. Why did we do this? I am going to deal with this point for a moment, because this is a very important point, as hon. members will see later. We had it stopped because it could involve additional high costs. One does not know what these services cost. No tenders or anything of the kind have been submitted. It could have cost anything, and hon. members must remember that if the proclamation of those townships had been further finalized, all those buyers, one after the other, could of course have obtained transfers. If the process had proceeded still further, other people could have bought plots before obtaining transfers, and once they got transfers, we would have had a whole crowd of owners in that township with whom we would have had to negotiate. We considered it in the best interest of the Trust&#x2014;and time proved that this was indeed so&#x2014;that we should rather negotiate with two owners, i.e. the two companies in the person of Henning and Schoeman, instead of negotiating with potentially more than 100 owners of all the individual plots as well as the original owners. For this reason we asked them not to continue with it, because those people too would, in turn, have had profits, expenses, and so on, which we would have had to take into consideration.</p>

<p>It is very difficult for me to tell the House how much we saved by stopping the development of the township. How were we to know what these people&#x2019;s claims would be? How were we to know what the costs would be? What we do know is that it would have been a very expensive process. We must also bear in mind that it would then have been necessary for the Bantu to live in a township developed according to the Cape system and regulations, while in an independent Transkei they might want to do things in a different manner. Considering it from all angles, it was sensible for us not to allow that township development to continue. As a result of this commission of ours, both Henning and Schoeman had to repossess properties from people who had already bought, but who did not have title deeds. Dozens of people&#x2019;s properties have been repossessed by both Henning and Schoeman so that we do not have to consider them as separate owners today.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with the woman to whom that hon. Chief Whip over there and this hon. Chief Whip over here referred. That woman&#x2014;if I understood the hon. member on the other side correctly&#x2014;bought one of these subdivided properties in the unproclaimed township area. Surely, the hon. member has <span class="col_1261-1262" refersTo="page_0647"/>been an attorney long enough to know that she did not obtain a title deed for that plot.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member is getting annoyed, because he sees the implications of his senseless remark. [Interjections.] If the hon. member will keep quiet, he will hear my point. It is very clear that that woman was not a legal and registered owner with whom we had to negotiate. [Interjections.] No, of course not. Please wait a moment. I said I was going to answer hon. members&#x2019; questions and I am keeping my word. I am replying to the point raised by that hon. member. That woman was a purchaser from that company, and the company undertook to take back all those properties so that we would only have to buy from the company itself and not from all the purchasers. That woman was unable to obtain transfer, because until now that township has not been registered, and therefore that woman has no claim against us. If she has not received payment yet, she has a claim against the company with which she negotiated. She could probably claim from them. [Interjections.] I cannot hear what the hon. member is saying.</p>

<p>Order! I want to remind hon. members that I watched the hon. the Minister while the hon. member for Griqualand East was speaking and that, except towards the end, he listened in silence. I think hon. members ought to do this too.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. member over there know&#x2014;I presume the facts are more or less correct&#x2014;that Henning alone repossessed 34 such plots from people who had bought from him and were already paying off, but who were unable to obtain title deeds? That woman could have been one of them or someone who had not yet offered hers. That is a matter between him and her and not a matter for us. She was not a registered owner of property from whom we had to buy. The hon. attorney on the other side must prove the contrary to me.</p>

<p>The position concerning this matter remained like this until Parliament took its decision. This is an important matter. Hon. members were all present last year when Parliament decided that Port St. Johns should be added to the Bantu area, besides other areas which were decided on. After Parliament had taken its decision, we gave instructions for the valuations to be continued, because we had had a decision from the highest authority in the country, i.e. Parliament, and the law provides, and the hon. member for Griqualand East ought to know this, that once Parliament has taken the decision, the State President, as a formality, has to declare those areas released areas. Thereafter, in terms of the Act, we zone the areas. This is the position and the hon. member ought to know this. In other words, we immediately made a start with this. I shall deal with this again in a moment when I deal with the priorities. But hon. members will appreciate the urgency which existed concerning the properties of those two people which had to be bought before the area could be proclaimed as townships. Therefore we had it valued. As I said, we could not leave it in midair, because if we left it in mid-air, those people could have continued, under pressure from the local authority, to have their township provided with services and have it proclaimed, and then we would have had to negotiate with a few hundred buyers and would perhaps have had to pay far higher prices. Now, you must understand this quite well, Sir, that if we say that there was no basis for priorities here, as I told the hon. member with reference to Port St. Johns, I want to refer <span class="col_1263-1264" refersTo="page_0648"/>him to what the hon. member for Sea Point asked me. The other day, the hon. member for Sea Point asked me whether a priority scheme had been laid down in the Port St. Johns area, and my reply was that no priority scheme had been laid down for the Port St. Johns area.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>What about the September letter?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, Sir, I wish that hon. member would contain his excitement. I told him that priorities had not been laid down for Port St. Johns alone. In that circular I said&#x2014;and this still applies&#x2014;that as far back as in 1966, a priority scheme was laid down for the whole of the Transkei, by no other person than myself, and that priority list still applies to the whole of the Transkei, of which Port St. Johns forms part. This applies to all the remaining people. [Interjections.] Both these statements are quite correct. The priority had not been laid down for Port St. Johns alone and the priority which had been given to the land of these two companies&#x2014;let us now deal with this point, and I think that from what I said now, it is quite clear&#x2014;was in our own interests and not in the interests of the buyers. The hon. member wasted his time during his speech here this afternoon by suggesting that we gave priority to Henning and Schoeman, and that it was in their interest. It was not in their interest. Seen from their point of view it may have been important to them, but we were concerned with our point of view. [Interjections.] The hon. member can believe what he likes. He can even believe what he sucks out of his thumb, as he usually does. What was our approach? I have just outlined it to you. We wanted to prevent those townships from developing further and thus becoming a more expensive proposition to the Trust, and they would have become just that. Therefore, in our own interest, we decided first to buy that land with the money which was available and which was kept available for this purpose. And all other people are as subject to the general priority position which applies there, i.e. that we consider sick people and people who cannot continue with their work and we consider estate cases and court orders, and so on. Indeed, the Upton case which the hon. member referred to this afternoon, was being dealt with by the court. It was for this reason that we had to buy it out. Of course a far smaller amount was at stake, but it was in court. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Now the hon. member refers to the two valuators. The hon. member need not be concerned about those two valuators. The properties at Port St. Johns are not the only properties they have valued for us. Those two valuators have valued several other properties for us in the Transkei and in the Ciskei. The one person originally came from the Transvaal and the other from King William&#x2019;s Town. It was merely a funny trick on the part of the Sunday papers to say: &#x201C;They were specially flown from Pretoria. &#x2019;&#x2019; This is utter nonsense. I do not know whether they perhaps walked from Pretoria if they were there, but both those men are experienced men in the property market, sworn appraisers, experienced people, people appointed by our department for the Adjustment Committee to carry out those valuations in the Transkei and the Ciskei. I do not know whether they will still be available indefinitely, but we may most definitely use them again if we want to. We do not only have the one man in the Transkei we have to use, the person whom the hon. member referred to a moment ago. He is still being used, but others are also used. He was not the only man who was used in the past, and these two people were not used for Port St. Johns alone. Prior to Port St. Johns, a great many other properties were also valued by them.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the forms, or rather, he asked me about the forms and then did not understand my interjection at all. I read in the newspapers that we allegedly deviated from the prescribed procedure on two important points. The one was with reference to advertising, which the hon. member referred to this afternoon&#x2014;I shall deal with this presently&#x2014;and the other was with reference to the forms which were not completed or not submitted to the magistrate at Port St. Johns, as is stated in the circular and applies since 1966. Yes, the forms were not submitted to the magistrate; they were submitted directly to us. What does it really matter?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<p>It is not the correct procedure.</p>

</speech>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But good grief, Sir, what is the procedure? [Interjections.] Sir, the hon. member is upsetting himself now because &#x2026; [Interjections.] First calm down. Sir, what is <span class="col_1265-1266" refersTo="page_0649"/>the meaning of those forms? Does the hon. member think, and do those senseless little newspapermen who write about things they know nothing about, think that the magistrate of Port St. Johns has to finalize those forms? Sir, he is merely a local representative of the local people, and the same procedure applies in all 22 Transkei and Ciskei towns. The owner completes the forms and submits them to the magistrate and he forwards them to us, just as they are. [Interjections.] Sir, there is an hon. member who does not want to hear what I have to say. Would you not rather allow him to leave the House? I am talking to the hon. member for Griqualand East, if the hon. member will give me a chance to do so. [Interjections.] Yes, he may leave the chamber before it is too late. Those forms are received by the magistrate merely in transit, on their way to us. The people in Pretoria where the negotiations took place, completed the forms. I saw them in the files myself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But the hon. member did not refer to forms.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member did not, but other people referred to them. I said I was going to deal with all the points. I now come to the second point about which the hon. member raised such a hue and cry where, according to him, the procedure was deviated from. This concerns the so-called advertisements, why the properties of those two companies were not advertised. Sir, what are the requirements concerning advertising? What, must I ask first, is the purpose of this whole property take-over? The purpose of it is that Whites who have property in those parts of the Transkei which become Black, must have their properties taken over by Black people. If there are not Black people to take them over immediately, the Trust with its machinery and the corporation and the Adjustment Committee come along and buy it. The requirement was that the ordinary people who owned houses and small properties, should first try to find a Black buyer through advertising. Sir, that advertisement is not meant for Whites, for Blacks or for anyone. That advertisement is only meant for Black owners, the colour group which should be the ultimate owners of the Transkei. In this case we decided that they do not advertise for Black buyers. Why? This is obvious: Which Black buyers would have come forward to buy these properties? It was impractical for another reason. If those Black buyers had bought any property, and steps had been taken so that the townships were later proclaimed while the Black buyer was in possession of the property, the State President would have been required to grant a Black buyer permission to own a property in a White area. This is the reason why we have the provision that no transfer takes place before the zoning is approved, because once the zoning and the declaration as a released area are approved, a Black man, or whoever is allowed to buy in that zoned area, may buy. The hon. member should know those legal provisions. Therefore the fact that no advertisements were published, means absolutely nothing. This would only have been a waste of time and would only have caused further delay.</p>

However, I promise to continue in the Third Reading debate, if the rules of the House allow me to do so. Now I shall reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what he meant when he said that the proper procedure had been followed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The normal procedure? Yes, that is the part I still have to deal with&#x2014;the White paper and all the other things. [Interjections.] There is a Dutch saying: &#x201C;Empty vessels make the most noise.&#x201D; The valuations took place according to the basis laid down by the Adjustment Committee. This is what I mean when I speak of the prescribed procedure. A procedure has been prescribed, and the hon. member has been a member of this House long enough to appreciate this. If he looks through his old papers, he will find it there. Here is a copy of White Paper CC of 1964. In this the Government laid down what the procedure is when white properties are bought in Transkei towns. The Adjustment Committee was announced in this White Paper. This is the procedure, and we have <span class="col_1267-1268" refersTo="page_0650"/>followed the procedure throughout. I would like to tell the hon. member that the White Paper does not even mention the form, neither the advertisement. This is an administrative arrangement which I introduced myself.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the basis laid down in the White Paper, was followed. We used the valuators appointed by the Adjustment Committee and the valuators made their valuations on the basis laid down by the Adjustment Committee. Everything was done according to the criterion laid down by the Adjustment Committee. The valuations were completed towards the end of July, and by the end of July 1975 the negotiations took place with the owners of the two companies. Negotiations were conducted about prices. Of course, they wanted more and we wanted to pay less, and so on. These negotiations took place mainly with the Deputy Minister. In fact, I never saw Henning and saw Schoeman only on one occasion when he came to see me. The Deputy Minister of that time handled the whole matter correctly to its conclusion. Then the prices were agreed upon, i.e. R1 212 967 and in the case of Schoeman R800 000. In both cases the prices were within the valuation. It is most important to take note of this. Now I should like to deal with the two valuations. I have copies of the valuation lists here. In the few minutes left to me, I would like to say what I intend doing in future. I want to go through these two valuation lists with this House to show the intensive and thorough manner in which the valuators went to work to arrive at a valuation. Secondly, I would like to point out some of the special conditions which we laid down at the time of the sale, and then I want to refer to certain aspects in general, i.e. the prescribed provisions contained in the White Paper, how they work and what action was taken. I also want to talk about the ridiculous story that the cost price was used as a basis, a matter which the hon. member for Griqualand East also referred to this afternoon, although he is a lawyer. He asked that the original cost price be used as a basis for the calculation of the present purchase price. I shall deal with all these matters. I also want to deal with the question of priorities and the action we take in respect thereof, but I regret that we shall not be able to deal with all these matters this afternoon. I can do nothing about it, because I have only half an hour at my disposal and there is no more time available to do so in this debate. [Interjections.] I did not waste a minute, except on the interjection made by the hon. member. Before dealing with the valuations one at a time, I shall furnish hon. members with a very comprehensive explanation of it in so far as I am prepared to divulge confidential information.</p>

<p>Hon. members must take note of this. They can giggle and balk as much as they like, but I cannot divulge the intrinsic particulars because this may hamper us in hundreds of other transactions we still have to finalize in the Transkei, Ciskei, including Port St. Johns, and many other places. For that reason I cannot table the valuation lists, as I have already said. We will continue with this tomorrow.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope that the hon. the Minister for Bantu Administration and Development will take some time off to relax before we come to the Third Reading, because when I listened to him today, I could somehow not help feeling that he was worried about this. So far he has not given us any information which detracts from our request that a commission of inquiry should be appointed into the whole affair. The hon. the Minister said, in reply to a question which I put to him on Friday, that there was no basic priority scheme for Port St. Johns. I believe that he is playing with words, for what is then the value of sending out a circular addressed to all the owners of land in the township of Port St. Johns setting out the priority scheme. This circular has cruelly mislead the people of Port St. Johns. For the Minister to say that there is no priority scheme for Port St. Johns, is to play with words. The hon. the Minister said there was no need to advertise. I want to tell him that had he advertised the scheme or that the properties were up for sale to the Bantu Trust he need not have paid as much as he had paid. The public&#x2019;s attention would have been drawn to the fact that this transaction is about to take place, and many of the people who were in the process of buying plots prior to proclamation, would have been warned not to touch these plots, not to buy them. I have no doubt that we will hear more in the Third Reading.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested to know the basis of valuation, because in a statement made by the hon. the Minister last week he mentioned that the land had been subdivided into a survey township at the time the Trust <span class="col_1269-1270" refersTo="page_0651"/>started negotiations. As far as the Schoeman land was concerned, only that part which is valued at one-third of the total cost price&#x2014;the 63 stands&#x2014;were in any way affected by the survey diagram. The other for which the hon. the Minister has paid Mr. Schoeman the amount of R550 000 was at no stage surveyed. It was at no stage a township; it was merely a town planner&#x2019;s recommendation that such a scheme could be developed. There are other questions which should, in particular, be directed to the hon. the Minister for Water Affairs, the Deputy Minister concerned at the time. When did Schoeman and Henning first get into touch with him? I believe that it was not when Parliament was dealing with the matter, but during December 1973 and in January 1974. The hon. the Minister has said that as soon as Parliament gave the green light he decided to proceed with the scheme. I put it to the hon. the Minister: When did he tell Prof. Schoeman that this land would be bought out? When did he tell them that this area was going to be a Black area? I believe that the information was given to Mr. Schoeman and Mr. Henning ahead of the information given to the general public. Before Parliament and the general public knew these two gentlemen were apprized that Port St. Johns was going to be Black. I want the hon. the Minister to tell us whether this was so or not, that he went and told land speculators what he had in mind but not the general public. I put it to him: When did he tell either Henning or Schoeman that his department would buy the land?</p>

<p>I did not tell &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>It was told way back in 1974, long before the decision of this Parliament. I know that we will have further debates on this subject but I hope that in the end we are going to get the commission of inquiry which the matter deserves.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want now to turn the debate to a subject which is dominating public discussion and public thought in South Africa today, and that is the Angolan situation. I especially want to look at the developments during the last two or three days and I want to look at the consequences of some of these developments for South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that the story is gradually unfolding. There are reports from Washington, reports from Lusaka and the stories told by our own young men who are returning from the border and from areas beyond that. We on this side of the House have said all along that the Government has not only not told the whole story, but that the Government has not told the whole truth. Mr. Speaker, unless the Prime Minister and the Government reject the reports of the statements made by Dr. Jonas Savimbi which appeared in <i>Rapport</i> yesterday, then I say that those statements of Dr. Savimbi indicate that the Government has not told the truth. The Prime Minister, in this House, went out of his way&#x2014;I do not have the time to quote it, but I can give the column references&#x2014;to say that we were in no way involved in a civil war. Three times he said: &#x201C;I tell you we were in no way involved in a civil war. We were not a party to a civil war.&#x201D; Yet, Mr. Speaker, when one looks at what Dr. Jonas Savimbi said&#x2014;if it is to be accepted as correct&#x2014;we were directly involved. We were involved on a partisan basis, and in support of Dr. Jonas Savimbi. I am not arguing the rights or wrongs, but I am saying that, as a result of what has happened over the past four months&#x2014;the secretiveness of this Government and the deviousness with which it dealt not with this House, but with the people outside&#x2014;this Government has broken a bond of trust which has traditionally existed between the Government of South Africa and the people of South Africa, no matter what political party they belong to. This is what has happened, Mr. Speaker. Until the Prime Minister or the Leader of this House repudiates the statement attributed to Dr. Jonas Savimbi, we will have to say that this Government continues to live and to operate under a cloud of mistrust as far as the people of South Africa are concerned.</p>

<p>So much about the past. What is much more important, are the consequences for the future. I hope, although there seems to be a lull in the tension and in the fighting, that we are not going to slip back into any mood of complacency. I believe that the dangers that flow from our involvement in Angola are just as great today as they were three days ago, and in fact they are going to be just as great in the years to come. I want to touch on this briefly on three critical areas. The first relates to our involvement in Angola, the second to South West <span class="col_1271-1272" refersTo="page_0652"/>Africa, and the third to the situation within South Africa as a result of our involvement in Angola.</p>

<p>As far as Angola is concerned, a couple of points have been made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, but I want to restate that I believe every effort should be made to achieve a negotiated settlement regarding the unfinished Ruacana and Calueque schemes. I believe that this Government made a serious error in using its protection of these schemes as the cover-up for its major involvement in the civil war. It has brought these two schemes not into the sphere of the protection of some services, but into the whole sphere of international tension and conflict.</p>

<p>I also hope that the Minister will make it clear that South Africa <i>per se</i> has no interest in these schemes, that we were there purely as the administrators of South West Africa, and that we were acting on behalf of the people of South West Africa, to whom we intend to hand these assets when they accept independence in a short while. Secondly, as far as Angola is concerned, we still have troops in southern Angola. The Minister is reported differently in the Washington newspaper from the way in which he is reported in South Africa. According to the Washington newspaper he said we were up to 80 km across the border into southern Angola at points and that this reduced to 30 km in places. Be that as it may, I believe that this Government should take all possible steps to withdraw the South African forces from Angola. We believe that the presence of South African forces on Angolan soil on any continuing basis is fraught with the greatest dangers for South Africa. We obviously have to protect the borders of South West Africa as they move towards independence. Obviously we have to hit back in no uncertain way against people who violate those borders, but if our forces should be trapped in a war on foreign soil outside the borders of South West Africa, I believe that South Africa will be falling for the very trap which the Russians are setting for us. I believe the Government must weigh up very carefully indeed the advantages of being on the other side of the border against the very grave disadvantages and dangers which are inherent of the situation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I believe that as soon as an effective authority emerges in Angola, this Government should take immediate steps to normalize relationships between Angola and South Africa. More than this, the Government should go out of its way to offer technical and other aid to Angola in order to get its economy going again.</p>

<p>Fourthly, there has been a new development. There has been an announcement by Dr. Jonas Savimbi of Unita that he is now going over to guerrilla warfare. I hope this Government will say, in unambiguous terms and without any delay, that whatever the relationship with Dr. Savimbi is, South Africa will under no circumstances support any guerrilla movement in any country. I say this because there is a relationship between the South African Government and Unita. I believe it is of tremendous importance, before it is thought that we are now involved in assisting guerrilla movements, that this Government should publicly declare that we will have nothing to do with guerrilla campaigns in any part of Africa or in any part of the world. I believe it is important that such declaration should be made without delay.</p>

<p>As far as South West Africa is concerned, the hon. member for Von Brandis and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition pointed to the need to speed up the time-table for self-determination for that territory. They also pointed out the need to try to include in the constitutional talks people other than those present now&#x2014;if possible, the domestic wing of Swapo. I believe that other people should be included, including the Federal Party of South West Africa, to see that it is not only constituted on an ethnic basis. The Government should be moving towards the establishment of a multi-racial provisional government. There has to be an interim phase. I believe that we should be moving into the phase of establishing a multi-racial or, as the people on that side of the House might like to call it, a multi-ethnic provisional government for the peoples of South West Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Administration in South West Africa there has done well in eliminating discrimination in the social field. I believe it should take the next step and throw open the civil administration of South West Africa to all the peoples of South West Africa on a non-discriminatory basis. I believe that serious and urgent attention should be given to the phasing out of direct representation of South West Africa in this House. If this is not going to be phased out, I believe that people other than Whites should also have the right to be <span class="col_1273-1274" refersTo="page_0653"/>represented in this House. I believe it becomes an affront to the whole concept of self-determination if only Whites have representation here, while members of the other communities do not. I further believe that this Government should start moving in the direction of setting up separate South West African citizenship for those people who claim to be of South West Africa. When it came to the Bantu homelands the Government immediately said that each Black citizen would become a citizen of that particular homeland, because identification as a citizen was necessary before moving into independence. I would suggest that this step of setting up citizenship for South West Africa is a very necessary and urgent prerequisite for independence for that territory.</p>

<p>Having said that about countries to the north and the territory over which we have jurisdiction and for which we have responsibility, I want to direct the attention of this House to what I believe are certain important aspects of mood and attitude in race relations which have developed as a result of the Angolan situation. I believe that the effective defence of South Africa has now become a matter of critical importance. But having said that, let us not delude ourselves. We Whites will never be able effectively to defend South Africa from attacks across our border or from subversion within, unless we have the unqualified support of Black South Africans. Four million Whites, without the support of 21 million Blacks, will not be able to provide an effective defence of South Africa. This is something we should be looking at this moment. To what extent can we count on the masses of Black and Brown people in this country for the effective total defence of South Africa? It is a pity that we do not have in this House Black leaders who could tell us of the mood and the attitude of the Black people. I believe that, at this stage, we would come in for a rude shock, because all the indications are that a significant number of the Black people of South Africa will not be able to throw themselves in the way we would wish them to, to the defence of South Africa at the present stage.</p>

<p>I will probably be accused of saying an unpalatable thing, but I believe that, unless these things are said, we shall go on living in cloud cuckooland. There must not be any doubt about this: There will be some Blacks who will rally round the White Government, but the masses, the young people, the educated people, the articulate, the politically-aware people, perhaps will not. We would like to attempt to try to ascertain the attitude of Blacks but I admit that it is not easy. But there is no doubt that more and more Blacks are seeing what is happening to the north of us in a White man&#x2019;s war.</p>

<p>They do not see this as South Africa&#x2019;s war or their war. They see it as a White man&#x2019;s war, and many Black people see what is happening in the north and in Angola as part of the process of their liberation from discrimination and domination within South Africa. Let us make no mistake about this. Just as many of them cheered the Frelimo victories in Mozambique, so I believe that many of the Black people of South Africa are getting a silent satisfaction out of the successes of the MPLA. I am saying these things because I believe that there is an element of tragedy in this. I believe the Black people want to give their loyalty to South Africa, and yet this Government is making it impossible for them to do so. This Government has cut Black South Africa out of the decision-making process, especially the decisions about whether we should go to war or not. It has told the Blacks that they are not South Africans. It has given them separate citizenship. It has conceded that the Coloureds and Indians are South Africans, but it has then proceeded to humiliate them by treating their citizenship as second-class. I now want to test hon. members present. When Black people listen to hon. members on the other side talking about defending South Africa, they get the impression that hon. members over there are talking about defending White South Africa. Is that right or wrong? Is that what they mean by defending South Africa? Are the Blacks right in saying that Government members are speaking of White South Africa? When hon. members opposite talk of loyalty to South Africa, do they talk&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister can answer me. When they hear hon. members on the other side speaking about loyalty to South Africa, the Blacks interpret this to mean loyalty to White South Africa.

When speaking of patriotism, we want those hon. members to say they do not mean a commitment to the <i>status quo</i> or to the White man&#x2019;s position or to apartheid and separate development. The Black man interprets their calls for patriotism as having a political and racial connotation. When the Black man hears the hon. members opposite calling for national unity, does he feel that the Black people are included? Let me now ask if the Black people are included when they talk of national unity. No, the Black people do not believe that because it is not a true national unity encompassing all the people and all the groups of this land.</p>

<p>By adopting these attitudes&#x2014;and this includes the hon. member for Waterkloof&#x2014;of excluding Blacks from South African unity, they are making it impossible for Black South Africans to give their loyalty to the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>In this situation of mounting tension, I do not believe that Black South Africans, in a moment of conflict, are going to take sides because of ideological calls. Blacks are not going to respond to the call of Communism or the call of Western democracy or the free world. The attitude of Black people, in this time of pending conflict in South Africa, is going to be determined by the impact of their experience in their daily lives in South Africa. This is going to be the decisive factor. Their decision about whose side they are going to take is not going to depend on generalities. It is going to depend upon the impact of the Group Areas Act, job reservation, the pass laws, their rejection, their exclusion and the humiliations they have to endure each day in this apartheid society. Their opinions are going to be formed on the basis of the inequalities they see in housing, wages, education and advancement. Their attitudes are also going to be formed on the basis of the discrimination they suffer. Hon. members must read the Snyman Report. Let them read that report and see what these people feel.</p>

<p>If there is this danger, as the result of the policies and attitudes of the members opposite, it is made even more dangerous because of the impetus which the Angolan situation has given to the forces of division in this society. We must make no mistake about this. What is happening up north is divisive. White South Africans, in the main, are being swept up into a new White patriotic laager, and more and more Black people are growing together, confident that their liberation from discrimination is just around the comer. This is what is happening. This is the divisive impact of Angola. I have the fear that intransigence is going to be met by increasing intransigence, that arrogance is going to be met by increasing arrogance and stubborness by increasing stubborness.</p>

<p>This is the situation in which we find ourselves. I believe that South Africa is poised on a knife-edge between greatness on the one hand and disaster on the other; greatness if, as the result of the trauma of our experience in Angola, there comes a new commitment to a new national unity embracing all the people of South Africa; disaster if we in South Africa face the future as a divided people. That is the choice. On the shoulders of the hon. the Prime Minister, in particular, and on the shoulders of all of us in this House, rests a very heavy responsibility indeed. I believe this to be a matter of urgency arising out of the situation that has unfolded over the past four months. We must make a commitment to a unity that embraces all South Africans. We must now proceed to repair the damage that history and practice and legislation have done to the fabric of our society. I want to suggest to the hon. the Prime Minister that he takes a leaf out of the book of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. When the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs had to fight inflation last year he called in the leaders of commerce and industry &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>He called a meeting of all the leaders of the various groups involved. I suggest we should do the same thing at this stage. In the face of a crisis, in the face of pending conflict in South Africa, the hon. the Prime Minister should call together the leaders of the people. If hon. members do not believe me, let him hear and let us hear from the Black people of South Africa about their frustration at the present time, about the agonizing problem they have of reconciling their love for South Africa with their hatred of a racial system under which they have to live in this country. This is the situation. I do not believe we can at this stage determine the end of the road to the future. What we should be able to do, however, at this moment of crisis is at least to decide on the first and immediate steps that we should be taking in order to bring South Africans together. I believe that out of such a conference, such a council for national unity, could come a new definition of South African patriotism, a patriotism which is not White patriotism or Black patriotism, but South African patriotism, a patriotism not geared to protect one section of the community, not geared to maintain White privilege or White domination, but a patriotism committed to defending the rights of all South Africans irrespective of their race. I believe that this is a critical stage in South Africa&#x2019;s history. We are, in fact, poised on a knife-edge between greatness which could be ours, and disaster which will be ours if we go into the future divided. I therefore urge the Prime Minister to respond, to rise above party politics and accept as his credo, and the credo of South Africa, a patriotism which is South African and which includes all the people of this country.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Sea Point amazed me and, I think, most of the hon. members in this House by his demonstration this afternoon. He tried to exploit a situation for political gain. The patriotism of that group has long been suspect and this afternoon the matter was put beyond all doubt. He came here in order to try to put forward their philosophy as the salvation of South Africa. He is acting irresponsibly in regard to human relations and in regard to the future of South Africa too, particularly the future of White South Africa. He said that it was mainly Whites who were fighting, but I want to tell him that Blacks are being trained everywhere. He wanted to know for whom the Whites were fighting. Are we not fighting for Black South Africa too? He tried to create the impression here that we were not fighting for the other peoples as well. He came along with these extravagant statements in order to boost his party&#x2019;s prestige a little owing to their demonstration of a lack of loyalty towards South Africa. I fear that he has not succeeded in this aim, but instead that he has once again placed himself and his people under suspicion. I do not want to dwell further on the hon. member. He raised certain important matters in connection with Angola and that will be replied to in good time.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the issue of land purchases, specifically land purchases at Port St. Johns, an issue which has been dealt with in great detail by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I shall not discuss the aspects of the matter dealt with by the hon. the Minister. He stated that we had co-operated very closely and I want to express my appreciation for the co-operation I had from the hon. the Minister for many years. I shall therefore leave the details of this matter to the hon. the Minister. Hon. members need not be afraid that I shall get excited about this. I shall do my best not to get excited, although hon. members will realize that as far as this matter is concerned there is a great deal of provocation.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to deal with the question put by the hon. member for Sea Point, viz. whether the people were informed before Parliament decided. I think the hon. the Minister has already replied to this question. To be specific, he said that when it became known that the inclusion of Port St. Johns would be considered, some of those people&#x2014;not Henning, but certainly Schoeman&#x2014;came and asked what they had to do. I informed the newspapers of this. After consultation with the Minister and the department I informed Schoeman and told him: &#x201C;I think that this is for the best; I cannot give you an assurance, because Parliament must still decide. Once Parliament has decided, we can discuss the matter further. But I think it is in your interest to stop this development because it is going to <span class="col_1279-1280" refersTo="page_0656"/>cost the taxpayer money if we should have to buy. If you can do that, we shall give you priority in due course.&#x201D; In other words, here we were taking deliberate action at an early stage in order to prevent unnecessary development.</p>

<p>Why were there only discussions with these two people? Why was a general announcement not made?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>These people specifically came and asked us. They said that they were engaged in this matter. One cannot make a public announcement on every occasion in regard to a man&#x2019;s personal problem. It is merely the specific circumstances which caused this. These people&#x2014;first the one and later the other&#x2014;came and asked about the situation.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to the campaign which has been waged in the Press over the past week. This is virtually all the hon. member for Griqualand East had to base his argument on. He quoted left, right and centre from the Press. In all the time that I was Deputy Minister of Bantu Development&#x2014;a period of almost five years&#x2014;I had a great deal to do with the issue of land and the emotions which it involved, and I want to say that I have great appreciation for our farmers in particular, but also for landowners in general for the calm and responsible way in which they approached this matter. I mention this because of certain insinuations that have been made by the other side of the House. It has been alleged that we have simply been riding roughshod over these people and have not been consulting them. Consequently I want to convey my appreciation for the co-operation we have had.</p>

<p>Let me now refer very briefly to the newspapers which have been quoted at such length by the hon. member for Griqualand East. I want to tell hon. members candidly that I do not have the time to set right every newspaper story, every wild rumour, and to ask the newspapers to set the record straight. I gave certain newspapers information when they phoned me. I tried to behave as decently as possible towards the Press. Which newspapers in particular were involved? I told <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> for example: &#x201C;Read back what I have told you; you can place it as it stands.&#x201D; As far as I can remember, I read through it quickly and found nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>With the <i>Sunday Times</i> it was a different matter. They say that I made inconsistent statements, but I told them expressly that I was dealing with the matters and can clearly remember that I finalized the case of Schoeman and granted approval in that regard, but that I had no clear memory of giving approval in regard to the case of Henning. What I said was: &#x201C;There was a question of adjustment committee funds and I should prefer not to tell you now&#x201D; and as soon as I had made sure, I told them. I say honestly and candidly: &#x201C;I have nothing to hide.&#x201D; Let me say at once that if there are people who want a commission of inquiry&#x2014;to me it would be very inappropriate to appoint a commission of inquiry for every newspaper rumour, every piece of gossip&#x2014;I am quite prepared to state my case. I shall have no objection whatsoever except to the principle that a commission of inquiry should be appointed and a lot of time and money wasted for every piece of gossip. If we want to publish figures and the hon. the Minister provides further details&#x2014;we agreed that he would deal with those matters and that I would deal with this aspect or would act as I saw fit&#x2014;then I have no objection. However, we must bear in mind that if we make the details of one case available, it may be expected of us to make them available in regard to all cases. I want to ask the Opposition whether they want us to make all transactions public. After all, one cannot publish details merely because the <i>Sunday Times</i> has a gossip story. What has happened here? They only refer to Henning and Dr. Schoeman, but Upton is right in the background. However the principle is the same. Afrikaners from elsewhere are involved in that.</p>

<p>No, Upton&#x2019;s case concerns a farm. It does not come out of adjustment committee funds because those funds are for urban areas. We decided that the South African Bantu Trust would buy the farms and the adjustment committee the rest. The adjustment committee funds were available.

<p>I cannot quite hear what the hon. member is saying; but I shall tell him what the principle is in Upton&#x2019;s case. This man who was charged and sentenced came to us. We then said what we always say when people have problems and we feel that the normal interaction of supply and demand is absent because the Government has said that the Trust is going to buy there. [Interjections.] It is possible that this may influence the prices, but I shall deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s people. That is why we interfered in Upton&#x2019;s case. In that case it was his personal financial problem. In the other two cases an advantage for the Government was in involved. What story would we have heard if we had waited? They would then have said: &#x201C;You knew those people were going to develop. Look at the development you allow. You allow them to continue; you allow them to sell the plots and effect improvements and only now do you want to buy it. Why did you not put a stop to it and buy?&#x201D; That is the story one would have had then. They would have said: &#x201C;It cost millions. See how you are wasting the money.&#x201D; The Opposition wants the best of both worlds. That is why their situation is what it is. One cannot be opportunistic.

We then told him: &#x201C;Abandon all further development.

<p>Had he bought it at that stage?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He had committed himself to purchase and I could not stop him from going ahead with the transaction because I should then have had to negotiate with more people. That is the position. His whole set-up comprised a certain complex in respect of which he had commitments.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the newspaper reports. I find it regrettable that whereas we are dealing here with a matter of general importance, a matter like the purchase of land, which arouses emotions because it constitutes the personal possessions of people, some people kick up a fuss for political gain. I do not mind criticism; to me it is only right that there should be criticism. However, I find it regrettable that statements I have made are taken out of context in newspapers with the aim of arousing emotions and blackening people&#x2019;s names in order to see whether some benefit may not perhaps be derived from the matter in this way. About <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> I want to say nothing. This is the newspaper which sent stories about Dimbaza abroad. This is the newspaper which did not hesitate to place its own country under suspicion and foul its own nest. What can I as an individual expect of that newspaper? If a person has no feeling for his fatherland, what feeling will he have for a person? I expect nothing from this newspaper, because this is a newspaper from which the biggest stories about South Africa in general and Dimbaza in particular are sent abroad. The most flagrant untruths I have received back from abroad have been quoted virtually verbatim from <i>The Sunday Tribune&#x2019;s</i> stories about Dimbaza, stories which were devoid of truth. Consequently I have no more to say about <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i></p>

<p><span class="col_1283-1284" refersTo="page_0658"/>The <i>Sunday Times</i> mentions two points on which I had supposedly backed down. One point was that I said that I was not sure. I said that I was not sure, and now the hon. member wants me to tell him how I could not have been sure. I have personally examined hundreds of transactions. The Minister instructed me to examine every transaction, irrespective of whether a hundred rand or a million rand was at stake. I examined every one and analysed them all to the best of my ability. I discussed the purchases with people who had problems. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and the other hon. members over there know about this. The hon. member for Griqualand East states that we make exceptions. For what exception did he come and make representations to me? He wants us to buy out a shop in a Black spot since the Black spot is going to be moved some day and the owner may suffer as a result. This is a matter which is now being dealt with through the hon. the Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, of Planning and the Environment and of Statistics. The hon. member knows about the case; he has been dealing with it for years. [Interjections.] We have hundreds of cases and when the time is ripe each case is dealt with on its merits. However, the hon. member is asking that we should buy out a shop which is in a Black spot and where nothing has happened yet. On the one hand he complains that priority is given in certain cases and states that we are benefiting certain people in this way and on the other hand he asks for priority to be given. [Interjections.] Unfortunately people have shown tremendous enthusiasm in trying to exploit this delicate situation. The hon. member for Albany is not present this afternoon. He, too, made quite a fuss about this matter. He says that we were disturbing sound relations in the process. In the course of carrying out my task as regards the purchase of land, I told people that the task of obtaining approval for borders had given rise to difficulties, but the man who has to buy out all the land and satisfy everyone is going to experience bigger difficulties. I did not have the slightest doubt about this. Nevertheless I received letters of congratulation and thanks from two homeland leaders for land which had been consolidated during the period that that task was entrusted to me. Surely this is conducive to good relations. Of that there can be no doubt. We do not receive much thanks for this task and for that reason I sincerely hope that the new Deputy Minister of Bantu Development will meet with a favourable attitude and will receive the necessary assistance.</p>

<p>As far as priorities are concerned, I want to dwell on the way in which they are determined and the problems which arise from this. However, I must first point out that this was not the first transaction which had to be given priority. Hon. members will remember that little more than a year ago we requested special authorization from Parliament for the purchase of the Zebediela estate because we wanted to give it preferential treatment. It would not have been necessary for us to approach Parliament had it not been that this area had not yet been declared a released area. I requested the department to thrash out the matter before reporting to the Minister. I wanted to know whether we could not do this without parliamentary approval, since it took three years of delicate negotiations. I myself conducted many of the negotiations but for the most part they were conducted by the department. We then approached Parliament. The PRP voted in favour of it, but not the UP. It was in the interests of the country that the estate should have been purchased and more than R8 million was involved in the transaction. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South made a tremendous fuss about it, but he should ask us today how affairs are progressing at Zebediela. At the time he was disparaging about the matter and the hon. members in his party voted against it. If there had been sufficient time in regard to the case under discussion, we could have come to Parliament in this regard, too, but there was insufficient time and furthermore it was unnecessary. As I have said, in the case of Zebediela it was necessary because it did not fall within a released area. If this had not been the case and if it had been a unit, we should have been able to take it further without approaching Parliament. I referred to Zebediela in order to indicate that the State had its own priorities and that it was in the interests of the country and to the benefit of the taxpayers that certain matters be given priority.</p>

<p>I now come to a further aspect as far as the <i>Sunday Times</i> is concerned. I told the people that we would give them priority, but it was then alleged that I had said &#x201C;Top priority&#x201D;. There is always an attempt to give the thing a <span class="col_1285-1286" refersTo="page_0659"/>twist. I said that the people would be accorded priority because they had co-operated in the interests of the country. I have nothing to hide. I did not say that top priority would be given, although it is now being alleged that I did in fact say that. Probably one gets differences of degree, but all these little things are used in an attempt to blacken people&#x2019;s names and sow suspicion. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development will probably furnish further details, but I want to point out that I looked at the valuations. Capable men submitted valuations and provided motivations. The Department also perused the valuations and submitted them to me. I asked whether there were difficulties in regard to the valuations although I was unable to find any difficulties. The valuations were thoroughly checked by people who had carried out a great many valuations themselves. However, we find this sowing of suspicion. I can do no more than say that I perused the valuations and could find no reason why our people could not make offers based on those valuations. I submitted the valuations to the Minister and certain offers were then made. We asked one person concerned to make us an offer. I want to leave the matter at that and speak in general terms.</p>

<p>I want to say something about the sowing of suspicion. I sacrificed part of my holiday and went to the Transkei because I had been unable to find the time to visit certain areas last year. I was also charged with agricultural development and was simply unable to find time for everything. As far back as October I phoned to find out whether I could be accommodated at a certain hotel. I was informed that no accommodation was available. At the time I thought that I would leave it at that. Later I heard that it was possible that I might in fact be able to stay there for a few days. I could have gone to stay in Umtata, but I wanted to visit other areas and towns like Lusikisiki, too, because important decisions concerning the Transkei had to be taken in Parliament and because my department had to take important decisions in regard to development in the Transkei. Consequently I had to be in possession of the facts. Then I made use of accommodation there which happened to be offered. It was all I could get, and this too, is dragged up and I am slandered. I now want to leave it at that and I do not want to dwell on it any further. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, I now want to come to the hon. member for King Williams Town. [Interjections.] You will get information concerning the valuations from the Minister, as much as he wants to supply. I want to suggest that possibly he could inform the Leader of the Progressive Party and the Leader of the Opposition about these things, but I do not want to dwell on this further, except to say that the matter was dealt with directly and openly and honestly. But then the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town came along and, in the debate here the other day, stated that the land was proclaimed in 1952. It seems to me that he was just as confused about his dates as about the motorcars, because it must surely have been 1972. Now my department and I have drawn up a programme and it has been approved and published. He complains about Braunschweig. That land was to have been purchased. This was envisaged for 1978. The people then made representations and we said that we would advance the date. Now I want to tell you, Sir, what problems there are, because it is important that the House take cognizance of them. I listened to that hon. member&#x2019;s problems, just as I listened to the problems of other members. Each of their voters received the same treatment and they will continue to receive the same treatment in the future.</p>

<p>What are the problems as regards these properties at Braunschweig and at Wooldridge? Some people offer land while not enjoying ownership of the land, and one has to determine what the state of affairs is. Now people come along and tell us that they have been there for 150 years with their families and they thought that it was their land. Now they have to go to court and prove their right in court and request a court order confirming their right to stay on the land because they have been staying there for so long. If the court grants them this, they have to go to the Deeds Office. Then, too, there are people who have properties in the town with a right in the commonage. These things are registered and have to be valued separately. There is endless difficulty. This Parliament votes a certain sum of money. Parliament votes that we should purchase for that sum of money. Now my department has to make a reasonable and approximate estimate of where we can buy land with that sum of money. A rough estimate is made, but we do not know what that land is going to cost before we have valuations. We <span class="col_1287-1288" refersTo="page_0660"/>have only an approximate idea of the value of the land.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. One does not know what the land will cost. When one makes an offer, one does not know whether the farmer is going to accept it. In the beginning we gave people a long time. Now they sit and brood. They have an offer, but they do not let us know. Consequently one does not know whether those people are going to accept the offer or not, and we have only a certain amount which has been budgeted. And if they should accept it, one does not know when registration will go through, because each of those farmers can use his own attorney.</p>

<p>In other words, one has these three unknown factors whereas one has only a certain sum which one can spend. The point is this, that one cannot wait for people indefinitely. But we gave those people a chance and we were then instructed that we should not spend any more money. We then had to notify immediately all those people who had not yet accepted. For how long have they not been sitting and brooding on those offers? I was sorry to do it, but we then let them know that we could not continue. After all, these are not matters which are under our control. We then let them know that the offers had been withdrawn. But after all, we told the farmers many times that they should not incur obligations before they had their money, because we are aware of the practical problems one comes across on registration. They only receive the money when the transfer has been registered. Braunschweig was on the programme for 1974. Peddie was on the programme for 1978.</p>

<p>I think that is correct, but the fact is that we made a start and we had all these practical problems. Now we could not wait until Braunschweig had been dealt with. If we should come to the end of the year without having been able to obtain transfer for these people or pay out the money, then surely the Opposition is going to shout blue murder and ask what we are doing. If delays and problems occur, then we take the following section. So we moved into the Peddie section. We were going to purchase and carry out valuations there, and we made offers. I have the highest praise for the dedication of our department in the light of the enormous number of transactions and the problems which they involved. They tried to be objective in dealing with these matters. Sir, perhaps I should say in regard to this whole matter that I had to address hundreds of people. Now the newspapers say that if one buys a farmer&#x2019;s land, apparently one may not greet him afterwards because as soon as one talks to him he is a friend of yours. I have said this before, and I want to say it again here, that if I had made friends with all those hundreds of farmers who came to see my department and me, then I have many good and stable friends in this country. I do not doubt that my department will make even more friends in the constituency of that hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, too. We try to obtain co-operation. The hon. member must not come along with stories. After all, we warn those farmers and I want to repeat today that they should not incur obligations before they receive their money.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not prepared to give an indication because we cannot pay out before all those cases of theirs are in order. Those whose cases are in order will be considered this year, but I cannot give that assurance. I have compiled a programme and every time we inform the farmers of it, I tell the department that they should state that it is subject to the availability of funds. We have stated this repeatedly. The hon. member should go back and do his job, or else there is going to be danger for him in that constituency. After all, the hon. member states here that I handled the matter badly and that I am incapable, but the reason he is making such a fuss, Sir, is that he feels the problems of King William&#x2019;s Town getting closer to him.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one matter to which I want to draw attention very forcibly here concerning leasing and re-leasing, particularly at Port St. Johns. The newspapers keep saying that the land has been leased back to the people for five years. It has not been leased back for five years. It was taken over at a stage when we did not have people to take over the management, and it was then approved that they would lease <span class="col_1289-1290" refersTo="page_0661"/>it back for R5 000, until the department was in a position to take it over. It was leased back for R5 000, until the department was in a position to take it over.</p>

<p>Within five years?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they can take over at any time after a year has passed. We are giving the department a year in which to prepare itself, or the XDC. I now want to state this very clearly. It was not leased back to the people for five years. We must examine the matter carefully to see what we can do to best advantage, but this is a major undertaking and one cannot push people in from the outside. This has been my practice throughout with regard to farms, and I think my successor will continue with it because the department has found it to be very effective. Now, when we make a farmer an offer, we ask him whether he wants to lease back, because one cannot have a farmer leave today and establish a Black man there the next day on a planned basis.</p>

<p>Then these improvements on the various farms deteriorate. We have undergone a great deal of criticism in this regard in the past. Now one has to adopt measures as soon as possible, and the best man to do so&#x2014;and I think everyone will agree with me here&#x2014;is the farmer of that farm. He is equipped to do so. Now we have to call for tenders. How long does that take? This man has to leave, because he cannot continue there. We now have to give the highest tenderer the opportunity to carry on farming operations there. Theoretically there are certain advantages to this, but now the new man has to come along with implements and all his equipment and he has to move in, and in many cases it is only for a short period&#x2014;a year&#x2014;and consequently one does not get people who are interested in doing this. Sir, the various methods as regards, <i>inter alia,</i> making best use of the land and how best to effect the change-over, have all been investigated thoroughly by the department because we want certainty and security and we do not wish to cause destruction and harm to a State investment. We are continually being accused loudly by that side of the House of purchasing land and then neglecting it and then we are asked to see what it looks like there. Here are photographs showing what farms look like after the Trust had bought them. We want to occupy that land in a planned way; and one has to supervise, and the best supervisor is the previous owner. A certain sum of money is held back until he duly hands over the farm, after which he receives the full payment. We can criticize this method of operating, but in practice the department has succeeded in finding a workable and meaningful way of handling the whole issue, in the best interests of Black and White and in the best interests of the taxpayer as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to return to other aspects of the debate, but I feel that I should nevertheless comment on the discussion of the Port St. Johns matter which has recently been occupying the attention of this House. To me it appears to be the right and the task of the Opposition, wherever there may have been an irregularity in the utilization of funds or the purchase of land, to ask the necessary and pressing questions in regard to the matter. I feel that the Opposition would be shamefully neglecting its duty if it did not do this. When I refer to a few other little matters, I want to make it clear that I am not participating in any denigration. In fact, I do not think that any member on this side of the House was engaged in anything of that nature. The example or anology which the hon. Minister of Water Affairs used in regard to Zebediela does not hold water. Zebediela was a business undertaking which showed, or ought to show, certain profits every year. We would have had an analogy if Parliament had appropriated an amount of R8 million to purchase Zebediela, and we had then leased Zebediela back to the previous owners at &#x00BD;<i>%</i> interest, i.e. R40 000 per annum. The analogy would then have been correct.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the example was badly chosen.</p>

<p>Let us, in all calmness, try to extract from this discussion the essential points which were actually at issue in the debate. It seems to me that we could summarize the essential points into five basic problems which the Opposition came up against. Firstly, it would seem as though there was preferential treatment in the case of the properties in which the two companies were involved. [Interjections.] It <span class="col_1291-1292" refersTo="page_0662"/>would seem as though there was preferential treatment in regard to the purchase of the particular properties, and I shall go into this a little further at a later stage. With due deference I want to say that the misgivings have not been removed by what the hon. Ministers told this House. The second problem is why so much capital was spent at that stage on the purchase of the land. It has been said that it could subsequently have cost the State more. In view of what I still want to say, this argument does not hold water. This side of the House and I are not convinced that an adequate reply has been given to the question of why the owners of the land were given preference as far as the purchase of the land was concerned. Thirdly, it would seem as though there was a departure from the procedure. We can become excited about this if we wish, but no satisfactory explanation has yet in fact been given as to why, if this was the case, it should in fact have been necessary to deviate from the procedure. The argument of the hon. the Minister that it was not necessary to advertise because there would have been no Blacks to buy it, may indeed have been true. However, the hon. the Minister did not know this for a fact. He based his defence on an assumption.</p>

<p>Another problem to which no adequate reply has yet been given, is the amount which was paid. The hon. the Minister indicated that he would furnish further particulars, and I want to suggest to him that he should consider making the details of the deed of sale available. The fifth problem was the leaseback. We have as yet received no adequate reply as to why the lease-back occurred on the scale on which it did. I am saying these things in the light of the policy which was stated in reply to the misgivings expressed by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, i.e. the policy which was adopted, and is being adopted, in regard to the purchase of White farms. I should like to quote what was said in this connection during a debate last year. I am quoting from Hansard, Vol. 56, col. 6032. This deals with the consolidation proposals, and the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been said in the past, and I consider it necessary to emphasize it here once more, that White farmers whose farms cannot be bought out in the near future, through force of circumstances, should continue normally with their farming activities, development and planning, but without making excessive, uneconomic improvements, which cannot be taken into account in the determination of the market value. I am thinking, for example, of irrigation projects which are developed without sufficient water.</block>

<p>The question which occurs to me is why these owners were not told not to proceed with the development. Why were they not told that the Government would not be interested in purchasing properties that had already been developed? If this can be said to farmers, then it seems obvious to me that it can also be said to people engaged in township development. These are the type of questions which crop up, but I shall leave at that. I hope that the hon. Ministers will be better able to give us a satisfactory reply to the misgivings I have expressed.</p>

<p>I want to return to other aspects of the debate. This is the first opportunity I have had to return to the subject we discussed in this House the week before last when I introduced a private motion on discrimination. In the motion I asked for the appointment of a Select Committee which should give consideration to statutory measures which discriminate on the grounds of race and colour. In my motivation I made it very clear that our internal situation urgently requires us to get rid of discrimination perceptibly and as quickly as possible, that our relations with other African States and with other powers are going to be determined by this, and that, since Mr. Pik Botha and the hon. the Prime Minister themselves stated it as policy that South Africa had to and wanted to get rid of discrimination, we should remove the discussion of this critical matter from the sterile atmosphere of confrontation prevailing in this House and create another forum in which we could deliberate on this matter more calmly and more objectively.</p>

<p>The outcome of that debate is now history. More people than only the Opposition members in these benches in this House were and are bitterly disappointed at the negative attitude adopted by the Government in this regard. Only the hon. the Minister of Justice admitted, at least by implication, that discrimination does in fact exist, and that the Government is instituting an investigation into what discriminatory measures could perhaps be abolished within the framework of apartheid. <span class="col_1293-1294" refersTo="page_0663"/>I shall return to this if I have time. However, it will not be taken amiss of me when I say that the other speakers on the Government side did not express a single constructive idea on this matter. On the contrary. Their contribution can only be described as childish, party-political shadow boxing, and as poor attempts to escape from reality.</p>

<p>I want to repeat what I said at the time, i.e. that the matter is indeed extremely urgent. If the Government members are not in a position to be really well-informed of what leading personalities among our non-White groups are thinking, then they must be prepared to accept the information we furnish in this regard. Under these circumstances I have no choice but to try to convince our friends on the opposite side of this House of how important it is that cognizance should be taken of what those people are thinking and saying. It is most certainly not pleasant for me to convey to this House that resentment and bitterness which exist among them. It is certainly not pleasant for any of us to be confronted with those facts.</p>

<p>No one will doubt that effective resistance to the Russian-Cuban intervention in Angola and their presence in Southern Africa can only be offered if we are able to rely on the full co-operation of our entire population, White and Black. Now listen to what the non-Whites are saying. I am referring to leading non-White intellectuals and political leaders, and I want to try to convey to you what they are saying. They are saying: &#x201C;You have rejected us and pushed us away, and how can you now, in your hour of need, expect us to support you and to fight at your side?&#x201D; They are also saying&#x2014;I repeat that I am coming back to what those people are telling us&#x2014;and we can no longer evade this: &#x201C;You have divided us mercilessly into separate groups and have done everything in your power to keep us apart, and with that you have destroyed the concept of a common loyalty.&#x201D; They are saying to us: &#x201C;You have said that you do not recognize us as part of the South African nation, that you want to establish us in separate nation states. You have said this time and again, and with that you have destroyed the concept of a common fatherland. You have constantly excluded us from proper participation in the political structure, and have persistently adopted resolutions which affected us intimately without our being able to make our voices heard and without our being consulted. That is why you have eliminated the possibility of collective participation and collective responsibility. You have discriminated against us, and you have separated us from yourselves and from one another, solely on the grounds of our race or colour, a God-given attribute which we did not create and which we can do nothing about. With that you have denied our common humanity. You have made us strangers in the land of our birth. You have driven us from the inheritance of our fathers to the separate group areas which you created for us, and with that you have forfeited any claim to our assistance and our support in keeping the inheritance of your fathers inviolate for you. &#x2019;&#x2019; [Interjections.] It may be nonsense, but I am merely repeating what they are saying. It is not I who am saying these things; I am simply repeating what was said. This emanates from prominent Coloured, Bantu and Asian personalities. [Interjections.] If hon. members were to talk to them they would hear that their young people regard the Russians, Cubans and the MPLA as liberators. That is a fact. I do not know why hon. members are at loggerheads with me here, for the hon. member for Green Point has already indicated what was stated even in the Snyman report. I want to quote precisely what was stated there, and which confirms what I have said here. It is stated in the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although in the past there had been some sporadic signs in student activities of resistance to Government policy and the actions of the University Administration, the appearance on the campus of a large number of posters and slogans emanating from the student body on the morning of 25 September 1974 came unexpectedly. The slogans, all apparently prompted by the apparent successes of Frelimo in Mozambique, clearly revealed a strong, alarming and general anti-White feeling. None of the posters or slogans contained anything from which it might be inferred that the students&#x2019; revolt had been generated by a situation in the University.</block>

<block name="quote">As a result of this extreme rejection of the Whites, the events of the afternoon culminated in serious violence by a group of students against members of the White staff of the University.</block>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1295-1296" refersTo="page_0664"/>It is a generally accepted fact that students at the University of the North harbour a deep-seated antagonism which is overtly manifested in a strongly anti-White attitude.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] It is stated in the report. It is not I who am saying this, and I could give you the references if you want them. It states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The events of 25 September 1974 testify strongly to this extreme antipathy of the students&#x2019; community towards the Whites.</block>

<p>In addition the report refers to an &#x201C;anti-White attitude&#x201D; which has been engendered &#x201C;since childhood&#x201D;, and it is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the emergence of SASO &#x2026; this anti-White feeling has been fostered even further.</block>

<block name="quote">The Black staff of the University side wholeheartedly with the students.</block>

<p>In addition, the report states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is this Black solidarity and often antagonism that White academic staff and the Administration come up against</block>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the aim of Black Consciousness and therefore of SASO is the overthrow of the present political system in South Africa.</block>

<p>I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear that this resentment, together with the strongly anti-White feeling manifested in the behaviour of the students and the Black staff, is a serious threat to the continued orderly and peaceful existence of the University.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have the unpleasant and unenviable task of having to say what I want to say within the space of 14 minutes. For this reason I shall not elaborate in detail on the speeches I want to refer to, including the one made by the previous speaker. We know that he came to this Parliament from a university atmosphere, a very learned atmosphere. But when one listens to his logic, I simply must say to him: Preserve, oh preserve us from learning! I <span class="col_1297-1298" refersTo="page_0665"/>really want to speak with reference to the speech made by the hon. member for Sea Point, as well as those made by the hon. members for Maitland and Von Brandis, and by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point really disappointed me today. We know his general standpoint and we know&#x2014;he has never made it so clear as today&#x2014;that his party&#x2019;s policy is based on fear of a Black majority government in South Africa. He mentioned that we are four million Whites in this country as against 21 million Blacks. I know that the hon. member is a very brave member, that he is at least honest and that he speaks with the utmost sincerity. However, I want to remind him of something which Shakespeare said: &#x201C;A coward dies many deaths.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I am amazed at the things that have been said in connection with South West Africa, Swapo, the Angolan question and so on, and I hoped that I would have a little more time to refer to them and to illustrate these aspects in greater detail. However, I shall only discuss these subjects briefly.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to Swapo. I have before me the Hansard of the hon. member for Von Brandis, in which he asked why the Prime Minister did not go to have discussions with Sam Nujoma, the leader of Swapo. He also said &#x201C;Swapo is real&#x201D;, etc. The hon. member for Maitland, too, asked why we did not ban Swapo if this organization had communist leanings. By doing so, he showed once again that he had no idea of the position in South West Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went so far as to say, &#x201C;I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that if he could achieve the objective of having even a section of Swapo round the conference table he would be doing a great deal of good in solving this particular problem.&#x201D; This was what he said in connection with Swapo. The impression was created that Swapo was just another organization, and, well, what were we going to do with it? I want to make it quite clear that Swapo consists of two parts: an international Swapo which operates outside the country and a Swapo which operates inside the country. The Swapo which operates externally is completely communist orientated. That part of Swapo was founded here in Cape Town in 1957 by four White communists, Jack Simmons, Solly Sachs, Fred Carneson and Ben Turok. They were all outspoken White communists and only in the following year, in 1958, did they instruct Sam Nujoma to take over the leadership, so that it would not be so obvious that White communists had been responsible for the establishment of the organization. Nor is there any doubt about the fact that Sam Nujoma, too, is an outspoken communist, because he received his training in Moscow and Peking. He makes no secret of this. So there is not doubt about the situation, but &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. member admits it. Within the country there is a section which calls itself the Swapo Youth Movement and sometimes the Swapo League. They claim to have nothing to do with the external Swapo, to be an ordinary political party. We have always been accused by hon. members on the other side of seeing a communist behind every bush. We have various political parties in South West Africa, such as Swanu, Swapo and National Convention, but let it be said to the credit of the Government that we have not banned any of them because we do not see a communist behind every bush.</p>

<p>Wait a minute; I shall come to that. I do not want the hon. member to fall into a trap so soon. I want to tell the hon. member that the Namibia National Convention was established to unite the Black people of South West Africa against the Whites in South West Africa. What happened the year before last? Swapo walked out of the National Convention, and this can only mean: &#x201C;If we get the upper hand in South West Africa and a unitary government is established in South West Africa, the people who will have a say in it will not be the Herero or the Damara or anyone else, but we, Swapo.&#x201D; By doing that, the organization showed its true nature.</p>

<p>It is difficult to distinguish between insurgent elements which come from outside, crossing the Kunene and the Kavango, and which make terrorist attacks inside South West Africa as happened again yesterday near Okahandja, and Swapo inside South West Africa. I want the Government to consider <span class="col_1299-1300" refersTo="page_0666"/>banning the internal branch of Swapo as well, if it wants to eliminate these dangers with which we are faced in South West Africa today. Otherwise we shall be faced in the future with attacks of which we do not know the origin. We have not done this yet, because it is true that Swapo has not given us any reason to do so. But if this is proved, I believe that the Government will not hesitate for one moment to act against Swapo.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Swapo has 6 000 members outside South West Africa. As far as those inside the country are concerned, it is impossible, of course, to give exact figures, but they are probably not more than 1 000. During the successful conference in South West Africa, Swapo claimed to be the legitimate representative of the Ovambo people, because Swapo consists only of Ovambo and does not include members of other peoples, as the hon. member for Von Brandis said. Because the Ovambo and the various population groups had met to find a solution to the constitutional problems of South West Africa and had even undertaken a successful trip abroad, Swapo lost a great deal of its prestige. It used to enjoy great prestige, because it was recognized even by the UNO and it received funds from every person who was hostile to South Africa and the Whites of South Africa. Because it had lost some of its prestige, it decided to flee across the Kunene, to be trained there and then to deal with the Ovambo leaders and with the rest of South West Africa by means of terrorist attacks. I want to refer to the situation which has developed in respect of Angola, because the hon. member for Sea Point spoke of South Africa&#x2019;s involvement in Angola in a manner which made it very clear to me that he had no idea of what was going on.</p>

<p>What South Africa did in Angola was in accordance with its policy. We did not interfere in Mozambique when Frelimo took over there&#x2014;in fact, we said that we would recognize the <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> Government of Mozambique and that we would co-operate with it and we are prepared to do that in respect of any Government which comes into existence on our borders. The situation in South West Africa is that the South African troops were assembled there in the first place to protect the borders of Ovambo, the Black people, against the attacks of Swapo and of other terrorist movements. Their first aim was to guard the borders and to protect the water projects, which benefit the Black people and the Angolans themselves, no matter what Government eventually comes into power there, no matter whether it be the MPLA or any other Government. The situation has now arisen that there are certain countries which are beginning to recognize the MPLA as the legitimate Government of Angola. If you know the country as I know it, you will know that Angola has a population of 5,5 million people, among whom Jonas Savimbi&#x2019;s people, the Oviumbu, account for 3,5 million, the Barakongo&#x2014;who support the FNLA&#x2014;for approximately 2 million, and then I am not mentioning the smaller groups such as the Portuguese, who number &#x00BD; million, the Okuambi and so forth. Even if we were to recognize the MPLA, it is by no means sure that it will remain the <i>de facto</i> Government of Angola.</p>

<p>The Portuguese had 45 000 troops in the field at the time, and they were unable to stop the terrorist movements. The best proof of the fact that we should not speak of our involvement&#x2014;I do not like this word; I do not like the term &#x201C;involvement in Angola&#x201D;&#x2014;is this: If South Africa really had got involved in the war in Angola, we could have flattened Angola in one week&#x2019;s time, before a single Cuban or Russian or East German, or anyone else, had set foot there.</p>

<p>However, we adhered to our policy of no intervention in the domestic affairs of another country. The Western world must give us credit for this. Of course this Government is going to consider the facts in the future. We shall consider these. If the MPLA were now to succeed&#x2014;I do not know whether we are to recognize the Cubans or the Russians, because they are the people who are in power at the moment, with Dr. Agostinho Neto as leader&#x2014;if the MPLA were to succeed in retaining control over Angola <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto,</i> without assistance from the outside world, there would be nothing to prevent us from recognizing them. Co-operation between us would benefit us and them. I would almost say that they need our co-operation more than we need theirs. Angola is an undeveloped country. They will have to obtain capital and technical know-how. Where are they going to <span class="col_1301-1302" refersTo="page_0667"/>get it? They are not going to get it from the UNO, because that body is bankrupt. They will have to co-operate with South Africa.</p>

<p>It does not matter what government comes into power <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> in Angola, and when this happens, we shall continue and we shall put it to them that we are protecting our interests in regard to the Calueque scheme, from which both the Ovambo and the Angolans stand to benefit. Then we can recognize them as the government. I want to make this quite clear. We are practical. We are not living in a theoretical world.</p>

<p>However, there are hon. members, such as the hon. member for Von Brandis, who argue that we should conclude the negotiations, the conference in regard to South West Africa as soon as possible. The hon. member demanded that we find a solution to this matter before the end of 1976. I have here the Declaration of Intent which was drawn up by the conference at the time. I am sorry that I cannot come to the translation which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition used in Windhoek and which gave a completely wrong interpretation of the matter. However, I want to tell him that this Declaration of Intent forms the foundation of a future South West Africa. In this document it is stated clearly that we and these peoples absolutely condemn and reject the use of violence or any form of improper interference aimed at overthrowing the existing form of government or at forcing upon us a new dispensation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, no one can require us to conclude this matter before the end of the year. When the Blacks asked us how long it was going to last, we said that it did not depend on us, but on them. We tried to set a target period of three years, which was accordingly embodied in the Declaration of Intent. Subsequently, however, the Black people told us themselves that we had been very optimistic and they even advised us rather to make it 10 years. They felt that this would be more realistic.</p>

<p>No one&#x2014;not the Opposition of the UNO or anyone else in the world&#x2014;will force us to conclude our constitutional affairs in South West Africa within a given period. Our actions are aimed at ensuring absolute peace and security for all the peoples of South West Africa, and I am able to say that this is also the aim of all the responsible peoples that are concerned in the matter.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although nothing much was said about finance in this debate to which I feel it is necessary for me to reply, I do want to say that the debate was generally interesting and meaningful to me. There were only two or three exceptions. I am referring to the speech made by the hon. member for Sea Point today and last week&#x2019;s speech by the hon. member for Johannesburg North. Then there was also, although to a lesser degree, the speech made by the hon. member for Edenvale today. It was a very disappointing speech. I cannot think that my hon. friends, for instance the hon. the leader of the Opposition, the hon. member for Durban Point, the hon. member for Newton Park and many others, really agree with some of the things he said. The hon. member for Edenvale told us how all the non-Whites are apparently feeling about the situation in which our country finds itself. He blames the Government for the negative attitude of these people and says that the reason for it lies in our policy and our approach to them. I would like to know who those people are. He must mention them by name. Since when does he speak on behalf of the Bantu and the Coloured people and the Indians in this country? He must mention their names, then we can put this matter to the test.</p>

<p>However, before I continue, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations on their fine achievements to those hon. members of this side of the House who made their maiden speeches during this debate. It was really a pleasure to listen to them. I want to refer to the speech of the hon. member for Smithfield, for example. He spoke about a very intricate matter and showed us that he knew his facts. It was clear that he understood the provincial subsidy formula, something which is very involved. I believe that all these hon. new members will be great assets to this House. I also want to extend my sincere congratulations to my hon. friend, the member for Ermelo, on his appointment as chairman of the Select Committee on Public Accounts. It is a very important post which was previously occupied with great distinction by the hon. member for Paarl. I want to thank the latter sincerely for the valuable service which he rendered there for many years. We are also looking forward very confidently to the contribution of the new Chairman. We know him as a very able member of this House and we have great <span class="col_1303-1304" refersTo="page_0668"/>appreciation for the work which he does here.</p>

<p>I would have proceeded at once to deal with all the financial matters and all the arguments which were used in connection with them, but I felt that I could not allow the speech made by the hon. member for Sea Point to pass without any comment. I must refer to it. I would not have spent more than one minute on the speech of the hon. member for Johannesburg North. It was an unpleasant speech, completely negative. In view of the speech made by the hon. member for Sea Point, however, I shall in fact refer to it.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, in the circumstances prevailing in the country at large and in the world in which we live, I have never heard a speech such as that made today by the hon. member for Sea Point, a leader of a party in this House. Presumably, if one listens to him, this hon. member has a monopoly of the contact and of the confidence of all the non-White people of South Africa&#x2014;not this Government, not this Prime Minister, but this hon. member.</p>

<p>There never has been a Prime Minister who has had closer contacts with all the non-White groups of this country than the present Prime Minister. I want to go even further and say that I do not believe there has ever been a Prime Minister of this country who has been held in greater esteem and who has had such confidence placed in him by all the people than our present hon. Prime Minister. That is the position. But the hon. member for Sea Point &#x2026; [Interjections.] I do hope hon. members will give me an opportunity to speak.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I must gather from their noisiness that they agree with the hon. member for Sea Point. If they do, they must get up and say so. [Interjections.] One almost gained the impression that provided the hon. the Prime Minister approached all these people on terms and conditions set forth by the hon. member for Sea Point, the hon. the Prime Minister was free to talk to our non-White leaders. That is the impression I gained when listening to him. The speech of the hon. member for Johannesburg North was the exact prototype, in the financial field, of the speech of the hon. member for Sea Point in the broader political and security field. It was the exact equivalent, critical of everything the authorities are doing and wise in hindsight to the point of perfection. The hon. member for Johannesburg North by February or March last year knew all the answers to our coming financial problems. The tragedy is that he did not tell us anything about them. With the wisdom of hindsight, he stood up and made a speech here which led one to believe that he had gazed into a crystal ball and that only he could foretell the future. We have come to a point in our affairs where conditions are serious. We all know this and that is not because of the faults of this Government, but because of the absolutely unwarranted intervention in the affairs of Africa by the communists. That is why we are in this position. All we get from that party, however, is destructive criticism and a whitewash of everything the communists are doing. [Interjections.] That is the position. One can analyse it. One can go even further. When I listen to these hon. members and see the Press statements they are making and the way they put things, I find myself beginning to feel&#x2014;I am not the only one&#x2014;that there is a very serious fifth column developing in this country. [Interjections.] I think the sooner that is said the better. It goes on on all fronts in that party. It is a very serious fifth column, and the hon. member for Yeoville must sit up and take notice &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; because the hon. member for Yeoville has put his head not into a beehive, but into a nest of scorpions. That is what he has done. The hon. member for Yeoville is not going to get his head out of that either. The time has come to face the facts. We cannot have this double talk any longer, and I am entitled to say that this side of the House finds it intolerable that a group which calls itself a recognized political party in this country, can carry on in the way that party is doing, making the speeches they are making in public in this country. It is intolerable.</p>

<p>Let us see what the hon. member for Johannesburg North has said. Talking about devaluation he said one would think we were a banana republic like South America. A banana republic!</p>

That hon. member has lived on the fat of the land in this country, if I may put it in those terms.

<p>He did not say that we have had more appreciations of the rand in recent years than devaluations. He did not say that. He did not tell the House that in the three years, from the beginning of 1972 up to the middle of 1975, when the depression settled so severely on the world, the exchange value of the rand measured in terms of all currencies in fact increased. For how many countries&#x2019; currencies over that period can one say that? Why did he not tell the House that?</p>

<p>Is that so? For a member like the hon. member for Johannesburg North to come to this House and say that this great country, South Africa, is a banana republic, is a disgrace. [Interjections.] That is the point, and I do not propose to pay any more attention to his speech. His speech was delivered here in a fit of pique; it was a most disagreeable speech. Just read it! He was piqued for two reasons. He was piqued because I had refused, a day or two earlier, to tell him how precisely we had estimated the tax income from the gold mines for the budget. I was not prepared to give him information which, I said, was not in the public interest. It now comes out in his speech that he was angry about that. I repeat that I have no intention of giving him that information, simply because if I did it would disclose a good deal of the gold selling strategy of the Reserve Bank and that is not in the interests of South Africa. There is another reason, however, why he was so disagreeable. Why, for instance, right at the start of his speech, in a completely uncalled for manner, did he hurl a gratuitous insult at the hon. member for Ermelo? What for? In comparison with the hon. member for Ermelo, what has he to contribute to the affairs of this House? You see, Mr. Speaker, he thought that this country had reached the point where it was financially and economically down, and he thought the only thing to do now was to kick the South African economy while it was down. However, he miscalculated, as that side of the House has miscalculated every time.</p>

<p>As I have said before and as I say again, although we have certain problems, those problems are nothing like as severe as the problems of most other countries of the world. What is more, we are overcoming those problems and we have a very great deal to be thankful for. I think the hon. member was so frustrated when he realized that our budgetary position was, in fact, remarkably sound and that we could handle our balance of payments position provided we continued to take the proper steps, although most of the countries in the world cannot handle theirs; when he realized that our growth rate was still positive and that, in comparison with other countries today, we really had no unemployment to speak of. That is the position in this country. In his position, why does the hon. member not say a single kind thing about the South African economy and the South African people? Why does he continually attack us in the negative and destructive way we saw the other day? I leave the answer to him.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to something else. I want to refer to two items which appeared in the last few days in the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> On more than one occasion in this House during this session I have referred to the fact that we had in this country at the moment a positive growth rate. That is a fact. We are one of the very few countries in the world that has such a positive growth rate. My friend, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, a few days ago met with the committee that was called into being to deal with the anti-inflation campaign. It is a representative committee drawn from the whole economy. He had the Press present. My statements on the growth rate are in Hansard; so there is no question about them. As I say, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs had the Press present when he spoke about the South African economy and the anti-inflation campaign. He dealt specifically with the growth rate per capita and said that if the growth rate was proceeding at about <span class="col_1307-1308" refersTo="page_0670"/>2&#x00BC;<i>%</i>&#x2014;that must be a pretty close estimate, although we do not have the final figures&#x2014;and if the population was increasing at a somewhat faster rate, one could say that there was a slight negative tendency in the growth rate per capita. He said that if this growth rate of 2% or 2&#x00BC;<i>%</i> or thereabouts continued into the following year and the population continued to increase slightly faster, that negative tendency in the growth rate per capita would continue.</p>

<p>He used that to stress how important it was for us to work harder and step up productivity and production generally. However, what did the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> do? Having had that talk by the hon. member available to them, and having my statement on record in Hansard, the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> on Saturday came with a leading article&#x2014;&#x2018; &#x2018;Double Image&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2014;an article covering the whole length of the front page. The gravamen of this attack on the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and myself is that I am saying one thing and he is saying the opposite, that I am saying the growth rate is positive while he is saying it is negative. We stated these things in the clearest terms. Yet the Press proceeds on the basis of a completely false and dishonest premise to try to ridicule the Government, saying that different Ministers in the Cabinet talk a different language and do not know what they are talking about. That is <i>the Rand Daily Mail.</i> And that is not all they have said. The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> also has a column being contributed, I understand, by someone who calls himself &#x201C;Bull Ring&#x201D; &#x2026; [Interjections.] I know what the hon. members are probably thinking. I just want to repeat what I said in my Second Reading speech. I do so in order that the country may know how these things are being presented to the public. I was talking about the IMF quotas&#x2014;that is where you get your voting rights. In my speech the other day&#x2014;it is in Hansard&#x2014;I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die rand is een van die slegs 16 betaalmiddele wat gebruik word by die bepaling van die waarde van die IMF se spesiale trekkingskrag &#x2026;</block>

<p>i.e. the Special Drawing Rights&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in die verhoging van IMF-kwotas wat in Jamaika oor besluit is, kry Suid-Afrika op grond van sy ekonomiese krag &#x2019;n aansienlik groter persentasietoename in sy kwota as baie ander lande, insluitende lande soos Australi&#x00EB; en Nieu-Seeland.</block>

<p>It is a question of the percentage increase. However, the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">News agency reports attribute this to Senator Horwood in Parliament this week:</block>

<p>That is on 12 February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Recently South Africa has been given a higher International Monetary Fund quota than countries such as Australia and New Zealand because of her economic strength. &#x2019;&#x2019;</block>

<p>The paper then goes on to try to ridicule still further what I said. It speaks of &#x201C;a higher quota&#x201D;, while I said we got a higher percentage increase in our voting rights in our quota than Australia and New Zealand. You see, Sir, one has to ask oneself what is going on in this country. How can any man with Hansard in front of him&#x2014;Hansard is available at all times&#x2014;make such an absolutely deliberate false statement such as this, together with the other one, the leading article which bears reading by anybody who has the truth in mind?</p>

<p>I now want to turn briefly to some of the more financial issues raised. I shall be as brief as I can. I want to refer, first of all, to what I thought was an extremely fair and able summing up of the point I tried to put to this House in my Second Reading speech at the commencement of this debate. I want to refer to the leading article by <i>The Argus</i> on my speech. With your permission, Sir, I should like to read a little from this article, because I think it sums up in a few words exactly what I was trying to say. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Finance, Senator Horwood, has reacted in a sensible way to the economic situation in which South Africa finds itself. Introducing the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill yesterday, he announced, as was expected that there would be drastic reductions in Government expenditure &#x2026; but he thankfully refrained from increasing indirect taxation as some feared he might. The problems confronting the Government are that the economy is still relatively slack, although there are several <span class="col_1309-1310" refersTo="page_0671"/>distinct positive indications at present &#x2026; and that it is essential to keep up the fight against inflation. There have also been balance of payments problems, the need to finance increased defence expenditure and the depressing effect of the reduced gold price.</block>

<p>They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But it was a hopeful sign that Senator Horwood was able to be cautiously optimistic about several of these issues.</block>

<p>They then refer to the issues in question. I think that, if I could sum up in one phrase what I tried to say, it would be that I was being cautiously optimistic, and I still am. I am not pessimistic about the future. I gave my reasons in fair detail, and nothing that has been said in this debate, with respect, causes me to change my mind for one moment.</p>

<p>I think the main criticism in the debate on the financial level again concerned devaluation. There was also the plea for the better use of non-White labour, a plea which was put in different forms. Such pleas, of course, are now becoming fairly old hat.</p>

<p>If one looks at the facts and at the situation as it developed up to September last year, there can be no doubt whatsoever that the only thing we could have done to protect the balance of payments and safeguard our reserves and, therefore, the strength of the rand, was to devalue. I have said it before, and I have given my reasons for it here and in other places. I do not want to take up the House&#x2019;s time unnecessarily. However, the hon. member for Constantia, for example, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The monetary base for taxation is also expanding because both inflation and devaluation have given the Treasury a very nice little nest-egg in higher dutiable values where <i>ad valorem</i> customs and <i>ad valorem</i> sales duties are concerned.</block>

<p>The monetary base is expanded, but not the real base. I should like to point out to the hon. member that the tax receipts on <i>ad valorem</i> duties simply keep pace with the rise in prices. In the case of specific duties&#x2014;of which there are many&#x2014;the real base is in fact reduced.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know. I am merely pointing this out because this is part of the whole question of financing from these sources.</p>

<p>Then, of course, the hon. member said that the Government should call a halt to forced or subsidized border industrial development. What is the point of coming to this debate and saying that we must stop our decentralization policy when we have a clear mandate from the public? How many times has this not been an important issue before the public? What is more, it has been supported every time. Perhaps, if the hon. member feels like it, we can discuss this at some length on another occasion. I think that the case that can be made out for decentralizing in conditions such as are experienced in some of our big metropolitan areas where very substantial increased social costs are incurred because of over-congestion of various kinds, is in itself a very strong case indeed. It is not based purely on economic grounds. There are other important considerations which I think the hon. member understands. I would merely like to say here that devaluation has stabilized our reserves. We still have balance of payments problems with the low gold price. Naturally that is so, but if we had not taken this measure, how would we have stopped the decline in the net reserves which had reached serious proportions by September? The devaluation did give us that relief, and it is undoubtedly having a stimulatory effect on the economy. It is stimulating a number of important export industries, including, most of all, the gold mines. These are being stimulated directly. The devaluation is also contributing to containing and, indeed, reducing the volume of imports overall. That was one of the main things we tried to achieve, viz. to encourage exports and to discourage imports. That is, of course, what the devaluation has been doing. I was interested to see in the latest copy of the <i>Financial Mail,</i> which appeared last Friday, that, in referring to my speech, that of the hon. member for Constantia and some others in the debate that had taken place, it said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1311-1312" refersTo="page_0672"/>Remarkably, the current account deficit was reduced from an annual rate of 1,9 billion pre-devaluation rand in the September quarter to 1,7 billion post-devaluation rand in the December quarter.</block>

<p>That is, of course, completely correct. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;That is equivalent&#x201D;, Horwood might have added, &#x201C;to a fall from 2,7 billion dollars to 2 billion dollars&#x2014;quite a dramatic improvement.&#x2019;&#x2019;</block>

<p>That was of course a very good way to put it. That was the <i>Financial Mail</i>, and I do not think one really needs a stronger justification than that for this step. Incidentally, the hon. member for Constantia listed a whole number of &#x201C;do&#x2019;s&#x201D; and &#x201C;don&#x2019;ts&#x201D; which I can assure him I will look at very closely. The hon. member for Yeoville went much further. He did not worry about the &#x201C;do&#x2019;s&#x201D;, but he doubled the number of &#x201C;don&#x2019;ts&#x201D;. He told me not to do a whole series of things. I can assure him that I will bear every one of them carefully in mind. But talking about the <i>Financial Mail,</i> it is interesting to see that on page 459 it sums up these &#x201C;don&#x2019;ts&#x201D; which the hon. member gave me. One of them is: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t impose taxes that will raise living costs&#x201D;. The <i>Financial Mail</i> proceeds further on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tax increases in the present recessionary climate in which the bargaining power of labour is weak are deflationary, because they cut into disposable incomes and thus into spending, and even more so if the taxes are indirect.</block>

<p>That is just a reminder that these things are not as simple as they may look. One has to look at them in relation to the conditions prevailing and from all sides.</p>

<p>May I ask the Minister whether he does not consider that if in fact he were to increase sales duties on items which are important to the consumer, this would in fact have an inflationary and not a deflationary effect?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If you put up the tax on an item which must be bought, the consumer then must pay the higher price, and to that extent you could say that that is contributing to the inflation, but the argument here is that it causes that consumer to pay less for other things because it has eaten into his available disposable income. Therefore, overall and on the slightly longer-run view&#x2014;as in fact the <i>Financial Mail</i> goes on to state&#x2014;such price increases are &#x201C;exceedingly deflationary&#x201D;. Now that is a point that I leave with the hon. member. I do not want to argue about it, but it is an interesting point to show that there are two sides to the question.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville amongst other things made the remark that many of our foreign loans last year were short-term loans. That is so; many of our loans were short-term, but the hon. member knows that this is a world-wide phenomenon. The term of even the long-term loans in the world today is six or seven years, whereas recently it was 15 years.</p>

<p>In the case of a few loans&#x2014;we were able to repay them exactly on time because it was the right thing to do&#x2014;but we also had a substantial number of long-term productive loans. In addition, in respect of the capital accumulation that came in from abroad last year, our capital inflow, we had a very substantial long-term private capital contribution of over R500 million, which is a very substantial figure. But the point on which I do want to cross swords with the hon. member for Yeoville is his statement&#x2014;and he must have had the hon. member for Hillbrow in mind when he said this&#x2014;that devaluation was an act of bankruptcy. Sir, I must say it is an astonishing thing to say. The devaluation was never an act of bankruptcy in any shape or form. It was simply a practical and, I believe, essential adjustment of the price of our currency towards other currencies, particularly the dollar. The hon. member must remember that we are living in a very different world. We do not have fixed par exchange values. To an increasing extent we have floating rates of exchange, and currencies are moving upward <span class="col_1313-1314" refersTo="page_0673"/>and downward all the time. For reasons which are important to us, we have a link with the dollar, because our foreign exchange market, as the hon. member knows, is not big enough to give us a reliable value on its own. We are linked to the dollar for technical reasons. The dollar is floating and it has been moving up and down a good deal. Obviously that means that we move too, and we have to watch this. We are not as big a country as America, but we do get substantial benefits provided we adopt a realistic exchange rate policy, and this is what we are doing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on that point I would just like to tell the hon. member for Johannesburg North that in the process of estimating the revenue to be expected from gold mining companies in our budget I consulted not only all my top officials and the Reserve Bank, but also some of the greatest authorities on gold in the gold mining industry, and the figure we used was an absolute consensus. So the hon. member must not come here with the wisdom of hindsight and tell us what he would have done, because it does not make any impact on me. To say that devaluation was an act of bankruptcy is a pretty serious thing to say, and I hope it is the last time the hon. member will use that phrase in this House. As long ago as June, when we made that downward adjustment of nearly 5%, when we switched from the limited floating adjustment, short term, of the rand to the long term basis of adjustment, I said we would only devalue under certain conditions. I said we would only devalue if there was a fundamental change in the underlying conditions affecting us. The fundamental change came with that sudden, drastic drop in the price of gold on top of the very serious downward revision in export prices that hit us in September. That, I may say, is exactly my view today and I do not intend under any conditions to devalue. I know there are some people who like to think that if a Minister says that, it means he is going to devalue. Let them think what they like; I happen to be saying what I intend, and I want to say further that &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, you are talking absolute nonsense, my friend. You are talking as much nonsense now as you spoke when my hon. friend was talking about land purchases at Port St. Johns.</p>

<p>In the course of this debate the hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Yeoville made the point that we must watch the supply of money very carefully, and that we must not let it in any way get out of hand, particularly as far as bank credit is concerned. I think they also raised this matter during the no-confidence debate, namely that we must be very sure that we keep the supply of credit by the banks to the private sector within bounds. I want to assure the House that this is precisely what we have been doing for some time. The liquidity in the system, however, has been quite remarkable, despite the fact that there is this overall financial tightening world-wide, in <span class="col_1315-1316" refersTo="page_0674"/>the capital markets of one country after the other. The fact is that even after we had raised the liquid asset requirements of the banks, twice last year, there was still substantial liquidity in the system which was causing still more credit to be issued. This was so much so that even after the devaluation and the second raising of the liquid asset requirements of the banks, the credit issued by the banks to the private sector showed virtually the same increase in the fourth quarter as it had in the third quarter. The figures are preliminary but I think that the rise during the fourth quarter, at an annual rate, amounted to about 18% and in the third quarter to something like 19% or 20%. To me this was something quite remarkable. I would have thought that during the fourth quarter there would have been a substantial falling off in a credit issued to the private sector. This has led us to examine the situation very carefully. We have been looking at this regularly. We did so the week before last, last week and again today. It is quite correct; we have got to keep a very careful check on this credit position because it is a very serious potential inflationary factor for one thing and it does mean, if we are going to adopt a policy of holding down Government spending, which we are doing, we have certainly got to watch the concomitant credit situation and the supply of money. We are dealing with that matter very carefully and it may well be that as we discuss this matter further, we may very shortly have to take further steps in this direction. We will have to see how that emerges.</p>

<p>This brings me to a point which I do want to raise and deal with for one or two minutes, namely the criticism which has been raised in this House during the no-confidence debate and again in this debate of some strange sort of financial mismanagement by this Government.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the case of the Budget of last year, we made it moderately expansionary and we attuned our monetary policy accordingly. In June we made a small downward adjustment in the value of the rand because it was essential, and we changed over from the system of rapid and frequent small adjustments in the exchange value of the rand, which I think has been a very good measure. In August we raised the liquid asset requirements of the banks to try to cope with the very substantial liquidity and the potential inflation that could follow. We also made far-reaching and important improvements to our whole foreign exchange control system. One of the results of that has been that in the last few weeks we have set in working a revised blocked rand system. We have in fact abolished the blocked rand in certain classes of overseas investments and we now have a securities rand in operation. The Stock Exchange tells us that it has started very well. This is regarded as a substantial improvement in our foreign exchange control position and, indeed, has a very healthy effect. We hope that the initial signs are good and that it will have a healthy effect on foreign investment in the Republic.</p>

<p>Last year we made it easier for the banks to obtain funds abroad. When we came to the serious position in the balance of payments and the reserves, we devalued in September. We did that fairly substantially precisely to handle the situation that we have had during the last few weeks when the price of gold experienced a further substantial drop. However, for the gold price to be approximately $131 a fine ounce is a very fine performance, especially with the pressures on gold at the moment. That is the view which is expressed by some of our best advisers overseas. One has to wait and see what happens ahead. I believe there is going to be considerable pressure on gold for some time yet. Unfortunately there are a number of countries that want to phase gold out as a monetary asset. They certainly are not succeeding. But in the process of all this talk, they are giving rise to certain fears which I think are groundless in the long run. However, it has an unfortunate depressing effect on the gold market in the short run. However, under all these pressures gold has come up again to approximately $131, and I think that under the circumstances it has done extremely well.</p>

<p>So we will proceed. We are watching the fiscal, monetary and financial position day by day. In my opening speech I said that we have a great deal to be thankful for. <i>The Argus</i> called my approach one of &#x201C;cautious optimism&#x201D;. I think that that is the best way I can describe it, because I have every confidence in the financial capacity of this country. We will make the necessary adjustments as we go <span class="col_1317-1318" refersTo="page_0675"/>ahead. I believe that once we have gone through our budgetary procedures and made such adjustments to our fiscal and monetary policies as may be necessary, we will in fact within the next year or so come out extremely well at the other side.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am asked to say something about our gold and foreign exchange reserves. In a word or two I would say that one of the big problems round about September, when the gold price dropped so severely and our exports were badly hit by the depression in world markets, our net reserves, i.e. excluding borrowings, were falling. The hon. member will see that in publications of the Reserve Bank. The net reserve position is a better indicator in that sense than the gross reserves, because the latter include foreign borrowings. If one can borrow on a fair scale for a length of time then one might say that the gross reserves are quite a good criterion because we are getting a regular inflow of capital over a long period. However, we would much rather look at the position of the net reserves. These were in fact dropping. That is one reason why we took the step to devalue. When we did that, for the months through to December we stabilized the net reserves position, i.e. irrespective of borrowings.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there has recently again been a call on the Reserve Bank for foreign exchange, i.e. money that is sent abroad. I can only think that this is because some people insist on thinking we are going to devalue again. Therefore they purchase foreign exchange from the Reserve Bank, and that money goes out of the country. Some of it is outright speculation and some of it, I should imagine, is legitimate because there are people who have to meet commitments abroad. I fully appreciate this. However, there is no doubt that some of it is simply short-term speculation, in the sense that they are trying to make a quick penny, as one might say. It is a pity that under these conditions those people do not have more regard for their country&#x2019;s position and less for their own immediate enrichment. Because of this we have to watch the situation very carefully. However, we do have loans coming in. We have a very good standing abroad. The hon. member may have seen that Escom recently succeeded in raising a loan of no less than $200 million. Then there are also our exports as well as our gold sales. On the gross reserves position we have something like R950 million. We are repaying loans from time to time, and we are also getting in loans from time to time. Overall, although the next few months might be fairly tricky, I have no doubt that an improvement in the current account, which is clearly there to see, is going to pull this position straight in the longer run. I see this as a problem of a matter of a few months. We will, however, have to watch it very carefully. If it were not for the fact that some of these people were purchasing foreign exchange from the Reserve Bank on a fair scale from time to time, we would be able to handle the situation without any problems at all. Even so, with the leads and lags moving adversely from time to time against us, we will certainly handle the situation. It simply means that we will have to give closer attention to the decisions week by week.</p>

<p>Basically I believe the current account is improving. In fact, the signs are clearly there. The balance of payments over the year will definitely improve as a result, and I have no doubt that we can cover any deficit that might emerge by the influx of foreign capital.</p>

It is not as a result of devaluation that our current account has improved and is improving. It is a situation which we can certainly handle. I should like to thank the House for its indulgence.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Third Time.</block>

<p>It is not customary for the Minister to present a formal introductory speech at the Third Reading, but I do, nevertheless, want to avail myself of this opportunity to make an important announcement in connection with exchange control. I shall not occupy much of the time of the House with it.</p>

<p>During the past few months I have made several adjustments to exchange control in order to deal with new circumstances. In August 1975, for example, exchange control over the raising of foreign loans by South African bodies was relaxed, the control over internal loans by foreign-controlled firms was extended to cover leases as well, and the control over payments for imports and exports was applied more strictly. The regulations in respect of forward cover were also relaxed. I referred yesterday to the recently introduced transferability of the new securities rand. All these adjustments have contributed to the safeguarding and improvement of our balance of payments. It has now become desirable to adopt further measures.</p>

<p>This morning the president of the Reserve Bank issued a statement in which he announced new credit control measures. He referred to the fact that recently there had again been a considerable increase in the foreign exchange purchases of the Reserve Bank. These increased purchases indicate a new unfavourable movement in the so-called &#x201C;leads and lags&#x201D; in the balance of payments which have occurred so frequently during the past few years, and which have handicapped the administration of the country&#x2019;s gold and other foreign reserves very considerably. Although it is assumed that these movements are for the most part occurring within the framework of the existing exchange control directions, it is surmised that in some cases, with the transfer of funds to and the holding of assets abroad, deliberate evasion of the regulations is occurring.</p>

<p>The president of the Reserve Bank consulted me in this regard, and I was in complete agreement with the idea that a thorough investigation should be instituted into such evasions. The Government attaches great importance to this investigation, and I am looking forward to hearing the outcome of that investigation. The banks are already engaged in the investigation, and the Government will not hesitate to take strict action in cases where contravention can be proved. In this regard the exchange control regulations make provision for a term of imprisonment of up to five years and/or the imposition of a fine of up to R10 000, or even more if the value of the subjacent transaction exceeds R10 000. This is an indication of the serious light in which such transactions are being regarded.</p>

<p>After consultation with the Reserve Bank I also deem it necessary to effect the following two adjustments to the existing exchange control regulations and directions&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_1323-1324" refersTo="page_0678"/>(1) Inhabitants of the Republic who receive foreign exchange abroad for any reason, for example as payment for exports, are at present required to transfer this foreign exchange to South Africa within 30 days after receipt. This arrangement creates the possibility for exporters to invest export proceeds abroad for short periods. The regulation is now being amended, and in future all inhabitants of the Republic who receive foreign exchange abroad for any reason are required to sell it to an authorized dealer in foreign exchange in South Africa within seven days after receipt.</li>

<li>(2) As far as South African importers are concerned, authorized dealers may only provide exchange to an importer upon submission of documentary proof verifying that goods have been shipped. As a special concession authorized dealers are, however, allowed to make advance payments of not more than 40% of the factory cost of machinery or equipment which is being specially manufactured on order for a South African importer. However, documentary proof has to be submitted that the advance payment is required by the foreign manufacturer and that such payment is normal in the trade concerned. There is reason to surmise that this concession is sometimes abused, and therefore authorized exchange dealers will in future be able to effect such advance payments on imports only after they have received prior approval for the payments from the Reserve Bank.</li>

</ol>

<p>I want to point out once again that the existing exchange control regulations and directions have been devised in such a way that there is no unnecessary interference with normal trade practices. This allows a certain flexibility in the control, which unfortunately is sometimes abused for short-term speculative considerations. The Government would not like to eliminate this flexibility, and I am consequently making an appeal to authorized exchange dealers and to the private sector to comply scrupulously with the exchange control regulations and directions in respect of all foreign exchange transactions.</p>

<p>The credit control measures which the president of the Reserve Bank announced this morning are intended to reduce the rate of increase in bank credit to the private sector as a temporary measure so as to strengthen the balance of payments and reduce the potential inflationary consequences of excessive liquidity to the economy. I referred yesterday to the importance of effective control over bank credit and the money supply, and it is also one of the undertakings of the Government under the collective campaign against inflation that it will ensure that there is no excessive increase in the money supply.</p>

<p>I want to give this House the assurance that the Government is bearing this undertaking in mind and will adapt its monetary and credit policy wherever necessary.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the announcement by the hon. the Minister of Finance shows to what a sorry state he has allowed things to develop, when he has to announce, at this time of virtual crisis in the economic situation, that he is going to take measures which he should have taken a long time ago. I do not intend dealing with this matter, because I want to move to other matters. In this, the prelude to the budget, the normal rule has been reversed. It is normally the person who pays the piper who calls the tune. In this instance it is the Government which calls the tune and the people who pay the piper. Once again the Minister has given an indication that it is the people who must provide the solution while the Government calls the tune. This time, however, it is not so much a piper as a bugler who is playing the tune, and a sombre one at that.</p>

<p>I make no apology, Mr. Speaker, for returning to the central issue in the thoughts of the public of South Africa at this moment. We have already debated in this House three aspects of the situation: Our military action on the border and in Angola, the failure of the Government to inform and to motivate the people and, thirdly, the up-dating of the Defence Act. As a result there have been areas of agreement and areas of controversy, but the real facts are slowly unfolding. It is against this background that my leader, with his usual grasp of priorities, last week cut through the futility of post-mortems and put his finger on what matters&#x2014;the reality of &#x201C;now&#x201D; and of &#x201C;tomorrow&#x201D;.</p>

<p>He has often done this on other issues, and each time we have found ourselves sidetracked into a futile political debate. We have therefore tried to return attention to the central <span class="col_1325-1326" refersTo="page_0679"/>issue of what lies ahead. We shall leave the Progressive generals and field-marshals to re-fight Angola in their caucus and in the Press, but I have to refer to one matter before I turn to other matters. I refer to a newspaper issued by the Progressive Party, <i>Progress,</i> of January/February 1976, on the front page of which I find two statements which cannot be allowed to stand. The one is, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, M.P., Colin Eglin, M.P., and Harry Schwarz, M.P., have now paid a special pre-parliamentary visit to the border areas &#x2026;</block>

<p>How very noble of them, Mr. Speaker! I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; We are going to see the situation at first hand, including the circumstances of our boys on the border, and to express our solidarity with them.</block>

<p>[Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on 30 January we had an amendment before this House, which read, <i>inter alia</i> (Hansard, 1976, col. 356)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This House in conclusion conveys its sincere thanks and appreciation to the Defence Force and all officers and men for the courageous and heroic manner in which they have acquitted themselves of their task in the operational area and expresses its deep sympathy with those who have lost loved ones in the struggle.</block>

<p>Here, Mr. Speaker, in this newspaper statement, the Progressive Party expresses its solidarity with the troops. Against this amendment, those words which I have just quoted, they voted; and they recorded their vote by dividing this House. [Interjections.] But, Mr. Speaker, the report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A statement to <i>Progress,</i> issued by Dr. Van Zyl Slabbert, reads: &#x201C;The PRP caucus, at its first pre-parliamentary session, expressed grave concern at the Russian presence in Angola and agreed that South Africans are at one in wanting to counter Russian imperialism in Africa. The caucus also supported any action that would alleviate and ease the position of our soldiers doing military duty.&#x201D;</block>

<p>On 30 January, in this House, Mr. Speaker there was an amendment before this House, reading (Hansard, 1976, col. 356)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This House expresses its grave concern at the communist aggression committed in Angola by Russia and Cuba with a view to imposing a Marxist state on the unwilling inhabitants by force of arms.</block>

<p>That same party, whose caucus had taken a decision, which they released, voted against this amendment and it stands recorded in Hansard. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, the reason why I raise this is the target at which this newspaper is aimed. Alongside this report stand the words: &#x201C;Calling Durban North.&#x201D; [Interjections.] To the public outside, they express solidarity with our forces and antagonism towards communism and Russian imperialism. In Parliament, to the outside world, they say: &#x201C;We are not prepared to vote for an amendment criticizing Russian military imperialism. We are not prepared to express our thanks to the troops of South Africa.&#x201D; This, Mr. Speaker, is the &#x201C;single&#x201D; voice of the Progressive and Reform parties. And I deliberately refer to them in the plural, Sir. I hope that the people of South Africa will take note of this and will know what to believe when they hear the protestations and the pious platitudes of this party when they think they can get away with it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, we could all be generals. We could have had a fiery debate for instance on the <i>Washington Post</i> report, but what would it achieve? History will judge when all the facts are known. History will also judge the Progressive Party as it will judge the United Party and as it will judge the Government. Until those facts are known, as my leader correctly said, there is no point in indulging in futile academic argument; we should rather look to the lessons we have learnt from Angola. My leader will be proved right as regards the direction to which he pointed, which is already fortunately proving to be a national approach and not a party approach, the approach of &#x201C;talking&#x201D; if you can avoid &#x201C;shooting&#x201D;. He will be proved right in respect of some of the other directions in which he indicated we should move, because I believe that the one political lesson we have learned is that events have shattered the euphoria, the dream, that time is on our side in South Africa. <span class="col_1327-1328" refersTo="page_0680"/>It has pointed to the tragedy of the wasted years, the years when votes appeared more important than political solutions to our problems.</p>

<p>In passing, Mr. Speaker, I want to try to make the Government understand why hundreds of thousands of South Africans can believe passionately in South Africa, in our sovereignty, in our security and in our territorial integrity, and yet remain totally opposed to the Government&#x2019;s political policies. But because we are opposed to political policies it does not mean that we will exchange the Government which we have, much as we dislike its policies and its direction, for a Marxist dictatorship. Neither will we accept the abject surrender of the left&#x2014;the abject surrender which I believe is aided and abetted by the views of the Progressive Party&#x2014;nor accept a suicidal confrontation which is envisaged and which is in fact, I believe, desired by so many on the right. There still remains a central course in South Africa, which is the only safe course. So we can continue to be opposed politically whilst we can stand together as South Africans and still be South Africans.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I am not going to go further on the political aspects, but there are military lessons. People have come back from the border. Information has been coming in from many sources. There have been allegations, rumours, reports and complaints, and we have tried to evaluate and to sift the tales that have come back. Again, one could have a ball of a debate. You could air all the allegations and the complaints and you could have an exciting and perhaps a heated debate, but I believe most of these are matters which need investigation first and having been proved can then be raised later on the Defence Vote. But certain matters need to be raised now because at this moment, as we sit here this afternoon, we have men on the borders and their families at home and it is essential that some of the damaging rumours&#x2014;I am sorry that the hon. the Minister of Defence could not be here&#x2014;should be cleared. The air should be cleared in the interests of the morale of the nation, because often it is minor things which affect morale as much, if not more, than bigger things.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to turn to the question of preparedness. There has been a lot of loose talk, but what disturbs me is what I regard as the incredibly damaging statements by the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Defence to the effect that we cannot match all Soviet weapons. I can think of no single statement which has caused more concern and despondency amongst those who have sons on the border than that single statement. I can think of no question more frequently asked me than the question: &#x201C;Is it true that we are outgunned and that our boys cannot match the weapons against them?&#x201D; My own information is that except for &#x201C;Rooi Oog&#x201D;, the &#x201C;Stalin&#x2019;s Organ&#x201D; which outranged us but which itself could be counteracted and neutralized by the superior skill, training and mobility of our men, we are able to hold our own in every field; in fact, not only hold our own but prove totally superior. It is my information that our 5,5s shot the daylights out of the enemy&#x2014;the handful of them which we probably had there&#x2014;and that it is one of the most feared weapons today in Angola. It is my information that we were able to stand up against the tanks and neutralize them. If these are the facts&#x2014;and these are the facts I get from the boys who were there, who were involved themselves&#x2014;surely it is incredible that the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Defence should have made such a statement, for what I believe was probably a political reason. They possibly wanted to encourage people to supply arms, and to point out that we were standing alone against Russian imperialism. That is the only reason I can assume for a statement which I believe damaged the morale, particularly of our people at home and of the troops who had not yet been up there and did not know for themselves that we could, in fact, match anything that was thrown at us.</p>

<p>Of course there are weaknesses. One reads stories of &#x201C;digging in&#x201D; in slit trenches with bayonets and tin cans, and all that sort of thing. These, however, are matters of detail. They are not issues that strike at the basis of our ability to fight back. I hope that this sort of statement will be clarified beyond any doubt so that those who are going up and those who have sons up there now will know that it is not true that we are unable to hold our own against anything they throw at us. This whole question of preparedness will need further consideration, but this is not the time or the place to deal with that.</p>

<p>The next point I want to raise is that I <span class="col_1329-1330" refersTo="page_0681"/>believe that the old military adage, &#x201C; Their&#x2019;s not to reason why&#x201D; does not apply to South Africa and to South Africans. I believe that we require and required in Angola and on the border, better motivation and a proper briefing of men prior to operations. It is not enough simply to have discipline and to say: &#x201C;You are going in to do this.&#x201D; South Africans are independent-minded people and I believe, that we have to improve the extent and motivation of our briefing before men engage in operations. Then, when they are engaged in operations, I believe we have to improve our communications and the information conveyed to them. When one is in action it is essential that one knows what is going on around one. It is essential particularly when aircraft are involved. It is also essential when quick mobility is involved. When people can move 20 and 30 miles in a couple of hours, it is essential to know what is going on so that if there is a sudden movement ahead, one knows whether it is the enemy or one&#x2019;s own people. I think there is too much of a tendency in the army, as there is excessively in the Government, to apply secrecy which, in actual fact, does not aid but rather harms the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations. There comes a time when &#x201C;secrecy&#x201D; becomes secrecy for its own sake, not with an objective, but simply for the sake of secrecy itself. I believe that our army is perhaps the one army in the world that deserves to be taken&#x2014;and will not abuse being taken&#x2014;into the confidence of the High Command and kept fully informed in operations. I refer, as an example, to the motivation before the withdrawal of our troops. Surely when men are being brought back, one would imagine that they would be told &#x201C;why&#x201D; and that they would be motivated so that on their return&#x2014;until they were told the full story&#x2014;they would not feel they were perhaps withdrawing because of superior opposition by enemy military forces. Motivation is as important when one is making a tactical withdrawal as it is when one is making an advance.</p>

<p>These matters, which we have already raised in previous debates, all fit into the pattern of motivation and information. In the same way that we have criticized the failure to motivate our people at home, so I believe that in the field there is room for improvement in motivation and information.</p>

<p>I turn to other issues which, in themselves, may not be important. I think, for instance, of Grootfontein which is the major base and the key to our operations on the border. We have known for years that the Grootfontein base was to be built. I have pleaded in this House for priority to be given to the Golden Highway and the communication from Grootfontein northwards, so that if we were ever called upon to engage in operations, we would have a proper base and proper road communications and not the notorious roads on which trucks last approximately eight to ten months before they fall to bits. However, we delayed this. We delayed it to follow a programme and when the time came a crash plan had to be made to build what was required. Even at this stage the road has not even been touched, except for minor repairs, and the base itself is still in the process of being built. Admittedly, rain was a factor, but I think we could have been more far-sighted. I raise this question now because it is a matter of urgency. I do not believe it can wait months or even weeks until the Defence Vote comes up. It is now a matter which should enjoy total priority. Every priority should be given to get that base completed and to get the communications from it put into a state of usefulness.</p>

<p>Then I turn to matters affecting welfare and morale. Some of these may again seem minor matters. Let me deal with one immediately. At this moment, on 17 February, the wives of Citizen Force men on the border have not yet received their pay due at the end of January.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This is not a rumour; it is a fact. I said there were certain matters which had to be dealt with now because the men are on the border. They know their wives have not been paid. They have had letters from their wives saying they have not been paid. That hon. member would like me to shut up and keep it secret while the men on the border who are getting shot at are worrying because their wives have not been paid. Yet he says we must not raise that sort of matter. If you cannot get it fixed by direct communication, this is the place to raise it and that hon. member should be supporting me rather than criticizing and questioning me. He should be standing by me. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>While I refer to the men hearing from their wives, let me say that, despite the improvements that have been made, the postal services have not yet been brought up to the state they should be in. I am prepared to bet that Government members are also receiving complaints&#x2014;we are certainly receiving them&#x2014;of letters and parcels that are not arriving, undelivered letters that are being sent back &#x201C;Return to sender&#x201D; and parcels being sent up there and not being delivered. Some were already sent up on 16 November but they have not yet been delivered. What has happened to them? These are the things that affect the morale of soldiers and of parents. They are things which it is our duty to raise when one cannot get them fixed any other way. Perhaps by raising them in this forum, something will be done to put them right.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister spoke of &#x201C;rumours&#x201D;. I heard a rumour which I was not prepared to touch, but now I have found the facts. Some of the hon. members here, for instance, may have contributed to the Turkeys for the Troops Fund on Springbok Radio. I do not suppose they did; some of us did. Where are those turkeys? They never got to the troops in the field. This is the sort of lack of organization and lack of attention to the welfare of troops that must be put right.

<p>Read my Hansard. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us take up another matter. The men who came back from the field, when they were withdrawn from Angola, came back to Grootfontein. All the preparation that was made for them was that the tents were up. The place was flooded with mud. There was no preparation made to receive them and they were kept there <span class="col_1333-1334" refersTo="page_0683"/>four days, not to debrief them, but to await the convenience of the Minister who wanted to come up to meet them personally before they were sent back to South Africa. It then took them another three and three-quarter days by train. When they had to go up, they were flown up but when they had to come back after having served there&#x2014;and not having had a picnic, because it was not a picnic&#x2014;they were delayed for four days at Grootfontein after they had come back to South West Africa. After that they were on the train for nearly another four days. This is not the way to treat our men. They are loyal and dedicated soldiers and, when they go into action, they go in to serve South Africa. When they come back, we owe them something. We owe them something when they come back in the same way as we owe them much more when they are in the field, but when they are in the field they must put up with inconveniences and the things that are wrong. That is part of being in any army in any country in the world. Afterwards, the other issues leave lasting resentment. Not what happened while they were fighting, not what happened when they were in the field, but what happened when they came back causes a resentment that stays in their mind long after any other. They want to know: &#x201C;Why could I not have gone straight home?&#x2019;&#x2019; I want to say at once that in the field up there, with very few exceptions, there has been fine leadership from the Permanent Force officers, the Citizen Force officers and the National Service officers.</p>

<p>There has been, again with a few exceptions, a fine response. Generally, I believe, training has been adequate, although there have been examples where it could have been better. That is why I believe it is necessary to raise these other things. We have fine forces and we have outstanding men&#x2014;South Africa owes them a great debt of gratitude. The way to do that is to ensure that these petty annoyances, these things which are unnecessary, these things which could be avoided, these things which simply affect morale, do not happen. Unless one brings them to light, unless one discusses them, unless one raises them and shows up the sort of thing that must not happen, then they are going to go on happening. That is why I believe it is necessary, not when we discuss the Defence Vote at a later stage, but now on this Bill, to raise them so that what can be done to put things right can be done now and not when the next batch of men go up.</p>

<p>The debate is drawing to a conclusion. It means that we now have to wait for the Budget at the end of March and until then we shall have to face events as they happen. I believe we are going through a difficult time which is going to call for cool heads and cool decisions. I hope, although I am very doubtful at times, that the financial management of this country under the hon. the Ministers of Finance and Economic Affairs will give that leadership.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. J. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has become very clear to me that the hon. member for Durban Point&#x2019;s image as regards matters of defence has taken a knock since he went on that accompanying trip. It is very clear to us that he is very sensitive on this score, and I wonder whether that is why he made such a fuss today during the final part of his speech. He became completely over-emotional. I share in his concern when gossip is involved which will prejudice our men in the Defence Force and lower their morale, but then we should also be careful when we participate in this debate and speak in this House, not to contribute towards lowering their morale. I can, of course, not agree with the point of view expressed by the hon. member when he said that the measures announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance this afternoon were proof of, as he called it, the &#x201C;sorry state of the economy&#x2019;&#x2019;. No. To me this shows a large degree of responsibility on the part of the Government, i.e. that it is prepared to take measures whenever they must be taken, irrespective of whether or not they are popular.</p>

<p>Over the past few days we have heard much during the debate on this Bill, about defence <span class="col_1335-1336" refersTo="page_0684"/>and Angola. We have also heard a great deal about devaluation and inflation. I think that those matters have been dealt with fairly exhaustively. However, the basic question concerns an amount to be appropriated for spending in the interests of South Africa. I find it ironical that while the hon. member for Durban Point is kicking up a tremendous fuss&#x2014;I cannot judge the merits of what he said, because I do not have the facts available&#x2014;because the salaries of members of the Defence Force have allegedly not been paid out, the Opposition is at the same time involved in opposing a measure which seeks to spend a certain amount of money in the interests of South Africa. Can one imagine what would happen if that of which the hon. member for Durban Point is accusing us, were to become reality and salaries could not be paid out and the Government could not meet its obligations? Surely that would result in chaos. One can understand the Opposition criticizing the Government about the amount involved, <i>inter alia,</i> that the amount is too large, and so forth; after all, it is the task of the Opposition to criticize.</p>

<p>However, when they refuse to pass the Second or Third Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill after they have received all the assurances for which they asked, and have been informed that the Government has taken effective steps, and will do so in the future&#x2014;we had another example of this this afternoon&#x2014;it is somewhat stupid and irresponsible. Surely it would amount to a complete disruption of the South African economy if payments which must be made, cannot be made. This will expose South Africa to its enemies. One expects a responsible Opposition, for the sake of South Africa and its people, to put forward positive suggestions for improving and strengthening the economy, but we had very little of this in the Second Reading debate. We rather gained the impression that the official Opposition as well as the &#x201C;Opposition in those benches&#x201D;, as they are known these days, were intent on creating a psychosis of pessimism. They do not give a hoot for what the economic effects of such a psychosis will be or otherwise they are too stupid to realize what it will be. They join in gaily in the prophecies of doom made by irresponsible and certainly incompetent so-called &#x201C;economic reporters&#x201D; in certain newspapers. Why all the clever economists who write for the newspapers are not very wealthy or sitting in Parliament yet, I really cannot say. The fact is that anyone who in present circumstances makes politics of a natural economic trend such as the present downward movement in the business cycle, is engaged in subtly sabotaging the Government and therefore South Africa as well. A pessimistic psychosis is something unpleasant. It gains momentum and can lead to a collapse. Hon. members must therefore be careful when they are discussing economic or military situations in this House not to cause a pessimistic psychosis to arise. I want to quote what a man such as Dr. A. S. J. Baster said long ago in his <i>Twilight of American Capitalism,</i> viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a free economic system, which depends for its continued operation on the disposition of consumers to go on buying things and of producers to go on producing them in the hope that they will be bought, a complete stoppage can be brought about if only there is a sufficient number of people who feel that there is going to be one.</block>

<p>This is of course the truth. One may ask whether that is what those people who are creating a pessimistic psychosis want. Do they want the South African economy to come to a standstill, with all the unpleasant consequences thereof?</p>

<p>We have challenged the Opposition to tell us where the Government has wasted or incorrectly spent money. But what have we had from that side of the House? The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town delivered a terrible tirade about Cadillacs, Mercedeses or Mercedes Benz cars&#x2014;it did not matter, he said, which it was. He also mentioned houses which were being built. I like the hon. member, but his arithmetic is poor. If the hon. member were to sit in the lounge and order brandy and soda for himself as well as for me&#x2014;and I am inclined to think that the hon. member would do this&#x2014;and if he were to buy a packet of cigarettes as well, he would have wasted more of his parliamentary salary on a percentage basis than the wastage by the Government&#x2014;about which he made such a fuss, would be in relation to the total income of the State. When one listens to something like this, one feels that people who bring such absurd examples to the House, are politically and economically immature. I agree that it is <span class="col_1337-1338" refersTo="page_0685"/>the little foxes who ruin the vineyard, but one must retain one&#x2019;s perspective.</p>

<p>A great fuss has also been made about the so-called misapplication of funds at Port St. Johns. We have already received facts, and shall receive more. The action of the Government was in the best interests of South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has already answered this fully. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs and of Forestry also dealt with this. I shall therefore leave it at that.</p>

<p>Let us look in all sincerity at the economy and the State&#x2019;s handling thereof. The first point I want to make is that there is no historical analogy for the unusual upward swing of the economy of the Western world after 1950. It does not exist. Indeed, it was no ordinary upward movement in the business cycle. I should much rather say that it was a change in the structure of the whole economic system. It was a period of rebuilding in Western Europe. In South Africa, however, it was the awakening of a young country with an immense potential. A new social order was developed, thanks to the National Party&#x2019;s policy. Even people like the hon. member for Johannesburg North&#x2014;I am sorry that the hon. member is not here&#x2014;could not, in spite of the fact that they did not subscribe to the policy of the Nationalist Party, withstand the attraction of a surging and progressive economy. It was the progressive economy which brought a member like the hon. member for Johannesburg North to South Africa and not the Progressive Party. It is the progressive and driving economy which keeps him here. Over a period of 26 years we had a state of net investment in South Africa, that is, there was an addition to the existing capital supply of the country. At that time this was caused by a growing and developing population. It was also caused by development in several fields&#x2014;such as agriculture, industries, viticulture and the private sector, which also played a role. The public sector saw to the establishment of an infrastructure so that development could continue in the various fields. Exceptional opportunities for profit also arose. The net investment stimulated consumption and this in turn was an incentive for further production. We are therefore dealing with a progressive economy which must lead, and did lead, to a rising real national income. I believe that the economic rise of South Africa will be held up as a classic example to students of the economy in the future.</p>

<p>The upward swing in or the structural change of the South African economy was so powerful that hardly any notice was taken of short-term business cycles in the economy over the past 20 years. It is no wonder that some of our more optimistic economists and businessmen and, very important, the Opposition as well, apparently knew that something like a business cycle existed. The hon. the Minister of Finance had to express himself in the following terms, and rightly so, when he addressed the <i>Financial Mail</i> Annual Investment Conference in Johannesburg on 14 October&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Too often we in South Africa seem to forget that there is such a thing as a business cycle. It may no longer be true to say, in this space age, that what goes up must come down, but in an economic context it is certainly untrue to say that what goes down must continue to go down.</block>

<p>The long-term upward swing of the South African economy was powerful, and is far from ending, otherwise the hon. member for Johannesburg North would have pulled up his tent pegs long ago.</p>

<p>As has often happened in history, a few important external factors suddenly hit the driving young economy and caused it to lose speed. We can mention two here: the impact of the energy and oil crisis and the stagnation of the economies of our most important Western trading partners. The oil crisis resulted in inflation and rates of inflation increased throughout the world at a faster rate than ever before. South Africa imported inflation as never before. As a result of selling gold at a high price, the effect of inflation could, however, be reduced. Unfortunately&#x2014;and no one could foresee this&#x2014;our trading partners became bogged down. Their economies stagnated and the result was that the price of gold dropped, bringing with it the usual results.</p>

<p>Now we are waiting for an upward swing in the economies of depression-stricken countries with which we trade. Today I want to make the statement that the downward swing of the business cycle in South Africa has an exogenous explanation in the main and that the Government is not to blame and the hon. the Minister of Finance even less, for measures, <span class="col_1339-1340" refersTo="page_0686"/>for example devaluation, which were taken in order to effect the necessary rate adjustments in the economy.</p>

<p>We have become part of an international economic system with a particular rhythm. It would be foolish to go against this rhythm on our own. The measures which we take, must be aimed at riding the economic wave when the time is ripe. The period of rest which our economy is enjoying at the moment may be to our advantage. I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. A. Engelbrecht, the chief economist of Volkskas, in what he said in <i>Rapport</i> of 15 February 1976 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the present weak international trade conditions which will continue for some time, the only way out is to lay a strong foundation for healthy development on the road ahead.</block>

<p>This is exactly what we are doing. The Government is prepared to take less popular steps. The Government is prepared to put a damper on bank credit, if this should be necessary and if it is in the interests of South Africa. The hon. the Minister gave us proof of this today. There is no reason for unnecessary concern. However, we must be careful and act responsibly, but we must not be over-hasty if the downward phase of the business cycle continues for a somewhat longer period than that to which we have become accustomed. We must mark time. The brakes of the economy cannot be released immediately in the light of the high rate of inflation which we still have. This would create the danger of demand inflation while we are still struggling with cost inflation.</p>

<p>Balance of payment problems will definitely come to the fore very quickly too. There is enough potential in South Africa, however, for a rapid revival when the time is right. We have reserve production capacities which can be utilized at once. We also have several projects which will stimulate the economy which can be launched. We have had assurances from the hon. the Minister in respect of the steps envisaged by the Government and what has already been done. I believe that if everyone co-operates in the interests of South Africa, also as far as the economy is concerned, there will be a rosy future for us in this beautiful country under the competent leadership of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. T. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Urban Transport Facilities in the Republic, commonly known as the Driessen Report, drew the attention of the public to the acute traffic problem in the Republic. The gist of the recommendations of the Driessen Report is that all available means should be utilized in a co-ordinated fashion so that all the inhabitants of the Republic of South Africa may derive the maximum benefit from it. The traffic problem is not a phenomenon which is limited to the Republic of South Africa. It is indeed a world-wide tendency and a direct result of the process of urbanization, which is typical of industrialized societies. Notwithstanding its apparent and obvious cultural, educational and recreational advantages, the migration to the cities has created a problem with which all planning authorities are struggling. The picture as regards Western traffic, as seen by J. N. Thompson, the well-known transport economist, is described as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Transport accounts for about one-fifth of the economic activity of most industrialized nations and it presents a world of splendid chaos. This chaos lies in its economic performance. One need only point to the congestion in most cities of the world, the appalling toll of deaths and injury on the roads, the declining condition of public transport and the deficit on most railway systems. No one could call this a smoothly running part of our economy. No one could pretend that it is close to an economic optimum, however that may be defined.</block>

<p>Basically, the traffic problem occurred due to this increase in the urban population and the increase in the number of motor vehicles. It is conservatively estimated that by the year 2000, the urban population of the Republic will have increased by 150% from the present 10 280 000 to 25 180 000. The present number of motor vehicles will, it is estimated, increase ten-fold to nearly 10 million in the year 2000. If the handling of transport on our roads already creates a problem today, can hon. members imagine what the situation will be in 10 to 15 years time? The concentration of large numbers of motor vehicles in urban centres gives rise to a host of acute problems, which are assuming the proportions of a crisis. The traffic problem entails <i>inter alia</i> the <span class="col_1341-1342" refersTo="page_0687"/>following: Traffic congestion during peak hours; insufficient parking facilities in metropolitan areas; poor support of public transport facilities and a weakening of the economic social situation of the central business area.</p>

<p>A facet of the traffic problem which cannot be too earnestly stressed today, is spatial organization. It is estimated that every motor vehicle needs about 500 square metres to move in, whereas the urban resident has to perform his basic living functions in an area of about 50 square metres. This justifies the question: Who is the master and who the slave? It is due in particular to this discrepancy in spatial organization between road user and means of transport that the general point of view arises that cities are being suffocated due to motor transport. The problem of urban transport is not limited to traffic jams and parking problems. The problem is far more complicated and relates to aspects such as pollution, preservation of the environment, safety on the roads and fuel conservation measures. It is usually argued that the traffic problems can be solved by building ever larger throughways and by providing more parking areas. This is an illusion, a chimera, because overseas experience and local experience has proved irrefutably that this is no solution to the problem. As long ago as the 19th century Robert Louis Stevenson had stated: &#x201C;When a road is once built, it is a strange thing how it collects traffic.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In the feverish haste to deal with the traffic problem, parks have been replaced by parking areas, while trees have had to make way for parking meters. Yet at best, this can only afford temporary relief. The construction of more and bigger roads and the provision of more parking areas in cities are and remain artificial solutions to the problem. To my mind, the short-term solution to this problem should be sought on a fourfold basis. In the first place, a re-evaluation of the existing aspects of the transport policy should be carried out. In the second place, there is the staggering of working hours, and in the third place, a re-evaluation of the land use factor in urban centres and lastly, the optimum utilization of suburban public transport facilities. When we consider certain salient aspects of the transport policy, we notice that the traditional method of approach has been to transport labour to the place of employment. The serious nature of the transport problem necessitates a radical and realistic re-evaluation of this method of approach.</p>

<p>It is clear that consideration should be given to a policy of deconcentration in accordance with which the place of employment should be localized as close as possible to the labour force. A second aspect of policy which deserves attention, is that local authorities and the South African Railways should work out a formula according to which sufficient parking areas and junction stations are to be provided, so that people can park their cars there and travel the rest of the way to their place of employment by train. The South African climate is particularly suited to the staggering of working hours. The urban transport problem is intimately bound up with peak hour traffic. The major problem in urban centres occurs mainly in the early morning and late afternoon. The reason is obvious, namely the uniform opening and closing down times of businesses. It is common knowledge that industries should plan their operations so as not to coincide with the peak hour traffic for a period of two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The extent of the problem is such that it would be justifiable to ask whether the staggering of working hours could not be regulated by legislation. Should so drastic a measure be deemed unnecessary at this stage, it should be brought home to the private and the public sectors that it is to their own advantage, in terms of productivity, to promote the staggering of working hours.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the zoning of land in the urban centres generates traffic. The use of land plays an important role as far as the density of traffic is concerned. Thus we can expect the traffic to be very heavy around the city centre and the industrial areas and reasonably light in residential areas. As I said before, the traffic situation in the metropolitan areas necessitates the co-operation of planners and local governments in working towards deconcentration. Attention should be given to the bulk factors which apply in urban centres. To freeze the traffic situation in any way, it is desirable that the existing business zoned area should not be increased.</p>

<p>Public transport, which includes suburban train services and bus transport, is an important link in the solution of the traffic problem. It is general knowledge that public transport <span class="col_1343-1344" refersTo="page_0688"/>demands substantial initial capital and investment, and furthermore, that it operates according to a simple economic principle, viz. that the more people use public transport, the lower the unit cost per person will be. The converse of course, is also true. Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that public transport facilities are not used to their full potential. In fact, we find a strange pattern, and in addition to that an anomaly, are being created in the structure of urban transport, and the taxpayer is directly involved, on the negative side unfortunately.</p>

<p>The anomaly, as it seems to me, lies in the fact that on the one hand we find that millions of rands are spent on the construction of major access roads, on the purchasing of expensive land and parking areas and on the buying out of road widening reserves which without exception are zoned for business purposes, while on the other hand, public transport facilities are subsidized by millions of rands due to the under-utilization thereof. In order to support this statement and elucidate it further, one need only look at the results of working of suburban train services for the past three years. This is on a country-wide basis. The losses on suburban train services on a country-wide basis for the financial year 1972-&#x2019;73 amount to R46,3 million; for 1973-&#x2019;74 it is R60,3 million and for 1974-&#x2019;75, R68,5 million. A passenger survey of suburban train services in the Cape Peninsula indicates that a daily total of 309 000 passengers were transported, that 748 trains were used daily and that 631 vehicles travelled approximately 22 000 km per day. Most of this was fully utilized. In fact, in certain respects it was over-utilized&#x2014;this occurred during the two peak hours, in the morning and in the afternoon. In practice, therefore, what it amounts to is that the taxpayers are charged with the financing of an impressive road-building programme as well as with an indirect subsidy on suburban train services and public bus transport. The irony of the matter is that neither of these two transport media function as they ought to. Public roads which lead to urban complexes do not function properly because they are over-occupied, and on the other hand public transport services do not function satisfactorily either, because they are under-utilized and have to be subsidized directly or indirectly by the taxpayer. If the position as regards suburban train services causes concern, then from the point of view of traffic, the position as regards public bus transport is alarming.</p>

<p>The problem as far as public bus transport is concerned, is a formidable one and is intimately bound up with city planning, residential development, road construction, traffic engineering, the South African Railways and urban traffic facilities. Because bus transport represents such an important component of public transport, and if we are in earnest in wishing to solve the traffic problem satisfactorily, certain priorities as regards bus transport will have to apply. One necessarily thinks in terms of giving consideration to having streets which are reserved chiefly for bus transport and pedestrians, lanes in busy streets which are reserved for bus traffic, traffic lights which allow bus traffic to flow faster and the far more important aspect of the incorporation in our traffic set-up of the traffic principle that buses picking up or off-loading passengers enjoy preference when re-entering the main traffic stream. In the new dispensation, a more fluid traffic set-up, there is no room for the well-known parkades in the urban centres of the metropolitan complexes. This is an uneconomical investment from the viewpoint of both the entrepreneur and the taxpayer. Consideration should be given to the placement of parkades on the peripheries of urban centres, and I understand there is a movement in this direction, the so-called &#x201C;park and ride&#x201D; system, from which the travelling public is then transported to its place of employment by bus transport.</p>

<p>The ideas I am expressing here may sound somewhat far-fetched in some respects, but if the council bears in mind that three-quarters of a bus transport fleet cannot be used during peak hours in most urban areas, or to put it differently, that three-quarters of the bus fleet is unproductive for 20 of the 24 hours, and that the losses suffered by the municipalities of Johannesburg and Durban on public bus transport amount to R7 million and R4 million respectively, it will be realized that strong medicine is needed for a very sick patient. The urban transport problem is a state of affairs which, in the long run, can seriously harm the economic viability and the vitality of a healthy national economy.</p>

<p>The transport system is the vital artery of the economic framework of a country, and it has a direct influence on the prices of consumer goods and, by implication, also on <span class="col_1345-1346" refersTo="page_0689"/>inflationary conditions. The largest single item by which inflation is imported is fuel, the price of which is manipulated by an overseas monopoly. By improved utilization of public transport, the travelling public can make an important contribution to the battle against inflation. The traffic problem is a top priority problem of national importance. The biggest contribution to the solution of the problem rests upon the shoulders of the travelling public. The traffic problem is not so much a physical or structural problem as one of attitude and orientation. It is a social problem. Should the orientation towards public transport change, then the practically insoluble traffic problem will become a problem which can be solved by scientific planning and co-ordination.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to the anti-inflation campaign and the fuel conservation measures. The success of the anti-inflation campaign or the fuel conservation measures, and therefore the traffic problem as well, depends on the mutual, motivated and sustained co-operation of the general public. Because there are encouraging signs that the anti-inflation campaign and the fuel conservation measures are meeting with success, there is no reason to assume that the traffic problem, too, cannot and will not be solved with the motivated and purposeful co-operation of the travelling public.</p>

<p>I do not expect these few ideas I have expressed concerning the urban traffic problem to cause the public transport facilities to be overcrowded tomorrow. This is only a modest effort on my part once again to bring a complex problem to the attention of this House. If we are aware of the problem, then that is half the battle.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to avail myself of this opportunity to wish my predecessor, Mr. Louis Pienaar, at present South Africa&#x2019;s ambassador to France, everything of the best on behalf of the constituency of Bellville. It is an honour and a privilege for me to succeed Mr. Pienaar in looking after the interests of the Bellville constituency in this hon. House, and it is the wish of the Bellville constituency that he should see to the interests of South Africa in Paris and in France in the same modest yet distinctive way that he saw to the interests of his Bellville constituency.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to congratulate the hon. member for Bellville on the occasion of his maiden speech this afternoon in this debate. He dealt with a difficult subject, the question of urban transportation, the various facets of the Driessen report and the overall question of urban transportation and its effects on inflation and on the cost of living. It was a constructive and positive speech and we on this side of the House would like to congratulate him and wish him well and hope that in the future we can look forward to further contributions on the level of the speech which he delivered here this afternoon.</p>

<p>The previous speaker, the hon. member for Malmesbury, dealt with various aspects regarding inflation and criticized the Opposition, which he believed was being pessimistic in its outlook of the future of South Africa, particularly as far as the economy was concerned. No person in his right senses could be pessimistic about the position of South Africa, bearing in mind the vast potential which still awaits exploitation in this country, such as the vast labour force which requires training and in some respects requires re-training, and the tremendous advantages which can be gained from exploiting the potential of South Africa. We on this side of the House are optimistic about the future of the economy of South Africa, but we would be even more optimistic if the hon. the Minister of Finance would adopt some of the do&#x2019;s and some of the dont&#x2019;s which were suggested to him by the hon. member for Constantia when he spoke on the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill.</p>

<p>We on this side have put forward various suggestions which we believe to be in the interests of South Africa and which we believe are in the interests of the economy of South Africa because the two are so closely interwoven. That is why the hon. member for Malmesbury should bear in mind that we, as a responsible Opposition, put forward suggestions in a constructive manner so as to improve the economy of South Africa where we think that improvement can be brought about by executive action or by the Government that is in power. The position of South Africa at the present time is one which, as far as the economy is concerned, people of many walks of life have looked at with trepidation. Indeed, there are many financial articles that <span class="col_1347-1348" refersTo="page_0690"/>appear in numerous journals that point out the difficulties and the problems that are facing the economy of South Africa. One article which I read recently on finance and the economy, and which appeared in the latest edition of <i>To the Point,</i> indicated in its introductory remarks that this country does face some difficulties as far as the economy is concerned. It mentions the fact that the forecast for 1976 could be hard, particularly in the first half of the year with a slow recovery later, perhaps in 1977. It then goes on to describe the various difficulties which are facing the economy of South Africa. It also deals with the various priorities that have to be given in relation to expenditure and in maintaining our economy. We know that the hon. the Minister of Finance has indicated in Press statements and also in the House that various steps are to be taken and that various cut-backs are to be made in the expenditure of certain departments. Here I think we must get our priorities right and see the situation in its correct perspective. In this connection there are certain aspects which we would like to put to the hon. the Minister of Finance, matters which we believe are priorities and which should receive his urgent attention.</p>

<p>There is, firstly, the question of compensation to be awarded to those men who are serving our country, and to their dependants, when they suffer various disabilities. Here I believe the Government must take its full responsibility and carry out its duty to see that these people are properly and adequately cared for in their time of need. The War Pensions Act of 1967 does make provision for various benefits are based on outdated legislation and persons who are serving in the Citizen Force and to our national servicemen, but these benefits are based on out-dated legislation and certainly the benefits are in present-day circumstances hopelessly inadequate. If we look at the position of the increasing numbers of men who are serving on our borders, and we bear in mind the increased claims that will be made by the dependants of these people and by the servicemen themselves, particularly those who suffer severe disabilities, we realize that it is indeed a question of top priority to see that these people are more adequately cared for. Immediate attention should be given to this matter to see that that responsibility of the State is fully carried out and fully met. We know that in terms of the existing legislation of 1967 there are persons receiving pensions at the present time, and it is interesting to note that of these people those who are receiving war disablement pensions number 14 450. As far as widows&#x2019; benefits are concerned there are 4 002 recipients, and dependants&#x2019; benefits are paid to 801 recipients. This makes a total of nearly 20 000 people who are receiving benefits. Amongst these are also Coloured, Indian and Bantu people who are still paid their benefits according to the outdated ratio basis of 4:2:1, which we believe this country should move away from as soon as possible. The question of dispensing with the whole basis of the system whereby the benefits are awarded should receive the urgent attention of the Government. I hope that when the hon. the Minister of Finance introduces his budget next month he will be able to give this House some indication as to whether the Government is to fulfil the responsibility that they have to see that these people are more adequately cared for.</p>

<p>As far as the question of priorities is concerned, obviously the defence of our country is a top priority and we are all anticipating considerably increased expenditure in regard to defence. This is perhaps the one department where the hon. the Minister will not be able to cut back expenditure in any way at all.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, we on this side of the House believe that there are other aspects where the hon. the Minister of Finance would find it extremely difficult to try to cut back. Here I particularly have in mind the responsibility towards those people who served in the Civil Service in the past, particularly those who retired prior to the consolidation of the various funds on 1 July 1973, when considerably improved benefits were awarded to those who were still in the employ of the State. People who have gone on pension since that date have received pensions and gratuities far in excess of those older civil servants who retired prior to that date and are still subject to the conditions that were applicable at the time of their retirement. We must remember that these people, Civil Service pensioners, and also Railway pensioners who retired prior to the improvement in the Railway pension, are specifically precluded from claiming any social pension whatsoever from the State. Consequently, it is for the Government to ensure that these people receive a better pension. Their pension should be improved in <span class="col_1349-1350" refersTo="page_0691"/>order for the Government to meet its responsibilities as far as this group is concerned.</p>

<p>If we look at the situation in which these people find themselves, we find that at present there are almost 50 000 Civil Service pensioners, including 14 000 widows. We know that they have received some increases in the past, e.g. in 1974 an increase of 10%, and a further increase in 1973, when the funds were consolidated and the allowances were consolidated. In the 1975 budget, however, the hon. the Minister of Finance unfortunately did not see his way clear to grant any relief whatsoever to these 50 000 people who served the State in the past, many of them for periods of 30 to 40 years. These are the people who built up the various pension funds. Indeed, if one looks at the latest available figures of the Government Service Pension Fund, one finds that it amounts to R1 500 million. That is the amount standing to the credit of that fund. This fund has been increasing at a rate of about R1 000 million a year from 1972 to 1973, and again from 1973 to 1974. These people can only look to the Government for alleviation and for assistance.</p>

<p>For several days we have heard in this House the discussion on inflation, and indeed, if one looks at the whole problem of inflation, one can immediately see that the group that is hardest hit by inflation, is the poorer group, the lower-income group, as well as those people who are living on fixed incomes and those who are living on small pensions. These people have to bear the brunt, the burden of increases in the cost of living and as a result already had to reduce their standard of living in many instances. They are subject to increases in rentals, in rates&#x2014;those who still own their own property&#x2014;increases in maintenance costs, increases in the cost of food&#x2014;all necessities of life. These people are unable to increase their income to any extent by virtue of the fact that they are fully dependent on the Government for their pension.</p>

<p>I believe that this group of people, who were overlooked in 1975&#x2014;the older Civil Service pensioners&#x2014;should receive some form of priority from the hon. the Minister of Finance when this matter comes up for his consideration. I do not wish to bore the House with the various details of the improved benefits that came about. We on this side of the House supported those improved benefits and the consolidation of the fund. We hoped, however, that the Government would come forward with some formula for some form of greater assistance to those people who helped to build up the fund in the past and who are receiving very little compensation for rises in the cost of living. Speaking about the question of inflation, we must also bear in mind that this group of people are indeed helpless and unable to assist in the campaign against inflation. It is a campaign the responsibility for which has to be shared by the State, by commerce, by industry and by the public. Unfortunately, this section of the public is unable to do anything to assist in the campaign against inflation by virtue of the fact that their savings are dwindling and that their income is inadequate. They have landed up in the vicious circle of having to use their savings in order to supplement their income. These people require the urgent attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>The position of the many hundreds of thousands of social pensioners is another aspect which must receive priority from the hon. the Minister of Finance. We know that in the past the Government has seen its way clear to grant increases from time to time. Of course, it is its responsibility to see that these people are able to survive. In helping them to survive, the Government should subsidize the various welfare organizations, without whose help many of them would not be able to survive merely on their social pension. I do hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance when he does grant relief to these people, will do so from an effective date&#x2014;perhaps April 1 or May 1&#x2014;and that he will not ask these people to wait until October 1 before they are to receive any relief. In these days of computerization it is certainly possible for these people to be granted relief at an earlier stage, instead of their having to wait for a period of some six months before receiving relief.</p>

<p>Another aspect to which the hon. the Minister of Finance should give consideration, is the question of the means test that is applicable to those people who qualify for a social pension. I mention this point particularly because here again the matter was overlooked in 1975. There was no relaxation as far as the means test was concerned. Indeed, the present basis for calculating pensions with a free income of R42 per month and free assets of R9 800 as far as the Whites are concerned, <span class="col_1351-1352" refersTo="page_0692"/>has remained static since 1 October 1972. There has been no change in the means test limit since October 1972. Surely, with inflation and with the reduction in the purchasing power of money, these people have to carry a heavy burden, including the burden of losing on their savings. Many of them did make provision for their old age, but find themselves now completely overwhelmed by the rising costs. These people, too, should receive consideration. There should be a relaxation of the means test in order to assist them.</p>

<p>Similarly those people who have paid into private pension funds&#x2014;and I know it is the policy of the Government to encourage private pension funds. We have no objection to that. We too wish to see private pension funds encouraged. We know that the hon. the Minister of Finance makes concessions from time to time in this regard. However, the fact is that many of those who do belong to private pension funds and who paid into their funds a long time ago, receive a social pension, but now suddenly find that an increase of their pension being paid by the private fund to which they had contributed over a long period, results in the husband and wife losing their social pension. This means that they are in fact far worse off than before. In many cases where funds have felt inclined to assist the older pensioners by granting them an increase, they had to find subsequently that the pensioner was in actual fact R20 per month worse off than he had been previously, as a result of losing his social pension that he had enjoyed before. This is a matter, I believe, which deserves the urgent attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance as a priority in assisting these people.</p>

<p>The question of an increase in productivity is indeed a vital factor in any economy, and I believe that there is a vast number of people who have reached retiring age, but who could still be productively employed in the economy. However, they are loth to do so because of the taxation situation, because by working they attract a higher rate of tax. They are therefore discouraged from working. Others, of course, would be disqualified in terms of the means test, which has specific low levels for what a person can earn over and above a certain income. In the case of a single person it is R42 per month. If he earns anything over R42 per month, his pension is subject to reduction. In the case of a married couple it is R84 per month. If a husband obtains another job and earns more than R84 per month, his pension is reduced, both his own and that of his wife.</p>

<p>There is a vast number of people who could assist as far as this country is concerned. Indeed, it is estimated that 45 000 people are retiring every year from the economy, people who still could make a considerable contribution towards the economy. Many of them are qualified, and experienced in their particular occupation. They can remain active, many of them for another five years, and in some cases even longer. I believe that these people could make a real contribution in a national emergency that could arise. If one looks at a situation of emergency, one could rely on these people to come forward and fill the posts of younger people who have been called up for defence duties. Under such circumstances these people could be fully utilized to assist. However, they must be given some encouragement to do so. One way is by means of taxation and the other by the relaxation of the means test for those people who are still keen and anxious to play a productive part in the economy of South Africa.</p>

<p>I had a case not very long ago of a man who was employed by the State. He is 81 years of age. However, he must continue to work because of income tax difficulties. Here then is a man who is still considered competent and efficient enough to be employed in a Government department at his time of life. This does prove that there are people who are prepared to come forward and play an active part and remain productive in the economy. Similarly, we have those people, a large group, who do not qualify for any form of social pension. Some do not receive a pension from a past employer but are living on fixed incomes. They carried out the Government&#x2019;s advice and saved for their old age. They have now reached the stage where they are unable to continue in employment or find that they must retire.</p>

<p>However, having retired on what they believed to be an adequate income, they now find, as the result of the ravages of inflation, that they have to find some means of supplementing the inadequate income that they are receiving, whether it be in the form of interest or dividends from some or other investment. These are the people living on fixed incomes, the older people, people who <span class="col_1353-1354" refersTo="page_0693"/>have made the necessary provision. Last year the hon. the Minister did increase the abatement for the over-60-year-old taxpayer from R400 to R600. This means that a married person with an income of R1 800 per annum need not pay income tax and that an unmarried person with an income of R1 300 per annum need not pay income tax either. In the present circumstances, however, these people should be encouraged, where possible, to play a productive role in our economy. This is another field that could receive the attention of the hon. the Minister when he prepares his budget. He should see that a greater tax concession is granted to these people who are having to live on fixed incomes. Many of them have to invest their money in very high-yielding forms of investment, for example participation bonds, to try to maintain a decent standard of living, and such interest as is received from those participation bonds is of course fully taxable. The sliding scale on which the hon. the Minister bases the taxation for the over-60-year-olds, a system whereby the abatement is decreased by R2 for every R10 over R5 000 income per annum, has also remained static for some time.</p>

<p>In view of the present financial position I wonder whether the hon. the Minister should not also give consideration to this abatement starting at a higher figure in preference to the R5 000 so as to assist many of these people who, as I say, have played a major role in developing this country. It is indeed a great pity to see so many of these people, the senior citizens of our country, having to suffer severe financial hardships in many cases as the result of the ravages of inflation. They feel so helpless in trying to meet this difficult situation created by a high cost of living and inflation. Many of them feel they simply have no alternative but to lower their standard of living. This is a matter to which the hon. the Minister of Finance should give priority so as to ensure that the economy of South Africa take care also of the pioneers of South Africa who have made such a great contribution in the past.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was a pleasure for me to listen to the hon. member for Umbilo. When he has a case to state, he states it positively, and if he has criticism to level, he still remains positive and pleads his case. I cannot say the same for many of the members on that side of the House. In general, they tend to be negative and they act negatively, too.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. the Minister of Finance disposed of, <i>inter alia,</i> three hon. members of the Opposition in a short, sharp and effective way. I should just like to refer to one of the three, the hon. member for Johannesburg North. As a matter of fact, the hon. the Minister had not intended to reply or react to him because the nonsense he spoke was not worth reacting to. However, I feel that I have something which I want to say to this hon. member for Johannesburg North. This hon. member was not even able to solve the problems of his country of origin, and now he comes here to us, to South Africa, a multinational and problematical country in comparison with his country of origin, and he wants to come and solve our problems for us. I want to say, with all respect, that although many of these people come to this country and want to solve the problems of this country, that is not the point. They are only too grateful that there is a Government here which acts responsibly so that they can skim off the cream. That is the point. Often the Opposition refers, <i>inter alia,</i> to a crash programme, and then reference is made to the training of our manpower. But it is the Opposition that is crashing; after all, we know that they have been crashing for years now. The other one, the Progref Party, together with their policy, will crash much sooner than they think.</p>

<p>We are accused of restricting the economy of the country by means of &#x201C;chains of ideological measures&#x201D;. The hon. member for Maitland is very fond of this crash programme story and of the &#x201C;chains of ideological measures&#x201D;. However, the National Party policy is a long-term policy which has yielded dividends through the years, whereas we only have to look at the number of times that that party has changed its policies since 1948. But not only that. Only the other day the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked that we should recognize the three trade union levels among Black people as well. Now it is not even three levels any longer; now it is simply open to everybody. The National Party is not, nor ever has been opposed to the training of our labour force.</p>

<p>Yes, I shall prove it. The National Party has never been opposed to the change that must occur from time to time in the traditional labour pattern in South Africa. We must bear these two things in mind very clearly this afternoon, and consequently I shall repeat what I said: The National Party has never been opposed to training, nor has the National Party ever been opposed to change in the traditional labour pattern. However, there is a condition attached to these adjustments which are made from time to time, viz. that it be done on a basis of exemption, and when we say that it is done on a basis of exemption, then this raises a host of matters. It must occur in an orderly way. However, that side of the House wants to do everything in a rush; unsystematically and head over heels they fall into things.</p>

<p>Yes, &#x201C;crash programmes&#x201D; and everything that involves, the National Party, on the other hand, is the realistic party, the party which approaches matters in a realistic way. It is the party which seeks to utilize and adapt our labour in an orderly way in this country, as circumstances demand. At the same time the National Party is the evolutionary party. However, when we look at that side of the House, over there where my friend is laughing now, we are looking at an unrealistic party, an opportunistic party, a party which wants to do things in a revolutionary fashion. We know what the result of a revolutionary approach is. There is one thing they fail to bear in mind, namely that we are living here in a multinational country with a multi-national set-up and a multi-national labour pattern. They are very concerned with inflation and the economy of the country, but I wonder what would have happened if this responsible National Party Government had not been in power to adapt matters carefully and systematically as they have in fact done. We on this side of the House think about the future of the country and the future of our descendants. It seems to me that that hon. member has forgotten about 1922. It seems to me that he has also forgotten what the result is when one simply opens the floodgates as one desires, without the necessary planning. The National Party still has certain principles on which it bases its policy, because it is a responsible Government.</p>

<p>Let me point out the principles followed by this party as regards industrial development in our country. Through the years this party has proved that it strives to provide for everyone, to make it possible for everyone to earn a living. It is this party which, to the benefit of everyone, has consistently encouraged the establishment of industries, irrespective of whether this has affected Whites, Coloureds, Indians or Bantu. After all, we know what the standpoint of the hon. Opposition was when Iscor was established. Surely we know what their standpoint was the other day when Sasol was established. Now they are terribly concerned about people who supposedly lack employment opportunities, whereas the National Party Government has ensured that there are employment opportunities for everyone in South Africa.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no unemployment. Has the hon. member looked at the unemployment figures of all the other countries in the world? At the moment the percentage of unemployed in this country is 0,5%. To tell the truth, we have over-employment. There is work for every man, be he White, Coloured, Indian or Bantu; in South Africa there is employment for everyone who wants to work. We have a <span class="col_1357-1358" refersTo="page_0695"/>shortage of farm labourers and also of mine-workers.</p>

<p>My time is too limited. We have a shortage of mine-workers. In fact, there is a shortage in various fields.</p>

<p>The second principle on which the labour policy of this party is based is not merely the creation of employment opportunities for people but also ensuring a liveable wage. Evidence of this, too, is available. It is a pity that owing to a lack of time I am unable to present this evidence. However, if the hon. Opposition wants to contest this, I shall give them the figures with the greatest pleasure when we deal with the Labour Vote. The third principle on which the policy of the National Party is based is that everything be done to bring about optimum utilization of the available labour, <i>inter alia</i> by means of training. I want to refer the hon. member for Maitland who is so boisterously kicking up a racket there, to a memorandum by the Department of Bantu Education in which all the schemes for the training of Bantu are set out, I think that when they refer to crash programmes they are referring more especially to the Bantu.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>If there is still time the hon. member can ask shortly: I shall reply to him then. The fourth principle on which the industrial policy of the National Party is based, is that there must be labour peace and industrial peace. The hon. Opposition is now enjoying the fruits of the measures taken by this Government to bring about the industrial peace and labour peace which have prevailed in South Africa over the years. Nor is the Government interested only in effecting industrial peace and development, it also believes that there must be security for its people. Our labour corps must have a feeling of security. If they should fear they might soon be supplanted or kicked out unreasonably, then one would have a dissatisfied labour corps, and when that is the case, problems occur. It is under this policy, too, that the degree of productivity we have in South Africa can be maintained. The fact that we are still able to increase our productivity is ascribable to this policy. The fifth factor as regards the labour and industrial policy of the Government is that in times of unemployment and illness it stands by the people. These measures, too, have been adapted from time to time the better to provide for the labour force of our country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland still owes me a number of answers from 1973 when we discussed job reservation. After all, the hon. Opposition wants to abolish job reservation because they say that it covers only 2,8% or 2,9%.</p>

<p>Surely that is not the point. Surely that is not true, either. What is important is that this side of the House, the Government of the country, is concerned that people should not be ousted from their jobs. That is the point. It is a question of controlled employment and controlled labour. That is where our industrial peace and our labour peace come from. The hon. member still has to tell us what they want to do. They want to abolish job reservation entirely, and now I want to know what they will do with the Public Service, for example. What are they going to do when they have to implement the full consequences of their policy?</p>

<p>Of course it applies on the Railways. That is exactly what I have just tried to explain to the hon. member, because as a shortage of Whites develops, the non-Whites are shifted up into higher posts whereas the Whites are shifted still higher. That is labour control, and of course it applies on the Railways as well. Initially I said that it was the policy of the National Party that the labour issue be regulated on a basis of exemption. I do not know whether the hon. member knows what this means. It does not mean that one simply <span class="col_1359-1360" refersTo="page_0696"/>throws open the market, but it does mean that this is done on a basis of exemption. It means that until such time&#x2014;we do not expect that there never will be a change&#x2014;that those posts are filled by other people, they will be filled by Whites. That is what is meant by that, and consequently the Railways, too, falls under job reservation. I hope that that answers the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Hercules has devoted the greater part of his speech to the policy of his Government towards labour in South Africa. I must say that some of the principles which he outlined came as a great surprise, particularly when one hears that it is a principle of the Nationalist Government to make the best possible use of all available manpower in South Africa. The history of this Government is that they have failed to do just that. But if it does mean that there is yet again another change in their developing policy, then we in these benches will welcome it very much indeed.</p>

<p>I shall in a moment or two refer to the reply of the hon. the Minister of Finance to the Second Reading debate yesterday, but before doing that I should like to refer to a few comments which were made earlier this afternoon by the hon. member for Durban Point. He referred to and gave us a gratuitous advertisement for the newspaper called <i>Progress.</i> If he and others would like to be put on our circulation lists, we shall make quite sure that it is done, because we should like to educate as many people as possible. However, one of the things that he did try to do was to misrepresent the position of members in these benches. He did this by referring first of all to the article in <i>Progress</i> where we make two points: (a) our solidarity with our troops on the borders of our country, and (b) our opposition to Russian imperialism in southern Africa. [Interjections.] He then went on to say that we did not do this in this House. Of course, he is quite wrong&#x2014;as usual&#x2014;because if one looks at the volume of Hansard which gives the debate on the no-confidence debate, one reads that the leader of this party said on our behalf (Hansard, 26 January 1976, col. 97)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On behalf of us on these benches I would like to pay tribute to young South Africans &#x2026; As those in times gone by, so these young South Africans, too, are a credit to South Africa &#x2026; We would like to express our sincerest sympathy to the parents and families of those who have lost their lives.</block>

<p>I should like the hon. member for Durban Point or, indeed, the hon. Leader of the Opposition himself, to give us one specific example from the history of the Westminster system of Parliament where, in reply to a vote of no confidence, the mover of that motion voted for the amendment moved by the Government in which he had no confidence. It is this kind of really stupid approach &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; which demonstrates why there is need for a new official Opposition, which is well on the way.</p>

<p>To return now to the reply by the hon. the Minister of Finance to the Second Reading debate yesterday, I want to say that we were disappointed with his generalized statements and his vague references. Although the hon. member for Yeoville made specific and concrete suggestions, the only response to that was: &#x201C;I will bear them in mind.&#x201D; One would have liked to see some concrete response, some indication as to whether they made sense or whether they were going to be taken over. However, the response was very vague and general.</p>

<p>I suppose the hon. the Minister of Finance will go down in history as the only Finance <span class="col_1361-1362" refersTo="page_0697"/>Minister in the world who regards devaluation as &#x201C;a sign of strength&#x201D;. If we adopt that attitude and say to our creditors that we will pay them 50 cents in the rand, I wonder how many of them would regard that as a sign of strength instead of a sign of weakness. The harsh facts of the matter are that both inflation and devaluation are nothing more than a redistribution of wealth&#x2014;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. As an example of this I quote from the latest issue of the Financial Mail where I read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1970 the average White household had R362 more to spend each month than the average African household. Last year, however, that gap had widened to R546. Last year the average White household received an income 1,9 times as large as the average Asian, 2,9 times as large as the average Coloured and 8,5 times as large as the average African household.</block>

<p>This means that although there have been very significant increases in Black wages&#x2014;we are appreciative of that&#x2014;the gulf between the income of Whites on the one hand and African, Coloured and Indian on the other hand is growing wider and wider.</p>

<p>I should also like to put the record straight as regards the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comments regarding my colleague the hon. member for Johannesburg North. The hon. the Minister of Finance accused that hon. member of saying that South Africa has now become a banana republic. The hon. the Minister himself quite rightly does not like to be misquoted or misrepresented. Again and again, indeed very recently, he said: &#x201C;How on earth can anybody who has access to Hansard make statements which are simply not there!&#x201D; Yet, this is exactly what he has done here. Here is the Hansard of the hon. member for Johannesburg North and I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he actually referred to Hansard or relied on his memory. It is very clear from his Hansard that the hon. member for Johannesburg North said that because of the actions of the hon. the Minister of Finance and his Government that the country could become a banana republic. He then went on to say: &#x201C;Of course it is not true at this time.&#x2019;&#x2019; Here it is.</p>

<p>The Minister also went on to make a quite remarkably intemperate attack on the leader of this party. I have his unrevised Hansard in front of me now also. For someone who accuses many other people of being intemperate, it is quite remarkable that a Minister of Finance, a senior Minister of the Cabinet, should dare to say the kind of thing he has said in this House. There will come a time when we will have to return to the words he used. Suffice it to say now that so long as that is the kind of reaction from a senior member of the Cabinet, so long will we go on trying to put as clearly as possible the facts and the true situation of South Africa. The fact of the matter is that we in these benches have called consistently since the very beginning of this session for a new patriotism, a new whole South African patriotism, as against a very stunted one-sided patriotism. A very long time ago a man called Stephen Decatur gave a toast at a dinner party in these words: &#x201C;Our country! In her intercourse with foreign nations, may she always be right; but our country, right or wrong.&#x201D; A hundred years later another American, speaking in Chicago and referring to that toast, used the following words: &#x201C;Our country, right or wrong; when right to be kept right, when wrong to be put right.&#x201D; Sir, I put it to the hon. the Minister: Which attitude, the first or the second, illustrates a greater patriotism or a greater love of country; the first, which blindly supports any course of action taken by the State, or the second, which dares to look critically at the direction in which the country is going and expresses criticism without fear? We in these benches believe that this is the kind of new <span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_0698"/>patriotism which is long overdue in South Africa. [Interjections.] We call on this Government to think again as to the direction in which it is taking our country at this time, for the tragedy is that with the deteriorating situation on our borders, there are many&#x2014;and I choose my words&#x2014;Black and Brown South Africans who do not find it in themselves to bind themselves to a common purpose and loyalty because they believe that the policies of this Government are divisive and discriminatory.

<p>I will never be able to speak for you because you have nothing to say. In 1910 Union, indeed a paper Union, was established in South Africa, but at least a common objective was stated, and the objective at that time was enshrined in a motto in this country which has since gone by the board since 1948, and that motto was &#x201C;Unity is strength&#x201D;. Again and again this was the appeal, and while it is true that that unity represented more a union between White and White, nevertheless there was need for a Union as one ushered in the birth of a new nation. In 1961, when we left the British Commonwealth and became a Republic, I believe that that action did a great service for this country in helping to unite the English- and Afrikaans-speaking people.</p>

But I believe that this country needs now a new Republic, which speaks no longer merely of uniting English and Afrikaans White people in South Africa, but a new Republic, a new situation, which impels and calls for a common commitment and a common loyalty because we are in a common predicament, facing a common destiny. And, Sir, we will sink or we will swim together. It is therefore imperative that this Government begins now to declare a new opportunity and a new way forward. [Interjections.] If only this Government would acknowledge the need for a new loyalty and a new patriotism which involves all 25 million South Africans! But the tragedy of this Government is that it has deliberately divided the country by saying to the majority of people, to Black and Brown: &#x201C;You are not South Africans.&#x201D; As a direct result of that, we who should be standing really and truly united are totally divided at this time.</p>

<p>We saw many evidences of this. Many of us have seen it at sports matches when visiting teams used to come to South Africa in the good old days, and when we were faced with that situation we were appalled by the fact that the Black people who watched the match always supported the foreign team and never the South Africans. Why? Because that Government had decided that they were not South Africans, so why should they support South Africa? And in a much more tragic way, one sees one of the direct results of our intervention in Angola, because this highlights the fact that there are many people in South Africa, alas, who cannot find it in themselves to bind themselves to this common loyalty and this common purpose. Sir, we can quote times without number many leading Black people in the State, like Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, who stands up and says it is a great pity when we are looking for unity in South Africa that we cannot find it because of the policies of this Government. Again and again this fact is proved, and I say that we need a new patriotism in South Africa, and we need it desperately.</p>

<p>Sir, a further illustration comes not from Progress, but from the Snyman Report, which has been quoted in this House already and no doubt will be quoted many times still. I hope it will be, and I want to agree with the hon. member for Green Point that I think it is absolutely right that everyone of us should be given one of these copies and that it should be required reading, because this is a sobering journal. The hon. member for Green Point cannot resist at any time referring to me, but unfortunately I am not really interested in quoting anything about him. What I want to do is to look at the words we find again and again in this report. Here are the words written by <span class="col_1365-1366" refersTo="page_0699"/>the judge himself, who was appointed by the State President&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was soon clear to the commission that their (the students&#x2019;) hatred of Whites, their rejection of separate development, their rejection of the university, their refusal to co-operate with the university authorities, their incivility to those who were well disposed to them, their refusal to accept anything offered to them, their acceptance of Saso&#x2019;s destructive policy&#x2014;all those things actually spring from a sense of impotence and frustration which has built up in them in the face of the Whites&#x2019; position of power over them and their powerlessness to fight it and to obtain what they believe to be their due.</block>

<p>This is not a remark made by anyone in these benches, or even by anybody in the Opposition. This is something which comes straight from Judge Snyman&#x2019;s report. Sir, what I find very interesting&#x2014;and I did not know about this until the last few days&#x2014;is that in November, 1972, another report of an inquiry into student unrest at the University of the North was published. That was published several years ago. It was a commission of five members, under the chairmanship of C. W. Wright. Two of the members were Africans, and one is now Chief Minister of Gazankulu. The facts which emerge from this report are very interesting. Paragraph 17(1)(a) says: &#x201C;Students are conscious of the fact that they are debarred from attending other universities, and particularly other White universities.&#x201D; Paragraph (b) states: &#x201C;The fact that students have to attend ethnic universities causes further strictures and academic problems.&#x201D; Paragraph (d) states: &#x201C;The Blacks resent paternalistic treatment.&#x201D; Paragraph 19 is most important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fundamental cause of student unrest is of a political nature.</block>

<p>That is the heart of the matter&#x2014;it is of a &#x201C;political nature&#x201D;. It stems from the society in which we live and not merely from the university. They bring with them to the university their frustrations which have been building up over the years. This Government was warned five years ago by that commission&#x2019;s report. [Interjections.] I am sorry, but I have not time to answer any questions. The fact of the matter is that this Government was warned several years ago by that commission&#x2019;s report. What has resulted? They did precisely nothing! The policies of this Government are indicted by the Snyman Report. It is apartheid that is on trial in this report, and nothing else. It is rejected again and again and the appeal is made in one recommendation after the other: &#x201C;The word is out; change your policy now.&#x201D; Snyman makes the point very clearly and very strongly that those people who are already there are full of frustration and hostility and, to use his exact words, &#x201C;the hatred for Whites&#x201D;. These people will be going out to teach in schools, they will be going out to conduct affairs throughout South Africa, and they will be taking with them this kind of frustration&#x2014;unless the situation is so changed and altered that there will be a new chance and a new opportunity for them.</p>

<p>I said earlier that what this country needed desperately and urgently was a new patriotism, a patriotism which transcends the 1910 Union and even the 1961 Republic. What is very clear is that a house divided simply cannot stand.</p>

When that happens there is no room for the papering of the cracks, no putting up of wallpaper to hide the very real divisions existing in our society. Then the time comes for the building of a new house, a new Republic, I say, and a new patriotism which can bind together all the people of this country. A house big enough, wide enough and free enough for all the peoples in this country. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>That is why we call for a constitutional conference now. There is no other way. We have made many, many suggestions from these benches also during this session. We have suggested a number of ways in which to move away from discrimination, a number of ways to bind the broken heart of the society, but these, of course, are always thrown back at us, because they cannot happen and are not <span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_0700"/>according to policy. The Government is perfect and popular, and so is the hon. the Prime Minister himself!</p>

<p>I would like to conclude with a single suggestion and recommendation. Just as we have had to do it in South West Africa and just as it is being done in Rhodesia, let us too, while we can still speak from strength, call a constitutional conference immediately, where all the peoples of this land, all their representatives can come together to find a way through. [Interjections.] No matter how you bluster and no matter how many interjections you make, and no matter how much you laugh, you all know as well as I do that we are in trouble. The only way to get out of this trouble is to do it together as one united South Africa. That is our deepest need today.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I undertook to do yesterday afternoon I am rising to furnish further particulars and not to react to questions or to discussions. I said yesterday that I should like to refer in detail to the valuations made by the two appointed valuators of the two properties concerned. I have here a copy of the valuation of the property of Prof. Schoeman&#x2019;s company. It is a valuation which was drawn up in the minutest particulars, in the minutest detail of the components of each property. I am not going to quote all of it to you, for it is far too long for the available time. However, I want to give hon. members an insight into the way in which the valuators set about their task. As an example we can consider the residence. I am going to read their entire description of the residence. They mention: 23 cm concrete walls, semi-pitched roof of corrugated iron, 2 rooms with ceiling the remainder without ceiling covering an area of &#x2026; a corrugated iron storeroom with cement floors, covering an area of &#x2026; a room of asbestos construction on the verandah with a corrugated iron roof and covering an area of &#x2026; concrete formations of a certain length, and so on. After they had made their calculations they arrived at a grand total of what they would pay for the house. As I said yesterday, I am not furnishing the tariffs at which they calculated the areas and the lengths.</p>

<p>The hon. member ought to know it and could understand it if he wanted to, but he is unwilling to do so. That is the point. The valuators then proceed to deal with the outside rooms in the same way &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#page">

<p>Why get so excited so early?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member cannot contain himself, he must do something to himself. The valuators then proceed in the same way to describe and give the dimensions of the outside rooms and the outside toilets. They adopt the same procedure even with two small corrugated iron buildings, and subsequently they adopt the same procedure with the land, which is the major item. In regard to the land they say that they have gone into the origins and history of the land. They go on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The planning of this property as a township with its parks, streets and caravan park and plots had been in progress since 1970 and had been finalized when it became known that the Port St. Johns area was to be incorporated in the Transkei. Proof of all the costs incurred in this regard was shown to us.</block>

<p>They had the proof in front of them. They then proceed to describe other things, and I need not quote this now. They also described how the land consists of various parts. They say that there are 43 plots which had already been sold to individual buyers in 1971 at an average price of R4 000 per plot. These are the plots which they called the &#x201C;concealed&#x201D; plots and which individuals had purchased from the various companies by means of deeds of sale. They took the prices, as ascertained by them in 1971, as a basis for the calculation of a price at which the plots could be valued in 1975. On that basis they arrived at the valuations of the number of plots, and in the same way they valued the other piece of land which was still in the process of being surveyed and which <span class="col_1369-1370" refersTo="page_0701"/>was large enough for 60 plots. The latter calculation they based on the same valuation which they had adjusted to the 1971 price, and arrived at their figures for it. Over and above that there are still of course the caravan park, the streets, the parks and the lagoon situated there. All these things they took into consideration in the minutest detail and on that basis they determined a total valuation. As I said yesterday, it was subsequently checked by other people from our department, by the Deputy Minister and by our departmental officials, as well as by another controller of whose services we avail ourselves in Pretoria for all the Transkeian properties. Therefore, it was checked and double-checked, and within that total valuation the negotiations were conducted and the agreement entered into with the Schoeman company on the purchase price which was paid to it. The amount was R800 000.</p>

<p>Next I want to deal with the case of the Henning company. Here the, same two valuators went to work in the same way with this major difference that in the case of the Henning properties there were far more properties involved and consequently there is a much longer and more detailed inventory, approximately 8 pages of particulars. I want to describe the shop to hon. members as an example. There is a shop of which they give a description, e.g. how thick the walls are, how many rooms there are, what the area of the verandah is up to the telephone booth, the cellar, amenities, the counter with a yellow-wood top, etc. They describe no fewer than 16 shelves, each of which was properly measured down to the minutest detail. I am certain the hon. member for Griqualand East would not have taken as much trouble as these people did. He would have said: &#x201C;All those shelves, I estimate them at so much.&#x201D; However, these people measured each one. They continue in this way to describe the residence as well They give its area and a classification of its various components, verandah, open verandah, equipment office, shelters for motor vehicles, the rain-water tank, the other shelters and so on. They then itemize the other buildings, such as the offices, the ironing room and showers, the bathroom, the toilets, the round wash hand basins, the bird cages, the sports facilities, which they subdivide into the various amenities, for example the tennis courts, the trampolines, the jukskei pitches, the concrete blocks which serve as seats for spectators, etc.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member had better keep quiet, for I am not in the least interested in his nonsensical remarks. They then proceed with the valuation of the rondavel cottages. They do not simply say that there are so many rondavels; they classify them into categories as well, for these rondavel cottages are not all identical. They mention all the different types. They deal with seven rondavels in one group, furnish a full description and then give their valuations on the basis of the particulars. They even counted the number of baths and mirrors in each room. There are altogether 17 rondavels in the various categories. Another group of houses consists of the wooden chalets, 14 of them, and in this case they also furnish full particulars. Another group consists of the holiday homes, of which there are ten. The women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s ablutions are not all identical either and are divided up into three different groups. They furnish all the particulars&#x2014;how many toilets, showers and mirrors there are&#x2014;and on that basis they make their calculations and furnish the tariff&#x2014;as I wish to call it&#x2014;at which they calculate the value of these articles, with the totals appended. They also furnish the particulars of the boiler room, the linen room, the roads and bridges &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The ratios and tariffs of all these things were examined by people who <span class="col_1371-1372" refersTo="page_0702"/>know ten times more about these things, and who are ten times more reliable than that hon. member. In this way they went into the particulars of each of the improvements made to the properties. As in the previous case they concluded the report, as in the previous case, with the land, and this, too, they classified into various categories of land, inter alia, the land which had been planned and surveyed, with holiday cottages on it, those with shop sites and business rights, the large site which is intended for the luxury hotel and the luxury flats with the parks included, and they furnished their calculations for these as well. They dealt next with the holiday resort area with its holiday cottages, etc. In that case, too, there is in addition the water, roads, etc. In this way they arrived at a total amount which was checked and double-checked by the people in Pretoria, just as in the previous case, and within that total valuation which they made, negotiations were entered into with the owner, a final agreement was reached, and the amount paid out as hon. members know. Therefore I need not repeat this.</p>

<p>Certain general special conditions were attached to these transactions. I am not going to enumerate all these conditions. Many of them are ordinary routine conditions. But I do want to point out to hon. members single condition which is of importance. The first very important condition which applies to everyone&#x2014;and which will also apply to everyone in future&#x2014;is that payment only takes place after transfer of the property into the name of the new purchaser, i.e. the Trust, has been registered.</p>

<p>I would rather be a teacher than an empty pumpkin. [Interjections.] I can also see that there are members on the opposite side of the House who still require the services of a teacher. In both cases certain fixed amounts were held back to ensure proper take-over of the assets which we took over from them. In both cases we said that the transfer could only take place after the released area had been declared and after the zoning had been done, because we concluded the purchase agreement before the zoning and before it had been declared a released area, although we did so after Parliament had decided. That is the point I dealt with yesterday. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Umhlatuzana and the hon. member for Griqualand East ought to know that as a rule the Trust does not purchase areas which have not yet been declared released, and have not yet been zoned, and in exactly the same way these cannot be transferred to the Bantu before the areas have been released and zoned, unless we have the approval of the State President to do so. It was on account of those formalities that that claim was instituted.</p>

<p>There was another provision, about which a considerable fuss has been kicked up, i.e. the lease in the case of Henning. At the sale he was told that we wanted him to lease the property. Please take careful note now&#x2014;a lot of blatant lies have been told in public and outside this House about the lease. There is no possibility, and there never was any possibility of that property being leased for five years. I do not know how people sucked that out of their thumbs. It is explicitly typed in the agreement that it is leased to Henning as long as we want to lease to him. Why are we leasing it to him? We are doing this because there are a large number of properties&#x2014;as hon. members have seen. If he vacates them immediately, all the movable property there has to be looked after. We have applied the principle of leasing even in the case of farms. We ask the person selling the farm to us, the person who has sold the property to us, to lease it from us in order to help us over the interim period until we can take over properly. We have already contacted the XDC and told them that they should prepare themselves to take over that property as a running concern. In other words, we leased it to that person to look after it for us, and it is in that light only that the rental of R5 000 should be seen. It was not intended as a business proposition, but as an interim arrangement for him to look after it for us.</p>

<p>How was it calculated?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from><span class="col_1373-1374" refersTo="page_0703"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was calculated on the basis of the person&#x2019;s financial statements, what he would make from it on a temporary basis. I said yesterday &#x2026; Does the hon. member want to hear? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I just want to a make a few more general statements. I elaborated yesterday on the White Paper. I have the White Paper available here, the White Paper which was tabled in Parliament in 1964, and which the procedure for the valuation is laid down. There is no such thing as people looking at purchase prices and add percentages to it. The White Paper lays down very clearly that there shall be an Adjustment Committee and that the following three elements of all properties should be assessed, i.e. the land value, the value of improvements and the goodwill. It is also stated that the Native Trust should purchase the properties, and in addition the White Paper also contains the provision that the Minister has the right to appoint a person or a corporation to manage such places for him, which is what we did in this case. It is stated expressly in the White Paper, too, that the valuations should be made when the property is offered. As hon. members know, this is primarily because there are many people who thought that one could make a valuation today and a purchase in 20 years time. The White Paper states very clearly what the basis is, and that is the basis of the procedure we adopted. We arrived at a valuation of those three things, and having taken those three things into consideration, we then arrived at the price. The value of these things was taken into consideration, and not the cost price. As far as the cost price is concerned, I want to add something to what I said yesterday. Words to this effect appeared in newspapers, and it was even said by certain persons in this House: Look what the people paid for these properties&#x2014;in some cases ten, eleven years ago. Then the cost price only of a bare piece of land ten years ago is deducted from the price we are now paying, and it is said: Look at the profit the man made. But none of these improvements to these properties I have mentioned were taken into consideration. Should those improvements be ignored, and should we consider only the original cost price, and add a percentage to it? The hon. member has just asked me what the percentage and what the ratios are. You can therefore see that his thinking is completely twisted and distorted. They want us to work on that basis, while we are committed to the basis laid down in the White Paper, which determines that the valuation should be made at the stage in which the property is purchased. We must not go back and add percentages to the original cost price. What else should we take into consideration?</p>

<p>Of course there is also the character of the land. If we use the cost price as a basis, it must be borne in mind that the person purchased a bare piece of land. Now one is dealing with a surveyed township which only has to be proclaimed and is in the process of being surveyed. Should this fact, the development not be taken into consideration? Of course we have to take it into consideration&#x2014;the character and the nature of the land. In this case the procedure we adopted was the tried method, the only method laid down for us by the White Paper and which we have been applying all these years up to the present. The hon. members are being extremely unfair to allege that each property purchased should be approached in a different manner. One would then find oneself in a mess, in a chaotic situation, and then the hon. members opposite would of course revel in the chaos for their own political benefit. After all, that is what they think.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by telling you that according to what we have heard there is ostensibly talk of all kinds of irregularities. But I want to tell you that there was absolutely no irregularity in any of these transactions, nor in the case of the Upton land either, which was not even relevant here. There were no irregularities because we followed the stipulated procedures, the procedures as laid down in the White Paper, and as tested by us through experience. The only two deviations which occurred, were the departures from what was set out in a circular which I sent out, and in which it was stated that the people could submit their forms to the magistrate, actually the Bantu Affairs Commissioner, for he is our man in Port St. Johns.</p>

<p>I said yesterday that it was nonsense that it is a &#x201C;must&#x201D;. I say it is rubbish. I want to ask the hon. member why it is a &#x201C;must&#x201D;. What should the magistrate do with the forms? He has to post them to <span class="col_1375-1376" refersTo="page_0704"/>Pretoria, that is what he has to do. To bring this up as a departure, as an irregularity, is childish foolishness, absolutely childish foolishness. The only other departure, not from the White Paper, but from the procedure which I laid down, was that, unlike the ordinary properties, there should not be advertised. Why? As I have said, the purpose of advertising is to see whether Bantu persons want to buy the properties, for if they do this we need not purchase it, for then we have achieved our aim, namely that the property has been transferred to Black hands. In this case, as a result of the nature of the property and the fact that it had been halfway surveyed into a township, and because of the extent of the cost involved, it was in our opinion simply a waste of time to advertise the property, for no Bantu persons would have come forward. This would merely have proved to us that the Trust should purchase the land. Mention was also made of extravagance, and it is true that the land cost a great deal of money, but we received value for it. There was a valuation. I shall not deny that they received a great deal of money, but there was a valuation and we avoided higher costs by the procedure we adopted. It was alleged here that friends were given favourable treatment. But this was not the case, and I have dealt with this aspect in great detail. There was no nepotism. The only preference there was, was that of our own interests, as I indicated yesterday. No one else was prejudiced; in fact, all the other persons who still have properties there, may still offer their properties for sale, and all these transactions will be dealt with in the same way as these properties. They will all, if they can prove a personal urgency on their part, be dealt with under the general arrangement which exists in regard to preference for urgent cases. They must be able to prove it, and the predominant provision is of course that money has to be available. The arguments raised here yesterday by the hon. member for Griqualand West was that there had been laxity from the top. I said yesterday, and I want to repeat it here, that there was no laxity. The former hon. Deputy Minister, at present the Minister for Water Affairs, and my department&#x2019;s officials, the valuators and I, in so far as I was involved, all gave our attention to this matter. It is not the first transaction we have dealt with. In the entire Transkei area we have already since 1964, purchased land to the value of more than R30 million on that basis, I mean on this very basis laid down in the White Paper.</p>

The other people whose land has to be purchased there will also be dealt with on this basis, and no one will be prejudiced. And no one has been prejudiced. I can tell you what kind of thing could be prejudicial. This kind of debate which the Opposition and the newspapers conducted is not to the benefit of sound co-operation between our department and the people who still have to sell their land, for everyone is being placed under suspicion. It is being implied that those people are dealing with super scoundrels of South Africa, while we are not dealing with super scoundrels of South Africa, but with people who know what their duties are and who are discharging them correctly. What we are in fact dealing with is a group of super inciters, that is what we have been dealing with.</p>

<p>I want to express a last word of appreciation to the hon. the Deputy Minister of that time&#x2014;at present the Minister of Water Affairs&#x2014;who had to endure most of this nonsensical hubbub which centred around all kinds of farcical and inane maneouvres such as the question of where he went for two or three days and what he did there. If one takes such things into consideration as where a person slept for two or three days when he went to do certain things, then I am extremely grateful today that I never availed myself, and never shall avail myself, of the offer the hon. member for Griqualand East made to me a year or so ago when he invited me to make use <span class="col_1377-1378" refersTo="page_0705"/>of his beach cottage (strandhuis) at Kei Mouth. I have never availed myself of that offer, and here I am learning my lesson. I am very grateful to myself, for the hon. member for Griqualand East and I &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, yesterday afternoon the hon. the Minister told us at great length&#x2014;he repeated it several times&#x2014;that he was going to deal with the valuations today. He was going to tell us all about valuations. What has he done this afternoon? He has wasted the time of this House. [Interjections.] He has given us no information of any use with regard to valuations. The hon. the Minister speaks about needing teachers and ignorance about different matters. The hon. the Minister showed his ignorance this afternoon, when he read to us the details which he gave on valuations. Does he know anything about how appraisements are made? What sort of appraisement would it be if it did not give all these details? What sort of appraisement would it be if they did not measure shelves? Surely that is a normal thing to do. If the Minister thinks this is an outstanding appraisal, because of these details he has given, I am getting worried about the appraisements on which his department is acting.</p>

<p>When I asked the hon. the Minister for an assurance that the same appraisal, the same basis of valuation, would be used throughout the rest of Port St. Johns, I meant the basis of land valuation and not that of baths and shelves and things like that. This <span class="col_1379-1380" refersTo="page_0706"/>is the valuation of a hotel. When the ordinary residences are being valued at Port St. Johns, we are going to be told that the high valuation given in these two instances was because of goodwill and because of the value of the loose assets. We want to know the basis of the land valuation and of the building valuation. That is what we want to know, and unless the Minister gives this, we are not satisfied with the story he has told us. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. the Minister spoke a lot about my being an attorney, and that I ought to know this and that I ought to know that. It is a pity that we did not have an attorney to handle these transactions. To leave transactions of this nature to an ex-teacher, when one is dealing with two wily speculators, is only harmful to the State. We cannot allow this sort of thing. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister told us what he thought was important in these transactions. What does he say about the agreement of sale? He says that there were certain conditions. Of course there must be conditions of sale. He said he was not going to give us the normal conditions. He said he was going to give the extra-ordinary conditions. He also said the purchase price would only be paid after transfer. [Interjections.] That is a normal condition. He said that transfer would only be passed after the zoning of Port St. Johns.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, then the hon. the Minister went on to say that the transfer would not be passed until the State President had declared this a released area. What he is actually telling us, is that he acted legally. All that he had put in his conditions of sale, was that he had not acted illegally. Have you ever heard such nonsense, Sir?</p>

<p>Yesterday we heard the reply of the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, who was then Deputy Minister of Bantu Development. He spoke about the Press, and about how he had been misquoted. Then he went on to deal with Dimbaza. Dimbaza had nothing to do with this case. All he was trying to do, was to draw a red herring. He spoke about the dealings in the King William&#x2019;s Town district. The accusation which the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and I made was that they had unnecessarily paid out this large sum at Port St. Johns when they withdrew offers made to farmers in King William&#x2019;s Town district. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs did not answer to that allegation. What did he do? He tried to tell us that some of the people who had offered their farms in that area, in Braunschweig, did not have title. He said the families who had occupied the farms for 150 years or more had to go to court to obtain title. That is not the allegation we were making against him. We were dealing with the withdrawal of the offers that they had made. On 10 or 11 September they withdrew offers that they had made.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He did not explain why. [Interjections.] He said it was because they were short of money. They had given the people 60 days time to accept the offer, and they did not know whether the people were going to accept it or not. When the offers were accepted they had to withdraw. Why did they have to pay out this large sum if they were so short of money? If an ordinary business man makes an offer and gives one 60 days time within which to accept the offer, he has no hope of withdrawing that offer. He cannot say that he did not expect the offer to be accepted within 30 days. This is absolute nonsense.</p>

Sir, we have it on record&#x2014;in the interview given by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs to the Press&#x2014;that Schoeman <span class="col_1381-1382" refersTo="page_0707"/>consulted him before he bought. When I questioned the hon. the Minister about it yesterday, he said that Schoeman had already bought one property and that he told him he had taken an option on the other property.

<p>Yes, but the hon. the Minister himself mentioned that Schoeman had options, and that Schoeman exercised the options after he had been warned that he might lose money. Why were Schoeman and Henning not treated in the same way as Upton? We did not complain about what happened to Upton. Upton had a court case against him and the Government only paid out the amount for which Upton was sued. That was all. The balance he has not received yet.

It is not good enough. Preference has been given to these people and the hon. the Minister has not justified such preference. There are other ways of stopping the proclamation.

There was consequently no hope of those townships being proclaimed. Did the hon. the Minister take that into consideration? Did he take into consideration the costs these people would have to meet to supply sewerage and water services? When he paid them out did he take into consideration the expense to which these people would still have been put in order to develop that area as a township? The reasons given by the hon. the Minister in connection with the leases could hold some <span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_0709"/>water. They wanted somebody to look after the property after they had bought it and taken it over, but it was not necessary to lease the property to them at that price, i.e. R5 000.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to discuss Port St. Johns. I shall leave that subject in the able hands of my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. [Interjections.] However, I wish someone would be kind enough to invite me to spend a holiday on the beautiful coast of the Eastern Cape, preference or not.</p>

<p>It is really a privilege to me to be able to refer on the second consecutive day to a particularly competent and valuable maiden speech which was made here today by a new member on this side of the House. I say &#x201C;on this side of the House&#x201D;, because I do not know when last there was a new member on that side. The hon. member for Bellville discussed a very important subject, urban transport. I can assure him that we shall give very serious attention to his speech. I wish him all the best in his future career in this House.</p>

<p>I referred today to an important statement made by the president of the Reserve Bank this morning concerning the improvement we have made to the system of exchange control. In my short introductory speech this afternoon, too, I referred to arrangements that are being made and steps that are being taken to introduce further control over bank credit. I would have expected someone on that side of the House to have spoken on this subject, but the only person who had anything to say was the hon. member for Durban Point. I say with all respect that he speaks much more effectively on defence matters than on finance. He did not say that the steps should not have been taken, but he did say that the steps had come too late and should have been taken earlier.

<p>The only speech from the official Opposition which dealt with financial matters came from the hon. member of Umbilo. As is his custom, he put his case soberly and carefully marshalled his facts, and I listened with great attention to what he had to say. I can assure him that the points he raised will have the very careful attention of myself and my senior officials, particularly when we come to consider the forthcoming budget proposals. However, some of the things he referred to are matters that have had the very careful and constructive attention of the Government. I can merely refer him to the fact that in the last budget the improvements we made to social pensions alone cost almost R60 million in one year. That is an exceptionally large figure, and I think the hon. member will agree. I think the hon. member for Walmer might be interested too, because he raised the question of the increase in food prices since 1970. He said the increase had been 76%. Of course, food prices constitute only one item in the cost of living, admittedly an important item. Its weight is about 25% of the whole. However, while the cost of living index has risen, since 1970, by about 63%, social pensions have, in fact, risen by 84% over the same period. I mention these things because I <span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_0710"/>think we must be fair and keep a balanced view.</p>

<p>There is another very interesting point. The hon. member for Umbilo quite correctly referred to defence expenditure and mentioned that defence expenditure was a very big item in the Government&#x2019;s budget. What interests me, however, is the complete volte face we have seen in the Opposition generally in connection with this issue of defence. Less than a year ago we were being severely criticized for the defence budget that we presented. We were told that &#x2026; [Interjections.] Oh yes. If hon. members want me to refer to Hansard, I can do so when I have the opportunity. [Interjections.] I remember clearly what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said and I also remember clearly what the hon. member for Hillbrow said. [Interjections.] What they said is recorded in Hansard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands referred to what I said yesterday. He also referred to what the hon. member for Johannesburg North had said. It is very interesting that a man who is internationally known as an authority on gold, among other things, has just arrived in this country. I refer to Dr. Schultz. Immediately on arriving, Dr. Schultz expressed his unbounded confidence in the future of gold. He is one of the world&#x2019;s authorities on gold. His words are in stark contrast to what the hon. member for Johannesburg North has been telling us about gold. In view of the fact that, one might say, his own whole future and that of the companies with which he is directly connected are based on gold, one wonders why the hon. member takes this extraordinary negative view on gold.

<block name="quote">You would think, Sir, that South Africa has become one of the banana republics of South America. It has fallen into such financial ill-repute that we have to deny yet another devaluation, and of course that is far from the truth &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on these benches also want to take issue with the hon. the Minister on the infamous clause 3 of this Bill. We believe that the conduct of the Government in pushing this clause through has been disgraceful. We believe that the rights people have had for many years have been seriously prejudiced. I should like to put one request to the hon. the Minister, perhaps the last request in terms of this Bill. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether, if the members of the Harbour Carriers&#x2019; Association can bring concrete proof before the Minister of severe hardship which will be suffered by them as the result of this Bill being passed, he will give consideration again to the question of compensation. I sincerely believe that the rights of these people, which they have had for a very long time, are being taken away from them, and that their businesses and their whole way of life are being severely prejudiced. The hon. the Minister, I know, does not agree, and says that there will be plenty of work for them, but all I should like from him is an assurance that if hard facts can be brought to his attention to show that hardship is being suffered by these people, he will give further consideration to the question of compensation.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member for Durban Point and the hon. member for Orange Grove rising merely to state their objections here since we have already discussed this particular clause, to which they are objecting very thoroughly during the Second Reading and the Committee Stage. Allow me to use this opportunity, the Third Reading of this Bill, to say that it is by no means our intention to deprive other people of their privileges or to make money through the Railways Administration from these steps we are contemplating here. What we are doing here and what we envisage with clause 3, to which objections are <span class="col_1393-1394" refersTo="page_0713"/>being raised, is merely to promote efficiency in the handling of containers. We believe that it is essential that there should be the greatest measure of efficiency in the handling of these containers, especially in consideration of the large amounts of capital that have been invested in this; we would like to promote that efficiency as much as possible. If it had been a matter of rands and cents or financial considerations by the Railways, my approach to this question would have been entirely different.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove again spoke about compensation. As I have already said during the Committee Stage, I do not believe that there need be any damages in respect of this work. I want to agree with him that since the Railways Administration will be responsible for a large part of the handling of these containers, there will provisionally be less work for the private sector which undertakes this work. I agree with him here. However, there is one thing I find very strange. Other people are also going to be affected by this, for example the stevedores, amongst others, but hon. members on that side of the House have not objected to this. That side of the House has only raised objections on behalf of the carriers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But the stevedores will not handle the containers in any event.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But there will be less work for the stevedores as a result of this change which has been effected. All I want to prove, is that in due course there will be certain people who will have to make sacrifices for the promotion of procedures and the more efficient handling of transport. That is why some of these private carriers are likely to have less work. However, I am not aware of any financial losses or damage which will be suffered as a result of capital investments which have been made. Naturally I am not prepared to consider compensation for any losses which may arise as a result of less work for these people. If there are justified cases where losses are suffered as a result of capital investments which were made, one can consider them, but under the present circumstances I do not believe there is any likelihood of this happening. Prior notice of this was given so long ago that I cannot for one moment believe that capital investments have been made which cannot be utilized. If people have indeed made such capital investments, it was really foolish of them. I am therefore not prepared to reply unequivocally that I shall consider the matter as the hon. member for Orange Grove advocated. If I say that I am prepared to do so, it is possible that it will be concluded from that that I am prepared to pay damages. If there really are justified cases in which compensation has to be paid, the necessary procedure in accordance with which claims may be made is already in existence. These claims can then be settled on that basis. I think that it is common knowledge to all hon. members in this House that my office is always open to people who feel aggrieved about something done by the Railways Administration. If there is any carrier who would like an interview with me at a later stage, I am prepared to give him a hearing at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Berea asked certain questions relating the definition of &#x201C;sell&#x201D; and I promised him that I would consult the legal people. They gave me the following reply: If an Act dealing mainly with the subject of selling did exist, the definition of &#x201C;sell&#x201D; and also of &#x201C;advertise&#x201D; used therein would have been used. The Trade Practices Bill which is due for consideration by Parliament is considered to cover the subject of selling and the definitions contained in that Bill could, subject to certain reservations, possibly be used. As that Bill had not been approved it was deemed advisable to formulate a definition which would be acceptable for the administration of this Bill. This is the only reply I can give the hon. member.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. the Minister for his kindness in going into this matter and for the explanation which he has tendered. I appreciate the difficulty he has in dealing with a Bill which is not yet <span class="col_1395-1396" refersTo="page_0714"/>before the House. However, I did point out during my Second Reading speech that certain Acts which have been on the Statute Book for some time also contain definitions for &#x201C;sell&#x201D; which seem to introduce different phraseology and in certain cases different words. I should like to refer once again to the fact that in this clause the definition for &#x201C;sell&#x201D; contains the word &#x201C;send&#x201D; in line 41. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; keep, expose, transmit, send &#x2026;</block>

<p>However, in other Acts on the Statute Book we find that the term &#x201C;consign&#x201D; is used. I am not a legal person, but I wonder whether there is much difference in the intention when the word &#x201C;sell&#x201D; is used as opposed to &#x201C;consign&#x201D;. There is another point which I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. The definition for &#x201C;sell&#x201D; in the Bill is in relation to plant breeders but there is also a definition for &#x201C;sell&#x201D; in the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act, Act No. 101 of 1965. The definition in that Act includes the term &#x201C;barter or exchange&#x201D;. I find myself in a difficulty as to why it is necessary to use a term like &#x201C;barter&#x201D; in a Medicines and Related Substances Control Act when it would probably be more appropriate in a Bill of this nature which deals with plant breeders.</p>

<p>These are some of the points which I believe could possibly be considered and, if my argument is a valid one, the hon. the Minister could agree to broaden the scope of this definition in the Other Place so that it will comply, more on a general basis, with other definitions already existing in laws on the Statute Book.</p>

What is meant is &#x201C;om &#x2019;n ding weg te stuur&#x201D;. We can have a look at the whole thing however and, if necessary, rectify the wording in the Senate, if that would make the hon. member happy. Personally I am not concerned about the issue.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I promised the hon. member for Bryanston to reply to his question. He asked for the period of provisional protection to be limited. However, it is simply a fact that the Upov convention provided us with a directive. The provisional protection is in any case only granted for a limited period. It expires at the stage when the application for plant breeders&#x2019; rights is granted or rejected. As a rule it should not take more than one or two growing seasons before a decision on an application is reached. After one or two growing seasons, the quality of the specific variety is determined and then the provisional protection expires. It is not clear why the hon. member wants a limitation. But I can appreciate that he thinks we might impede the practical application. The fact is that a limitation is in conflict with the Upov convention and that it does not seem to be necessary in any case. I think that will satisfy the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate I expressed my concern about the fact that a man who has obtained plant breeders&#x2019; rights would probably not be able to allow the multiplication of material to take place in such a way that the producers may benefit from it. The hon. the Minister said in his speech that he also believed that breeders will probably not be able to produce adequate reproduction material of varieties themselves. I want to repeat what I have already asked: Would the hon. the Minister consider, in terms of this clause and when the compulsory licence is granted, having a licence granted to the official plant multiplication organization at an early stage to undertake plant multiplication&#x2014;I want to mention here specifically the KWV because it has spent in the past and is still spending an enormous amount of money on plant multiplication facilities.</p>

An official, who is also an expert, acts as registrar. We leave the discretion to him when the KWV, for example, develops a new cultivar which we should like to administer in terms of this Act. Hence the word &#x201C;reasonableness&#x201D;, because one is unable to define this matter precisely. There is no question of wanting to harm anybody. All we want to do, is to place the practical application of the Act on such a basis that it will be to the benefit of the industry.

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, but I have had second thoughts about it as is my privilege, and I am not going to move it, for the simple reason that I believe that until we have corrected one of the other anomalies that exists in our marriage law, i.e. the manner in which a surviving spouse out of a marriage out of community of property, can be disinherited where a husband or wife leaves a will disinheriting the spouse, I do not want the capital of either spouse to be drawn into this Bill. The purpose of my amendment was to see that a spouse who maintained capital which was not income bearing&#x2014;in other words, invested in land, shall we say, at Port St. Johns or in diamonds or something like that&#x2014;should in fact be taken into consideration by the court in assessing whether or not a spouse was contributing his/her pro rata share to the necessaries of the joint household. However, as I have said, I have reflected on this and I think it is right that the spouse, where the possibility exists that he or she might be disinherited, should in fact be allowed to accumulate capital which will not be taken into the court&#x2019;s consideration as part and parcel of the bargain of the pro rata contribution to the joint household. Therefore I am not going to move this amendment, but I would like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the reason for the proviso which was initially inserted in the 1953 Bill. I have been doing a little further research, and I find that the proviso was in fact inserted in the Senate. It then came back to this House, but I still cannot understand, the reason why the then hon. the Minister introduced this, and I would like some of the legal luminaries in this House to explain what it means before I vote on this clause, because perhaps I have misunderstood the whole object of it.</p>

<p>Yes, I am sorry; there was a proviso but it was changed considerably. The proviso, before it went to the Other Place, provided that the spouse paying any such debt&#x2014;that is in respect of necessaries for the joint household&#x2014;would have a right of recourse against the other spouse for one half of the amount thereof. That went to the Other Place where an amendment was introduced which substituted that proviso by the following one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that if the wife pays any such debt or part thereof, she shall have a right of recourse against the husband for the full amount paid by her.</block>

<p>That is the law as it stands now.</p>

<p>No, the husband had no recourse. The then Minister of Justice, in explaining why he had changed the proviso, made in my estimation the rather nebulous statement that: &#x201C;It is a safety measure we have decided to take after careful consideration. It means that if a wife is sued for costs, then she has the right to sue her husband for the whole amount.&#x201D; For the costs of a law case or what? I simply do not understand this. I want to <span class="col_1399-1400" refersTo="page_0716"/>know what &#x201C;careful consideration&#x2019;&#x2019;led the Minister of that time, Mr. Swart, to introduce that change in the Other Place and why the hon. the Minister now, presumably after further careful consideration, is scrapping the proviso altogether and not even leaving the wife with the original right of recourse for half of the pro rata contribution she had made. In addition, why is he not following the suggestion of Judge Vos in the Engelbrecht case to the effect that the wife should have the right of recourse up to the full amount of the contribution she had made? I should like to have an explanation for this.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>It appears that the amendment is not going to be moved, but I have an amendment to this clause which I propose moving, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 3, in lines 17 to 25, to omit the proviso.</block>

<p>Basically, the proviso as contained in the Bill at present, endeavours to circumscribe the manner in which the proportional contribution according to income should be assessed. It deals with two specifics and includes a generality clause, if I may call it that. The first of the two specifics, is to recognize as part of the income, assets which are applied in respect of such necessaries. The hon. member for Houghton has an amendment in her name on the Order Paper to change those words to &#x201C;assets owned by each spouse&#x201D; and I am very pleased indeed that she has seen fit to withdraw that, because I believe that in its practical application this would be completely and wholly unworkable and unsatisfactory for the reasons I shall give in a moment. The second of the two specifics is to recognize that if a spouse renders services to the joint household for which moneys of the spouse would otherwise have to be applied, this fact may be taken into account in assessing the proportional income of the spouses themselves. Here again, the hon. member for Yeoville gave notice of, but apparently does not intend moving, an amendment in which he further restricts this specific by stating that the services should be other than normal household duties. We believe that a tremendous number of interpretations can be put on the words &#x201C;services to the joint household&#x201D; which are contained in the Bill as it stands at the moment. I believe that the number of these interpretations could make the mind boggle. One could sit down and for quite a while be able to turn out interpretations of these words, interpretations which would probably differ from those of somebody else.</p>

<p>We believe that our approach is a realistic and practical one in that our entire intention is to try to give clarity to the man in the street. We believe that, in devising legislation in the unhappily popular field of matrimonial disputes, the statute law should be made as clear and as definite and as non-litigious as possible. We believe that the spouses should by means of clear legislation be fairly informed just what his or her rights and obligations are. The terms of any Act should, particularly, be capable of easy interpretation by the legal advisers of the parties who are so often called upon to settle matrimonial matters without recourse to expensive litigation. Any dispute between the parties should be considered clearly in terms of the Matrimonial Affairs Bill by the parties involved in the matter, as that they may ascertain the extent of their respective contributions to the household necessaries. To this end, Sir, we have framed our amendment, so that the warring parties, one might say, can be spared the formidable task of trying to assess with any certainty the quantum of their claim and we hope that, in so doing, we are making a contribution towards the speedy and satisfactory conclusion to this type of dispute.</p>

<p>We believe, too, that the generalities phrase which reads &#x201C;or any other relevant fact&#x201D; itself also creates uncertainty in the mind. Reading through this Bill, we feel somehow that the proviso was created in order to attempt to give the courts an opportunity of having as wide as possible a scope in deciding or coming to a conclusion as to the respective rights of the parties. We believe that, even if that is an admirable approach to the whole matter, the general public will be better served if it were narrowed down simply to contain the words &#x201C;a spouse married out of community of property shall be allowed to contribute pro rata according to his or her income in respect <span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_0717"/>of the necessaries for the joint household&#x201D;. That is the effect of our amendment; by deleting the proviso altogether, it narrows it down simply to a matter of income.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say immediately that I am prepared to accept the amendment of the hon. member for East London City as I think it is a well-founded amendment. I have considered this clause very carefully and I believe that, by contaminating the principle of income laid down in the main body of the clause with possible assets and services, we would be indicating to the courts that we do not trust them enough to find out for themselves what exactly they should do. I believe that we must credit the courts with a certain amount of knowledge of the law and also of court procedure and that we should allow the courts to decide for themselves how they would like to apply the basic principle contained in this clause.</p>

<p>As far as the questions that the hon. member for Houghton has put to me, are concerned, I must confess that I am unable at this stage to follow the tortuous thinking of this particular assembly in 1953 or the tortuous arguments that were raised in the Other Place. In the same way, posterity will probably have a lot of trouble trying to find out what we were debating and why we were debating it. I believe that we should rely on the Law Commission and their arguments where they decided that income should really be the basic principle of the pro rata assessment. In the circumstances, I believe that we should not try to overdo this Bill. We must try to make it as basic as possible and leave it to the courts to indicate to us, in the case law, whether something else should be added or not. If the courts decide at a later stage that something else is needed by way of amendments, we can reconsider the matter then. In the circumstances, I am prepared to accept the Bill with the deletion of the proviso as it is at the moment.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move amendments (2) and (3) standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) On page 9, in line 15, to omit &#x201C;thereof&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(3) on page 9, in line 20, to omit &#x201C;(3)&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;(1)(b)&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>It is the intention to delete the word &#x201C;thereof" in the English text on page 9, line 15, because, according to the law advisers, this word does not really fulfil a function, and to omit &#x201C;(3)&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;(1)(b)&#x201D;, because this is obviously a minor error.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in the name of the hon. member for Yeoville as well as my own, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 7, in line 38, after &#x201C;company&#x201D; to insert:<br/>and of the words &#x2018;and partners&#x2019;, &#x2018;and associates&#x2019; or &#x2018;and company&#x2019;.</li>

<li>(2) on page 7, to add the following paragraph at the end of subsection (1) of the proposed new section 28quat:</li>

<li>(d) if the memorandum and articles of association of such company and any amendment thereof, have been approved by the law society in terms of its rules.</li>

</ol>

<p>I may say at the outset that these are amendments of a minor nature which do not affect any principle at all. The situation is that, on reading the proposed new section 28quat(1)(c) as contained in clause 4, it is quite clear that it is intended to restrict the name of a new company to the names of the people who previously practiced as attorneys in that company. There is one small exception, however, and that is that various firms have appendages at the end of their names such as <span class="col_1403-1404" refersTo="page_0718"/>&#x201C;and co.&#x201D;, &#x201C;and partners&#x201D; or &#x201C;and associates&#x201D;. After reading the particular subsection, I am not certain that this particular type of appendage to a firm&#x2019;s name is included in the wording. I am not certain that it will be proper for a firm of attorneys, who may have six or ten partners, to call themselves, let us say, &#x201C;Joe Smith and Partners&#x201D;. I am not certain that the words &#x201C;and partners&#x201D; could come into the name of the new company. In order to ensure that there is no confusion at all, the suggestion is that those words should be added as stated in the amendment which I proposed.</p>

<p>The second amendment relates to the drawing up and the acceptance of the memorandum and articles of association, and this is also a minor point. It might even be described as looking for ghosts in the cupboard, and I am prepared to be persuaded that no such situation could arise. While I agree that the memorandum and articles are public documents, and while I agree that nothing that is illegal may be included in these documents, I do believe that, in structuring a company, in the utilization of the capital structure of a company, in creating a company, specific circumstances can arise where a memorandum and articles of association can be structured, which are not in the interests of the legal profession or of the State. I do not wish to quote specific examples that I have considered. I can see absolutely no harm in the law society concerned having the final say in regard to the drawing up of the memorandum and articles of association. It is not my intention, and I am sure it would never be the intention of the law society concerned, to look into the details inter partes of partners. I am thinking of some of the major issues relating to the structuring of a company when it is first created. Therefore, I think it can do no harm at all to ensure that no malpractices creep in, which could, in years to come, embarrass the legal profession, and, perhaps at another level, embarrass the State. It could do no harm if we had the provision that the memorandum and articles of association shall be subject to the approval of the law society concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not take too much of the Committee&#x2019;s time, although I can see there is still a little time left. The official Opposition cannot agree with the two amendments moved by the hon. member for Sandton. In regard to the question of adding the words &#x201C;and co.&#x201D;, &#x201C;and associates&#x201D; and &#x201C;and partners&#x201D; at the end of paragraph (c), I mentioned in my Second Reading speech that I believed it would be right that, if a firm or a group of attorneys incorporated themselves under the Companies Act in terms of this particular section, the general public should be informed of this fact, and that therefore it would perhaps be advisable to add at the end of their names, as set out in paragraph (c), the word &#x201C;incorporated&#x201D;. I actually mentioned this in my Second Reading speech, and I have since discovered that the Companies Act itself provides for it in section 49(4). People will therefore know that it is an incorporated company. However, I believe there is no purpose in adding the words &#x201C;and co.&#x201D;, &#x201C;and associates&#x201D; or &#x201C;and partners&#x201D;. I believe that this will only tend to confuse the public, because at the moment there are numbers of firms of attorneys who do use those appellations at the end of the names of the partners who conduct the practice. So, we can see no reason for the inclusion of these words that are suggested.</p>

<p>In regard to the second amendment which was moved by the hon. member for Sandton, I would like to say that the memorandum and articles of association are always available to the general public. Secondly, if one reads the commencement of the new section 28quat, one will see that a private company itself conducts the practice of an attorney, and as such, is subject itself to all the rules and regulations to which an attorney is subject. Therefore, there is no purpose in providing for the memorandum and articles to be perused by the law society prior to, or even subsequent to, incorporation. We cannot agree with that.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree with the hon. member for East London City. Section 49(4) of the Companies Act states that it is absolute essential for the word &#x201C;incorporated&#x201D; to appear behind the name of the firm. To allow the word &#x201C;partners&#x201D; to appear there together with the word &#x201C;incorporated&#x201D;, will simply cause confusion. &#x201C;Partnership&#x201D; is a legal concept in itself, and &#x201C;incorporated&#x201D; is also a legal concept in itself. However, it is a different legal concept. In my humble opinion, it would be unheard of to allow the words &#x201C;partners&#x201D; to appear together with the word <span class="col_1405-1406" refersTo="page_0719"/>&#x201C;incorporated&#x201D;. The most I can do to help the hon. member for Sandton in this respect, is to say that I am prepared to allow the words &#x201C;and associates&#x201D; or &#x201C;and company&#x201D;. Those concepts are not in conflict with one another. Therefore, I want to move amendment (1) standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) On page 7, in line 38, after &#x201C;company&#x201D;to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that the words &#x201C;and associates&#x201D; or &#x201C;and company&#x201D; may be included in the name of the company.</block>

<p>I think this will meet to some extent the request of my hon. friend over there in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I also want to deal briefly with the second amendment moved by the hon. member for Sandton. I am not prepared to accept that amendment. I was informed by the lawyers that they had never reserved for themselves the right to determine the mutual arrangements of partnership between parties. Neither are they desirous of doing so now. They are prepared to abide by what the Registrar of Companies does in connection with matters of this nature. In that respect I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Sandton.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I did hesitate, and I consequently consulted senior members of the legal profession and of the law society. I am aware of the fact that the law society is not keen to institute an investigation into everybody&#x2019;s memorandum and articles of association. On the other hand, I think it is the duty of the Committee not only to take into account the wishes of the law society, but to take into account an even broader view as well, and to protect the interests of all the parties concerned in the legal profession and the various individual members of that legal profession. I particularly do not wish&#x2014;and I am not going to press the matter any further&#x2014;to quote any specific instances, but I do wish to warn the hon. the Minister that situations can arise in the converting from a firm of partners to a company, in the structuring of the company, in the way in which it is done, which will not redound to the benefit of the legal profession, and I would therefore have wished that there would be some protection for the legal profession against certain members who might adopt a procedure which is undesirable. That is why I proposed this amendment.</p>
