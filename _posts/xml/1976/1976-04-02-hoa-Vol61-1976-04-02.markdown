<p>Clause 5:</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 5, in line 47, to omit &#x201C;codes of practice and&#x201D; and to substitute:</li>

<li>(2) on page 5, in line 58, to omit &#x201C;code of practice or&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>In the Second Reading of this Bill the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs motivated this clause as follows, and I quote from his Hansard (col. 4373)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Circumstances arise from time to time where it is necessary to urgently amend an existing standards specification of the SABS and where such an amendment cannot be held over for approval at the next formal meeting of the SABS council. An avenue for the implementation of urgent amendments is created by clause 5 of the Bill, which provides that the Standards Council may delegate its authority to amend standards specifications to the chairman or the vice-chairman of the council, or to the director-general of the council.</block>

<p>This matter was very fully debated at the Second Reading stage between the hon. member for Johannesburg North and myself and the hon. the Minister. I thank the hon. the Minister for his courtesy in replying as fully as he did at that stage. He did, however, indicate that in his opinion the amendment as it now appears on the Order Paper, would not give effect to the desire as expressed by the Natal Chamber of Industries, for whom we as an Opposition party are making representations at this stage at their specific request. The problem of the Natal Chamber of Industries is basically that they have an objection to the hon. the Minister, through this amendment, allowing the council to delegate its powers to either the chairman of the council or the director-general of the council in the absence of the chairman. They believe that this is bad in principle because in the event of there being an aggrieved party under this amendment, any right of recourse back to the council would be virtually impossible because it would involve the council then repudiating in effect either the chairman of the council or its director-general. They believe that certain sections of industry could be embarrassed and prejudiced under those circumstances. The hon. the Minister has his viewpoint, and I have given very close consideration to the arguments that he adduced, but we on this side of the House, with our legal advice, still believe that the amendment has its merits and I move accordingly.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, unfortunately I cannot agree with the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens for the following reasons. The proposed delegation of powers by the board in terms of the proposed section 11(2)(a) to the chairman and, in his absence, to the director-general, may only take place in respect of codes of practice and standard specifications&#x2014;these are both voluntary schemes&#x2014;and not in respect of compulsory standard specifications. A standard specification is a binding specification where a manufacturer wants to manufacture a product under an approved mark of the bureau and according to specification. However, he is free to cease manufacturing according to the specification and mark at any time. Secondly as a result of technological development and changes as far as the provision of raw materials is concerned, it is necessary that amendments have to be effected before the <span class="col_4455-4456" refersTo="page_0910"/>next board meeting as a matter of urgency. An example which I may mention here is the recent petroleum crisis when certain manufacturers had to execute binding contracts for products which had to be delivered according to standard specifications. The manufacturers then approached the bureau to adapt the standard specification as a matter of urgency in order to make provision for substitute raw material. It is therefore essential that it has to be done in great haste and therefore the chairman or the director-general has been able to effect such a change. The amendment of hon. member for Cape Town Gardens is not feasible because the committee which he referred to is not a statutory committee. Committees for specifications do exist, but the representatives serving on these committees, are invited administratively by the bureau to serve on the committees. The hon. member therefore suggests in his amendment a committee which does not exist anywhere in the legislation. If it were accepted, a whole number of legal consequences which would flow from this would have to be covered by the legislation, for example, who the members of such a committee should be, what their term of office should be, whether they should give advice or make recommendations, whether their recommendations were binding, and so on. The fact of the matter is that the chairman of the board and the director-general will be advised in the same manner and by the same people in respect of adjustments to codes of practice and standard specifications as when the board is requested to consider and approve adjustments. Clause 5 of the Bill proposes a new section 11(2)(b) which provides that the board maintains its power to repeal any change made by the chairman or director-general. The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens said that it would not be possible to amend such a specification, but the board maintains its power and may repeal or amend any amendment effected by the chairman and the director-general at any time, if necessary. I am therefore not in a position to agree with the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Germiston District has given very much the same reply as the hon. the Minister in his reply to the Second Reading debate on this Bill. It was quite obvious from the way in which the hon. member read what he had to say that the statement was prepared for him.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>There is no need for the hon. the Minister to react in the way he did. The hon. member made exactly the same two points which the hon. the Minister made the day before yesterday in his Second Reading speech. The first one is that these are voluntary specifications which are, as he put it, asked for by the industry concerned and then applied by them. I must draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to section 15 of the principal Act which provides that he may, under certain circumstances, make these specifications compulsory specifications, which would then have to be adhered to. If the hon. the Minister is going to reject this amendment on the basis that we are here dealing with standards and specifications which are voluntarily accepted by the industry concerned, then I want to ask him why we have this Bill and why we have the Act. If these are voluntary specifications which the parties concerned are going to apply voluntarily, why do we have an Act&#x003F; Why do we waste the time of this Committee in even considering it&#x003F; I believe that although these specifications are voluntarily instituted at the request of the industry concerned, there still is a degree of compulsion which pertains to them. How do we arrive at these specifications&#x003F; These specifications are accepted and published by the bureau after they had been considered by the council or after they had been considered by a committee established by the council.</p>

<p>Let us come to the second point the hon. member made, namely that there is no provision anywhere in the Act for a committee. The hon. member for Germiston District made the point that it was not a statutory committee, and I accept that. However, I do <span class="col_4457-4458" refersTo="page_0911"/>not believe it has to be a statutory committee for this to have force and effect. If we look at the rubric of section 11, which is being amended here, we find that it is for the&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Establishment of committees and assignment of powers of council.</block>

<p>When we go back to section 3 of the Act, we read that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The objects of the bureau are&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) to promote standardization in industry and commerce;</li>

<li>(b) to prepare, frame, modify or amend specifications and codes of practice.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then, Sir, when you look at section 10 of the Act, you read that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) the functions of the council shall be&#x2014;</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(a) to formulate, on broad national lines, the policy which, subject to the approval of the Minister, shall be adopted by it with a view to achieving the objects of the bureau.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then we come to section 11 of the Act, in terms of which&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council may establish committees to assist it in the performance of its functions &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, I believe that its functions are the formulation of these standards, and committees have in fact been established by the council for the precise purpose of formulating these standards and these specifications. I do not believe that it is unreasonable to ask that before one person&#x2014;the director-general or the chairman&#x2014;is given the power, on his own, on an application made by possibly one concern, not by the industry as a whole&#x2014;it could be on an application by one concern&#x2014;to amend these regulations which will affect the whole industry and not only one concern or one factory, the matter should at least be referred to the committee which in fact is concerned with that particular aspect. I know that the hon. the Minister is going to say to us that there is not a committee in respect of every industry. I accept that but, Sir, if there is something wrong in the drafting of this amendment then I ask the hon. the Minister if he will not assist us, if he can see our point of view that, where the specifications are made compulsory or can be made compulsory and, secondly, where they are made with the voluntary consent of the industry as a whole and only after the recommendation of the committee or consideration by the council as a whole, a committee or the council as a whole should have some say in the amendment of these regulations and that it is wrong in principle to allow them to be made simply on the authority of one person without referring the matter to any other body.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the amendment moved by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens, contains two basic elements. In the first place he wants the term &#x201C;code of practice&#x201D; to be deleted from the section and in respect of the amendment of any standard specification, he wants, in the second place, only the chairman and the director-general to have the power to amend the standard specifications at the recommendation of a committee. Sir, here we have to consider the definitions in the principal Act. In this connection the principal Act deals with three things; it deals with standard specifications which are compulsory for a whole industry. This proposed amendment does not affect the position concerning compulsory standard specifications. In other words, the clause is not meant to assign delegated powers to the chairman of the board or to the director-general in respect of compulsory specifications. Then, by means of the definition, there are also standard specifications with which this clause deals. Then there is also a definition of codes of practice which this clause is also dealing with. The hon. member for Germiston is quite correct, in spite of the vicious remarks of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South. This is voluntary, and should any particular enterprise feel itself aggrieved as a result of this, there is no need for it to comply with it. In other words, I maintain that there is nothing onerous in this particular connection, but in any event these amendments are actually effected at the request of the people in the industry themselves, and often as a result of technological developments. Sir, we have to be practical. <span class="col_4459-4460" refersTo="page_0912"/>This council is composed of people who are quite familiar with the objects of the Act, and the director-general himself is a science expert in terms of the requirements of the Act.</p>

<p>The second point in this connection is that the board meets four times per annum and in practice this means that it is not always possible to effect amendments initiated by the private sector before the next meeting of the board, with detrimental effects for the industry itself. With respect to the second point I made, I want to say further that the board has its own committees of experts and also asks experts from outside to advise it on certain subjects. The board often takes decisions according to the advice of these committees, and the director-general and the chairman&#x2019;s decisions&#x2014;in terms of the powers granted them by this clause&#x2014;will likewise be in accordance with the advice furnished by the abovementioned advisory committees.</p>

<p>If we were to effect this amendment to the clause it would mean that the director-general would be compelled to act only in accordance with the advice of an informal committee of specialists. Legally something like this is not possible because neither in the Bill nor in the principal Act is provision being made for a committee or committees of this nature. One cannot exercise powers in conjunction with a committee for which no provision has been made. It would therefore not mean a thing and could just as well be <i>non scripto.</i> For that reason I cannot accept this amendment. I want to ask the hon. member for Cape Town-Gardens please to be content with this.</p>

<p>I received a telegram on this same subject from the Natal Chamber of Industries. However, I want to make it clear that should the objections raised by the Natal Chamber of Industries were to become a reality and the rights of people were to be affected detrimentally, I promise to take action.</p>

<p>Amendment (1) negatived and amendment (2) dropped (Official Opposition dissenting).</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the good that will be seen to have arisen from the passing of this Bill is that, in the first instance, it has been handled on an entirely non-political basis. Secondly, it has highlighted the importance to South Africa of the SABS and it has further highlighted the close collaboration which is taking place at all stages between commerce and industry on the one hand and the Government on the other hand.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the hon. the Minister for the undertaking he gave me during the discussion of the amendments moved by myself on clause 5 of the Bill.

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill has taken a long time to reach its last stage in this House. It is a Bill to which those who have been involved in it, have given a great deal of attention over a prolonged period. To my recollection, it was first drafted several years ago. It was sent by the department to bodies in the private sector. They then considered it and gave their views on it. I believe that it went back and forth with ideas and revisions suggested by the private sector as many as four times, until the private sector indicated that they were satisfied with it. I should like to compliment the department on the very close <span class="col_4461-4462" refersTo="page_0913"/>co-operation which was initiated by them on this legislation with bodies in the private sector. I think this is the way in which legislation of this nature should be dealt with. But I am afraid I cannot pass the same bouquets to the private sector in this instance, and it is with great regret that I have to say so.</p>

<p>I believe that this was an occasion which called for the fullest co-operation by bodies in the private sector. An opportunity for them to give that co-operation was provided, but to my mind&#x2014;and I think from what I will say it will become clear&#x2014;the private sector did not grasp this opportunity to the full and did not apply their minds to the needs of business so far as this legislation was concerned. I am sorry that I have to say this in regard to bodies in the private sector, but I do so with the intention of bringing this matter pertinently to the attention of the private sector in the hope that when an opportunity for co-operation of this nature is presented in the future, they will grasp that opportunity to the full.</p>

<p>I make this criticism, Sir, because when this Bill first came to Parliament a matter of two years ago&#x2014;in 1974&#x2014;it contained two glaring defects. The first of those defects was that on account of the incorporation of the provisions of the Trade Coupons Act into this legislation and the fact that those provisions were subjected in this Bill to a new definition of &#x201C;sell&#x201D;&#x2014;which now includes advertising&#x2014; unintended effects would have come to light if this legislation had been passed in that form. These effects, i.e. the subjection of the trade coupons provisions to advertising, were never intended and would have the effect of prohibiting some quite innocent and quite desirable trade practices.</p>

<p>The second defect that the Bill contained when it first came to Parliament was that clause 16, which defines the powers of the Trade Practices Advisory Committee, was framed in such a way that the Minister would have been able to act without the concurrence of the Trade Practices Advisory Committee. This was never intended, but was in the Bill as originally presented to Parliament and had been approved of by the organization in the private sector. I think, Mr. Speaker, we of the Opposition must claim quite a substantial part of the credit for remedying these defects. But I would like to say that when this Bill came to the House at Second Reading it still contained one of those defects, namely the subjection of the provisions of the Trade Coupons Act to the new definition of selling, with all the harmful effects which that would have had. Accordingly, we at Second Reading felt obliged to oppose the Bill at that stage for that reason. We have, however, never queried the desirability of giving consumers added protection in certain areas. We consistently supported that principle. Many other Western countries&#x2014;and I am familiar with the position in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia&#x2014;have found the need for this type of legislation&#x2014;in fact, they found a need for going further than this Bill actually does. I therefore welcome this measure. It provides a long-felt need in regard to the protection of the consumers, particularly against false and misleading advertising and selling methods and against various injurious trade practices which may be thought up by ingenious people from time to time.</p>

<p>Having said that, Sir, I certainly do not think that the Bill in its present form is perfect. If we had thought so, we would certainly not have moved as many amendments as we did in the Committee Stage. All the amendments which we moved were aimed at one thing and one thing only, and that was to improve the effectiveness of this legislation and the smooth working of it. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that we on this side of the House are pleased about the number of amendments that were accepted in the Committee Stage, including some important amendments which were moved by this side of the House. For that we express our appreciation. But I do believe that there is one important further amendment that the hon. the Minister should consider when this Bill is discussed in the Other Place. He will recollect the discussion we had in the Committee Stage on clause 9. I believe that this clause would be very greatly improved if the discussions which we had were implemented, namely that in addition to the three general provisions defining the offences of false and misleading advertising and selling methods, there were also to be included in that clause the specific offences which were contained in the amendment which I proposed in the Committee Stage. I believe that if the hon. the Minister were prepared to redraft this clause&#x2014;and it is, after all, the essence of the Bill, being the clause that is going to cover most of the offences that this Bill is designed to stop&#x2014;this clause would be much more effective. It would then be easier to lay <span class="col_4463-4464" refersTo="page_0914"/>charges and to secure convictions. Above all, however, if the specific offences were included in this clause, it would act as a very much stronger deterrent than it would in its present form. I hope the hon. the Minister will keep an eye on the working of this Bill in practice. This is new legislation that is breaking new ground, and I hope that if amendments become clearly necessary and desirable, the hon. the Minister will not hesitate to introduce them in future sessions. I believe that some of the amendments we moved in the Committee Stage may well have to be adopted by him when he sees how the legislation works in future.</p>

<p>I believe, too, that the hon. the Minister must carefully watch the working of clauses 10 and 11 which cover the trade coupon provisions. These provisions basically go back to the old Trade Coupons Act of 1935. We on this side of the House believe that the original purpose of the Trade Coupons Act is still valid, in the sense that it is still desirable to prevent the supply of coupons of so great a value that the value of the goods themselves becomes insignificant by comparison. We do not want to go back to the chaotic conditions that existed in the late 1920s when coupons of so great a value were offered with cigarettes and breakfast foods that the value of the cigarettes and breakfast foods was of secondary importance in the making of a purchase. However, all the changes that have occurred in trading practices since the Trade Coupons Act was passed in 1935, do require that certain adjustments should be made to these provisions and that there should be more flexibility in the application of exemptions than is provided for in the legislation at present before us.</p>

<p>Although I do not regard this Bill as being perfect, I nevertheless think it is a good one, one which is going to afford consumers protection in areas where that protection is at present lacking. When this Bill becomes law there will be a remedy against firms who exploit the less sophisticated members of society by making misleading statements in mail order catalogues, etc., against exaggerated claims by patent medicine manufacturers, against half-truths on the part of second-hand motor-car salesmen and, what is somewhat more important, there will be a remedy against advertisers who encourage, even by implication, harmful and dangerous practices. I have in mind, in particular, the advertising of cigarettes &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; without any warning in regard to the danger of smoking, and some of the advertising in connection with tyres which, by implication, encourages dangerous driving and speeding. This Bill must not be put into a drawer and forgotten like the Trade Coupons Act was. The hon. the Minister must ensure that he has an adequate administration to deal with it once the Bill becomes law. In my view he should expect a lot of complaints to investigate, and he must be in a position to do so when those complaints are received. In practice this is how the Bill is going to work. Members of the public are going to lay complaints with his department. He is not going to have to conduct general inspections, as is provided for in the legislation. He is going to have to deal with a large volume of complaints, and I hope that his department is going to be in a position to deal with the situation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister may well find that he will have to go further than the provisions of this legislation if consumers are to enjoy adequate protection from all the harmful practices that ingenious members of the private sector think up from time to time. There are certain unconscionable acts which may or may not be covered by this Bill. I have in mind, for instance, undue pressure brought to bear by salesmen in consumer transactions, for example when door-to-door salesmen sell encyclopaedias and insurance. I have in mind taking advantage of people&#x2019;s inability or incapacity to protect their own interests due to physical or mental infirmity, ignorance, illiteracy, age or the inability to understand the nature or the language of a transaction. This is important in a country like ours where such a large proportion of the consumer public is unsophisticated and uneducated and, in many cases, illiterate. I have in mind the charging of prices grossly in excess of what is normally charged for a particular item. This happens on a fairly wide scale, particularly where retailers <span class="col_4465-4466" refersTo="page_0915"/>enjoy special privileges to trade at certain hours when their competitors are not open for business, for example those who trade on Sundays.</p>

<p>No, not necessarily imported goods. I have in mind also the selling of an article on credit when there is no reasonable probability that the purchaser is going to be able to pay, and finally I have in mind selling on terms that are so harsh that they are inequitable to the consumer. Some of these practices may well be covered by clauses 9 and 15 of the Bill under consideration at the moment, clause 9 dealing with false and misleading statements and clause 15 dealing with injurious trade practices. Others, however, may require additional measures.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I hope the hon. the Minister will give all these matters I have mentioned this morning his attention as soon as this Bill becomes law. We on this side of the House support this measure at Third Reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill deals of course with three separate matters. It deals, firstly, with falsity in advertising, secondly with trade practices and, thirdly, with trade coupons. I think it is necessary to deal with all three in turn, to analyse what has happened during the Second Reading and the Committee Stage and to set forth what one&#x2019;s attitude is towards the three aspects.</p>

<p>As far as trade coupons are concerned, I want to say relatively little because the hon. the Minister has indicated that he is going to examine the matter during the recess. He has given that undertaking and I think he has given that undertaking with a view to try to shorten the debate on this subject. I want to respect that. However, I hope that he will give the opportunity to people of putting forward their cases on the matter because there are very different opinions on the subject. May I just give an example to the hon. the Minister&#x003F; The hon. member for Constantia talked about the laxity of the private sector, but I can tell of one organization which has not been lax in regard to this. I refer to the National Management and Development Foundation, which has not only had seminars on it, but intends to have further seminars. There have been considerable expressions of opinion at those seminars which I think would be of assistance to the hon. the Minister. I would appeal to him to make sure that he does hear the representations of the people who are concerned with this type of business and who I think make them in quite a <i>bona fide</i> and reasonable fashion. I do not want to carry the subject of trade coupons any further.</p>

<p>When it comes to falsity in advertising and trade practices, I think we are in a different field. I think the first thing that needs to be said is that we are entering an age in which the consumer is going to expect from the people who represent him, action to protect him. This is not a question of taking consumerism to extremes, but it is a question that a section of the population which for a very long period of time has had inadequate protection, now wants its voice to be heard. I think it is correct that we should say that this is not the only piece of legislation in regard to consumer protection which either has been passed or will be passed, because such pieces of legislation as the Price Control Act, the Rents Act, the monopolies legislation and the Limitation and Disclosure of Finance Charges Act are all consumer legislation in the true sense of the word. I am sure that there is further legislation pending in regard to credit which, if it does not reach us this session, I hope will certainly be able to be on the Statute Book by next year. I wonder whether we should not have in South Africa a code of consumer practice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I have been pleading for that all along.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then we are on the same wave-length because a code of consumer practice and of consumer protection is what I believe the South African public needs. One of the remarkable things which I think is forgotten in this House, is that we are actually elected by consumers. We are actually supposed to be the watchdogs of the consumers and therefore it is my view that we need to devote far more time in this House to debating the measures which are designed to protect the consumer. The concept of a code of consumer protection is one which I am sure will, particularly in the light of what the hon. the Minister has now said, find universal acceptance.</p>

<p><span class="col_4467-4468" refersTo="page_0916"/>I want to go one further in this matter: I want to deal with the concept of rooting out exploitation in South Africa. One of the difficulties that exist in our country is that the exploitation is here not merely an economic matter. Exploitation where a businessman exploits a consumer, is not something which has purely economic consequences in the sense that the person who is exploited becomes poorer and the exploiter becomes richer; it has in fact far wider consequences from a social point of view, from a political point of view and, unfortunately, from a race relations point of view. One of the dangers which we face is, as I have indicated before, that it will be said that the face of the exploiter is White. We will therefore have consequences in regard to this matter from a race relations point of view which we cannot afford. The fact that the isolated White person in South Africa exploits people of a different colour for economic gain, is something which South Africa cannot tolerate. I do not say that Whites are exploiters and Blacks never are, but what I am saying is that in the times we are living today, in the whole context of the society in which we are living, we as White people cannot allow this kind of situation to take place. That is why we have to take strong action against exploitation, not only for economic reasons, but, in fact, for reasons of politics and for reasons of good relations.</p>

<p>Then we have the argument which is repeatedly used, namely that we have a free enterprise system, a capitalist system, and that in a free enterprise system, you must allow people virtually to do what they like, and people must look after themselves. This is a concept to which I do not subscribe. As far as we are concerned, we support the concept of free enterprise, but it is the duty of the legislature to restore the balance in bargaining power between the different sections of the community. If we want free enterprise to survive in South Africa, then we must make sure that people are on the same level in respect of bargaining. We can only have free enterprise survive if we take the steps to make sure that this equality is achieved. If we do not do that, then the people who are exploited, the people who are at the wrong end of the free enterprise system, will look for a different system in order to allow their equal economic development to take place. Those who believe in free enterprise must accept that free enterprise, in order to survive, must adapt itself to the conditions of today, must make changes to it and must offer the protection to restore the balance between the privileged and the underprivileged when it comes to the question of economic bargaining.</p>

<p>I should also like to talk about exploitation in a very immediate sense. Every time we have had a budget in South Africa and every time that there are changes in prices or duties or anything of a similar nature, somebody in the country seeks to take advantage of it. Immediately, within hours of the last budget speech, one heard the reports of exploitation and advantage being taken in this regard. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that it is bad enough having a tough budget, but it is worse when people seek to take advantage of it at the expense of underprivileged and sometimes poorer people. I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to ask the Price Controller to take immediate steps and to let us have a few examples set in South Africa in cases where this kind of thing is being done, at a time when many people in South Africa are feeling it and feeling it pretty hard. This is the first opportunity that I have to make this appeal to the hon. the Minister to stamp out the exploitation that takes place immediately one has a budget speech. One inevitably seems to have exploitation when higher prices or duties are announced. When such announcements are made it inevitably happens that one person takes advantage of another.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal specifically with the aspect of the legislation which deals with falsity in advertising. This legislation does not create a new offence in our law, but what it does do, is to make it easier to prosecute. The remedies have always been there, but now we have better weapons with which to act.</p>

<p>I should again like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to something connected with advertising, and to ask him whether he approves of it. We are at present engaged in an anti-inflation campaign, as the hon. the Minister knows; he himself is playing a part in that campaign. Is it in the interest of the anti&#x002D;inflation campaign for businessmen to advertise that to buy is anti-inflationary and for them to use the anti-inflation campaign to get people to spend their money&#x003F; Is this a form of advertising of which he approves&#x003F; Is it desirable that such advertising should take place, particularly as in many cases it can be <span class="col_4469-4470" refersTo="page_0917"/>shown that it means no saving to anybody who buys the products advertised in this fashion&#x003F; To me this seems to be an abuse of the whole concept of fighting inflation and of reflecting the truth in advertisements. With respect, this again is a matter to which I ask the hon. the Minister to pay attention.</p>

<p>There is perhaps one other matter concerned with trade practices to which I should turn. The hon. the Minister has tremendously wide powers in respect of trade practices. There can be no doubt about that. He can change the law of contract and he can do many things and do them in a very dramatic way if he so wishes. I should like to appeal to him to use these wide powers &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>With circumspection, as I usually do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>That is it: with circumspection. I ask him to bear in mind that, in view of the wide powers Parliament has entrusted to him, the public look to him to ensure that these powers are very carefully used. I think it is also important that the hon. the Minister has accepted amendments to the composition of the board which plays a very real part in this whole matter. The appeal I should like to make to the hon. the Minister in this connection is that he must ensure that the personnel of the board will create the image that is required to make a success of this. I think that the success of this will to a large extent depend on the type of people who will actually serve on this board. Therefore I appeal to him to bear this in mind because much will hinge on this particular aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>When we consider trade practices, it is actually the standards of the community that have to be taken into account. I previously referred to the German legislation on this. In Germany, in fact, this is accepted by the courts and it is the courts who take the actual decisions in regard to the norms that are to apply. These norms change from time to time. In exactly the same way trade practices will have to change from time to time. There are examples I can give of how the norms of the community in Germany have changed. In 1955 the Bundesgerichtshof of Germany declared that door-to-door solicitation by an undertaker seeking to sell future burial contracts was contrary to the practices they regarded as being desirable. They also regarded it as an undesirable practice that, when someone died, the next-of-kin were immediately telephoned in order to sell them a tombstone&#x2014;funeral people and monumental masons seem to adopt such practices quickly. This goes to show that a society applies certain values.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister might do so, but I am out of that game. I quote this to illustrate that a community has certain concepts of what they regard as right and wrong. These norms change from time to time. I think the hon. the Minister has a great responsibility in that he must make sure that he stays in tune with what the opinions of the community are as they change from time to time.</p>

<p>Lastly, I should like to deal with the powers given to inspectors and to the secretary in terms of this legislation. These powers, again, are very wide. We have asked for safeguards, some of which we did not get. There are presumptions in this legislation, some of which we do not agree with. There is vicarious liability of a sort with which we do not agree in its complete form. There is the question of the power to search and to seize. These are all very wide powers. Again, I ask that, in view of the fact that these powers are being given by Parliament, they be used very carefully, and that the principles one holds dear are borne in mind.</p>

<p>We opposed the Second Reading of this Bill. We opposed it because of the particularly wide powers that were provided for at that stage. We have subsequently had amendments accepted; there have been changes made. I want to make it quite clear that we are not entirely satisfied with this matter. However, we believe that this matter is so important to the public at large at this particular time that we cannot vote against the Third Reading of the Bill on these grounds. We entrust these powers to the hon. the Minister and to his department and hope that these powers will be used carefully. If they are abused, he will hear all about it from us. What is important at the present moment is that we introduce in the business life of South Africa a little more <span class="col_4471-4472" refersTo="page_0918"/>morality, not for the whole broad spectrum of businessmen, but for that section of them who bring business, free enterprise and the community as a whole into disrepute. That is why we support the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have come to the end of a debate on a measure the Second Reading of which was taken as far back as last year. In my opinion the principles in this legislation have been fully discussed. I do not believe there is a great deal about which to pick an argument with the members of the Opposition as regards the broad principles of this legislation. It is only that I cannot understand why the hon. members opposite are so concerned about the coupon system. In fact this is the only aspect of this legislation which they have really attacked. Surely it is true that in the past the coupon system has repeatedly shown that it causes difficulties. Since we know that it causes difficulties, why should we again make the provisions in regard to this coupon system so wide as to cause us further difficulties in future&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville intimated that they, too, objected to that aspect of the legislation. He added that they were in favour of a code of consumer protection. I do not think that anyone will have any fault to find with that. We should just note that there is already a degree of consumer protection in practice owing to various organizations which are already active in commerce. However, I have no fault to find with the idea that we should take another look at this aspect in future in order to overhaul the code of consumer protection and create other machinery to effect its actual implementation.</p>

<p>However, we ask ourselves whether the hon. member for Yeoville was in earnest when he referred to exploitation. As usual&#x2014;this is something one has from that party from time to time&#x2014;they always want to employ any issue they possibly can to cultivate a feeling of guilt among Whites. In his speech the hon. member said: &#x201C;We want to specially mention the exploitation of Blacks by Whites.&#x201D; In general I want to agree with him in this connection, but after all, the traders in South Africa are not exclusively White. In the non-White areas such as Madadeni in the vicinity of Newcastle, the consumers are exploited by non-White traders for the most part.</p>

<p>I say that the answer as regards the future of a sound relationship between the consumer and the distributor or the trader is to be found in our causing the consumer public to be increasingly informed and providing them with the necessary knowledge as to how to buy judiciously. The hon. member for Constantia who spoke before me complained about the fact that the private sector had not given sufficient assistance with regard to the drafting of this Bill. I want to agree with him that this is <span class="col_4473-4474" refersTo="page_0919"/>so, because in fact, this legislation is primarily there to protect the interests of the private sector. He added <i>inter alia,</i> that there were certain &#x201C;glaring defects&#x201D; in the original legislation at the Second Reading stage. Now I really want to object to a remark made by the hon. member, claiming for that side of the House all the honour for the amendments and the rewriting of this Bill as it eventually came before this House. I think that this is really unfair. The hon. member is saying by implication that the members of the Select Committee who represented the Government did nothing whatsoever about the matter. We are prepared to give recognition to the hon. member if he made a contribution. However, I think that the hon. member made a remark which could not be allowed to pass unheeded. What I find strange with regard to the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint on this Bill is that although they accept the principles with regard to the issue of trade coupons, for example, they are constantly trying to find a means of getting away from these principles by way of the amendments they move.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>It is a fact that we are prepared to look at any reasonable suggestion. The hon. the Minister has repeatedly stated very clearly that if some of the amendments moved by that side had been accepted at the Committee Stage, this legislation would have been totally ineffectual and emasculated. This is the aspect which, in my opinion, is of importance. It is true that the hon. Opposition did express its satisfaction with regard to the number of amendments accepted, but they are now complaining about certain amendments which were not accepted, and they are doing this in spite of the fact that we agree about the Bill, that the Opposition is going to support the Third Reading and that the hon. the Minister has already given the House the assurance that he will have another look at certain aspects of this legislation during the recess, particularly with regard to the trade coupon system.</p>

<p>What is important is that we should first have a look at how this legislation works in practice. After that we shall be in a far better position to amend this legislation to adapt it to the practical situation, because that is the real test for any legislation which functions in this country. I did not take part in the discussion of this Bill before the Third Reading, nor was I a member of the Select Committee which examined this legislation, but I should like to say that by means of this legislation the hon. the Minister and his department are doing the consumer public of South Africa a valuable service. In my opinion this Bill meets a need which has been felt for many years. The South African public expects the protection which the Government and this Parliament must afford them, in spite of what we have just said in connection with the task of education to be carried out in respect of the general public.</p>

<p>Now we repeatedly come across the other aspect of the matter and that is that the public also expects the State to protect it against price increases, which is also something which, to a degree, forms part of the background of this Bill. It is true that inflation or price increases have always been a powerful political weapon in the hands of an Opposition and the Opposition Press. This aspect is constantly cast in the teeth of the Government. Owing to the development of the economic systems of the world and the more sophisticated methods of manipulating economies by fiscal and monetary measures, it is indeed sometimes possible for a Government to handle certain tendencies in regard to price increases. We can never make this concession, unless we say in the same breath that the public, too, has a definite responsibility in this connection. That is why I think that the most important thing that has been done here this morning is that we have expressed our disappointment that the private sector has not played a greater part in the drafting of this legislation. Looking at the debates which are past, one gets the impression that the United Party, and to the same extent, the Progressive Reform Party, too, wanted to create the impression that for the most part it was they who wanted to protect the interests of the consumer. Looking at the amendments moved, and in view of the fact that the Opposition tried to circumvent certain principles by way of their amendments, one gets back to this aspect of the matter: viz., that the protection which the Opposition tried to afford in this debate was really to be found in the protection of the trader and the distribution market. This Government is not insensitive to the interests of the distributor and the manufacturing industry in South Africa in general. <span class="col_4475-4476" refersTo="page_0920"/>We have the principle of a free trade economy in South Africa which has applied for a very long time. The interests of the traders are equally important. But when we are dealing with legislation which is chiefly aimed at protecting the consumer, then we necessarily emphasize that aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia readily conceded that this was a good Bill. He added that in the future we should have to go further, and I want to concede at once that we shall have to go a great deal further in the future. Mr. Speaker, you will allow me to say something more about this. We must also take into account the fact that there are already various other Acts in this country which protect the consumer. To mention only a few, there are the Price Control Act, the Weights and Measures Act, the Sale of Land on Instalments Act, the Merchandise Marks Act and the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act. Besides these we have the S.A. Co-ordinating Consumer Council which is subsidized by the Government. I think that this organization plays an extremely important role which cannot be replaced by this legislation. We must take into account that last year this organization was already playing a major role in the legal proceedings instituted in regard to the various cases in which the maximum prices of goods had been exceeded. I believe that we shall have to expand this S.A. Co-ordinating Consumer Council substantially in the future to enable it to play a more effective role. I feel that legislation of this nature can only function effectively if the interests of the general public are protected by means of an organization. I want to agree with the hon. member for Yeoville that the existing legislation we have just mentioned must be supplemented to a substantial extent and that this Bill only serves as an interim phase to deal with certain glaring difficulties in this connection.</p>

<p>The legislation we have just been discussing deals with various matters and I think it would be as well if we were just to draw attention once again to the kind of practice which must be restricted by means of this legislation. Looking at advertising&#x2014;and this applies to the whole world, it is indeed a difficult matter to know exactly where the line is to be drawn. I believe that any trader would go out of his way to describe and present his product to the public in the best way possible by means of advertisement, because after all, that is the aim of advertisements. In so doing he might very easily infringe the provisions of this legislation. It will therefore be very difficult to know where to draw the line and that is why I think that when this legislation is implemented in practice, it should be done with great circumspect in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>There is another aspect, too, relating to the quality of the goods, viz. the issue of the price factor. The advertising of prices constitutes one of the biggest gaps in the trade practices of the entire country. I think that it is the advertising of prices that causes the most mistaken impressions among the public, and exactly how the legislation is going to restrict this in practice, we do not know. We shall have to see how it works. There is no doubt that the growth of chain stores in South Africa is based entirely on the advertising of prices.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. member whether he is referring particularly to loss leader advertisements or to advertisements in general.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>I was specifically referring to loss leader advertisements, and I am particularly perturbed about the fact that one often finds a full-page advertisement in the Press where only selected prices are advertised. To my mind this conveys a completely wrong impression of the true state of affairs.</p>

<p>*Another aspect of misrepresentations which we must take account of is the fact that certain people advertise goods of which they have no stocks whatsoever, merely to attract certain people. I think it is very often the case that certain prices are advertised at a sale and that there are only a few articles available at that price. When the public arrives at the dealer to buy these articles, they have supposedly been sold out.</p>

<p>The second malpractice which I should like to mention in this regard is the fact that in many cases people advertise certain services when they have no authorization to do so. I think there was a specific case of an estate agent advertising that he had the sole agency for the sale of a certain State property. On investigation it transpired that there was no such State property for sale in that area. His aim was merely to attract the public in order <span class="col_4477-4478" refersTo="page_0921"/>by so doing perhaps to offer them something else.</p>

<p>Another malpractice in this connection which I myself have come across is the sending of an account for some article by post. When one takes a closer look at the account, one finds that it is in fact an account for something which is offered for sale. It is possible that many people might react to such an account and then find that the goods are not what they hoped they would be. We also find the practice that people place advertisements for goods which supposedly no deposit is required. The fact is that in many of these cases a deposit is in fact required under the hire-purchase system, and that is why I think that in the future we shall have to investigate this aspect again, because I am not quite sure that it will be possible to restrict all these practices in terms of the provisions of the legislation as they stand at present.</p>

<p>For a number of years there has been another phenomenon, in South Africa too, that of certain foreign companies recruiting agents within the Republic of South Africa who then have to pay a certain amount for the right to obtain articles at a so-called discount price, which they in turn have then to sell to the public. This practice has already cost prospective agents literally thousands upon thousands of rands. Quite often, when enough of these agents have been recruited, the company disappears and the agents are then unable to obtain new stocks or are unable to sell the articles they have offered for sale. As now amended, this Act will make it possible to restrict these undesirable practices.</p>

<p>Sir, I think that the establishment of the Trade Practices Advisory Committee is indeed a major step in the whole structure of our trade relations in South Africa, but I think that the success of the operation of this advisory committee will depend largely on whether the people serving on this committee are in fact inspired and whether they have the skill to advise the Minister properly. If the Minister finds that this committee is not functioning properly, then in my opinion, irrespective of what the Opposition may have to say about this matter, he should take certain of the powers of this committee into his own hands. It is important that this problem be solved, and if we do not act forcibly we are certainly not going to solve this problem, because we cannot escape the fact that the imaginativeness of the traders in South Africa and throughout the world really knows no bounds. Every day they come up with new methods and new gimmicks.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now discussed certain aspects of this legislation which, in our opinion, will eliminate certain practices which give rise to concern, but there is another aspect we may look at with a view to this legislation and also with a view to the future revision of this legislation, and this is the issue I have just mentioned, viz. the psychological onslaught on man. Sir, since Pavlov demonstrated the conditioned reflex, the world, science and commerce has seized on it to launch an onslaught of increasing scope on the spirit and mind of man, and trade practice in advertising in the world is nothing but an extremely sophisticated attempt to condition the reflex of the individual. Therefore, Sir, we should also consider another aspect of trade, and that is the issue of salesmen. I want to ask whether South Africa can continue to afford having almost 17 000 of those salesmen working in this country. When I say this I do not want to make out that we can carry on our trade without salesmen, but is it really necessary, for example, for a specific furniture business to employ, on a commission basis, four or five salesmen who are simply forced to adapt their whole impact on the public in such a way that members of the public are forced to buy things they do not need. If they do not do this, they are unable to make a living. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the initial stages of the speech of the hon. member for Newcastle he seemed to generate more heat than he shed light on the Third Reading, but he settled down and I think he put forward some constructive ideas and highlighted certain aspects of promotion which could well do with closer investigation, and I feel quite sure that when this council is constituted it will be able to deal with some of the abuses which the hon. member suggested were taking place. He also, I think quite rightly, pointed to the fact that while there was a need for consumer protection there was also a need for consumer responsibility. I think that this is an important aspect.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to refer to a particular portion of the speech made by the hon. member for Yeoville. The hon. member <span class="col_4479-4480" refersTo="page_0922"/>referred to the question of funeral expenses and the possible exploitation of the public by salesmen selling funeral policies from door to door. I would just like to remind the House that in the early sixties, as a result of information which came to me, I tabled a private member&#x2019;s motion. You may remember, Mr. Speaker, that at that time you took part in that particular debate. As a result of that motion various steps were taken by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, but unfortunately, although I was able to provide absolute evidence of cases where there had been a flagrant abuse of the terms of funeral contracts, it did not seem at that stage that it was possible to take positive action against the perpetrators of these breaches. I feel that under this Bill it will be possible in future to deal with this matter if it can be established that some of these undesirable practices are still being carried on.</p>

<p>I want to come back to another aspect dealing mainly with advertisements and I want to refer the hon. the Minister to what he said last year when he replied to the debate. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All advertising that is not covered by any other Act will fall under the purview of this Bill.</block>

<p>At that time reference was made to an announcement made by the hon. the Minister of Justice in the debate on his Vote in 1974 when he said that he had instructed the National Liquor Board to investigate certain aspects of advertising. He drew attention to the fact that the board, after delivering for virtually three or four years, had suggested that there were three kinds of liquor advertisements. They were defined as primary, image-building or direct-action advertisements. Sir, I would like to refer very briefly to the third type, the direct-action advertisements and I want to quote what the Minister of Justice said on that occasion. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the third type of advertisement is concerned, no evidence was submitted to the board nor was the board able to find any evidence that the so-called price advertisements gave rise to increased liquor consumption or encouraged people who had not previously consumed liquor to do so.</block>

<p>My reaction to that statement by the hon. the Minister is that the whole object of the exercise as far as the producers are concerned is to encourage consumption, and I believe that the figures which show increased consumption together with the fact that the advertisements are designed to encourage new consumers, indicates that the emphasis has been directed towards that particular motive and that it has been directed particularly at our youth. Here I believe that the Minister in charge of this Bill will have a very serious and great responsibility to see that there is no abuse. The Minister of Justice said at the time that if there were any abuses and if liquor advertisements still appeared &#x201C;depicting scantily clad females or extolling the consumption of liquor or containing obvious untruths&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall not hesitate to introduce a system of advance screening of all liquor advertising material. I have also instructed the Liquor Board to watch the position closely in future.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my plea to the hon. the Minister in this connection is that, in view of the explicit statement made by his colleague, he should see to it that there is full collaboration and liaison between the two departments because it would be a waste of manpower and effort if there should be overlapping and duplication of effort with regard to this particular aspect.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer to a matter which was brought to my attention by a constituent who wrote to me saying&#x2014;</p>

Have you ever seen such a depressing picture of what we must look forward to for our young people&#x003F; What it is supposed to achieve I cannot tell you. All living together, I suspect. A bottle of whisky is depicted. The advertisement states: &#x201C;There is a movement taking place; a take-over.&#x201D; Am I silly to be offended by it&#x003F; But I am.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to send the advertisement over to the hon. the Minister. I would like him to have a look at it. It is not so much the offensiveness of the advertisement itself, but what it says. It says: &#x201C;There is a movement taking place; not belligerent, just slightly insurgent. Wrangler&#x2014;the quiet take-over&#x201D;. Sir, &#x201C;insurgent&#x201D;, according to my dictionary, is defined as &#x201C;rising in opposition to lawful authority; rebellious; one in revolt; a rebel.&#x201D; I believe that the fact that these advertisements are still allowed to appear&#x2014;this one appeared in <i>The Natal Mercury</i> on 26 March this year&#x2014;is an indication that the Advertising Standards Authority and the Newspaper Press Union either lack the motivation or they do not have the teeth in their code of ethics to control such advertising which, I believe, is offensive.</p>

<p>I want to quote from the code of the Advertising Standards Authority, their code of advertising practice. They have a specific section in the code for liquor advertising, which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Advertisements which contain the following features will not be accepted: &#x2026;</block>

<p>There are four conditions laid down, but this is the one to which I draw the attention of the hon. the Minister and I think he might even agree that I have a point, because it refers to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Advertisements showing consumption in squalid, poverty-stricken or disgusting surroundings.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that that advertisement falls very near to that particular category. According to the Advertising Standards Authority&#x2019;s code for liquor advertising, such advertisements are not permitted to be published. It seems to me that although these voluntary prohibitions have existed through voluntary codes, they have not been implemented and I believe in many instances they cannot be implemented, because there is no legal power to back it up. As I see this particular Bill, I believe that clause 9, which deals with particulars in respect of certain advertisements, and clause 14, which also deals with what the hon. the Minister may prescribe in connection with advertisements, will place a strong weapon in the hands of the hon. the Minister if he chooses to use it. I believe that he has a responsibility, as far as the consumers are concerned, and as soon as this Bill has been signed by the State President and has been put into effect, to use the authority it gives him. I believe that we will be able to overcome some of the flagrant breaches of the advertising code which have occurred because there are strong penalties. The contraventions are accompanied by very heavy penalties and high fines, even possibly imprisonment. So I ask the hon. the Minister whether he will give particularly careful attention to this aspect of the Bill at Third Reading.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Berea who has just resumed his seat is known in this House as a person who is very concerned about the moral standards of our people. In his contribution this morning which, in my opinion, was a very constructive one, he again spoke along these lines. I think he can expect the hon. the Minister to react about a matter which really deserves consideration. The hon. member for Yeoville spoke earlier and I want to acknowledge at once that he said a great deal with which we can agree. He referred to the necessity to eliminate the exploitation of the consumer public and in principle we agree wholeheartedly with that idea. But now he has also referred in particular to the exploitation of the non-Whites. I want to say that the statement he made is not an unfair one because it is indisputably true and it is the responsibility of the Government to give constant attention to this. But I do not think that the picture is quite as sombre as the hon. member made out here, because I read in the annual report of the Consumer Council that steady progress is being made in respect of the non-Whites&#x2014;I want to refer to this, Sir, because it links up, to a certain extent, with the plea made by the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;as regards the extension of contact with the non-Whites. It is put as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4483-4484" refersTo="page_0924"/>&#x2019;n Aansienlike aantal radiopraatjies oor &#x2019;n verskeidenheid onderwerpe van basiese belang vir die ontwikkelende verbruiker, is aangebied en in Bantoetale herhaal. Die reaksie was gunstig en verdere aandag sal mettertyd hieraan gegee word. Die Nieblankes verwys in toenemende getalle hul probleme na die raad en verskaf in hierdie proses waardevolle inligting oor wanpraktyke. Dit lyk dat baie werkgewers &#x2026;</block>

<p>And that is the point I really want to emphasize&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; min benul het van die uitbuiting waaraan hul werknemers op hul eie werf blootgestel is.</block>

<p>Now I just want to dwell on this for a moment and draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that in my opinion, as far as exploitation as such is concerned&#x2014;under the Act as well&#x2014;one must try to obtain the employers&#x2019; co-operation to a greater extent to assist in this regard, and I do not think there is any doubt that one will never be able to eliminate all the irregularities that occur, through legislation alone. A very important task lies ahead, particularly as far as education is concerned, and I want to suggest that the employer can make a very important contribution in this connection. Here is a very interesting contribution by the Consumer Council in connection with the combating of exploitation of the non-Whites in this country, and I want to say that one should have the greatest appreciation for the contribution made by the Consumer Council and in particular to eliminate these problems. I think the hon. member for Yeoville can rest assured that constant attention is being given to this problem.</p>

<p>This legislation, which is now before the House in its final stage, is one of the most important pieces of legislation in many years, because this legislation protects the consumer community and the business community. As far as I am concerned, it protects the business community, which is for the most part a very responsible community, against exploiters within its own ranks. These exploiters derogate from the high standards which the business community as a whole strives to maintain. In this connection I want to refer to the contribution made by the business community. There is an association known as the Direct Sales and Service Association of Southern Africa, and they have a code of honour which they uphold. Unfortunately I cannot quote the whole code of honour, but that code provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the quality of the product or the service rendered; for a guarantee which must be given to the purchaser of that product; for the provisions relating to the sale, in other words, the agreement which must be concluded; even for a period for consideration by the purchaser or the person making use of the service; for the responsibility to the purchaser which is accepted; and for advertisements and the elimination of misrepresentations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it provides that when equipment is purchased, free training is provided for the people who have to operate the equipment in question, and in conclusion, it provides for the control and discipline of the members themselves, and this brings in the Trade Practices Act. The example being set here is one well worth following, because if the entire business community were to adapt themselves to the upholding of a code of honour, a better relationship would develop between the consumer and the seller or the business community as a whole. If this legislation at present before us can prompt the business community to eliminate that which is undesirable in their ranks, we should, in general, be able to live in a far better and healthier community. As I have said, we acknowledge that it is only a small section of the business community which is guilty of offences of the kind for which the legislation is now providing. It is as well, too, that the honest members of that community feel that they are protected by this legislation.</p>

<p>However, it protects the consumers as well. In the first place, it protects the consumers against themselves, to prevent them becoming the victims of the emotions incited by exploiters. The fact that this is so cannot be disputed either. We all agree that the consumer public needs protection. I have a very good example in this connection drawn from the experience of the Consumer Council, which proves how essential it is for the consumers to be protected against themselves. The Consumer Council deemed it necessary to publish a brochure dealing with the behaviour of salesmen, etc. In the introduction to this brochure the standpoint of the Consumer Council is stated as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4485-4486" refersTo="page_0925"/>Dit is egter so dat huisbewoners dikwels &#x2019;n maklike prooi is van die verkoopsman wat daarop uit is om vinnig en maklik geld te maak. Laasgenoemde maak selfs soms misbruik van die alombekende gasvryheid van die Suid-Afrikaanse huishouding. Die gemiddelde bewoner glo dat sy huis &#x2019;n veilige vesting aan hom bied. Hofregisters bewys egter die teendeel wanneer waaksaamheid verslap word.</block>

<p>And then there is a whole series of &#x201C;don&#x2019;ts&#x201D; for the consumer, &#x201C;don&#x2019;ts&#x201D; which really demonstrate to us how essential it has become for the consumer to be protected against himself. They put these &#x201C;don&#x2019;ts&#x201D; as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moenie bloot vir die genot daarvan koepons invul of na handelsmonsters kyk nie.</block>

<p>In the Second Reading debate and, to a certain extent, in the Committee Stage as well&#x2014;this morning, too&#x2014;quite a lot has been said by the Opposition about the issue of trade coupons, trade samples and so on. It is true&#x2014;this has been found in practical experience&#x2014;that the coupons and trade samples are extolled to such an extent that the public become the victims of their own emotions and spend their money on goods which they could have done without or of which the quality is questionable and the price quite out of proportion to the value. The consumer council adds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moenie vra vir &#x2019;n demonstrasie van iets wat u nie nodig het nie.</block>

<p>I need not even mention the fact that over and over again, what in fact happens is that suggestion takes place. As a result the consumer is subjected to a process of psychological brainwashing in order to persuade him to make himself available for demonstrations. There are innumerable examples of the practices against which the consumers should be protected. Members of the public are invited on a friendly basis to have tea with someone but when they get there, they are subjected to high pressure techniques. It is as well that the Bill is to be placed on the Statute Book, because where necessary, action should be taken against this kind of thing as well. The following is also stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moenie &#x2019;n verkoopsman binne nooi as hy iets verkoop wat u nie wil h&#x00EA; nie.</block>

<p>This gets back once again to the well-known hospitality shown in South Africa. When someone knocks on the door one is only too willing to invite the person in for the sake of friendliness, but once he has his foot in the door, he really has his foot in that door and it is not easy to get him out again. One often sees in cartoons that such a salesman does not go before he has sold something to the householder. The consumer council has ample experience of the type of practice which is undesirable and against which the public should be protected. I could go on quoting the &#x201C;don&#x2019;ts&#x201D; because there are about twenty of them here. I do not want to quote all of them, but there is one against which very strict action can, I hope, be taken in terms of the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moenie &#x2019;n dokument op die ingewing van die oomblik onderteken nie. Gun uself afkoeltyd.</block>

<p>This, too, is referred to in the code of honour which I put before the House. It is true that people just decide on the spur of the moment to sign for what they have been offered.</p>

<p>I really hope that if, in implementing the legislation, methods are discovered which appear to conflict with the principles of the legislation, it will be possible to take action. I said at the start&#x2014;I want to emphasize it now&#x2014;that legislation alone is not enough to eliminate these undesirable methods. It will still be necessary to continue with an education process to educate the consumer public and warn them to take care, because there will always be loopholes. In this regard I want to refer to the outstanding work done by the Consumer Council in South Africa. This is an organization which was established by the Government and it serves under a board which only acts in the interests of the consumer. I believe that when the Bill is placed on the Statute Book, the board will be in an even more favourable position to carry on its work in the educational sphere, because I see the Bill and the educational work done by the board as two elements which are essential as regards putting right what is wrong in our community at the moment. Under those circumstances it is a pleasure for me to support the Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, both the hon. member for Springs and the hon. member <span class="col_4487-4488" refersTo="page_0926"/>for Yeoville mentioned the question of consumer participation in the implementing of the Bill. The hon. member for Yeoville mentioned that what we need is a code of consumer protection while the hon. member for Springs mentioned the good work which is being done by the Consumer Council. We on these benches are all in support of that council, but we believe&#x2014;we have said it repeatedly&#x2014;that the work of that council could be extended and that the council could be given some real powers. As we have put it in the past, it could be given some teeth. With the implementing of the Bill, the hon. the Minister is in a position to give the council some teeth. However, more important than giving the council some teeth, is the education on consumers in this country. Consumers must be educated not only along the lines mentioned by various hon. members, including the hon. member for Newcastle, but they must be educated to participate in the control of malpractices. My information from overseas countries and particularly from Europe and North America is that it is the active participation of consumers which has done away with much of the malpractices which existed there in previous years. The malpractices have not been done away with by means of legislation, but through the consumers themselves participating.</p>

<p>I believe that we must now get to the stage where we will persuade our consumers to take active steps against exploitation and against what amounts in many cases to cheating. I do not think that I need go too far on that, but I do want to mention in particular what has happened in the past in the furniture industry and in the motor industry where most of the sales are contracted under the Hire Purchase Act. I must say to the hon. the Minister that I appreciate the fact that in December last year he announced the code of conduct which was to be followed by the association of furniture traders. I believe that came directly as a result of the introduction of this Bill. I believe that until this Bill was introduced, those things were hidden away&#x2014;they were under the blanket. It was only with the introduction of this Bill that those things were brought to light notwithstanding the fact that they were mentioned in this House before. I say that it is as a result of that that we now have this code of conduct.</p>

<p>I also want to mention the question of Christmas clubs. As far as I can see, their activities have dwindled. I do not believe, however, that they have been completely exterminated. They were a tremendous source of frustration to the public, and more particularly to our non-White public. The gullible ones were easily persuaded to buy a certain amount of stamps every week which would allow them to participate in a Christmas hamper or to receive a Christmas hamper or something of that kind. There is also the question of burial societies mentioned by other hon. members. Unfortunately it is nearly always the illiterate, underprivilege Black masses of people who are affected by this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville mentioned the question of inspectors and I want to repeat what I said to the hon. the Minister during the Committee Stage regarding inspectors. I sincerely hope he will employ the right type of person and that people who are employed will have specific instructions to carry out their duties in such a way as to gain the confidence of the people with whom they are going to work, the people who are most directly affected by the legislation, viz. the traders and retailers.</p>

<p>Sir, that hon. Whip &#x201C;broms&#x201D; all the time. If it was a pleasant noise he was making, we could put up with it, but it is most unpleasant. He knows nothing of what he is talking about. He is simply &#x201C;bromming&#x201D; and nobody can hear a word of what he is saying. The hon. member for Newcastle spoke of an Act which has existed for 40 years and has been applied more in the breach than in the observance thereof. In those 40 years certain trade practices have developed in this country. For instance, there is the issuing of coupons. If the Act had been strictly applied, that would have constituted an offence. However, today it has become an accepted trade practice. Coupons are issued whereby certain benefits are given to the public&#x2014;not selected benefits to selected members of the public, but selected benefits to the public at large. I believe that in the implementation of this measure when it becomes law, what we are going to need is a rational approach. I believe there will have to <span class="col_4489-4490" refersTo="page_0927"/>be circumspection in the application of this measure.</p>

<p>I have referred certain trade coupons to the hon. the Minister and I believe that such coupons do not really constitute a moral offence, although they may be technically considered as such in terms of this legislation. I have here a voucher which resembles a cheque. It has printed on it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Free!&#x2014; R25 with every suit purchased from R79,95: Two free shirts, two free ties, two free pairs of socks.</block>

<p>It cannot be argued that the shirts, ties and socks are made by the same manufacturer. Nor can it be argued that they are proportionate to the price that is being paid. Indeed, none of the exemptions contained in clause 11 of the Bill apply. However, I really and truly do not believe that this is a malpractice as such. It is an advertisement, an offer to someone to purchase a suit. It is an advertisement saying: &#x201C;If you purchase a suit, we will allow you a discount of R25.&#x201D; However, as the Bill is worded, this would constitute an offence. I ask the hon. the Minister, when he looks into these matters, to consider this aspect before this practice is outlawed. I know that a lot of these matters will be referred to the committee and I know too, that the members of that committee will look into this particular aspect.</p>

<p>I have another coupon here which states&#x2014;</p>

I sincerely hope that the same attitude will attain in the future.</p>

<p>I must in passing draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to an article I found in <i>The Evening Post</i> of 17 March. I happened to be flying to Durban and, being bored on the aircraft, I bought this newspaper in Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>I was bored until I came across this article. The article carries the heading: &#x201C;Back to card sets&#x201D;. In 1935 the Trade Coupons Act was introduced, and it achieved its object, which was to break the malpractices that were occurring at that time. For instance, if one smoked enough cigarettes, one could get a free motor-car through the coupons enclosed in the cigarette packets. The same thing applied in the United Kingdom at that stage and there they adopted similar legislation. However, I see in this report that England, for one, is now going right back to the beginning. A tobacco company is now to revive cigarette cards as a collecting incentive for adults. The article states that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2018;The subject of the first set, which is vintage automobiles, was deliberately chosen for adult appeal,&#x2019; said the managing director &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was suspended, I had asked the hon. the Minister to be circumspect in his application of this Act because I felt that a lot of good could come of it, but that a lot of what was being accepted today as normal trade practice, could also be affected in terms of the Bill. I come back to a statement which the hon. the Minister made during the Committee Stage when he said that it was his intention to see that the advertisements were not used &#x201C;om die koper uit te lok&#x201D;, the phrase he used.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from><span class="col_4491-4492" refersTo="page_0928"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Instigate. I shall accept that too. The point is that everyone of us who uses an advertising media, used it with the intention of persuading somebody to do something, either to make use of a service or to purchase something. When a firm spends the kind of money that is necessary to place an advertisement such as the one I am holding in my hand from a newspaper, a half-page colour advertisement, that firm does it with an object. The object is to persuade people to buy. In this case the object was to persuade people to buy pianos. In this particular advertisement, an advertisement which appeared in <i>Rapport,</i> it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bespaar nou met hierdie bewys. Hierdie bewys is vir u R80 werd mits dit voor 29 Februarie ingehandig word by enige tak van</block>

<p>And then the name of the firm is given, followed by&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; teen die aankoop van enige nuwe klavier.</block>

<p>This is what is in effect in terms of this Bill a trade coupon. If a person takes this coupon to the particular firm and purchases a piano there, that person will receive a discount of R80. This is a benefit; it is in fact a trade coupon in terms of the definition of this Act. I believe that it is not the intention of the hon. the Minister to deal with this sort of advertisement. I do not believe that this sort of advertisement is covered by the exceptions which are provided for in section 11. When one goes further and looks at the change of the definition of the word &#x201C;sell&#x201D;, which now includes &#x201C;to advertise&#x201D;, this in fact becomes an offence because it is an advertisement which is construed in terms of the Act as a sale. I think the hon. the Minister has got the message here, but I want to refer to another advertisement, namely one which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> from a firm which was selling goods made from sheepskin. At the bottom of the advertisement it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tydelike aanbod. Bring hierdie advertensie in en kry R1 afslag op skaapvelle.</block>

<p>This does not bear a relationship to the price; it is not a discount or anything of that sort. This is in effect a trade coupon. The last point that I want to mention again deals with an advertisement. It is one which appeared in <i>The Natal Mercury</i> and states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Each day several of the names received will be published in the classified section. The first four persons whose names appear are to &#x2019;phone &#x2026; each morning and will win a double ticket to any theatre&#x2014;so hurry!</block>

<p>Here again it is a competition for a benefit which this Act could preclude. The point that I want to make is that these are practices which have grown up. I do not believe that there is any evil in these practices. There are other practices where there is evil and if the hon. the Minister will use this Act to stamp out those evils, he will have the full support of us on this side of the House. We wish him and his department well in the execution of those duties. That is why I ask him please to use those powers with circumspection.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words in general regarding what has been said by members here this morning particularly, and what has been said outside this hon. House. The hon. member for Newcastle said that the Opposition had tried to protect only the distributor and the trader and were not interested in the consumer at all. He also spoke about the ingenuity of traders who will find some way of circumventing the provisions of this legislation. I do not believe that those comments were in the best interest of consumers and I do not believe that they were in the best interest of commerce and trade in this country as a whole. I believe that it is important that there should be confidence between the buying public and the distributive trade. If we do not have that confidence, we cannot have an efficient business which will work to the best interest of all the people. In addition to these statements, I refer particularly to statements made by certain supermarkets and discount house bosses, comments and statements which have been made with the express object of obtaining for themselves a benefit and obtaining for themselves free and cheap advertising. They are statements which they have made with the object of creating the impression with the public that they were the only honest traders in the whole world and that any of their competitors were in fact dishonest.</p>

<p><span class="col_4493-4494" refersTo="page_0929"/>I believe that this sort of publicity only exacerbates public feelings, especially at this time when the public are faced with ever-increasing costs. This sort of statement is to the detriment of consumer relations. The distributive trade in this country is, I believe, the most competitive single aspect of business in the whole country. Each trader relies on the confidence of the public whom he serves. Over the years they have worked on this and I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that for all that we need a Bill like this, for all that we need this sort of legislative provision, the best way of ascertaining that the public will get a square deal is to leave it to the trade, to leave it to business, because the best way is competition. Malpractices cannot develop where there is adequate competition, because the honest trader with an honest price will draw the business every time.</p>

<p>My last words to the hon. the Minister in wishing him and his department well in the execution of this Bill is to say to them, use the honest trader rather than use the sledgehammer.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as we have now come to the end of this debate, I should like to address a few words of thanks to the hon. members who contributed to this debate this morning and this afternoon for their support of the principle of this legislation. At the same time I should also like to thank most heartily those particular members who accentuated and highlighted the facets of the evil that we are trying to combat for their information in this specific connection. I intend to try to reply to the details mentioned by hon. members but before I do so, I want to say at the outset that the legislation we are dealing with at the moment is, firstly, one of many statutory measures which are being placed on the Statute Book to protect the consumer against exploitation. I think that hon. members are aware of the fact&#x2014;and they emphasized it in their speeches&#x2014;that during this period of rising inflation, there is increasing pressure and the focus is on rising prices. The belief is also very often generated that it is the function of the State under these specific circumstances to use the instruments which it has at its disposal to protect consumers against exploitation by those undesirable trade practices. In this specific connection we must not lose sight of the fact that the producer and the dealer depend upon the support of the consumer for their livelihood. Just as little must we forget that it is the responsibility of the producer and the dealer to comply with the normal requirements of the consumer at the lowest possible and competitive prices. It is generally true, and specifically now, that there is a clash of interests between the producer, manufacturer and the consumer. In such circumstances the authorities are expected to interfere, to act as arbiter and to pass judgment in regard to the interests of the various groups.</p>

<p>In this connection I want to emphasize one facet because it was not emphasized this morning. I refer to the point that the rights of the consumers do not simply lie in the fact that they must be protected from exploitation. They also lie in the fact that there has to be a proper distribution system on a regular and continual basis to bring the goods, commodities and services which the consumer requires, within his reach at reasonable prices. One important aspect has become very clear from this debate and that is that all members of this House, all the parties represented here, have accepted one important principle and that is that it is the duty and responsibility of the State to intervene when the shortcomings in our economic system are such that they are harmful to the national or general interest. I hope you will permit me, Sir, to put my attitude and that of the Government in this connection for what I hope will be the last time this session.</p>

<p>Persons and organizations in the private sector and also in commerce and industry, as well as certain news media, have recently repeatedly attacked alleged increasing and unfair State interference in the economy of our country. The Government in general and I as the responsible Minister have been accused in the first place by the participants in this campaign of sacrificing the prosperity of the community in general and the progress of our economic system on the altar of creeping socialism. At the same time it is stated by those persons participating in this campaign that the system of private enterprise to which I and the Government are bound, must be given the chance to carry out its recognized functions in our national economy, viz., to promote the profit motive in a way which will advance the private entrepreneur and his financial aims and benefit, apart from the effect which this <span class="col_4495-4496" refersTo="page_0930"/>may have on the general interest and the rest of the community. Those people who hold this view contend further that the lasting development of the economy of our country can take place to the benefit of all the groups in our community in only one way, that is to say, by giving unlimited freedom to the private sector.</p>

<p>These bodies also contend that the Government&#x2019;s various forms of interference by way of legislation and regulations which hamper the activities of the private sector, as well as its direct participation in the rendering of necessary services to the public and the delivery of necessary materials to specific consumer groups, have systematically to be broken down. I feel that the time has come when the Government, and not only the Government but all of us, must adopt a very clear attitude in this regard and in respect of these accusations. It is only possible to succeed in combating properly the evils that we are seeking to combat, as manifested in the shortcomings in our economic system, in an atmosphere of collective responsibility and by the adoption of a joint point of view. I want to make it very clear that the Government has stated repeatedly that it has made its aim in the first place to protect the present economic system in our country which is fashioned on the last of the free operation of the marketing mechanism and the acknowledged functions of the system of private enterprise, against erosion by unfair State interference on the one hand and State restrictions on the other. If there are people in the private sector of our country who still really believe that the system of private enterprise is breaking down because of the so-called creeping socialism for which the Government is ostensibly co-responsible, those who regard themselves as the protagonists of the system of political democracy should after all try to draw an objective distinction between the position here and what is happening elsewhere. If they were to make an objective study of this matter, they would be convinced that conditions throughout the Western world are at present changing so swiftly and in such a radical manner, as all foreign experts have already admitted, that before long South Africa will be the only remaining bastion of the Western economic system. It may perhaps be important for these people to realize that in the interests of the promotion of our economic system which rests upon the principle of free enterprise, we have a duty to strip the system of the shortcomings which promote exploitation.</p>

<p>If we do not succeed in doing so and if the private sector is not prepared to discipline itself to a very large extent, they themselves will be the hangman of the system which we want to keep alive in our country. It is significant that some of these persons who are continually lashing out at unfair State interference in our economy and who at the same time defend the doctrine of unlimited freedom for the private entrepreneur, are in fact also members of those groups and organizations in the country which often in the past made it apparent by their actions that, when the opportunity presented itself, they were only too pleased to use that so-called freedom unrestrictedly, in the first place, to their own advantage and, in the second place, to exploit it for specific political gain. There are also persons and financial writers in our country who under the cloak of high-priestly financial objectivity, write about our system with completely different motives. They want to disguise their political motive because in fact they envisage a different political dispensation in South Africa by means of a change in our economic system. Although as I have repeatedly stated the Government has bound itself to maintaining our system, in view of its over-all responsibility in respect of the Government of the country it has a certain broad duty it may not ignore. On account of the country&#x2019;s involved population structure and our socio-economic political circumstances, this has resulted in the fact on the one hand that the Government has in the past had to make policy decisions which it still has to do and&#x2014;let me emphasize this fact&#x2014;intends to continue doing in the future, which from a purely financial and economic point of view can rightly be considered to be an interference with the freedom of the private enterprise system. The Government and I have to take these decisions because of our over-all responsibility on the basis of considerations which are in the broad national interest, and it is my intention to continue to make these decisions to an increasing extent.</p>

<p>I also intend taking steps particularly with a view to maintaining peace and order in our community. These are things which I regard as being indispensable, also because of the fact that our population structure is more defenceless against the shortcomings of this system <span class="col_4497-4498" refersTo="page_0931"/>than is the case in other countries with homogeneous population structures. I believe furthermore that hon. members will understand that the Government is compelled to ensure the provision of certain necessary services to the community as a whole and that it is also the duty of the Government to ensure that the supply of certain important material to particular consumer groups is undertaken and maintained.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this is that no private entrepreneur&#x2014;perhaps on account of financial or other problems&#x2014;is prepared or able to render those services. A further reason for this can be because the Government is of the opinion that in the broad national interest those services ought to be made available to the community on a non-profit basis. It can&#x2014;this I concede&#x2014;justifiably be contended that the action of the Government in regard to the methods to which I have referred, as well as the activities of the Government in the aforementioned spheres in our economy, place unfair curbs upon the freedom of the private enterprise system. The State may even be engaged in bringing about the downfall of those particular enterprise systems. However, Mr. Speaker, is that true&#x003F; I believe that precisely the opposite is true. I also believe that all hon. members accept the fact that it is the responsibility of the Government to interfere and, in fact, for the reason and in the way that I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to burden you with details in regard to all the shortcomings. I want to confine myself to the debate itself and I want to point out that all the hon. members&#x2014;although they may differ from us in regard to certain details of the Bill&#x2014;have adopted one important point of view in this House, a point of view by means of which they have given their approval to one of the standpoints to which I referred. What that standpoint amounts to is that the State has a duty and a responsibility to intervene in certain circumstances in the national economy. How ever, when the State does intervene in the way for which provision is being made in this Bill, or in any other way, it is accused from various quarters of showing increasing hostility towards the private enterprise system. When it so happens that I refer in speeches to the duty and the responsibility of the State in this specific respect, there are without fail some presidents or chairmen or organized commerce or industry who adopt a critical point of view in respect of the so-called danger of Government interference. Some of them even brand requests made by the Government as interference and even as a real danger.</p>

<p>When times become difficult it has become the custom to ask the State for assistance and, when the success of the assistance by the State becomes obvious, to intimate that the State should stop interfering in the economic system of the country.</p>

<p>There are other important matters that were raised during this debate, matters on which I should like to comment. Certain representatives of the private sector object when the Government interferes with the freedom of the capitalistic system and with the policy of commerce of the profit motive. Hon. members mentioned examples of the exploitation that takes place. However, I want to point out that their examples are not representative of commerce, industry and the private sector in its entirety. We as practical people know, however, that no person, no system and no organization is judged according to its 90% success but is in fact condemned on account of its 10% failure. That is why it is important, apart from what can be done by the State to protect the system against the weakness of the people in whose hands it is, for us to ensure that the private sector in its turn shoulders its responsibilities through the medium of codes of conduct and practice because of which it should be unnecessary for the Government to interfere. However, until this happens it is the duty of the State to do what I recommend.</p>

<p>Please allow me, Sir, to mention to you one example of a complaint that I received from a consumer. This particular consumer complained about a certain commodity. I had to trace the source of that commodity right down to the manufacturer. There I ascertained that the manufacturer had to manufacture that article&#x2014;after all the bargaining of the large purchasing bodies had been concluded&#x2014;for R4,25. Please note that he also had to put the labels on the articles. The selling price of that specific article in the shop was R9,85. After he had delivered the first consignment, the dealer asked him to remove the labels and to raise the selling price to R10,85 because, as the dealer put it, the article sold too quickly. Further investigation brought to light the fact that the same product was marked &#x201C;not for sale in South Africa&#x201D; and was offered for sale at R19 <span class="col_4499-4500" refersTo="page_0932"/>each. I simply mention this individual example. There are still many other examples to prove how the bargaining power of large distribution institutions is emphasized in respect of industry, an emphasis by means of which it is possible to as it were blackmail industry.</p>

<p>This is the way in which action is taken against the buyer and the prospective buyer. This results in my having to instruct my Department to investigate the particular industry and trade and this probably as a result of the actions of only one or two individuals who need not account to themselves for the advantages or the disadvantages which their actions hold for the community. This also means that I and my Department will have very seriously to consider whether the time has not come for the invoiced purchase price to be indicated on the article.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having said this, I also want to issue a warning against the over-emphasizing of the interests of specific groups as against those of other groups. I also want to emphasize the fact that it is important for us to adopt a definite standpoint in regard to matters of this nature. I have undertaken to consult the private sector when considering legislation or decisions of administrative policy affecting them. It is my intention to do so but only on the understanding that the private sector will respect the confidential position in this respect. If we cannot do otherwise, we will probably have to enable people to take decisions on the strength of information supplied to them through the medium of private negotiation. It will of course be to their own disadvantage if such negotiations are without result.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Constantia has referred to clause 9 of this Bill and indicated that it could be improved. I have already said that I would have a serious look at the matters which he has raised in this regard. I personally contend that the greatest weight of the Bill we are discussing at the moment lies not so much in its penal clauses, but much more in the preventative action it may lead to.</p>

<p>*I want to emphasize the fact that my approach in this specific connection is that we must apply preventive rather than punitive measures.</p>

<p>&#x2020;For this very reason the creation of an advisory committee representative of all the interests which are involved is, I believe, the crux of this Bill. I would like at this stage to give the undertaking that in the constitution of this committee and the appointment of members to this board, I shall make every effort and every endeavour to ensure that people of high standing in the private sector and in the Government sector are appointed.</p>

<p>Sir, naturally this Bill is not perfect. It is the product of human endeavour and obviously it cannot be perfect. But I have repeatedly said that when we implement Bills which have been accepted by this House and we find that there are omissions, we would naturally come back to fill those omissions, and even if we have to amend the legislation, contend that amending legislation is in fact not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. Therefore I have no hesitation whatsoever in coming back to amend Bills wherever that is required.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville quite correctly said that the important facets or aspects of this Bill relate to advertising and to the prohibition of advertisements in terms of clause 9. He has made the point that we have a duty to protect consumers. Let me say that we accept the responsibility of being the watchdogs of the rights of consumers, but I would suggest that short-term rights of consumers and the protection of those rights are sometimes incompatible with the long-term rights and demands of consumers. Let me say this quite openly. As there are abuses in the private sector, we would take measures to try to eradicate those abuses, but I want at the same time to warn against a general impression that it is possible for the State, in all aspects and in all circumstances, to protect consumers. It is not possible. I want to warn against another wrong impression, i.e. that price control as an instrument can avoid increase in prices. This is a fallacy. Let me say it in all fairness that sometimes that can be a subsidy on unproductivity because it is cost recovering. But, having said all this, I would also say that I appreciate the co-operation of all members in this particular regard for having assisted me in one aspect alone and that is to strengthen us in our attitude that we not only have the right, but also the responsibility to interfere when there are abuses in our economic situation.</p>

<p>Finally, the hon. member for Springs quite correctly referred to the activities of the S.A. Consumer Council, about the codes that are involved. It is my intention further to use the <span class="col_4501-4502" refersTo="page_0933"/>S.A. Consumer Council, because I believe that the constitution of that council and the way they carry out their functions can only be conducive to proper trade-consumer relationships. I want to stress this, that there should not be an over-accentuation of the rights of the one or the other. We should rather strive in this particular regard to build up relationships of trust between consumers and traders and producers. I believe all of us have a particular responsibility in this regard, because more often than not the temptation is very great to over-accentuate one aspect and to underaccentuate the other.</p>

<p>*In conclusion, in the application of this Act, we shall consequently try to reconcile the interests of people. I believe that the practical effect of this legislation will be not only to protect consumers but also to promote an understanding and a sound relationship between dealer, producer and consumer. Its value will lie in the fact that its preventive effects will be greater than its punitive effects.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is one of those pieces of legislation which the late Mr. Sauer would have described as &#x201C;an Act which has nothing in it&#x201D;. Purely administrative measures are being adopted here, with very little in them which is contentious, and I take it that I shall have the co-operation of this entire House in piloting this legislation through Parliament.</p>

<p>By way of introduction I should like to refer to announcements which I have already made in this House from time to time pertaining to an investigation made into specific aspects affecting the Public Service, also by way of comparison with the public services of other Western countries, and in particularly pertaining to the structure and functioning of the central staff institutions. The object of the investigation was, <i>inter alia,</i> to make it possible to determine whether the central staff institution in the South African Public Service is still functioning effectively under present circumstances or whether any adjustments ought to be made.</p>

<p>As I mentioned last year when the Public Service Commission Vote was being dealt with, the report that had been brought out in consequence of the investigation was still under consideration at that stage. The Cabinet has since decided, having regard to all the information at its disposal and after thorough consultation with the heads of departments, with the Public Service Joint Advisory Council and with the Public Service Association, that the Public Service Commission shall continue to exist in its present form as basis of the central staff institution for the South African Public Service.</p>

<p>In addition to aspects affecting the central staff institution as such, other important aspects pertaining to Public Service and staff administration emerged from the investigation, some of which may profitably be investigated for possible application in our Public Service. One example of this is the improvement of the existing classification system as a basis for, <i>inter alia,</i> an effective posts structure which will comply with present and future requirements. Considerable progress has already been made with this project. However, each of these particular matters is being followed up separately, and adjustments and legislation which may result from this, will receive attention as soon as some of the investigations are completed.</p>

<p>The Bill which is being dealt with makes provision for adjustments with regard to the Public Service Commission as a body while other amendments of the Act which have become necessary in the meantime, are also being proposed.</p>

<p>I now want to say a few words about the provision of the various clauses.</p>

<p>Clauses 1(a), (b) and (d), 2, 6(b) and 8:</p>

<p>These amendments stem from the provisions of the revised Exchequer and Audit Act, 1975,which came into operation on 1 April 1976.Firstly, they entail merely the amendment of certain definitions, and other terms, in order to effect an adjustment to those set out in that Act. Secondly, it is necessary to amplify <span class="col_4503-4504" refersTo="page_0934"/>the definition of &#x201C;head of department&#x201D;, &#x201C;head of a department&#x201D; or &#x201C;head of the department&#x201D; to include the Auditor-General as well&#x2014;who prior to 1 April 1976 was called the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2014;as head of the Department of the (Controller and) Auditor-General, referred to in the first schedule to the Public Service Act. The Auditor-General holds a statutory post, but in terms of the provisions of section 41(3) of the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1975, he is deemed to be the head of the said department. Clause 1(a) covers this aspect. Furthermore, it is necessary to include the Auditor-General among the persons who are not members of the Public Service, for example Ministers, members of the Public Service Commission, etc. who also occupy statutory positions. The amendment of section 3(6) of the Act, which is dealt with in clause 2, makes provision for this.</p>

<p>Clauses 1(c) and 10:</p>

<p>During the course of the investigation to which I referred earlier, it was found in other countries that the central staff institutions play an important role and that recognition is accorded to that role in that, <i>inter alia,</i> the institutions occupy a position in the government structure which is in close proximity to the seat of authority. With one exception all the institutions which were studied abroad, occupy a position on the highest level of the executive, namely under the Prime Minister, President or Governor, as the case may be.</p>

<p>In this country the role of the Public Service Commission as a central staff institution is equally important, particularly owing to our peculiar structure and the chronic manpower shortage. Specific problems arise in the allocation of the available staff and means and the maintenance of the necessary equilibrium between the various departments, having regard to the particular needs of each, but always in the betst interests of the Public Service as a whole and the best interests of our country. The Public Service Commission also has an important role to play in respect of co-ordination in general. The question of control and/or authority is specifically relevant to these various aspects, and the Public Service Commission is by its nature a controlling body as well. However, control cannot be exercised without authority and after the investigation it was concluded that the Public Service Commission as body should be vested with the necessary authority and status to enable it to carry out its statutory functions properly. Arising out of this the Government accepted as policy, <i>inter alia,</i> that in future appointments to the Public Service Commission shall preferably be made from among heads of departments.</p>

<p>In view of these circumstances provision is therefore being made for the Public Service Commission to be brought under the Prime Minister, instead of under the Minister of the Interior. Provision for this is being made in clause 1(c).</p>

<p>In practice such an arrangement will undoubtedly place a considerable additional burden on the Prime Minister, and it will be necessary to impose upon and entrust to another Minister certain duties or functions which are being imposed upon or entrusted to the Prime Minister as a result of this readjustment. However, section 10(4) of the Interpretation Act, 1957, already makes provision for the assignment of such duties or functions to another Minister by the State President. This ought to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Clause 10 contains a consequential amendment in the above-mention context, as well as a consequential amendment arising out of the proposed omission of section 7(7) which will be dealt with presently.</p>

<p>Clauses 3 and 4(a):</p>

<block name="quote">These clauses deal with amendments relating to the constitution, periods of office and conditions of service of the Public Service Commission and its members, respectively, and the minimum number of members who may make recommendations and give directions.</block>

<p>Firstly, the reference to section 142 of the &#x201C;South Africa Act, 1909&#x201D; is being deleted since said section has in the meantime been repealed&#x2014;clause 3(a).</p>

<p>Secondly, provision is being made for the Public Service Commission, from a date determined by the State President by proclamation, to be able to consist of three instead of a minimum of three and a maximum of five members. After suitable provision had been made in the Public Service Act during 1968 the commission delegated several of its powers, <i>inter alia,</i> to officers in departments. These delegations have since that time been <span class="col_4505-4506" refersTo="page_0935"/>considerably expanded, and at present departments have powers enabling them to dispose rapidly of a variety and a considerable volume of staff matters themselves. It also affords them a prominent part in the staff management function. The principle of greater managerial independence for departments has already been accepted, and further powers may be assigned to them as proper norms are determined and comprehensive directions established. The delegation of powers to departments has resulted in the volume of matters flowing to the commission diminishing considerably, and this volume will continue to diminish even further. Consequently it is thought, after having in practice functioned in this way for a few years, that a commission consisting of three members will be able to cope with its prescribed functions effectively. Clause 3(b) proposes the necessary amendment in this regard. An amendment to amend this clause will be moved during the Committee Stage in order to limit the commission to three members and to eliminate the possibility of four members being appointed.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is the position that the office of vice-chairman of the commission was abolished with effect from 1 May 1975 in terms of the Public Service Amendment Act, 1975. The provisions to which reference is made in clause 3(c) and which pertain to this office, are consequently obsolete and may therefore be deleted, while the amendment in this regard contained in clause 3(f) is self-explanatory. Arising out of this it is being provided in clause 3(d) that, during the absence of the chairman&#x2014;and because there is no longer a vice-chairman&#x2014;the senior member of the commission may act as chairman. In terms of the existing provision the State President shall designate a member to act in this capacity during the absence of the chairman. However, this procedure is very cumbersome in that the State President has to be burdened with the designation of a chairman every time the chairman is absent&#x2014;hence the proposed amendment.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the period of office of members of the commission is being dealt with. I am referring to clause 3(e). Before the commencement of the Public Service Amendment Act, 1975, section 4(4) of the Act provided that a member of the commission be appointed for a period of five years and that he could be re-appointed upon expiry of his period of office. The present provisions, in terms of which the duration of a member&#x2019;s period of office shall be determined by the State President, sought primarily, pending the investigation into the continued existence of the commission, to enable the Government to fill vacancies in the commission for short periods of time. Now that the Government has decided on the continued existence of the commission, the necessity for the existing provision falls away. It is not conducive to stability and continuity that members of the commission should be changed too frequently while appointment for a relatively short time creates uncertainty in those who are appointed. It is consequently being deemed necessary to reenact the previous provision, viz. that of periods of office for five years. Adequate provision exists for dismissing a member or discharging him from his office if such a step should become necessary.</p>

<p>Fifthly, it is necessary to improve the wording of section 4(6) of the Act&#x2014;clause 3(g). The expression &#x201C;cost of living&#x201D; allowance is obsolete as such allowances have not been payable since as long ago as 1958. The words &#x201C;re-imbursive and other allowances&#x201D; and &#x201C;conditions of service&#x201D;, respectively, are either adequate or more comprehensive. Although members of the commission enjoy the same benefits as heads of departments, the Act is not specific enough in this regard and consequently it is necessary to substitute the words &#x201C;heads of departments&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;officers&#x201D;. No new principle is involved here.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a consequential amendment of section 5(1) is necessary in regard to the minimum number of members of the commission who may make recommendations or give directions. The deletion of the portion of the said section as indicated in clause 4(a) of the Bill, follows on the amendment with regard to the number if members of the commission which was dealt with earlier. However, it is also necessary, arising out of the proposed amendment in respect of clause 3(b) in this regard, which has already been dealt with, to propose an amendment in respect of the clause under discussion&#x2014;clause 4(a)&#x2014;to the effect that the words &#x201C;of whom one is the chairman or acting chairman of the commission&#x201D; be deleted. This provision is now entirely unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="col_4507-4508" refersTo="page_0936"/>Clause 4(b):</p>

<p>In terms of the regulations referred to in section 5(3), the commission has the power at the time to make recommendations in respect of the annuities payable to members of the Services upon discharge owing to misconduct. This power has already been removed in terms of the Government Service Pension Act, 1973, and the reference to the regulations concerned may therefore be deleted.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

<p>The commission has the power to make recommendations or give directions on, <i>inter alia</i>, the matters referred to in the relevant section&#x2014;6(1)(b). According to legal opinions the commission does not, however, have powers of recommendation or direction in respect of officers or employees who have already left the service. This restriction has produced considerable problems in the past because persons, owing to delays in the submission of cases to the commission, sometimes had to forfeit benefits for which they qualified prior to termination of service because it was not possible to obtain the commission&#x2019;s recommendation or direction in time before their retirement from service. The proposed amendment seeks to eliminate this unsatisfactory state of affairs. However, to prevent persons who have been retired from the service for several years being able to lay claim to certain privileges or treatment, a time limit is being added in respect of cases of the present nature, viz. a period of two years.</p>

<p>Clause 6(a):</p>

<p>Although section 7(1) of the Act provides that a recommendation of the Commission relating to a particular person shall be carried out subject to certain directions, there is no such provision in respect of recommendations relating to matters of a general nature such as organizational changes, the creation, grading and conversion of posts, the determination of conditions of service, etc. The result was that the commission&#x2019;s recommendations in respect of said matters could be ignored. This situation is not conducive to sound administration, while it is a contributory factor in detracting from the status and authority of the commission and hampers the carrying out by the commission of its functions and responsibilities entrusted to it by law. Owing to its expertise and its position as an umbrella body, the commission is best equipped to decide on matters of this nature, always taking into consideration, however, the policy, the particular needs of departments, the interests of the Public Service as a whole and the availability of funds. Consequently it is considered necessary for the Act to be suitably amended to provide that, as in the case of recommendations in respect of particular persons, the recommendations of the commission relating to other matters to which the Act has empowered it to make recommendations on shall also be carried out if approval is granted for the expenditure involved, in the cases to which this is applicable. As in the case of the former kinds of recommendations, however, the door is left open to negotiations if such a recommendation should be unacceptable to a department or should create specific problems for that department and a period of six calendar months is being allowed for this purpose.</p>

<p>Clause 6(c):</p>

<p>This clause contains a consequential amendment arising out of the preceding amendment. However, it has become apparent since the drafting of the Bill that since subsection 4(4) is not applicable to the newly-inserted section 1A, the contemplated amendment of said subsection falls away, and this clause may therefore be deleted. An amendment in this connection will be moved during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Clause 6(d):</p>

<p>The portion which is being inserted in section 7(5) of the English text was originally omitted owing to an oversight when the Public Service Act was drafted, and is here being rectified.</p>

<p>Clause 6(e):</p>

<p>Section 7(7), the deletion of which is now being proposed, provides that if the State President is unable or unwilling to adopt, or reject or varies, a recommendation of the commission made in accordance with law, the commission shall report the matter fully to Parliament either by means of a special report <span class="col_4509-4510" refersTo="page_0937"/>or in its annual report. The rejection by the State President of recommendations of the commission usually has considerable news value and is frequently seized upon to cast suspicion on the integrity of the Government. In the process serious harm is done to the image of the Public Service while the person who is involved in the matter, and who had no part in it, becomes the focus of publicity which presents him in a poor light and places him in an embarrassing position. Consequently it is considered essential that the relevant subsection be deleted. The commission will still be able to report cases of such a nature in its annual report, but this may be done according to discretion. The existing provision, on the other hand, is imperative, and is considered undesirable.</p>

<p>Clause 7(a):</p>

<p>This amendment seeks to make the provisions of section 14(6), which deal with the discharge of officers, applicable to officers of the Bureau for State Security as well. The latter officers are at present excluded from these provisions. The amendment is being effected at the request of the Bureau with the concurrence of the Minister responsible for the Bureau, viz. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Clause 7(b):</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of section 14(7) of the Act a female officer who marries shall be deemed to have retired voluntarily from the Public Service unless the commission recommends and the Minister or Administrator approves that she be retained in service. Owing to the manpower situation it has in recent years become essential to retain in service after their marriages, in a permanent capacity, an increasing number of female staff members. Such staff members usually have experience which is of great value to the Public Service. The provisions concerned are, under the present circumstances, obsolete and may therefore be deleted to good effect. It is realized that it will be necessary to guard against married women keeping unemployed unmarried women from appointments. An eye will, however, be kept on the position, and appropriate steps will be taken to prevent such a situation. I accept the hon. member for Houghton in particular will welcome this clause.</p>

<p>Clause 9:</p>

<p>In terms of this clause the existing provisions of section 24 of the Act are being revised in their entirety. Firstly, the requirement that the performance by an officer of remunerative work outside his employment in the Public Service is subject to the recommendations of the commission is also being extended to employees. The commission has already delegated its power to make recommendations in respect of this matter to departments. Complete directions have been issued in terms of which applications by officers and employees to perform remunerative work outside their employment in the Public Service have to be considered by departments, and these will ensure uniform action. Secondly, the application of the existing section 24(3) and 24(4) produces considerable problems in practice because the provisions of these sections are to a great extent in conformity with one another. Thirdly, it is necessary to amend the existing procedure with regard to the recovery of moneys or allowances received by an officer or employee in regard to the performance of his employment, but in some other manner than in accordance with the provisions of the Act or a recommendation of the commission.</p>

<p>In terms of the existing provisions the duty of recovering such moneys or allowances have been conferred upon the Treasury. However, the Public Service regulations provide that a head of department is responsible for the effective management and administration of his department and therefore he should also be responsible for the recovery of such moneys and allowances. I think this is a sound principle. There is no good reason why judicial or other steps in this regard should in fact be taken by the Treasury. The Act is definite on the point that steps shall be taken. It allows a discretion only in respect of what steps shall be taken. However, when the officer against whom steps have to be taken is a head of department, the duty of recovery may still in fact be entrusted to the Treasury&#x2014;as the amendment consequently proposes. As the statutory provision reads at present, it is in any event in practice, the head of department, who causes the matter to be investigated and who takes action up to the point at which judicial proceedings have to be instituted. The Treasury is simply called upon then to act as principal to the State Attorney. <span class="col_4511-4512" refersTo="page_0938"/>From the nature of the case the head of department concerned is in a better position to carry out this duty as well. If such moneys were recovered in a manner other than by judicial steps, the Treasury will request the head of department, as accounting officer, to do so in any case. Furthermore, it will be observed that the statutory provisions are being expanded to include, besides moneys and allowances, rewards of any kind as well, and to effect general improvements to the measures.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was somewhat surprised that the hon. the Minister should have commenced by saying that this Bill had really nothing of any importance in it. I would have thought that even the mere fact that the obligation of women to have their employment terminated on marriage was being removed would have been sufficient cause to say that this Bill contained very important provisions.</p>

<p>I did not say there was nothing of importance. I said there was nothing contentious.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>If he says there is nothing contentious, then I have a surprise for him. In the main I agree that it is not contentious, but in one particular aspect I shall have something to say a little later. If the hon. the Minister means there is nothing of real importance in general in this Bill, I must disagree with him again because we have been waiting for many years for the outcome of the various investigations which have been done in detail by the Public Service Commission as to its status and functioning in the best interests of the Public Service in South Africa. We accept that a considerable amount of the content of this Bill is consequential on other legislation which has been approved by the House, regarding changes in titles, words and nomenclature. However, at the same time there are provisions which amend the existing Act for other reasons which have been outlined by the hon. the Minister this afternoon. I want to refer briefly to some of these amendments and to indicate the views which we on this side of the House hold in regard to certain of these amendments.</p>

<p>We agree with and accept the placing of the commission under the control of the hon. the Prime Minister, following upon what has been adopted in other countries of the world, as the hon. the Minister has indicated. This is a wise step that has been taken. In passing, we also agree with the consequent placing of the members, the staff and the officials of the Bureau for State Security within the Public Service. I am sure they will benefit in so far as their conditions of employment are concerned. This is a regularizing step of which we approve. We also accept and welcome the amendments which deal with the position of the Auditor-General. He holds a special statutory appointment. He is not a member of the permanent establishment of the Public Service. For administrative purposes it is correct that he should be included, with the status of a head of a department, to deal with his own departmental officials in the area over which he holds jurisdiction. Equally important is the fact that because of his authority and status, and the obligations he has to comply with in terms of his statutory appointment, he should be excluded personally from the provisions of the Public Service Act, as is now being done in terms of the Bill before us. He can therefore have the same status of independence from Public Service control which is afforded to Ministers, administrators and judges at the present time. We also support the amendments relating to the composition and procedures of the Public Service Commission. I also accept, on the basis of the deep-probing research that has been done by the commission over a period of time, the fixed term of appointment of five years, the reduction in the number of members&#x2014;this, of course, implies more streamlined control&#x2014;and the imposition of time limits as far as the finalization of recommendations is concerned. This, I believe, is necessary. There are occasions when the commission might recommend to a head of a department that certain steps should be taken within that department with regard to reorganization, and one knows that if the head of the department does not want to carry out those recommendations he can make counter&#x002D;recommendations interminably, leading over a long period of time to the frustration of the <span class="col_4513-4514" refersTo="page_0939"/>reorganization recommended by the commission. One appreciates that the introduction of a time limit will put an end to such procedures.</p>

<p>The next point I want to refer to relates to the provisions of clause 5. As the hon. the Minister has pointed out, these provisions will avoid the injustices which have occurred as far as former officers of the Public Service are concerned. Members who have retired, because they are ex-members of the Service, have hitherto not been able to receive benefits subsequently approved and applying to the period when they were in the employ of the State. I also believe that that is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the acceptability of this Bill is diminished by the provisions of clause 10. This clause removes the need for the commission&#x2019;s report to contain particulars of the recommendations of the commission not accepted by the Cabinet. The hon. the Minister said that publication would lead to argument and publicity and would give forage to the news media, but I cannot accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reasons to justify the removal of this particular provision that exists in the Act at the present moment. The commission has a dual function. It is not merely there as a tool of the Government. It is also there as a watchdog over the interests of public servants. It has this dual approach, and if the commission makes a recommendation to the State President, which is of course the Cabinet, it makes that recommendation with due regard to its dual responsibilities towards the interests of the Government and the interests of the public servants themselves. It is therefore absolutely essential, where there is a difference of opinion between the Cabinet and the commission, that the public servants should be made aware of that difference of opinion because public servants, after all, are at every congress of the Public Servants&#x2019; Association and they make recommendations on various matters concerning their terms and conditions of employment, age of retirement, etc. Those recommendations are invariably referred to the Public Service Commission in so far as they deal with employment conditions. The public servants are therefore certainly entitled to know what the opinion of the Public Service Commission is, but if we pass the amendment to this Bill, public servants will only become aware of the recommendations of the commission which have the blessing of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>I believe that is wrong. It can lead, on the part of public servants, to a loss of confidence in the commission if they believe that certain matters have not been attended to, when in fact the commission has made reports to the Cabinet which the Cabinet has rejected. The public servants would have no knowledge of these rejections. I also realize that if the commission&#x2019;s report publishes only those recommendations accepted by the Cabinet, it will seem as if the Cabinet is composed of reasonable gentlemen who never refuse anything, which would, of course, also be misleading to public servants. In the Committee Stage we shall definitely deal with this matter in more detail, but I want the hon. the Minister to give this matter some thought because of the dual responsibility, as I see it, of the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>I now also want to deal with two amendments that I believe are of some importance. I firstly want to deal with the deletion of the requirement that married women should automatically retire. This amendment is welcomed, in particular because it will now enable women to follow a career in the Public Service. One must recognize, of course, that there will be those breaks in service which are necessary as a result of those functions which are exclusive to women and which they may wish to undertake after marriage while they are still in the Service. Family-building, I am glad to say, is a temporary matter which is catered for in the Service and which need not necessarily mean the termination of a career in the Service. One does, however, regret that the hon. the Minister is introducing this measure at a time when his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, announced that he is not going to allow women that other benefit of separate tax assessment. That rather takes the gilt off the ginger-bread as far as the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposals this afternoon are concerned. I believe that South Africa has the distinction of being almost the last country in the Western world with this provision. I think there are only two other countries that still have the provision of compulsory resignation or termination of employment upon marriage.</p>

<p>As I have said, I think this Bill gives effect to a long period of research by the Public Service Commission, and I hope it will lead to a real increase in productivity in the Public Service. I believe that these provisions will, in fact, lead to increased productivity as a <span class="col_4515-4516" refersTo="page_0940"/>contribution to the anti-inflation campaign, since the Government is a signatory to the anti-inflation manifesto. There is a big job to be done, but unfortunately the Public Service seems to have been having some problems in this regard. I think we all agree in this House that heads of departments and members in the senior echelons of the Public Service, persons who render a very high standard of service to the State, are unfortunately very heavily overloaded with responsibility.</p>

<p>The recently tabled report of the commission has drawn attention to the alarmingly large subordinate staff turnover in the Public Service. I refer particularly to the reported turnover of more than 50% in the Public Service. For example, only 21 % of the posts of the Department of Justice and 51 % of the posts in the technical division are suitably filled. New staff and frequent changes in persons filling certain posts, I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree, must affect productivity. In fact, in its report the commission states that this turnover results in a large proportion of the staff lacking in experience and background. It results in the necessity for what one might term &#x201C;in-service training&#x201D; in the Civil Service to achieve the desired productivity. Even in that respect, as the commission has pointed out, the position is aggrevated by a 33% shortage of work study officers. Perhaps this is not the time for me to go into any further details on this matter. It can be discussed in depth under the Vote. I shall certainly make use of a later opportunity to do so. At the moment I merely wish to draw attention to the situation which has been reported upon, the effect of that situation on productivity and the need for the commission to be re-structured and to give priority attention to this problem which is now being provided for in this Bill.</p>

<p>I am also pleased to note that another matter which is receiving the attention of the commission is the employment of non-Whites in the Public Service. The number of non-Whites that are employed has increased considerably, as recent figures indicate. The number of non-Whites in the Public Service has increased from 4 154 in 1973 to 11 978 in 1975, an increase of 7 824 against an increase of only 1 671 in the number of Whites that are employed. Yet, to my mind, the use of non-Whites has not sufficiently permeated the service to meet the shortages in what are termed the technical and professional divisions of the Public Service. The position in respect of White education posts, for instance, has remained static while the number of non-Whites in this field has increased enormously. In a matter of five years the number has increased from 25 363 to 35 732, an increase of 10 369 non-White teaching posts in the Public Service. One would welcome a similar development in the professional and technical divisions. I was pleased to note that the Minister was at least moving in that direction, as he indicated in the statement he issued recently in regard to a standardized scale of pay. The idea is to offer these people a suitable notch on the scale in order to attract them into the service. It also creates the machinery for the equalization of pay in respect of people who are doing equal jobs, carrying equal responsibility and providing equal services. Whether the standardized salary scale is going to prove effective or not, will be seen in the future. In any case, as I have indicated, we shall support the Bill at the Second Reading and shall deal more fully with the one aspect I mentioned in the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the remarks which the hon. member for Green Point made this afternoon. We agree on one thing, and this is that the provisions of this Bill which is before the House, aim at advancing the best interests of the service and can only result in our getting a greater degree of streamlining, effectiveness and security in respect of the commission and its functions in general. There are one or two aspects in respect of which the hon. member differs from us, and I shall deal with those aspects during the course of my speech. I actually want to refer to two clauses in this Bill. The first is clause 5, which provides that the commission may make recommendations and issue instructions in order to rectify matters after persons have already retired from the service. I think that this clause will be welcomed everywhere in the service, because in this way an official will receive the benefit due to him. The fact that the limitation of a period of two years after retirement is imposed on this, also ensures a greater degree of security in this connection. It is a fair and just provision and I think that it will be welcomed everywhere.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to clause 6(a). This deals <span class="col_4517-4518" refersTo="page_0941"/>with recommendations of the commission which do not pertain to a particular person, but which envisage matters affecting the organization of the service such as the creation, varying and grading of positions. It provides for a compulsory application of this within a period of six months. This ensures that there is the opportunity to negotiate within the service. The existing situation could result in large-scale wasting of the State&#x2019;s money if it were not changed. As the saying goes: &#x201C;Unknown, unloved&#x201D;. It sometimes happens that the commission makes recommendations with regard to changing of the organization, etc., and because it is something unusual, it is not readily accepted. Therefore the opportunity is hereby being created to finalize matters, and as I said, to negotiate and therefore prevent matters being left suspended in mid-air. The commission can inspect a department not only to ascertain whether its recommendation has been carried out, but also to see how the recommendation works in practice and what its results are. As the hon. the Minister correctly said in his speech, in the absence of a provision like this the commission&#x2019;s authority and status may be seriously threatened. Good administration and effectiveness, too, are handicapped by this. The expertise of the commission and its position as an umbrella body, which make it particularly well-equipped to decide on such matters, apart from its statutory duty to take decisions in this connection, must therefore be utilized, and are fully utilized in this way. If this were not the case, it would result in undermining of its status. The commission&#x2019;s recommendations in this regard must be carried out. This provision can only lead to security and as a result promote greater efficiency in the Public Service.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to refer to clause 6(e). The hon. member for Green Point differs from us on that. It concerns the deletion of section 7(7) of the principal Act. Let us look at what section 7(7) says. This subsection reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the State President is unable or unwilling to adopt, or rejects or varies, a recommendation of the Commission made in accordance with law, the Commission shall report the matter fully to Parliament either by means of a special report or in its annual report.</block>

<p>The key words in this subsection are &#x201C;shall&#x201D; and &#x201C;fully&#x201D;. In terms of this subsection, therefore, the commission is forced to make a full report concerning the two standpoints of the two bodies. This is the point at issue. On the one hand there is the standpoint of the commission, and on the other, the standpoint of the executive. It is obvious, after all, that the Cabinet will differ from the commission from time to time, and may do so in many fields. The Cabinet may have many reasons for choosing another person in preference to the person recommended by the Public Service Commission. Let me mention only three such reasons. Firstly, there may be political reasons. It may happen that a particular Government might come into power which has a particular policy which it wants to carry out through a particular department because it has committed itself to that policy as far as the voters are concerned. It would therefore not benefit the Government to have a person at a head of a department who was not favourably disposed towards that policy. I think that a good example from our history in this connection is the case of the appointment of Dr. Eiselen in approximately 1950 as the Secretary of the former Department of Native Affairs. This is a very good example. A second possible reason is that there may be a change in the presentation of the functions of a specific department. The executive may want a shift of emphasis as to the manner in which the department sees its task and carries it out. Since in such a case the executive will want to prevent specific new ideas, it may want to do so by way of a particular well-equipped person and not by way of a person nominated by the commission.</p>

<p>A third possible reason is the usual case where the Cabinet on the one hand and the Public Service Commission on the other hand differ from one another merely on the merits of the person concerned; in other words, on the particular suitableness or competence of the person concerned to carry out the particular task of the head of the department in that case. Whichever of the three categories we are dealing with, in the final instance it remains a choice between two persons. It means that these two bodies must present their reasons for their own choice, and if one gives one&#x2019;s reasons for choosing a particular person, this necessarily also includes the negative, among other things&#x2014;in other words, the reasons why <span class="col_4519-4520" refersTo="page_0942"/>the other person is not acceptable. As soon as one does that, one acts to the detriment of the other man. Then there is a conflict. There will be a conflict in this connection, because as I said, it is basically a choice between two persons. Nothing incorrect happened here; the Cabinet differs from the commission and the commission differs from the Cabinet and no one has acted incorrectly. No one acted illegally. The commission has the right to act&#x2014;and it did in fact do so&#x2014;and to nominate a person of its choice according to the provisions of the Act, and the Cabinet has the right to make its choice if it differs from the commission. No one is acting unlawfully. There is nothing sinister in a difference of this kind between the Cabinet on the one hand and the commission on the other. Each of these bodies is acting within its rights. The only point is that they differ. Why, because they differ, must this be broadcast&#x003F; People only get hurt in the process. That is all that happens. Now we must remember that in a case like this we are dealing with two excellent officials. It cannot be otherwise, because if a man is recommended by the commission for one of the highest positions in the Public Service, he is a competent official. They are therefore two competent and senior people. Both are innocent in this whole affair.</p>

<p>However, one of the two must get the position. This is the important point. If he obtains the position&#x2014;whoever he may be&#x2014;he has to live and work together with his department, his officials, his Minister and the public afterwards. What happens in practice under section 7(7) of the Act as it reads at present&#x003F; We had a good example in the annual report of the Public Service Commission for the year 1972-&#x2019;73. In that year, in accordance with section 7(7), the commission reported on the appointment of the present departmental head of the Department of Information. I do not want to dig up history again at this point. If one reads that report, one will see that on the one hand the standpoint of the commission is given as to why they recommended Mr. X as departmental head, and on the other hand the standpoint of the Cabinet as to why, in their opinion, the present Secretary of Information should have been appointed. In the process, what this amounted to was that the qualifications and abilities of the one were weighed up against those of the other to the disadvantage of both. Neither of the two came through the process unscathed. I have the details before me but I do not want to go into the details because it is unnecessary. Now I ask whether it is necessary to make public such details about people. The hon. member for Green Point said that the commission had a double aim; it must see to the interests of the officials and the interests of the State. It does so. He adds that the officials want to know what the standpoint and the opinion of the Public Service Commission is. I shall deal with that in a moment. As the hon. the Minister pointed out, the rejection of the recommendations of the commission is usually newsworthy, too, and this is seized on by the news media, that is, the newspapers, to get at the Government so as to injure the Government&#x2019;s dignity and try to make political capital out of the situation. In the process the image of the person who is the Government&#x2019;s choice, is often criticized with the aim of showing what a bad choice the Government has supposedly made, and that such a person is only the lackey of the Minister concerned or of the political party which forms the government of the day. I must say in all fairness that this is not fair. That man is an innocent party in the &#x2022;whole issue and in the whole dispute. He has not asked for this. The whole image, not only of the Government or the Cabinet, but of the Public Service as an institution, is harmed in this way. Now it must be remembered&#x2014;and this is my answer to the standpoint of the hon. member for Green Point&#x2014;that the Public Service Commission still has to make a report every year in terms of the provisions of section 6(2)(n) of the Act.</p>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>No, it has nothing to do with section 7(7). When it comes to section 7(7), the commission once again gives both standpoints in full. For instance, <span class="col_4521-4522" refersTo="page_0943"/>this is what we had in the annual report of 1972-&#x2019;73. Let us now look at the annual report of 1973-&#x2019;74. I think that the hon. member for Green Point referred to this report last year when the position of the hon. the Minister was being discussed. The commission then reported as follows. One of the recommendations which was turned down by the Cabinet during the year of the report, was the following (page 20 of the 1973-&#x2019;74 report)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission had made proposals to the Cabinet in regard to the regrouping of the functions of the Departments of Community Development, Public Works and Planning and the Environment. These proposals would, in the commission&#x2019;s opinion, have brought about greater efficiency and considerable savings in manpower, accommodation and departmental auxiliary services. The Cabinet, however, indicated that the functions of the Department of Community Development should remain unchanged. The commission&#x2019;s proposals in regard to the other two departments have consequently also not been accepted.</block>

<p>No full particulars are given here. The fact that there was a difference is reported. This is being done. In this year&#x2019;s annual report, that is, for 1974-&#x2019;75, from the Public Service Commission, we once again have paragraphs&#x2014;I am referring to page 30 of the report&#x2014;which deal with cases of the commission and the Cabinet differing from one another. The issue here was the question of retirement ages and retirement of staff. The group with the choice of retiring with a pension at any age above 60 was being considered. Now I want to refer to page 32 of the report, para. 100. Here the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the abovementioned problems, the Commission undertook a thorough investigation into the whole question of retirement ages and retirement. In this investigation, the following interested parties were consulted and asked to comment on possible measures:</block>

<p>After that the three parties they consulted, are mentioned. I quote further from the report on page 32, para. 101, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The conclusions arrived at after the investigation was that retirement based on the following principles would be the most acceptable to the State as employer and to officials:</block>

<p>Then four principles are set out which were recommended by the commission. In other words, the commission stated its side of the matter fully. The Cabinet&#x2019;s standpoint, however, is not stated. One only has a single paragraph, and in my opinion this is completely correct. All it says is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission&#x2019;s recommendation that the principles outlined in the preceding paragraph be accepted was turned down by the Cabinet.</block>

<p>No detail or particulars of the Cabinet&#x2019;s standpoint appear and I think that this is correct. The Cabinet can speak for itself. The commission does not have to report on behalf of the Cabinet here. A member of the Cabinet can report to any hon. member across the floor of the House or in the privacy of his office, if necessary. I think that in this particular case, where the issue is usually the balancing of the interests of two persons, the clause we are accepting here is a sound and desirable clause. The commission regularly reports on recommendations which it has made and in respect of which the Cabinet differs from it. That right of Parliament is not being taken away. However, the difference is that the commission has a discretion in the report. Parliament&#x2019;s right to know is not taken away by this. I understand that the commission itself is in favour of the deletion of subsection (7).</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying this: There is a positive side to the matter. The deletion of subsection (7) may lead to greater openness in the interests of good administration. The fact that a full report must be made, may result in the commission hesitating to mention facts or particulars concerning a certain person precisely because a full report would have to be made and a full report can be very detrimental to one&#x2019;s interests. Mr. Speaker, I believe that the commission and the Cabinet, which are both extremely responsible bodies and must act as such, are competent enough to settle a matter like this between themselves without broadcasting it. In the process people are <span class="col_4523-4524" refersTo="page_0944"/>mercilessly, unnecessarily and unfairly crushed between these two millstones, and I believe, therefore, that no one can be placed at a disadvantage by the deletion of subsection (7). This can only contain advantages, and therefore we wholeheartedly support this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I will react to some of the comments made by the hon. member for Koedoespoort in a few moments but at the outset I would like to react generally to the Bill. We have no objections in principle to the Bill at all. There are one or two main features on which I would like to comment, starting in particular with clause 1, the definitions clause, in terms of which the Prime Minister is substituted for the Minister of the Interior in matters relating to the Public Service Commission. As I understand the position and as the Minister has said, this development is in line with the modernization of many Civil Service establishments throughout the world where there is a growing tendency to have a central personnel institution governing the structure of the Civil Service and where that central personnel institution is in most cases in the hands of the Prime Minister or of the head of State. This is very necessary, Sir, because of the very function of this body. This is an independent body, separate from the Civil Service. It deals with the problems of the staff of all departments, and in many cases the Public Service Commission is the arbiter as to conflicting demands and requirements of different departments. Theoretically and I suppose even in practice, this could place a Minister, who is an ordinary member of the Cabinet, in a difficult position from time to time when conflicting demands arise from various departments. I therefore feel that this move is justified and I think that by placing the Public Service Commission under the aegis of the office of the Prime Minister, a greater status is given to the commission itself, and I should think that it would give the chairman of the Public Service Commission direct access to the Prime Minister in matters of concern, so I think that this amendment cannot be faulted.</p>

<p>With regard to clause 3, in terms of which it was proposed that the number of commissioners be reduced to four and not less than three&#x2014;I see now that an amendment is to be moved by the hon. the Minister. My attitude is slightly different from that of the hon. member for Green Point. I may say that I welcome the amendment which the hon. the Minister of the Interior has placed before us this afternoon. I think it is far better to have flexibility as far as the number is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry; then I misread the amendment and then I find the amendment worse than the provisions of the Bill. I am not happy about that amendment at all. Let me say that I understand the reason for this amendment. I realize that it is the policy to delegate more powers than hitherto to the departments. I realize that the departments have themselves been allocated work study groups and that as a result of this there is possibly according to the thinking of the hon. the Minister less work for the commission.</p>

<p>But as you know, Sir, the Civil Service is in fact facing very serious problems. The Civil Service, in terms of the report for last year which is before us&#x2014;and I see that the figures in the budget estimates are even higher&#x2014;had an establishment of some 157 000 people as at the end of last year. The establishment over the years has shown an increase of roughly 5% per annum, and yet it has also been revealed&#x2014;and this is one of the reasons why I am not happy about this section&#x2014;that there is a turnover and has been a turnover over the last three years of over 50% in the Public Service itself. The losses, according to the report, amounted to 54% and the gains to 52%, so while the establishment grows the staff complement actually appears to be shrinking. On page 13 of the report of the Public Service Commission for 1974-&#x2019;75 it is stated in paragraph 40&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general situation as far as staff in the Public Service is concerned is giving cause for concern.</block>

<p>It then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4525-4526" refersTo="page_0945"/>Staff losses amounted to 54,98% while gains amounted to some 52,20%. This represents a considerable deterioration in the staff position and illustrates the difficulties that the Public Service has in keeping its staff. The result of this high turnover is that a large proportion of the staff are greatly lacking in experience and background, besides which training costs are pushed up to an unacceptable level and productivity is detrimentally affected.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to say that alarm is not only centred on the personnel of the Public Service; alarm has been expressed by various sectors of the community, and in this connection I should like to quote from the editorial of <i>Rapport</i> of 29 February 1976&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die huidige personeeltekort in die Staatsdiens bied moontlik net die regte geleentheid om weer &#x2019;n slag ingrypend na die organisasie te kyk. Daar is kommer oor die geweldige personeelomset, die manier waarop mense uit die Staatsdiens na die private sektor gelok word deur diensvoorwaardes en die gevolglike probleem om met &#x2019;n onervare personeel &#x2019;n goeie diens te lewer.</block>

<p>The editorial then goes on; it is in fact a long editorial. I see evidence of a certain amount of impatience on the faces of hon. members, but I want to say that they make certain recommendations and express public alarm at the difficulties being experienced at the present time by the Public Service Commission. I cannot find fault with the comments in the commission&#x2019;s report or in the editorial in <i>Rapport,</i> and I would suggest that there are many urgent duties awaiting this reconstructed commission, urgent duties which are going to require more than just three men. May I name just some of the duties to which this commission will have to attend as a matter of urgency&#x003F; There is a great need to ensure greater efficiency and productivity in the Civil Service as such. The second point is that the whole question of implementing unproductive laws&#x2014;call them petty apartheid laws&#x2014;should receive the attention of this commission.</p>

<p>The third point is the question of salary structures, particularly in regard to the necessity of narrowing the wage gap. This is a matter which is going to have to enjoy the attention of the commission very shortly. The incorporation of Blacks, Coloureds and Indians on an increasingly equal footing in the Public Service, I believe, is a burning issue, not only for South Africa, but also for the Public Service. Then there are also the following points: the better utilization of all the labour resources, the question of better training, research and even mechanization.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I doubt whether four members&#x2014;and now I see it is three members&#x2014;of this commission can in fact deal with this wide range of topics which I have mentioned, and with the many other aspects of the Public Service with which they come into contact every day. When it comes to the co-ordination of the dynamic change that is going to have to take place in the Public Service in a very few years, the tremendous co-ordinating task of including all South Africans in the Public Service, it is going to need more than just three men to accomplish it.</p>

<p>There is another factor which should be considered. I see that the establishment is now, in terms of the estimates, going to consist of some 186 000 people as against 157 827 at the end of 1975. We must realize that, at the end of last year, there were 75 256 posts for non-Whites. If I may put it in another way, almost 50% of the Public Service is in fact manned by Coloureds, Indians and Blacks. At this stage, of course, they are still in the lower echelons of the Public Service, but the Government has announced its policy some time ago of utilizing more non-Whites in senior positions. There are training schemes which should make this possible. Universities are turning out graduates. I am referring now, for example, to the University of the Western Cape, the Indian University of Durban-Westville and the universities in the homelands. In years to come, many of these people will be absorbed by the homelands, but many of these people, hopefully, will be absorbed in South Africa as well, and in the Public Service itself. These people will play a role in in the service of South Africa. Sooner or later the day must come when Blacks, Coloureds and Indians will be eligible to serve on the Public Service Commission itself, because of the huge complement of Blacks, Coloureds and Indians in the Civil Service. I would venture to say that it could happen sooner than we anticipate.</p>

<p><span class="col_4527-4528" refersTo="page_0946"/>I would be happier if we did not restrict the numbers, and if the hon. the Minister would consider simply stipulating &#x201C;not less than three&#x201D; and not specifying a top limit. If that was done, it would still be in the jurisdiction of the hon. the Prime Minister to make a decision. However, by leaving that figure open we would create a situation in terms of which it would be possible to include persons other than Whites on the Public Service Commission. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I am not pleased with the reduction.</p>

<p>I welcome the provisions of clause 5 of the Bill. The present position is that, when a person leaves the Public Service, the Public Service Commission has no power of recommendation. The hon. the Minister has explained the effect of the proposed amendment and I am sure we can support it. It is a laudable amendment and it will certainly be of assistance to quite a number of people.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with clause 6 of the Bill, which amends section 7 of the principal Act, and to which the hon. member for Koedoespoort has also referred. I can understand the argument put forward, which relates to recommendations on particular people not being accepted and preferably not being published or mentioned in a report. I appreciate the fact that people holding a senior position in the Public Service will not benefit by their personal affairs being bandied about in this House or in the public eye, but I must say that, taking that into account, I nevertheless doubt whether it will be wise to conceal or not place on record officially vital recommendations which might in fact deserve being debated.</p>

<p>As a result of this amendment it could happen that actions could be cloaked in silence and that an injustice to an individual could be perpetrated without its ever being exposed. Therefore, I am not happy with this clause.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort said that what worried him were the words &#x201C;shall&#x201D; and &#x201C;fully&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201D;moet&#x201D; and &#x201C;volledig&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, if one amended the clause in order to delete those two words, one might just as well delete the whole clause, because if one deletes the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D;, it will mean that the report can be made at the discretion of the commission. It would also be unwise to delete the word &#x201C;fully&#x201D;. Again, this would mean that it would be rather like the Schlebusch Commission putting in their report only things that they want mentioned. [Interjections.] I must say, however, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member gave himself away, because the hon. the Minister of the Interior, in quoting the reason for this amendment in his Second Reading speech, spoke about the personal aspects of&#x2014;if I remember correctly&#x2014;the inadvisability of making these things publicly known. On the other hand, the hon. member for Koedoespoort said: &#x201C;You know, we may actually want to make a political appointment, and if we make a political appointment over the heads of the Public Service Commission, we do not really want this to be the subject of a report.&#x201D; &#x201C;You will remember,&#x201D; says the hon. member for Koedoespoort, &#x201C;there was a fellow called Dr. Eschel Roodie, and there was a debate about the matter &#x2026;&#x201D; I do not want to go into details of that now. It is a dead issue, and I do not want to drag it in here, but the hon. member for Koedoespoort used that example in the context of this argument. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What I actually want to say is that if the Government, in any circumstances, wishes to make a political appointment, while the Public Service Commission in fact recommends that the position be given to an outstanding civil servant who has given years of service to the country in a non-partisan fashion, and there is a dispute of that nature, I believe it is correct that such a dispute be brought before this House. Surely, this is democracy, and this is surely a protection against political appointments. Therefore, in quoting that reason which the hon. member for Koedoespoort did, I believe he rather gave the game away, and by doing that he weakened his case. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I welcome the provisions of clause 7(b), which amends section 14 of the principal Act. It is the amendment which relates to the emancipation&#x2014;as it has been stated&#x2014;of women in the Public Service. For many years, the teachers&#x2019; bodies throughout the country, staff associations, members of the Opposition, people in the business world and many others have urged the Government to get rid of the discrimination under which women have laboured in the Public Service. Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome the provisions and I want to say that I think the hon. member for Houghton will, no doubt, have her say on the matter here later or in the newspapers. Suffice it to say that I welcome the provisions and that I hope that the scrapping of this outdated handicap will be <span class="col_4529-4530" refersTo="page_0947"/>a precursor of an enlightened policy of employment, of promotion, of pay on an absolutely equal basis with men. Just in case hon. members are wondering, Sir, I did not require the permission of my wife to make this statement.</p>

<p>Clause 9 of the Bill tightens up the provisions relating to the accepting of rewards other than normal emoluments paid to civil servants. I think these are to be welcomed and I believe they will help to avoid controversies.</p>

<p>To sum up, I just want to repeat that I am not happy with the two points I have mentioned, but on balance the Bill is to be welcomed. We shall support the Second Reading of the Bill and raise the other matters during the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I begin my reply to the debate, I should like to avail myself of the opportunity to welcome the new secretary of the Public Service Commission, Dr. Willem Steyn, to his new capacity. Mr. H. C. van Zyl, who served in that capacity for many years, retired from the service during the recess and has been replaced by Dr. Willem Steyn of whom I have very high expectations in the post. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to welcome him sincerely and to wish him many years of fruitful service.</p>

<p>I should like to thank the hon. member for Green Point for his support of the Bill. However, I want to tell him immediately that he should not put words into my mouth which I did not say in my introductory announcements. The expression which Mr. Sauer used&#x2014;that there is nothing in the Act&#x2014;does not mean that there is nothing important in the Bill. These are administrative measures which are indeed necessary, but my point of view is that there is nothing controversial about it. Now it seems as if there is in fact one controversial matter which the hon. member has brought to our attention and I shall say a few words about it shortly. But I should like to thank him immediately for his support of the other provisions, and I also thank the hon. member or Sandton for his support in this respect. It is fortunate that we are at least unanimous here in respect of the broad directive concerning the Public Service Commission which has to serve the whole Government and the country.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words on the whole matter of the size of the Public Service Commission, the three or five members which were mentioned by the hon. member for Sandton. The idea is clear, and it was motivated here in my Second Reading speech, that owing to the delegation of powers to heads of departments, which has removed quite a number of administrative duties from the Public Service Commission, there are now fewer responsibilities on the commission as such. Therefore, the task of the commission will in future be concentrated more on determining the direction to be taken in policy matters and on broader guide-lines provided from one central point.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell the hon. member for Sandton, while he is talking to his Whip, that in referring to the problems of the Public Service Commission and the tremendous turnover in staff, he is creating the impression that there are major problems. He is creating the impression that a commission of three would be too small to handle the matter and that I should therefore have greater flexibility. Furthermore, the impression is created that a larger commission would probably be a more efficient commission, because more people would serve on it. I should like to tell the hon. member that his own political party is probably the best example of this. As an old member of this House I should like to say to him that his party was much more effective when only the hon. member for Houghton was here. Therefore, a larger number of people does not necessarily increase efficiency. As I have said, this has been illustrated very clearly here in politics. [Interjections.] The fact is that this is true, and I am not joking. The policy of that party was conveyed more effectively by the hon. member for Houghton than it is now being done with all the hon. members there. This is common knowledge.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words on the high turnover in the Public Service. It is true, as the report indicates very clearly, that there is a high turnover in the Public Service. This is one of those problems which one must overcome and which one overcomes with great difficulty. Our experience at the moment is that we do not have many problems on the higher levels of the Public Service. When one has been there for a number of years, then one remains there. It is especially on the intermediate levels, after a man has been gaining experience for a number of years and has a <span class="col_4531-4532" refersTo="page_0948"/>reasonably good grounding, that he is lured away or sometimes bought over by the private sector. From the nature of the case one can do very little about this, seen from the viewpoint of the Government, because one has a number of officials in the Public Service who are all in the same category or group and if one of those people suddenly becomes attractive to some private concern or other, then an extremely attractive offer is made to that one person and the Government cannot prevent this by offering that person a higher salary as well, because then one would be disaligning the whole matter with all his colleagues who are on the same level as he. This is our problem in practice in the Public Service.</p>

<p>The hon. member quite rightly says that while the activities of the Government are becoming more and more, the number of Government officials seems to be decreasing, a trend which one would rather not have, but which to my mind implies a tremendous compliment for the Public Service, that a smaller staff, due to circumstances which we would rather not have, is still doing the work of the Government so effectively that the Government machine still runs as smoothly as it is running at present, and that those people continue to do their work with such dedication and energy and enthusiasm that the Government machine can show the normal progress which it does in fact show. Let us have no illusions about this: For the private sector and for the ordinary man in the street it is just as important as for the Government itself that there should be a good Public Service, because this eventually forms the essence of the whole organization for the private sector which also deals with the Government from time to time. For that reason I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to the Government officials in general for their dedication and for the hours of service which they render to keep the Government machine going with the dedication with which it can be done. I think they deserve praise and gratitude for the work which they are doing for the Government.</p>

<p>I should now like to proceed to the controversial clause, according to which the report to Parliament, or the survey in the report of the commission, need not be complete, and there is no necessity for it to be reported either. This is the provision which is being amended here. The hon. member for Koedoespoort summarized this very neatly. Let us take the facts as they are. The Public Service Commission makes a recommendation, and allow me to add to this for the information of the hon. member for Green Point, because this was one of the problems in his argument; he referred to the Society of public servants at their congresses who make recommendations and said that only the parts of these recommendations which are accepted will be made available and will be read while those which are not accepted will never be heard of again, because there will be no need to report on those which are not accepted. But the hon. member is making just one mistake. This particular provision concerns people only and not matters.</p>

<p>The Public Servants&#x2019; Association is not concerned with people in any way. It does not recommend which person should be recommended. Here we are concerned with people only as far as matters, are concerned, there is no obligation to report on these. In other words, the hon. member&#x2019;s premise is wrong in that respect. [Interjections.] We shall be able to debate this further in the Committee Stage. I should like to debate it there. But this is concerned only with people and the recommendations affecting people. The Act presently provides that if the Public Service Commission makes a recommendation to the Cabinet and the recommendation is not accepted, the commision can take certain steps. It may then be taken to the State President, and if that has been done and it has still not been accepted or given effect to, the commission must mention it in full in its report to Parliament. This is the present provision. The commission, as a statutory body, which advises the State on staff matters and which should enjoy a high status and great esteem and to which we should like to afford that status and esteem, feels that since these things are prescribed to it by the Act, it must make full use of all these steps in order to illustrate not only its credibility, but also its seriousness concerning a recommendation. If it is opposed in the Cabinet, if Cabinet does not agree with its recommendation, then the commission feels that if it were to yield immediately, it would seem as if it had not conducted proper research before making the recommendation, and this could make things difficult for it, and for that reason it normally follows all the steps which the Act makes available to it right <span class="col_4533-4534" refersTo="page_0949"/>through to the end. But this sometimes leads to a peculiar difficulty, namely that a complete report now has to be submitted on the people concerned. The people&#x2019;s qualifications have to be investigated. This is juicy news and the people like writing about it. Two people become involved in a matter which is in fact unpleasant for both of them. The man who has not been appointed to the post now has to read about these things in the Press every day, and the man who has been appointed to the post feels sorry that he was appointed, because he does not want to become involved. Why&#x003F; There are certain countries&#x2014;the hon. member for Sandton spoke of democracy and said it ought to be this way, but I do not know whether the hon. member does not regard the USA as a democratic country, because when there is a change of President, all posts in the top hierarchy of the Government service fall away and they are all filled with party appointments. Is this not democratic&#x003F; The hon. member refers to the democratic right.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is another system, yes, but the hon. member uses the argument of democratic right. America is a democracy and when a different President is elected, when there is a new chief of Government, then all the posts on that level fall away and are replaced by political appointments&#x2014;the whole lot. [Interjections.] Afterall, the point of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument is that it should be democratic. If the hon. member feels that the way in which the Americans operate is not democratic, he should say so.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to state the matter as follows: The Public Service Commission itself felt that this recommendation sometimes places them in a quandary, because it sometimes happens that they have to oppose the Cabinet and the impression is created in some cases that they want to dictate to the Cabinet or do not want to accept the ruling of the Cabinet and therefore want to rule South Africa in the Cabinet&#x2019;s place. Over and above the personal embarrassment which people may at times be caused, the commission feels that they and all the people concerned would be spared many problems if it need not necessarily take place in this way. The hon. member for Green Point initially raised the matter and I would like to say to him that he will agree with me that the commission inspires great confidence, because the commission as such consists of officials in whom we as well as the public servants have very great confidence. The commission does its work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and that is why I said that the Cabinet should carry out the commission&#x2019;s recommendations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member would like the commission&#x2019;s recommendations to be implemented, but the hon. member does not seem to realize that the way the provision reads at the moment, it is being left to the efficient commission to exercise a discretion as to whether it should be reported or not. They may decide not to report it at all or only to report it in part. If the hon. member places such a high premium on the commission, surely he should also place a high premium on their discretion to decide on what to report. With reference to the argument advanced by the hon. member, I want to say at once that because we have confidence in the commission, we should like to leave it to their discretion whether they will report it in full, in part or not at all. We as a Cabinet will abide by the decision of the commission, because we have great confidence in the commission, and so, fortunately, does the hon. member for Green Point. I think this matter has now been made clear, but perhaps we can come back to it during the Committee Stage. There is no need for me to talk at any length because this is the kind of measure which may be discussed more fully in the Committee Stage. The purpose of the Bill is actually to increase even further the esteem and status enjoyed by the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should remove one other problem which was raised by the hon. member for Sandton. I refer to the question of non-White staff in the Public Service. I should like to explain the position as it is at present. The Public Service Act is not discriminatory in any way. Therefore, non-Whites may and will be appointed to posts for which they qualify in their fields of activity. Consequently, no amendment to any law is needed to make this <span class="col_4535-4536" refersTo="page_0950"/>possible; it is already possible at the moment. It only depends on their qualifications, the demand for staff and their ability to fill the posts. Seeing that no discrimination may take place in terms of the Public Service Act, this is one of the Acts which the hon. member and his colleagues ought to support 100%.</p>

<p>I should like to state the matter concerning the Public Service Commission as follows: The thorough investigation which was conducted by the commission itself some time ago, included amongst other things, an overseas tour for the purpose of studying central staff institutions. The comprehensive report which was submitted afterwards enabled me to take a fresh look at the whole aspect. As the responsible Minister I wanted certainty in my own mind that South Africa&#x2019;s Public Service institution and staff were still keeping pace with the modern world in which we are living, that they had not started to lag behind, but were up to date and in line with the rest of the world. That is why I gave instructions for a complete investigation to be undertaken. I then submitted to various bodies the report which had been submitted to me, as mentioned in my introductory speech, and after thorough consideration of all the pros and cons, it was decided that the present system should continue. I may point out that some countries have a central staff institution. They do not have Public Service Commission or anything of that kind, but a department of staff matters which is on the same level as any other department, serves under a secretary and has an ordinary staff administration like any other department. This is one of the systems which are quite successful in some countries. We had to consider whether we should make use of such a system, but we eventually decided that our present system should be retained, provided, however, that we make it more streamlined and that we effect certain other adjustments as recommended in the report. Accordingly, the intention is to make further adjustments during the course of next year upon completion of the investigations which are being conducted at present. In doing so, we are hoping to set our Public Service to rights, so that there will be a machine which will be streamlined to handle the task and the challenges presented by our present position. The amendments which are before the House at this stage, therefore, are essentially provisional amendments, and we hope to be able to introduce more far-reaching amendments next year. I thank hon. members for their support. I believe that the remaining points which they raised may be discussed in the Committee Stage.</p>

If he uses the term &#x201C;at least three&#x201D;, it means that he can have three commissioners and be in a position to exercise a discretion. My difficulty is that I am not convinced by the hon. the Minister that three commissioners are sufficient. I can see no necessity for restricting the Minister and future Ministers to three commissioners. Why can we not have a provision that there will not be fewer than three commissioners&#x003F; Such a provision will leave it in the Minister&#x2019;s discretion and if circumstances will in years to come require the appointment of more than three commissioners, it will be possible to do so.

<p>Mr. Chairman, in my reply to the Second Reading debate, I have just indicated my reasons for this, but perhaps I should further point out to the hon. member that if we were to give effect to his proposal, there would be quite a few additional matters which would require attention. For instance, there is the question of a quorum. Surely it goes without saying that if there could be four or five commissioners instead of only three, the quorum would have to be defined differently. The same goes for the commission&#x2019;s powers in respect of issuing <span class="col_4537-4538" refersTo="page_0951"/>instructions, because it must be clearly defined how many commissioners are required. My honest opinion is that a commission consisting of three members, is sufficient. Furthermore, I may point out that the commission has consisted of three members over the past 18 months and has been carrying out its work extremely efficiently. Consequently we are of the opinion that practice has proved that it is not necessary to have more than three members.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, para, (e) of clause 6 deals with the deletion of subsection (7) of section 7 of the principal Act. I shall be brief on this matter. I have already indicated to the hon. the Minister what our views are on this matter. I am not very impressed with the argument of the hon. the Minister or of the hon. member for Koedoespoort. They have raised the issue solely on the basis of recommendations which might involve an individual in his appointment to some office in the Public Service. The Public Service Commission has to make recommendations and has powers under section 6 of the principal Act which are elaborated in no less than 15 categories.</p>

<p>There are 15 functions and only one of these has reference to recommendations which affect individuals. The hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Koedoespoort have offered no reason whatsoever as to why the recommendations in 14 of the 15 provisions which were not accepted by the Cabinet, should not be published. The hon. the Minister has certainly offered a reason, his own reason, as to why any recommendations under section 6(2)(h) of the principal Act, namely recommendations in regard to the appointment to posts in the various departments should not be published. I am quite happy that in so far as post appointments are concerned, it be left to the discretion of the commission under para, (h)&#x2014;where no names are published, but where there have been recommendations. We can discuss them in this House with the hon. the Minister. However, as for the remaining recommendations&#x2014;and there were some, for instance about a uniform retirement age, etc.&#x2014;it is in the interests of the Public Service, it is felt, that the recommendations and the attitude of the Cabinet should be included in the report. If the hon. the Minister will at some other stage&#x2014;I do not suggest he does it now&#x2014;give consideration to the exclusion of para. (h) in certain circumstances, then perhaps we can debate it on another occasion. At the moment the deletion of subsection (7) of section 7 of the principal Act covers all 15 paragraphs of section 6 of the principal Act in so far as compulsion and obligation are concerned. Therefore, I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I support that amendment. I think I have already stated my case in the Second Reading debate. I believe that if there is any matter of great importance over which there is a dispute between the Cabinet and the Public Service Commission, this will very likely become news anyway and I do not think a report to Parliament is going to alter the fact. I am quite sure that major matters cannot permanently be hidden, but I do believe that the motivation and the reasons for the decisions and arguments should be placed before Parliament. I want to say in particular that I am not in full <span class="col_4539-4540" refersTo="page_0952"/>agreement with the hon. member for Green Point. He says that he will be happy if para. (h) of section 6 of the principal Act be excluded. My belief is that it is particularly the individual who might find the necessity for protection in having his case placed before Parliament, and therefore I should not like to exclude para. (h) from that provision. Therefore, I cannot vote for the clause as set out by the hon. the Minister, but will support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister and I seem to be reading a different section 7, and the purpose of it. This Bill before us has specific reference to one of the problems which the commission has had. There is a procedure for what is to be done with recommendations which apply to a particular person, namely the dealing with them departmentally, how it has to be done and when it has to be finalized. The Bill before us has in fact provisions in it as to what is to happen when they deal with a group of persons. Section 7 has nothing to do with what the commission can do or must report upon except subsection (7), which the hon. the Minister now wishes to delete. Section 6 of the principal Act gives wide powers and I hope the hon. the Minister will look at my argument and perhaps come to the conclusion in consultation with the commission that I am correct and he is wrong in his approach.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is aimed at establishing a university for medical, dental and veterinary training for Bantu. The establishment of such a university for the Bantu may justifiably be called an historic event. For the Black population of a country it is a step of special significance, for although medical training facilities for Bantu do exist at present at the University of Natal, they are available to other non-Whites as well, and consequently the intake of Bantu is limited. This will therefore be the first medical training institution specifically for Bantu. In respect of dentistry there is the existing arrangement that the University of the Witwatersrand does take in a few Black students. Veterinary training has never before been offered to the Black people. The envisaged university is therefore historic in so far as it will have the first medical faculty and the first dental and veterinary science faculties specifically established for the training of Bantu students. I think it is appropriate, since we are going to discuss medical training for the Blacks, that we should first consider briefly the history of medical training for Bantu. As far as I was able to establish, the first attempts in this regard were made in 1922 by Dr. Alan B. Taylor of the American Mission and Dr. J. B. McCord, then head of the McCord Zulu Hospital. They realized the pressing need for medical services among the Zulu and in the absence of a sufficient number of Zulu matriculants they wanted to accept even lower qualifications as entrance requirements for medical training. The authority which was responsible at the time for the registration of medical practitioners was not prepared, however, to recognize an inferior qualification, as is still the case today. In 1938 the Government appointed a committee to investigate medical training in general. The committee, with Prof. M. C. Botha, not I nor my father, but the then Secretary for Education, as chairman, and among others Dr. Karl Bremer, the subsequent Minister of Health, as one of the members, recommended <i>inter alia,</i> that a separate medical school be established for non-Whites. With the outbreak of the Second World War, however, the implementation of this recommendation failed to materialize. In the meantime the Durban medical profession had begun to take an interest in the effort made by Drs. Taylor and McCord, to which I have just referred. In 1943 the Natal Branch of the Medical Association of South Africa reconsidered the matter and appointed a committee to investigate the possibilities. The council of the University College of Natal also decided at this time to establish a medical school under its control. They sent a deputation to the then Minister of Education, the late J. H. Hofmeyr. But he was of the opinion that there was not a sufficient number of matriculated non-Whites to justify the establishment of a medical school. Neither the medical profession in Natal, nor the University College of Natal wanted to admit defeat, however, and soon afterwards presented statistics indicating that a sufficient number of non-White matriculants would in fact have been able to qualify. The college estimated that an annual intake of at least 40 students could be guaranteed.</p>

<p>In the meantime the report of the National Health Service Commission was tabled in 1944, which recommended <i>inter alia</i> that Durban was the appropriate place for a medical school intended primarily for non-Whites, but also for Whites who wanted to equip themselves to serve non-Whites.</p>

<p>In 1947 the Government decided to grant its approval in principle to the establishment of a non-White medical school at Durban under the patronage of the University College of Natal.</p>

<p>That, then, was the position in 1948, when the National Party Government came into power. This Government gave its support to the establishment of the school, but with the proviso that only non-Whites be admitted. Ample financial assistance was rendered by the Government and, training commenced in 1951. The school has therefore been in existence now for 25 years.</p>

<p><span class="col_4543-4544" refersTo="page_0954"/>The statistics pertaining to intake and production over the entire period are as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Until approximately three years ago, as hon. members probably know, there was an additional preparatory year between the matriculation year and the first year at university for students studying medicine there, in order to make up a certain leeway. This only fell away a year or so ago.</p>

<p>This medical school did pioneering work in the training of non-Whites, and I understand that valuable contributions were made, particularly in the field of research. Therefore I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to express my appreciation for the work which has so far been done there for the promotion of medical services, particularly as far as the Bantu are concerned. This applies in respect of the university as such and also to individuals on the staff of that university. This, then, is briefly the history of medical training specifically for the Bantu.</p>

<p>To return to the Bill before us, I should now like to draw attention to the need which exists for the envisaged training, and I also want to indicate what the motives were which led to the Government deciding to proceed to the establishment of a new medical training institution.</p>

<p>It is an unfortunate fact that the largest population group in our country, the Bantu, have the least number of medical practitioners to serve their own people. Fortunately the medical practitioners of the other population groups have always been prepared to render medical services to members of other population groups, particularly the Bantu.</p>

<p>In certain areas, however, particularly in the various Bantu homelands, there is a disturbing need for more Bantu medical practitioners. The ratio of medical practitioners to patients in the various population groups is at present, according to calculations, as follows for the separate groups&#x2014;</p>

<table>

<tr>

<td><p>Whites</p></td>

<td><p>1 to approximately</p></td>

<td><p>400</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Indian</p></td>

<td><p>1 to approximately</p></td>

<td><p>900</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Coloureds</p></td>

<td><p>1 to approximately</p></td>

<td><p>6 000</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Bantu</p></td>

<td><p>1 to approximately</p></td>

<td><p>45 000</p></td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>The ratio for all the population groups together is 1 to approximately 2 000. The ideal ratio, according to general standards, is 1 to 1 000. Here in our country we at present, as far as can be established, have approximately 400 Bantu medical practitioners, and this is of course completely inadequate. During the past few years there has been an estimated average Bantu population increase of approximately 400 000 per annum. At the ideal medical practitioner/population ratio of 1 to 1 000 this amounts to a need for 400 Bantu medical practitioners per annum. Hon. members will agree with me that the present production of the medical school of approximately 15 Bantu medical practitioners is not even sufficient to meet the needs of the normal population growth, with the result that the backlog increases annually.</p>

<p>During the past 25 years a total of 688 Bantu students have been admitted to the medical school: 583 to the first year or preparatory year, and 105 to the second year after these 105 had completed their first year or even a B.Sc. degree at other Bantu universities. However, these 688 were only approximately one-third of the number of candidates who applied and qualified for admission. So there is undoubtedly sufficient student material to justify more extensive training facilities. In addition the number of Bantu matriculants with matriculation exemption continuing to increase encouragingly. In 1960 there were only 182 candidates who obtained matriculation exemption. This number increased to 827 in 1965, 1 856 in 1970 and at the end of last year 3 520 candidates passed in this way. Although a <span class="col_4545-4546" refersTo="page_0955"/>relatively high percentage of this group would qualify for medical training, it is obvious that not all of them have the aptitude and the interest.</p>

<p>The training facilities at the existing medical school are limited and the grounds on which it is situated do not lend themselves to expansion. Recently the University of Natal, in an application for the expansion of hostel accommodation to make provision for more students, stated <i>inter alia</i> that the grounds at Wentworth are bordered on three sides by an oil refinery and may be bounded on the fourth by a developing Coloured housing area. The university maintains that the smell and the noise make living conditions almost unbearable. According to the university undesirable elements from the neighbouring residential areas break through the boundary fences and trespass on the hostel grounds. The condition of the old barracks which were converted into hostel accommodation is no credit to anyone either. In any event, it was designed for 235 students, while in 1975&#x2014;293 students were already being accommodated there. The present hostels are not in the right locality either, since they are situated on a site approximately 11 km away from the medical school. This entails considerable transportation costs for students and also interferes with their studies in that they are unable to use the library after hours.</p>

<p>After a thorough investigation on the part of the government it was found that several million rands would be required for extensions in Durban, which could not be justified either because even after such expenditure the facilities and conditions would still not be satisfactory. The academic buildings, too, were originally planned in such a way that it would only be possible to make extensions enabling the accommodation of larger numbers at considerable cost. To make the planning of all this development possible at the existing faculty it would be necessary to expropriate land in which there are vested interests.</p>

<p>From the above it is clear that the training facilities at Wentworth are in any event very limited, even for the present inadequate student intake only. It is estimated that the construction of the necessary hostel amenities would amount to approximately R1,8 million. It is estimated that it would cost R23 million to expand all the amenities at the medical school to such an extent that the student intake would be the same as that of the envisaged new institution near Ga-Rankuwa. What is more, this estimate does not even include training facilities for dentistry and veterinary science.</p>

<p>In view of the great need for more Bantu medical practitioners, and the fact that more Bantu are qualifying for admission annually, consideration had therefore to be given to a new medical university. However, I want to make it very clear that the existing medical school is not suddenly being closed to Bantu students. The training which is being provided there is systematically being superseded by an institution which will be able to accept more students annually and which will have far better amenities. It is probably of importance as well to point out that the existing single faculty of human medicine for the three groups of non-Whites is being augmented and superseded by three new faculties of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science for the Bantu peoples, in addition to the provision which will be made for the other two non-White groups. Therefore there can be no question of the decision being prejudicial to any specific population group. Eventually the readjustment will therefore mean that the existing single faculty of human medicine in Durban will be superseded by seven faculties, viz. three for medicine, three for dentistry and one for veterinary science.</p>

<p>As far as dentists are concerned there is, as far as is known, only one Bantu dentist in South Africa. If it is accepted that it is possible to meet the need with a ratio of one dentist to 5 000 possible patients, there is at present a shortage of 3 000 Bantu dentists to serve their own people. In addition, there is at present no qualified Bantu veterinarian either. The homelands have an immediate need for at least 22 State veterinarians. This number is expected to increase rapidly once the services are established and as progress is made with animal husbandry in the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>The envisaged medical university is being planned to make provision for an annual intake of 200 medical, 50 dental and, initially, 50 veterinary students in their first year. The first year of study in all three disciplines consists of basic training, and this will provisionally be offered at the existing three Bantu universities. This is no new principle of course since students already attend one of the three Bantu universities for their first year and then the <span class="col_4547-4548" refersTo="page_0956"/>medical school in Durban for their second year. This arrangement has the added advantage that available funds may be utilized to offer maximum medical training from the second year onwards at the new institution.</p>

<p>The question may now arise as to why it has been decided to situate the new medical university near Pretoria. I want to draw attention to the fact that various commissions were appointed in past to determine the need for and plan the development of medical training. The most important reports, and the one which is of cardinal importance because it has a direct bearing on the university under discussion, is what we call the interdepartmental Van Dyk report, which was before the Cabinet in August 1966. This report dealt mainly with medical training for non-Whites. On that occasion I was already present as member of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>After careful consideration of this report the Cabinet decided that separate institutions should in time be established for each of the non-White population groups, that the first institution for medical training for the Black population should be in the Transvaal, that there should be an institution for the Brown population in the Western Cape, and one for the Indians in Natal. This was decided as long ago as 24 August 1966. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The specific situation of such an institution has to comply with certain basic requirements. I should like to point out the most important. In the first place there has to be a hospital large enough to provide the students with adequate opportunities for training. It is undoubtedly very relevant to draw your attention to the fact that shortly after the 1966 decisions of the Government I instructed the Department of Bantu Administration and Development to build a hospital suitable for training work near Ga-Rankuwa. This hospital is already in full operation with 1 258 beds already available and a planned expansion up to 2 100 beds. I could mention that the hospital is able to render ultra-specialized services and has already been registered with the Medical Council for the accommodation of interns. A second important consideration is that there should be practising medical practitioners in the immediate vicinity of the university, in particular specialists in various fields who may be called upon on a full-time or part-time basis as lecturing staff or to be of assistance with research in various spheres.</p>

<p>But thirdly it is essential to ensure that such a new institution will from the outset maintain recognized standards in the training and evaluation of its students. The new university will consequently be specially situated so that it is within reach of two established universities&#x2014;of Pretoria and the Witwatersrand&#x2014;each with a medical and dental faculty, but of greater importance, with the only faculty of veterinary science with its own research institute, viz. the world-renowned Onderstepoort, not far away.</p>

<p>It is a privilege for me to state that the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria have consented to the deans of the corresponding faculties serving on the advisory pilot committee which I have specially appointed to help plan the new university. In future it will also be necessary to lean heavily on the knowledge and experience of these two institutions. I wish to convey a special word of thanks to the controlling bodies of the two universities, the vice-principals and five deans of the two universities, and in particular to Prof. Dr. H. W. Snyman, who owing to the good co-operation of the University of Pretoria is acting as chairman of the interim pilot committee and is also my chief adviser for the envisaged training.</p>

<p>Furthermore I should like to draw attention to the fact that the application of a new principle is being envisaged here in that the ancillary or supporting studies, frequently called the para-medical professions, for the three disciplines will also be offered at the envisaged university. This approach has the advantage that not only will a feeling of solidarity and mutual respect be created among the various groups, but also that the training which has already been undergone, whenever studies are terminated for some reason or other, may be better utilized if the student transfers to a related line of study in one of the supporting professions. It is even possible that recognition may be accorded to studies that have already been completed in the form of a reduction of the training period prescribed for a specific course.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that at the Ga-Rankuwa hospital training is already being provided for dental therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, radiographers and physiotherapists. In addition there are such courses as medical laboratory technology, nursing, pathology and optometry.</p>

<p><span class="col_4549-4550" refersTo="page_0957"/>Because the need is so great considerable progress has already been made with the physical planning of the entire complex consisting of the hospital, university, hostels and grounds. As had already been said, the hospital is already in operation. Provisional estimates indicate that the cost of establishing the three faculties with certain additional amenities may be in the region of R30 million. It will be generally appreciated that this university will make heavy financial demands on us&#x2014;also as far as its operating costs are concerned. In view of this, and also taking into account the limited availability of professional manpower, this institution will first have to be well established and utilized to its optimum capacity before any thought can be given to the establishment of further similar institutions for the Bantu elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to elucidate certain provisions of the Bill briefly. The Bill is relatively simple and for the most part adopts the provisions of the Acts of the existing Bantu Universities verbatim. There is also considerable conformity with provisions pertaining to other South African universities. For that reason it is not necessary for me to explain each clause of the Bill.</p>

<p>The university is established by means of clause 2 and will be known as the Medical University of Southern Africa. This name may conveniently be abbreviated in both official languages to MEDUNSA.</p>

<p>It should be observed that the institution as a whole is not called a medical school, nor is reference made to medical faculties, for it is not part of another university. The institution, with its three faculties, is in itself a university. Nor is this procedure unique, for there are similar institutions overseas which are not broadly conceived universities with many faculties, but universities which one may, in a certain sense, call technical universities.</p>

<p>Clause 3 provides that the seat of the university shall be near Ga-Rankuwa. The site belongs to the South African Bantu Trust and adjoins the town of Ga-Rankuwa in the Bophuthatswana homeland. The university will serve all the Bantu nations in South Africa. It ought to be mentioned that we will of course also provide Black students from South West Africa, and if circumstances permit, students from neighbouring countries with training. Although section 2(1) of the Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959, to which reference is made in the Bill, mentions only the Bantu national units in the Republic, clause 19 makes provision for the admission of students who do not belong to the said national units.</p>

<p>Clause 10 makes provision for a university council. The attention of hon. members is drawn to the fact that we are following an entirely different pattern at this university than was the case at the other Bantu universities. Since the university will serve all the Bantu national units, it is being provided that each homeland government will appoint one member to the council. In addition the councils of the Universities of Pretoria and the Witwatersrand, appoint three and two members respectively, from their corresponding faculties. Each of the councils of the three universities for the Bantu offering the first year course will also appoint a member. Furthermore provision is being made for the appointment of a member by the contemplated convocation immediately the members reach the figure of 100, and two members immediately the members reach the figure of 500.</p>

<p>In the Senate&#x2014;i.e. the provisions of clause 11&#x2014;provision is being made as a temporary measure, as in the case of the Bantu universities, and in order to ensure that existing standards are maintained, for the appointment of professors from corresponding faculties of other universities.</p>

<p>In clause 13 provision is being made for a convocation which is comparable with those which exist in terms of legislation at other universities in South Africa.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 24 there shall be faculties of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science at the university. The clause also empowers us to establish courses, certificates, etc., pertaining to the ancillary or supporting professions which I have already mentioned. I have already stated that professors from other universities will form part of the senate of the university. Similarly provision is being made in clause 27 for the appointment of external examiners and moderators. This is the normal procedure in any case.</p>

<p>Clause 35 contains provisions pertaining to the hospital at Ga-Rankuwa, which will be used as a training hospital. Except in cases where health matters have already been transferred to homeland governments, the provision of hospital services in Bantu areas is <span class="col_4551-4552" refersTo="page_0958"/>in the hands of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, in terms of the provisions of section 2 of proclamation R.96 of 1970. The Secretary for Health controls certain hospitals in these areas in the capacity of agent of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>Because the hospital at Ga-Rankuwa will serve as a training hospital, it is essential that the development and planning of both the hospital as well as the university shall take place on a synchronized basis. This can only happen if the control over both institutions&#x2014; as well as their estimates&#x2014;is exercised by the same Minister and the same department. To achieve this ideal the Minister of Bantu Education is, in the present case, being authorized to take over the task of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, as provided in the abovementioned proclamation. The provision of course refers only to the hospital at Ga-Rankuwa. The Secretary for Health will continue to manage the hospital, but in future as agent of the Minister of Bantu Education. The Staff will therefore continue, as in the past, to fall under the Department of Health and will also retain their conditions of service, prospects of promotion and so on. The costs involved in this will, however, be recovered from the Department of Bantu Education. This department will make provision in its estimates for the redemption of the said costs, as well as for other capital requirements in this respect.</p>

<p>The Government entertains the expectation that Bantu universities and the Governments of the Bantu peoples will give their full support to the envisaged medical university, and that students and graduates of the medical university, too, will give the university their loyal support. If these expectations are fulfilled, and the circumstances are therefore favourable, the Medical University of Southern Africa could become a powerful professional powerhouse in the development of our Bantu peoples. It will also provide each of these nations with professional men, individuals who are best able to serve their own people, and who ought in course of time to make valuable contributions as soon as the establishment of further similar training amenities elsewhere can be justified.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with that I have now indicated the most important principles contained in this Bill. I now want to express the hope that this Bill will receive the support of all the hon. members of this House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think last Wednesday must have been the first occasion for quite a long time when a Minister of Finance has not cast himself in the role of, or liberally sprinkled his budget speech with quotations from, some notable person. Last year this Minister liberally sprinkled his budget speech with quotations from Abraham Lincoln. In previous years we have had Aesop, Langenhoven, Confucius and many others. I made a mistake when I spoke in this debate last Wednesday after the hon. the Minister had sat down, because I likened him to the managing director of a company. I think that a far more correct casting for this hon. Minister on this occasion would be that of a doctor. I cast him in this role because he is having to deal with an economy which is suffering from a combination of severe ailments. Like any illness, that of our economy is manifested by a number of symptoms. No illness, however, is caused by symptoms. It is caused by root causes, and on this occasion those root causes go back a very long way. Also, like any other illness, there are various different types of treatment for it. There are palliative treatments aimed at relieving the suffering caused by symptoms, there are curative treatments which are aimed at eliminating the root causes of the illness, and there are preventative treatments aimed at guarding against the recurrence of the illness. Let me say that I regard it as very important that anyone who has the health of South Africa at heart should not confuse what are the symptoms of our problems with what are the root causes of those problems, and also should not confuse what the palliative treatments for them are with the curative treatments.</p>

<p>I want to deal firstly this afternoon with the symptoms of our illness, but do not let us run away from the fact that we are dealing this afternoon and in this debate with an economy that is sick. I do not want to hear any noises from that side of the House that I am being disloyal or that I am being unpatriotic when I say that we are dealing with a sick economy in South Africa. [Interjections.] I believe that it is being far more disloyal and far less patriotic if you put your head in the sand and do not face facts when those facts are unpleasant. If our economy were not so sick, why should the hon. the Minister of Finance have had to deal out such strong medicine for it last Wednesday&#x003F; I believe, and I believe very fervently, that in times of crisis the people must be motivated by a frank approach to our problems and be taken into the Government&#x2019;s confidence in regard to the effects of those problems. It is only then that you get the people unified and willingly behind the national effort. It is only then that you get the people ready and willing to make sacrifices and to put up with a spartan diet such as they are going to have to put up with, for any length of time.</p>

<p>It is only then when people will fully appreciate that in order to have a safe and secure country it is necessary to have a strong and healthy economy and be seen to have such an economy. I regret having to say this, but it is my observation, that true frankness is not one of the strong points of the hon. the Minister of Finance. I say this because I think he was less than frank with the country at the time of the devaluation last September. He emphasized what the advantages of that devaluation were, but he glossed over the very harmful consequences of it. I believe that in his budget speech of last Wednesday the hon. the Minister also glossed over the less pleasant conclusion which are to be drawn from our current situation. I do not propose to gloss them over one little bit.</p>

<p>What are the symptoms of our ailment&#x003F; Obviously the most painful symptoms are stagflation&#x2014;i.e. inflation at a double-figure rate&#x2014;rapidly escalating cost of living coupled with a slow-down in employment and a slow-down in job opportunities. The rise in the <span class="col_4555-4556" refersTo="page_0960"/>cost of living is something that is causing real hardship particularly amongst those people who are at the lower end of the income scale, people who are mainly, but not entirely, members of our Black population. It is causing real hardship amongst people who have to live on fixed incomes, people who are primarily pensioners and are of an age when they are unable to supplement their income by working. It is causing hardship also to increasing numbers of salary and wage-earners whose salaries and wages are not keeping pace with the rise in the cost of living. I believe that the consensus of opinion amongst experts&#x2014;and this is a consensus with which I concur&#x2014;is that the rate of inflation is going to get worse this year when we start feeling more acutely the effect of last September&#x2019;s devaluation, the effect of the increased rail tariffs which came into effect on the 1st of this month, the sales taxes, the excise duties and the savage increase in the price of petrol announced in last week&#x2019;s budget. Food prices, which have been relatively stable for the past few months, are predicted by no-one else than the director of the Agricultural Union to go up sharply. Now with this budget and its hikes in the rate of income tax, the people are going to be left with less money in their pockets to pay for goods at higher prices. If this is not really asking for sacrifices, I do not know what is; if this is not going to lower living standards, I do not know what will. I believe it is inconceivable that there will not be a tremendous pressure by salary and wage-earners for increases in their salaries and wages as a result of this budget. If that pressure is conceded to, then we are going to see a further spiral of increases in costs and prices.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if inflation is a hurtful symptom of our malady, so too is the lack of growth in the economy and the slow-down we are experiencing in business. Last year the GDP rose by only 2,2%, which was less than the rate of growth of the population of our country. Worse still, however, was the fact that the GNP, which includes our net income from abroad and is the real measure of what is available to sustain our standard of living, in real terms was virtually static and may even have shown a marginal decline. This means that our standard of living, the average per capita real income of our people, decreased last year, and all indications are that it is going to decrease again this year, probably more sharply than last year.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>What is even more serious, however, is the fact that if the growth in the economy is less than the growth in the population, unemployment inevitably and axiomatically results. That is what is happening at present. Unemployment amongst Whites, Coloureds and Asians is measurable, and the figures show that over the past few months there has been an appreciable increase in that respect. However, there are no statistics for unemployment amongst the Blacks, although that is where the social and political consequences of unemployment are most serious. I know of an occurrence only last week where a firm in Johannesburg advertised for one African employee and received applications from over 500 people. If that is not an indication of unemployment, I do not know what is. [Interjections.] I think this Government would be very unwise and very irresponsible to underestimate the size or seriousness of this problem.</p>

<p>However, there are other serious symptoms of our present economic illness. We have a balance of payments problem because we are not earning enough from our exports and sales of gold to pay for our imports and we need some very essential imports to keep going. Business confidence has reached a low ebb with the result that the growth in investment, on which the whole future productive capacity of our country depends, has slowed down to a snail&#x2019;s pace. I regard this as a particularly serious symptom, because our whole future revival depends on our capacity to grow.</p>

<p>I think I have identified the main symptoms of our economic illness, and I suggest that they add up to a very painful illness indeed. What, however, are the root causes of this situation&#x003F; We have listened to arguments from that side of the House for a long time now that inflation is mainly an imported phenomenon. That is an argument that never did hold water. If it ever did hold any water, it is certainly not an argument that now holds any water whatsoever. South Africa is now ranked with the high inflation rate countries. With an inflation rate of roughly 11%, South Africa has a higher inflation rate than America with 4,8%, Switzerland <span class="col_4557-4558" refersTo="page_0961"/>with 3,4%, Germany with 5,3%, the Netherlands with 8,7% and France, Japan, Rhodesia, Canada and so forth. With one exception, and that is the United Kingdom, which has a higher inflation rate than we have, those trading partners I have mentioned all have lower inflation rates than we do. The conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that we are not an importer of inflation, but an exporter. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>In his budget speech last Wednesday the hon. the Minister put much of the blame for our sickness on the fact that overseas countries are going through a period of deep recession. The Government has placed much reliance on overseas recovery to lead our own economy back to the recovery trail. I do not think that we should exaggerate the effects of the overseas recession. Our exports have, in fact, held up remarkably well. Our balance of payments has been affected far more by the lower price of gold in the last year&#x2014;which, in itself, is not directly attributable to recessionary factors overseas&#x2014;and by capital movements, than it has by any slump in our exports. No, Sir, the root causes of our illness lie at home, not abroad. Our illness lies, and here I am going to use words which appeared in the leader in <i>The Argus</i> of 1 April dealing with the budget because I think those words are particularly apt&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Primarily in a long period of wasteful persistence with costly unproductive and frequently economically obstructionist political policies which run counter to the country&#x2019;s best interest.</block>

<p>That is putting it in a nutshell.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Here, of course, <i>The Argus</i> and I are referring to the whole gamut of the Government&#x2019;s ideological policies of separate development and apartheid. I am referring to the inflexibly administered influx control, to the Physical Planning Act, to job reservation, to separate amenities, to forced border industrial development, to the insistence on a migratory labour system, to the paucity of educational and training facilities for our Black population, etc. These are the things which have got us into our economic mess. These are the things for which we are paying such a high price in this budget. However, I think an almost equally serious root cause of our present illness has been the profligate and extravagant spending by the Government over the last few years, spending which has been coupled to and partly financed by an unhealthily rapid expansion in the money supply. It is a fact that between 1972 and 1975 our GDP&#x2014;i.e. the measure of what we produced in money terms&#x2014;rose by 65% while Government expenditure over the same period rose by 82%&#x2014;not 65%, but 82%&#x2014;and the money supply rose by 77%. The hon. the Minister admitted in his budget speech that Government expenditure was mainly responsible for the growth of the economy last year. What a confession for any Minister of Finance to have to make! If these are not the ingredients of extravagance, of inflation, of inflationary financing, of strangulation of the private sector&#x2014;the goose that lays the golden egg&#x2014; and of an acute balance of payments problem, then I just do not know what are.</p>

<p>These are the root causes of the economic illness from which we are suffering. Let us not be hoodwinked and place all the blame on the level of our defence expenditure. In 1975, last year, our defence expenditure amounted to some 3&#x00BE;% of our GDP. This is a high figure, but it should be a bearable figure by world standards; it is a figure we should be able to afford if we had a strong, healthy and growing economy. Sir, I think it is a terrible indictment of Government mismanagement that, lulled into a fool&#x2019;s paradise by the high gold price, not foreseeing the inevitability of a downswing in the trade cycle and certainly not foreseeing the steepness of that down-swing, making no allowances for the contingencies of adversity such as the higher prices we have had to pay for oil, the Government embarked on a spending spree which was quite out of line with the productive capacity of our country and with the real ability of our country to pay.</p>

<p>I have dealt with the symptoms and causes of our illness. What is the treatment&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Finance in his budget speech last Wednesday opted for shock treatment. To <span class="col_4559-4560" refersTo="page_0962"/>try to reduce the temperature of the patient and to alleviate some of the symptoms of the illness, he has chosen harsh monetary measures and high taxes. However, like all drastic treatments of illness, this treatment has its side-effects, and some of those side-effects are very harmful. Let there be no doubt about the side-effects of higher taxes. The high marginal rate of income tax, including the loan levy, introduced in the budget, is going to hurt. It is going to mean less money in the pockets of the people to pay the higher prices for the goods they buy. It is going to inhibit productivity, particularly amongst the professional and entrepreneural classes whose productivity is already affected by the rate of marginal taxation which has been applicable to date. It is hardly worth their while to put extra effort into earning the extra rand because they are left with so little of that extra rand. It is going to exacerbate the position of married working women and it is certainly going to discourage them from offering their services in the labour market. It is going to limit severely the ability of people to save, particularly of those people who are in the best position to do so. I am concerned that there is a danger that, through its affecting the ability of people to save, it is going to prejudice the success of the Defence Bond issue which the hon. the Minister announced in his budget speech.</p>

<p>I hope that when the hon. the Minister gives us details of the loan levy, he is going to announce a higher rate of interest than has applied to loan levies in the past. I regard it as absolutely iniquitous that loan levies should carry interest at only 5% when the rate of inflation that occurs between the time they are paid and the time when they are repaid is more than double that rate with the result that the people who pay the loan levy get back in real value much less than they paid.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>It does not help that you do not pay any tax on it if the interest is less than the rate of inflation. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;after, I must say, a rather puerile interjection across the floor&#x2014;that he should consider indexation for the loan levy so that when it is repaid it will be repaid in the same value, in real terms, as when it was paid by the taxpayer. The increase in companies tax and the loan levy on companies is going to play absolute havoc with companies&#x2019; liquidity, with their cash flows and with their ability to replace assets and to keep their plants up to date, and this will apply equally to large, medium and small companies. Many companies are already battling with liquidity problems. I believe that the substantial additional impost of this budget will be a mortal blow to many businesses. But, Sir, even more serious among the effects of this budget are the increases in the sales tax and the excise duty on petrol. These, coupled with the other increases which we know to be in the pipeline&#x2014;those resulting from last September&#x2019;s devaluation and those resulting from the higher rail tariffs in terms of the Railway budget this year&#x2014;are going to give a sharp twist to the inflationary spiral, and I believe that they will largely negate any efforts which the Government has made to play its part in the anti-inflationary programme. Sir, yesterday in the Sunday Press there was a full page advertisement presumably inserted by the Anti-inflationary Committee. One of the things this advertisement had to say was to ask this question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Q: Is not the budget going to lead to more inflation&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">Answer: No, the budget is not inflationary.</block>

<p>What sort of effect does a statement like that have on a person who has just filled up his tank with petrol and who has had to pay a rand or more for that petrol. The people are going to lose respect for this anti-inflationary campaign if advertisements of this kind appear in the Press. This was an ill-advised advertisement and misleading. It is absolute poppycock and a complete waste of money. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs will recall that last Friday this House passed the Trade Practices Bill. I question the legality of this advertisement in terms of that Bill, because that Bill outlaws false and misleading advertising.</p>

<p>Sir, I am afraid I am not yet at the end of the gloomy picture. Nearly all these measures which are included in this budget are going to have a damping effect on and are going to exacerbate the tendencies which already exist in the economy, i.e. slower growth and increased unemployment, with all, the social <span class="col_4561-4562" refersTo="page_0963"/>and political consequences of that situation. We are getting into a situation which the hon. the Prime Minister said some years ago would cause him sleepless nights. There has been no indication from the Government either in the budget speech or in any other statement by Ministers, as to how they propose to deal with this situation. The whole design of these tax proposals is hardly one which is going to propagate business confidence. Therefore we can look forward once again to another year of low investment and slump conditions.</p>

<p>I repeat: It is the Government that has dragged the Republic into this unhappy dilemma. It is the inevitable consequence of the root causes which I have described, and those root causes can be laid fairly and squarely at the door of the Government. I believe that the treatment of the economy meted out by this budget is too harsh in the circumstances and that the harmful side-effects which will result from this budget will prove me right. The Minister made this statement in the budget, and I presume he knew what he was talking about&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On economic grounds I do not anticipate any serious difficulty in obtaining foreign capital.</block>

<p>If he did know what he was talking about, then I believe that the harshness of this budget should have been softened&#x2014;and softened substantially&#x2014;by financing a larger part of the deficit by borrowing instead of by higher taxation. [Interjections.] The last harsh budget which we had in the Republic was in 1971, when income tax was put up to the level of 78% including loan levies. That was a budget which, <i>inter alia,</i> was designed to curb inflation and to deal with a balance of payments problem. It is now a matter of history that that harsh budget did not curb inflation. On the contrary, inflation has been escalating ever since. It did not help the balance of payments in 1971. On the contrary, the balance of payments deteriorated in this year until the devaluation of the Rand at the end of that year. I believe there is a lesson to be learnt from that harsh budget of 1971. I believe that the lesson is that palliatives of that nature, shock treatment of that nature, are not enough unless also accompanied by curative treatment. In other words, unless the Government undertakes the correct curative treatment, it is going to be faced with a regular recurrence, and a recurrence in an intensified form, of all of our present problems and everything that that entails.</p>

<p>I believe, Sir, that the long-term curative treatment of our illness falls broadly into three parts. The first part of the curative treatment must be for the Government, on a long-term basis, to curb its expenditure and to keep the growth of Government expenditure within the limits of the growth of the GNP. I hope that the Government may already have learnt that lesson. It has certainly cut its expenditure in this budget. But I suggest that it is early days yet, and that the Government is far from home yet in this regard. It appears to me that the cuts in expenditure in this budget are postponements of expenditure rather than actual economizing on expenditure. That certainly is the case in so far as there were no increases in the salaries of civil servants, and in so far as many capital projects have been postponed, property which ultimately must inevitably go forward. It is only in this way, i.e. by keeping a curb on Government expenditure, that the private sector, which is the dynamo for growth and development in the economy and on which the whole future prosperity of our country depends, can be given its head.</p>

<p>The second part of the long-term curative treatment is that the Government must keep the growth of the money supply within the growth of the GDP. I am by no means a slave to the thinking of that famous American economist who has just visited this country, namely Dr. Milton Friedman, who advocates the control of the money supply as being a major weapon in the control of inflation, but I do consider that it is an essential element in our financial stability, an element that has been sadly lacking in recent years. Even last year, 1975, after the Government had woken up to the importance of this factor, the money supply still continued to expand at the rate of 17,4% compared with a growth in the GDP in monetary terms of only 14% and in real terms of only 2,2%. This means that the growth in the monetary supply last year was mainly financing and perpetuating inflation.</p>

<p>The third part of the curative treatment for our ills, is the most important one, and there are few signs that the Government is doing anything about it or is likely to do anything about it. This is to loosen the chains by which ideological policies are restricting productivity <span class="col_4563-4564" refersTo="page_0964"/>and the growth in the economy. The Government is a prisoner of its own policies. It hangs on to job reservation, a factor which has a far larger impact and represents a far greater threat to employers than the figures of its application indicate. It hangs on to the Physical Planning Act, and to the harsh administration of influx control which prevents Africans from being employed where their services are needed. It hangs on to an inflexible attitude with regard to border industrial development which prevents the establishment and expansion of industries where those industries can operate most productively. It hangs on to outmoded and inhuman restrictions on Africans living in White areas, such as curbing family life and prohibiting home ownership, which not only affect the happiness of these people, but also affect their productivity. It hangs on to outmoded restrictions on business rights for Africans outside the homelands, preventing African entrepreneurs from being as productive as they could be. It hangs on to a lack of sense of any urgency in providing these training programmes for Blacks which are so necessary. That is by no means the complete list or the end of the list.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must conclude by saying &#x2026; [Interjections.] that these policies must be changed if we in the Republic are going to realize our great potential, if we are going to have the economic strength and health which is necessary to secure the real safety and security of our country and if we are going to broaden the tax base so that the burden of taxation to finance State expenditure and expenditure to ensure our safety, does not continue to fall on the shoulders of such a small proportion of the taxpayers. These policies must also be changed if we are to have racial harmony and if we are to have a peaceful future in the Republic of South Africa. If they are not changed, we are going to continue to have to pay the price in harsh budgets, like the one before the House at present.</p>

<p>To sum up the attitude of this side of the House, I move as an amendment to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposals&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, while supporting the level of expenditure which is necessary to ensure the defence and security of South Africa, declines to pass the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill because the Government has, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the hon. member for Constantia and I think I agree with him in one respect, i.e. that I have never heard such a pessimistic, such a gloomy picture being painted in this House as the one he painted here. What did the hon. member really tell us&#x003F; I have listened attentively to try and ascertain the alternatives he was able to offer. I am still waiting, because all we heard from the hon. member is that we should curtail State expenditure, that we should limit the supply of money, should do away with apartheid and separate development and all measures which exist in this connection. Work reservation, the Physical Planning Act&#x2014;the lot&#x2014;have to be abolished and once we have done all this, he says we should go and borrow the extra money. This is the solution which the hon. member for Constantia offers South Africa.</p>

<p>This budget is already well known throughout South Africa and we have therefore had the opportunity to learn what the public of South Africa think of this budget. Now I want to say immediately that this is a difficult budget. But I want to add that it is also a brilliant budget. [Interjections.] It is a difficult budget because I believe that since the year 1931 monetary and financial circumstances have never been as difficult as the circumstances prevailing throughout the world today. I say it is difficult because, as has correctly been said, the measures which can be taken are sometimes of a conflicting nature&#x2014; <span class="col_4565-4566" refersTo="page_0965"/>one man&#x2019;s meat is another man&#x2019;s poison. I say it is a brilliant budget because I believe that the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;and this is his first budget&#x2014;succeeded in an almost superhuman way in presenting this country with a budget which in its entirety complies with the position, the circumstances and the needs we have to face today.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I say that this budget complies with the norms and the provisions of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council in every respect. I say this as a result of a report which was recently presented to us by the Economic Advisory Council. In this report it is expressly mentioned that this advisory council met at the end of February and on that occasion suggested a budget which agrees in every detail with that which was presented last week. The Economic Advisory Council also expressed itself in no uncertain terms in favour of quite considerable tax increases in order to cover the cost of defence. The report states further that the advisory council is convinced that everyone in South Africa must be prepared to contribute their share towards strengthening the economy, and that in the present circumstances it is the duty of every member of the community to avoid being wasteful and not try and take from the economy more than they are prepared to put back into it.</p>

<p>Now I ask what the reaction of the hon. member for Constantia is. What is the reaction of the Official Opposition to this report, to this standpoint which was adopted&#x003F; Here we have the standpoint of a body which represents practically the highest authority in the country as far as economy is concerned. We can learn what their reaction is if we read what the hon. member for Constantia said in this House last Wednesday. In his opening speech in the Second Reading debate he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For many persons the joy of life is going to be diminished by the higher duties on liquor and tobacco.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] This, Mr. Speaker, is the answer of the Official Opposition in South Africa &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; when we are dealing with problems of an international nature, when we are dealing with a recessionary position in the world, when we in South Africa have to harness all our sources and all our energies in order to be able to maintain our position here in an orderly manner. [Interjections.] This, then, is the advice, this is the standpoint of the Official Opposition. Then they say &#x201C;it takes the joy out of life&#x201D;. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Constantia actually says that an increase of one cent on a packet of cigarettes, that an increase of one cent on a tot, is too much for him and for the Official Opposition to contribute towards the safeguarding of South Africa&#x2019;s economy. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has even become necessary for the Opposition to confuse the Government&#x2019;s expenditure in respect of certain aspects, which they describe as apartheid ideology. However, I want to make it quite clear that we on this side of the House, when it comes to spending money&#x2014;however expensive it may be&#x2014;on separate development and the development of peoples in South Africa towards autonomous independence, are not prepared to apologize for it.</p>

<p>However, I want to return to the hon. member for Constantia, and I want to refer to the remarks he made in his speech here last week. One of those remarks was:</p>

<block name="quote">The economic conditions in South Africa have deteriorated within the past year.</block>

<p>Then he continues, and in a sombre, depressing way, as he alone is capable of, he says (col. 4278)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Speaker, I say that this is a sad budget and a sad day for South Africa.</block>

<p>He was almost moved to tears when he said that. As a matter of fact, he was so sad he almost moved me to tears too.</p>

<p>Yes, he wanted to cry, but he could not find the tears! Mr. Speaker, what a lack of judgment this shows for the United Party&#x2019;s chief speaker on finance! What a gross error of judgment on his part!</p>

<p>Only two days later the <i>Financial Mail</i> appeared, a publication which is certainly not the most enthusiastic supporter of the Government. And what does the <i>Financial Mail</i> say&#x003F; In spite of what the hon. member for Constantia said on Wednesday&#x2014;and I repeat <span class="col_4567-4568" refersTo="page_0966"/>that he made a gross error of judgment, that he attached a completely wrong interpretation to the political and financial position in South Africa&#x2014;the <i>Financial Mail</i> says&#x2014;</p>

<p>[Interjections.] Now I want to know who is the cleverer of the two: The <i>Financial Mail</i> or the hon. member for Constantia&#x003F; [Interjections.] However, I want to tell the hon. member for Constantia that South Africa&#x2019;s voters are a group of connoisseurs.

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is why there are so few UP members. Now I want to say that, when the hon. the Minister of Finance was presenting his budget speech on 31 March in this House, there was a by-election in Alberton. The hon. member for Alberton, who has just been sworn in, is sitting over there. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, at a quarter to four on that afternoon the contents of this year&#x2019;s budget was known throughout South Africa. The United Party put up posters at the ballot-box at Alberton to try and frighten the people of South Africa with the contents of this budget. Sir, for weeks the English and Afrikaans newspapers, have been telling us what Horwood was going to do to us. According to the newspapers, what he was going to do was similar to what Jan Ellis said to the man behind him in <i>Funny People.</i> What happened on that day, Sir&#x003F; On that day 6 801 Nationalists voted for the National Party and 952 for the United Party. Mr. Speaker, &#x201C;it was indeed a gloomy day&#x201D;. Economically it was a black day for the United Party because they also lost their deposit on that day. What should have been a sad day indeed for South Africa, became &#x201C;a good day for South Africa and a black day for the United Party&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia alleged &#x201C;that economic conditions have deteriorated within the last year.&#x201D; Sir, I had a look around in order to determine what the position is; I took a few newspapers in order to determine whether his assertion is correct. Before me I have a few newspapers, from which I want to read a few extracts&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hendlers: Wins styg stewig. Hendlers Metal Industries het in die ses maande tot einde November sy belaste wins met sowat 45% opgestoot.</block>

<p>Then we read that Tedelex increased its profit by 600%. We read that the taxable profit of Marshall Industrials increased by 22% in the six months up to the end of December. Furthermore, we read that Gallo&#x2019;s profit increased by 52%. The last one I want to quote, Anglo American Corporation, in spite of the drop in the gold price, increased its consolidated taxable profit for the year ending 31 December by almost 12% to the colossal amount of R84 million. Sir, it does not sound to me as if this is a reflection of poor conditions. It does not sound to me as if it should move us to tears. It does not sound to me as if this reflects a tragic situation as that hon. member would like to make out. Sir, let us quickly determine what the declared objectives and goals of this budget were. Firstly, it was to make adequate provision for defence; secondly, to bring about economic preparedness; and, thirdly to safeguard and strengthen our balance of payments position and to curb inflation. Let us measure these objectives according to the budget, bearing in mind the words of the hon. the Minister when he says that there is a time in the history of every nation when stronger forces, political as well as economic, necessitate a different approach. Sir, we say&#x2014;and every good South African says this except for these cowards who are leaving the country, that if ever there was such a time it is now. We are pleased that the Opposition supports us this year as far as defence is concerned. Sir, this is a completely new note. Only last year the standpoint of the hon. member for Hillbrow was that one could buy 100 tractors for the price of one tank. Sir, this is a totally negative standpoint. I want to ask him if it is still his idea that we must safeguard South Africa&#x2019;s borders by buying 100 tractors instead of one tank. Sir, I am <span class="col_4569-4570" refersTo="page_0967"/>pleased that the Opposition accepts this idea but I am sorry that they qualify it with reservations such as &#x201C;apartheid marches on&#x201D;, etc. If the hon. member for Constantia, instead of making the statements he made to <i>The Cape Times,</i> instead of saying &#x201C;apartheid marches on&#x201D;, rather told <i>The Cape Times,</i> that he appealed to all the supporters of the United Party and the people of South Africa to buy defence bonds, he would have made a positive contribution. Sir, the hon. member had a great deal to say about the question as to whether this Budget was inflationary.</p>

<p>In his statement to <i>The Cape Times,</i> if I interpreted it correctly, he says: &#x201C;The budget is highly inflationary.&#x201D; Then he continues: &#x201C;The budget would again refuel inflation.&#x201D; Sir, I think this was another error of judgment. I do not think he interpreted this budget correctly. I can call in no better witness in this connection than a person who is actively dealing with inflation, a man who eats, sleeps and drinks inflation, namely Dr. Lawrence McCrystal. What does Dr. McCrystal say&#x003F; He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die begroting is &#x2019;n prysenswaardige poging om die Regering se ondememing in die anti-inflasiemanifes gestand te doen.</block>

<p>&#x201C;A highly commendable effort.&#x201D; In yesterday&#x2019;s edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> Dr. McCrystal says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He reasons like this: First, Government spending is down in real terms and the deficit that does exist is being financed in a non-inflationary manner. That portion of the deficit that is being financed from foreign borrowing and from withdrawal from the Stabilization Fund will probably be counterbalanced by purchases overseas anyway, so that the amount of new money that this budget will bring into the system is pretty well minimal.</block>

<p>This is the expressed opinion of Lawrence McCrystal. The hon. member may perhaps not have much confidence or faith in Lawrence McCrystal, but what does Aubrey Dickman of Anglo American say&#x003F; He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I don&#x2019;t think it is right to categorize the budget as inflationary despite increases in taxation.</block>

<p>What does Assocom, one of the authoritative bodies in South Africa, say&#x003F; It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The budget is a realistic but tough one under the economic and political circumstances now facing the Republic. The need to give the fight against inflation and the balance of payments positive priority in an economic policy does mean that inevitably the expected upturn in the economy is now likely to be delayed to 1977.</block>

<p>Sir, they accept the contents of this budget as anti-inflationary. What does the Federated Chamber of Industries say&#x003F; It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This budget is to be welcomed as a well balanced package.</block>

<p>I think that we can certainly accept the statements of all these authoritative bodies in preference to the statement of the hon. member for Constantia. These are people who know what they are talking about.</p>

<p>You know, Sir, Tielman Roos said: &#x201C;A UP member is a strange thing. If you ask him &#x2018;What is two times two&#x003F;&#x2019; then he says &#x2018;Five&#x2019;. If you say to him, &#x2018;but two times two is not five, it is four,&#x2019; then he says: &#x2018;That may be so, but where were you during the Boer War&#x003F;&#x201D;&#x2019; This is the kind of argument one gets from hon. members on that side too. The idea has never been that this Budget should be deflationary; it has always been intended to be anti-inflationary. The idea has never been to present a &#x201C;balanced budget&#x201D; or a neutral budget. This would have smothered the economy completely. Therefore we have before us a conservative, realistic budget. The problems which confronted the Minister were a recessional condition in the world, the declining growth rate, the cost inflation and the low gold price. What was he asked to do&#x003F; He had to tighten up defence; he had to honour the undertakings given by the State in terms of the anti-inflation manifest; he had to leave scope for a positive growth rate in at least production potential. The Minister had to sweat it out. What were the foreseeable options&#x003F; They were only: possible State loans locally and abroad, withdrawals from the Stabilization Fund and fiscal measures. I think that Assocom&#x2019;s final summary can be taken as correct when they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4571-4572" refersTo="page_0968"/>The broad economic strategy reflected in the budget speech is realistic and the sacrifices inevitable.</block>

<p>It is a fact that foreign loans do not have to be inflationary, because we can spend the amount we receive in that way, abroad. Internal loans do not have to be inflationary, and the direct taxes are indeed not inflationary. The indirect taxes do not have to be inflationary, except for a portion thereof, and except for the amount of R240 million taken from the Stabilization Account. May I in respect of the argument of the hon. member for Constantia to the effect that the higher taxes are inflationary, once again refer hon. members to the <i>Financial Mail.</i> As long ago as in February they said the following in connection with the increase of taxes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the more difficult tasks facing M.P.s in the months ahead will be to convince the public that tax increases are actually deflationary, that is that they will help to bring down real demand so that it more closely matches supply. Only if this serious imbalance is removed can one hope that the balance of payments will come right or that the rate of inflation will fall. Tax increases in the present recessionary climate, in which the bargaining power of labour is weak, are deflationary because they cut into disposable incomes and thus into spending, even more so if the taxes are indirect. Since indirect taxes immediately push prices up, that may seem hard to believe, but it is true nevertheless. Indeed, in today&#x2019;s climate price increases are exceedingly deflationary.</block>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this is the opinion of these people, and I also think it answers the hon. member for Constantia in this connection, i.e. whether or not these tax increases are inflationary. Sir, the hon. member also spoke of &#x201C;a broadening of the base&#x201D;, and so on. We are aware of the fact that we have a narrow tax base in South Africa. We are aware of the fact that a great burden rests upon the shoulders of the White taxpayers. We know that all the Opposition&#x2019;s solution amounts to is that they suggest that we do away with all restrictive measures, including apartheid, work reservation, etc. But, Sir, I want to tell the hon. member that although I agree that the taxes imposed on companies and the burden on business enterprise are heavy, I nevertheless believe that it is worth while. I believe that commerce and industry are also prepared and willing to contribute their share. I believe that it is a sounder policy to use one&#x2019;s own capital resources instead of incurring loans and obligations. I believe that financial discipline is essential now. I believe that we should tackle our problems in a realistic way without running away from them. I believe that the sooner we get stuck in, the better it will be for us.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say in respect of the Budget that it is a pragmatic and realistic Budget. I believe that the Government did not hesitate to adopt the right standpoint. I believe that it is a Budget with which we shall inspire confidence both in and outside South Africa, because it proves to countries abroad that this Government is able to do what must be done. I believe that it is a budget which South Africa needs for an early recovery, and in this connection I want to quote what Dr. Jan Marais recently said in the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i> I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This year <i>all</i> South Africans will have to make a contribution towards strengthening the foundation upon which future growth and prosperity may be built.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I conclude by agreeing with the <i>Financial Mail</i> for once in my life when I say: &#x201C;Hats off to Horwood!&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I read the other day that the hon. the Minister of Finance was born under the sign of Sagittarius. It struck me, therefore, that the budget could perhaps best be typified by using that sign and saying: &#x201C;He shot an arrow in the air; where it fell, he did not care&#x201D;. I think that really is a description one could give of this budget. The hon. member for Ermelo decided that as far as he was concerned this was a brilliant budget. I have had the experience in this House of having listened to three budgets. They have got worse as we have gone along, but the praise for them has become more and more extravagant. I also have a fairly good memory of the hon. the Minister of Finance talking <span class="col_4573-4574" refersTo="page_0969"/>about the <i>Financial Mail.</i> I remember him attacking it and saying that the sort of things it published should not be allowed to be published. He got quite carried away with what he regarded as being the incorrect statements that were published by the <i>Financial Mail.</i> For once it seems to me that the Minister is right in respect of this issue of the <i>Financial Mail</i> to which the hon. member for Ermelo referred. But, of course, the hon. member for Ermelo only referred to those portions of the <i>Financial Mail</i> which suited his particular purpose. He did not, for example, read that it also had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While on the subject of camouflage, what of the anti-inflationary manifesto&#x003F; Businessmen are faced with on the one hand profit curbs from direct and indirect taxation and most certainly rising distribution costs, and on the other, wage demands from employees faced with a sudden drop in their income. As one disillusioned industrialist put it, &#x201C;Louwrens Muller with his rail tariff hikes torpedoed the manifesto; Owen Horwood has administered the <i>coup de gr&#x00E2;ce.&#x201D;</i></block>

<p>I think that could not have been in the issue of the <i>Financial Mail</i> referred to by the hon. member for Ermelo, otherwise I am sure he would have been willing to quote it. Mr. Speaker, 20 months ago, in August 1974, we in this House listened to a budget speech. We were told that South Africa was powerful and that there was strong growth. We were told that the rand remained a strong monetary unit in an uncertain world. Reference was made to &#x201C;another year of progress and prosperity&#x201D;. That is what we were told. The hon. the Minister, during the last budget, said: &#x201C;I am quite convinced that as far as gold is concerned, we are on a wonderful wicket.&#x201D; That was on 14 April of last year. He said that there would be an upswing in 1976 and that he was therefore going to be moderately expansionist. On 14 April he said: &#x201C;Output is increasing at 4&#x00BD;% at the moment.&#x201D; On 26 March he had this to say: &#x201C;The rand can today undoubtedly be regarded as a strong currency.&#x201D; He went on to say, on 17 June, which is a significant date: &#x201C;We have a balance of payments position which is sound right up to this moment.&#x201D; Only a man who did not know the facts could have said that, and I have some doubt as to whether the hon. the Minister knew the facts or did not know them at that moment in time. He said also: &#x201C;We are in a country whose economic growth is burgeoning.&#x201D; He became all emotional about an article that had appeared in <i>The Cape Times,</i> in which Mr. Murray&#x2014;not the hon. member for Green Point, but the trade unionist&#x2014;was quoted as saying that living standards were shrinking steadily. He became all emotional and said it was &#x201C;an absolutely incorrect statement&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The truth is that we today have a growth rate of 2&#x00BC;%, on the Minister&#x2019;s own admission, while the population is increasing at a greater rate. Is that not reducing living standards, or has the Minister forgotten his economics&#x003F; [Interjections.] The per capita situation in South Africa is negative, and the hon. the Minister knows it. It is no use pretending it is not. Sir, the unfortunate thing about the hon. the Minister is that he resents criticism. He is optimistic to an extent which is quite unrelated to reality. He has an inability to read the economic signs correctly. He seems to have no adequate economic model or policy on which to work, and no clear definition of what the priorities are to be. The hon. the Minister keeps talking about cyclical movements. If he looks at some of the writings which are available in South Africa on what in fact is involved in the business cycle, he will see that, in the present situation we are in, we do not have the classic symptoms which are associated with a business cycle, because at a time when we are at a low point in the business cycle, we do not have low imports, we do not have relatively low interest rates and we do not have a current account which is in surplus. The hon. Minister can yawn about it if he likes to. That might be his attitude towards this budget, but I want to tell him that he appears not to appreciate &#x2026;</p>

<p>Why does the hon. the Minister then yawn when an hon. member is making a speech&#x003F; [Interjections.] If anything, I promise the hon. the Minister that I shall keep him awake. The fact is that the hon. the Minister is suffering from a great delusion <span class="col_4575-4576" refersTo="page_0970"/>if he believes that the difficulties we are in are cyclical or non-structural. This is the tragedy behind the whole budget, namely that the hon. the Minister fails to realize the structural problems we have to face. He thinks we are merely in a cyclical position and that everything will come right. He is like the master of a ship with the rudder not working, with the engines not working, but he has the sails up and is hoping for a favourable wind that will take his ship somewhere where it will be safe. In the meantime, all he is saying is: &#x201C;All hands to the pumps; otherwise we are going to sink.&#x201D; This is the tragedy of the hon. the Minister of Finance and his handling of the position at the moment.</p>

<p>Let us look at what I believe are 13 serious consequences, for South Africans, which flow from this budget.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is a baker&#x2019;s dozen.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is 13. Thirteen is a lucky number both for the hon. the Prime Minister and myself. There is no doubt&#x2014;although the hon. the Minister of Finance keeps denying it&#x2014;that there is going to be a reduction in living standards for the average South African as a result of this budget. The issue which the hon. the Minister has not been able to deal with is whether this reduction in living standards is to be transient or whether it is now to be a long-term or even a permanent characteristic in the lives of South Africans. It is a question the hon. the Minister failed to answer in his budget speech, while South Africa was waiting for his answer. The hon. the Minister speaks very glibly of the fact that unemployment is not yet serious. But, with great respect, if we look at what is happening to the economy, the real danger of unemployment is there with all its social and political consequences for South Africa in the context in which we live. We talk about inflation and one thing is very clear&#x2014;I have quoted from th<i>e Financial Mail</i> with which the hon. the Minister is now so pleased. Sales tax, whichever way one looks at it, is inflationary, particularly if it is applied to essentials. Nobody can tell me that matches, razor-blades and household goods are not essentials in the community in which we live. What is happening, is that the issue as to what is becoming a luxury in South Africa is changing. What used to be regarded as an essential is now to be regarded as a luxury under the new r&#x00E9;gime. That is why the hon. member for Ermelo is able to speak quite so contemptuously of the ordinary man who wants to drink his glass of beer. That is now to be a luxury in the circumstances under which we live.</p>

<p>Let us look at petroleum products in particular. Thirty-six per cent of all petroleum is used by the private motorist, 36% by industry, 11% by agriculture, 10% by commerce, 5% by aviation and 2% by sundry others. The effect of this is that inflation will seep right through the system and will be felt in increasing measures as we go along. We talk about the fact that this is going to mean a reduction in disposable income. The hon. member for Ermelo said it was a very good thing to have a reduction in disposable income. Did the hon. member not say it&#x003F; In fact, the hon. member quoted from an old issue of the <i>Financial Mail</i> in order to try and substantiate his point. A reduction in disposable income may be of assistance in reducing demand inflation, but even the hon. the Minister had to say that this was not the major inflation problem he was facing, but that he was faced with a cost-push situation. With great respect, to reduce disposable income at this stage, will be to have an adverse effect on not only the private individual, but also on industry and commerce. One will have a reduction in demand and price increases which will follow it.</p>

<p>I now come to the fifth point, that of salary increases. In his budget the hon. the Minister was dead silent about salary increases for the Public Service. Is the hon. the Minister, in reply to this debate going to say what is going to happen about public servants and their salaries, or must we wait for the, Additional estimates which may put a completely different complexion on what is going to happen during this financial year&#x003F; I think the hon. the Minister has a duty&#x2014;as he has always had&#x2014;to get up in this House and say what is going to happen to public servants during the course of this year.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of consumer confidence. I think the hon. the Minister is destroying consumer confidence in South Africa, and this will have a long-term effect on commerce and industry in the years that lie ahead. I have dealt with the lack of growth in the GNP, and I now come to the fact that the hon. the Minister relies for our future on the <span class="col_4577-4578" refersTo="page_0971"/>fact that if the economies of our trading partners improve, everything will come right. In other words, it is not what he is going to do that is going to put things right. He is, in fact, relying on what is going to happen in other parts of the world to determine the degree of prosperity we shall have in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then we come to the issue of the drop in after-tax profits in business. We already have liquidity problems, particularly with the credit ceiling that has been imposed. The public is going to be increasingly pushed as far as that debt is concerned. Periods for debts will have to become shorter because of the action that has been taken under this budget.</p>

<p>Then we come to what is perhaps the most important aspect, and here I am referring to the disillusionment which is endangering the confidence necessary for investment and progress. The hon. member for Ermelo attacked the hon. member for Constantia for his pessimism. But how can one not be pessimistic about a Government that introduces measures of this kind&#x003F; We in these benches are optimistic about South Africa, but pessimistic when it comes to the handling of South Africa&#x2019;s economy by the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Let me now deal with the events in southern Africa. The danger of events in southern Africa, political events, affecting overseas confidence, is something that cannot be ignored. However, the hon. the Minister passes this off as a remote possibility, as something one simply has to bear in mind. What we are actually faced with, however, is a very real situation, not merely an academic question. There is also, of course, the balance of payments position. At a low point in the economy, as every work on the subject reveals, one must be flush on current account or have a very small deficit. Yet contrary to all the economic rules, if this is indeed a cyclical situation, we have a balance of payments problem which has reached disconcerting proportions. Perhaps it should be mentioned that at a time when one should be giving people an incentive to work and should be encouraging productivity, the hon. the Minister does not give that encouragement. On the contrary, he puts up the marginal tax rates so that there will be an even greater lack of incentive than there is at the present moment. The hon. the Minister knows that South Africans are prepared to tighten belts if they have to, but there is another matter the hon. the Minister must take a look at, and that is that the public would like to see the Government doing the same. They do not want to see excessive Government expenditure all around them. Examples in the Press, over the past day or two, of extravagant entertainment are not examples that should be allowed to pass without mention. The chairman of the Board of Governors states that the money spent by the SABC does not come from the taxpayers. That is very strange, because my estimates have an amount under the Education Vote of R12 million for that purpose. Yet Dr. Meyer has the nerve to state that this money does not come from the taxpayer. When one asks members of the public to tighten their belts, one is obliged to set them an example. It should not be the other way around. However, this is something the hon. the Minister does not seem to appreciate. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let me ask, in respect of this budget, whether the members of the public really know the facts. When the budget was debated last year, the Exchequer Account was running at an abnormal deficit. The deficit for the June quarter was over R500 million. The hon. the Minister, however, should presumably know what is happening, at least on a monthly basis, but he said nothing. On the contrary, in the Third Reading of the budget last year, he confirmed his over-exuberance. He said not a word about this matter. This deficit continued and was, to a considerable extent, financed from the monetary banking sector. This is a classically inflationary procedure. If we also look at the deficit of R853 million on the Exchequer Account at the end of September, the drop in earnings from commodity exports, the drop in the gold price and the resultant anticipated drop in the tax earnings from these sources, we find that these constituted one of the reasons we were not told about for the devaluation. The reason was to improve the Exchequer receipts and to get more tax, the Government benefiting not only from taxation on higher rand export earnings but also from the higher import costs in rands. This caused inflation, thus increasing customs, excise and sales duties on imported goods which would otherwise not have increased in price but which did, in fact, increase in price by virtue of devaluation. It is significant that the hon. the Minister said in his budget speech that customs, exicse and sales duties realized R48 million more than was estimated.</p>

<p><span class="col_4579-4580" refersTo="page_0972"/>There is a further point. The Exchequer payments appear to have dropped remarkably in the two months before the Budget, in a manner quite inconsistent with the pattern set in previous years. The Afrikaans Sunday newspaper <i>Rapport</i> yesterday suggested that payments were deliberately being withheld. However, there may be another possibility. Transit payments may have been dealt with in a particular manner. Will the hon. the Minister, however, tell us whether something went wrong with the Reserve Bank computer at a crucial time&#x003F; What is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation for all of this&#x003F; What will the April and May payments now be&#x003F; Are they now going to be extremely large&#x003F; Perhaps he will give us the figures when we come to the Third Reading debate. <i>Rapport</i> yesterday virtually accused the hon. the Minister of window-dressing&#x003F; It is quite remarkable how the picture seems to have changed completely in the last few months. I wonder what the picture is going to be like at the commencement of the new financial year&#x003F; Perhaps the hon. the Minister will give us the net foreign reserves, and perhaps he will also give us the borrowings, particularly the short-term borrowing in the first quarter of this year. Perhaps he will also give us the terms, particularly the periods and the amounts, of the gold swap. Then we would be able to sit in judgment on the article in <i>Rapport</i> and be able to ascertain whether there has been or has not been any window-dressing.</p>

<p>Perhaps one has to look at these estimates with an eye to items that are going to be in the supplementary estimates. Perhaps that is how this budget has been presented. I think that the public is asking whether they have been told everything about this budget. They are perhaps wondering whether we have been told all the facts as they are.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia spoke about separate development. However, I should like to approach the matter from a slightly different angle. I believe that South Africa is paying the price of apartheid. When we talk about the structural defects in the economy, we must realize that this is what it is all about. Billion&#x2019;s and billions are being spent on implementing apartheid, and this is now coming home to roost. The public must know that one cannot have an unproductive movement of people, that one cannot have an unnecessary duplication of services, that one cannot create a massive bureaucracy to implement an unending list of laws designed to perpetuate the very ideology that saps the economy and that one cannot seek to create jobs at abnormally high prices in ideologically selected areas without having to pay the price for all of this eventually.</p>

<p>There is another issue involved. In the present circumstances it seems that this budget should actually have been a watershed. People were looking to see whether this would be a turning point which would ensure the safety and security of South Africa. The hon. the Minister and the Government are pre-occupied with events taking place outside of South Africa. We do not underestimate the seriousness of those events, but we believe that events inside South Africa are more important and potentially more dangerous. The hon. the Minister quoted Adam Smith to the effect that defence comes before opulence. I believe that economic strength is essential to defence in South Africa. It is necessary not just to pay for the defence, not just to create the image of being the powerhouse of Africa, but to satisfy the reasonable expectations of the emergent communities. If one cannot maintain and, in fact, improve the living standards of the Black people and hold out hope for further advancement, I do not believe one can ensure racial peace in South Africa. The events of the past year and the state of our economy at this moment in time, and also the inability to convey confidence in future decisions and actions have created I believe, a crisis of confidence. There is no confidence in the ability of the Government to handle the economy. There is no confidence that the Government has adequate plans for the future. I believe that all that is happening is that the Government is plunging us into deeper recession at the present moment in time.</p>

<p><span class="col_4581-4582" refersTo="page_0973"/>There may be palliatives for the situation created by the Government, but it does not give us the confidence that the future will in fact produce real solutions. The Secretary for Commerce has called for a national convention of all races on economic matters. We support this. However, there are more urgent plans needed. We have the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council, but it does not meet frequently enough and has insufficient direct influence on the Minister of Finance. I believe South Africa needs a budgetary committee, comprising not only Parliamentarians of all parties, but also leading businessmen, industrialists, financiers and economists. Such a committee should not only consider the budget, but should also meet at regular intervals with the Minister of Finance to consider the budget and developments as they arise from time to time. I believe that, if the hon. the Minister were to act contrary to the recommendations of the majority of such a committee, he should be obliged to report such a fact to the House. I believe that we need all the best brains in the country to get the economy right. I would hope that the Government might be big enough to appreciate this.</p>

<p>It may be said of us that we only criticize and do not provide alternatives. Therefore I think we must put the alternative as we see it. Let me say immediately that I believe the Government cannot continue to ignore the facts that are coming to light in South Africa. That is the first thing we must pay attention to. I refer to such facts as bus strikes, factory strikes, unrest over lack of housing and the public utterances of Black leaders. These are facts the Government is ignoring. We believe that the economic well-being of the people is the major item of security in the country. To allow a drop in the standard of living of the under-privileged is, I believe, to play with fire. I believe the hon. the Minister of Finance is playing with fire at this moment in time. We also believe that the budget should show the path for the future. It should indicate the economic road and not merely deal <i>ad hoc</i> with current problems. There must be a plan; there must be objectives. Our objectives are: To use the economy as an instrument to safeguard our future; to safeguard the living standards and to give hope for the legitimate aspirations of the under-privileged; to create price stability and take effective and long-term steps against inflation; to preserve the foreign reserves and take short and long-term measures to safeguard the balance of payments position; to install confidence in South Africa overseas and in local businessmen and industrialists; to encourage investment and to set the rate of growth as soon as possible at a rate sufficient for our future.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members ask &#x201C;How&#x003F;&#x201D; What should we do&#x003F; I believe that the first thing is to take steps to improve productivity and to give material incentives to workers to produce more. We should not just talk about productivity, but give people greater rewards for working longer hours and producing more. Secondly, we must utilize all the human resources that are available. One must remove the legal restrictions on their use and train and educate them in the right direction to ensure that bottlenecks do not occur. Thirdly, I believe that long-term steps must be taken to avoid the dangers to which our open economy is subject. This can be done, <i>inter alia,</i> by raising the purchasing power in the local market so as to employ the economies of scale and to make exports more competitive. Fourthly, we must utilize the business brains of South Africa in the economic planning and decision-making. I have referred to this already.</p>

<p>Let me deal specifically with certain individual aspects of the budget and indicate what we would have done and would not have done. Sir, we would not have increased the sales tax and thereby the cost of living. We would not have had an increase in the price of petrol, and we would not have removed the incentive to work by an additional tax burden. On the other hand, we would have had a sales tax on truly luxury items and we would also have had a sales tax payable at the retail level to avoid the additional mark-up on tax. To fight inflation, we would have avoided the tax increases of an inflationary nature. We would have introduced an index savings bond; we would not have used the inflationary form of financing which the Government used to a considerable extent in 1975. We would borrow more overseas and from non-monetary banking sectors in South Africa. We would use a zero-base budgeting system under which each item of the budget has to be justified anew. We would also cut down on Government expenditure in respect <span class="col_4583-4584" refersTo="page_0974"/>of non-productive ideological matters. Furthermore, we would not move people in the manner in which this Government does and we would eliminate the bureaucracy which implements discriminatory practices. As regards growth, we would not have growth in the broad sense for its own sake, but growth in the sectors which are of real benefit to the economy and the people. We would hurry up with the system of inflation accounting. We would cut back on the import of luxuries. We would standardize more in the production of local products and we would take more drastic steps to stop the leads and lags speculation. We would give the working married women a better tax deal to encourage them to work. We would also give greater relief to the private pensioner who saved for his old age, was hit by inflation and is being ignored by the hon. the Minister. We would encourage older people to work; we would abolish the means test. If we were the Government we would set an example to the public. We would not ask them to do things which we, as the Government, were not prepared to do ourselves.</p>

<p>I want to touch briefly on the balancing of the budget. The hon. the Minister spoke of loans and said he transferred a substantial portion to the Stabilization Fund. However, the major portion of those loans was actually raised in the second half of last year. By transferring them out at the last minute, the hon. the Minister now has a far smaller balance at the beginning of the financial year. If one looks at the budget as a whole and one allows the increased special price to fall away, if one applies the sales duty only to luxury items and if increases in company tax and personal tax were to fall away, one would need another R321 million. That one could find relatively easily by using the loans that were raised in the second half of last year&#x2014;which were, I believe, wrongly transferred to the Stabilization Fund&#x2014;and by borrowing another R90 million locally and another R75 million overseas. The increases in taxation are quite unjustified and are not warranted in the present circumstances.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to refer briefly to defence. I believe there is a strong case to be made out for a large professional army. I believe that the call-up system will become increasingly disruptive and is going to cost the economy more. I believe that a citizens&#x2019; army is necessary for emergencies, but also that we need what I should like to call a bushfire army of professionals. I should like to see two fully professional brigades which would be highly equipped, highly mobile and highly trained. I believe this would be cheaper and more effective for South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was my doubtful privilege this afternoon to listen to two great economists in South Africa&#x2014;the hon. members for Yeoville and Constantia. The hon. the Minister of Finance referred the other day to Adam Smith when he said that defence was of far greater importance than wealth. We have already had great economists like Lord J. A. Keynes, a great British economist of the &#x2018;thirties, and Mr. Milton Freedman of America, but I wonder what those people would say if they had to listen to those two hon. members and hear how they want to govern South Africa, how they want to pull our economy right and what they want to do. In the course of my speech I want to refer to matters raised by the hon. members, but I want at the outset to tell the hon. member for Yeoville that I am sorry that he was not a trifle more original. I am also very sorry that he was guilty of suspicion-mongering this afternoon. I should like him to elaborate further on his reference to &#x201C;window dressing&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo pointed out that the Economic Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister met and that this is the body on which all the businessmen of South Africa are represented, including those supporting the parties of the hon. members of the Opposition. I do not wish to deal with this any further: I shall come to it again in the course of my speech. The Economic Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister gave very clear guidance early this year. At the beginning of this year the hon. member for Yeoville made a great fuss about the fact that the hon. the Minister of Finance had apparently not kept pace with the true price of gold last year. Why did the hon. member not tell us what the true price of gold was going to be this year&#x003F; Why did the hon. member not tell us this afternoon what the actual budget items should have been&#x003F; Why did he not tell us what amount we should regard as being the price of gold and what revenue we were going to earn in the form of taxation on gold&#x003F; He should also have indicated to us what revenue we were going to derive from customs and excise duties. I want to predict at this early stage that next year, after he has obtained all the facts of this year, he will again give to understand that he was all-knowing this year and predicted everything correctly. Why does he not come to light with those facts this year&#x003F; We will note what he has to say next year. The hon. member made certain statements and said that a tremendous amount of growth would have to be brought about by various sectors. He also said that there would be no consumer confidence. The hon. member made a number of statements which are not economically justifiable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mention one of them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I will mention a whole series of them. There is one point to which I want to return and I want to start with the very first portion of the budget speech of the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister mentioned three points with which the budget has to comply. The first one was the defence of the country. I am very pleased that the hon. Opposition as well as the hon. member for Yeoville intimated that they support the defence budget. The following statement of the hon. the Minister was that our economic defensibility had to be maintained, that our balance of payments position had to improve, that inflation had to be curbed and that our economic growth had to be maintained while we would also have to see to the needs of our less privileged people. The hon. the Minister did what President Woodrow Wilson prescribed at one time when he said that what one had to do was to give light and not heat. The hon. the Minister has given light in South Africa and it is now the task of the private sector, the consumer, the employees&#x2014;yes, everyone&#x2014;to follow the path indicated by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Before I discuss the budget itself, I should <span class="col_4587-4588" refersTo="page_0976"/>like to refer to something that is happening in South Africa at the moment. We have a certain psychosis in South Africa today and I think that the time has come for one to refer to it. Hon. members of the Opposition also suffer from that psychosis. Everyone thinks that everything must be done by the Government&#x2014;by the Government and only by the Government&#x2014;and no citizen of this country, no employer, no employee, no viewholder or anybody at all has any responsibility or task. I also want to refer to our newspapers in South Africa. I am not referring to the reporters or to those who collect information, but to a certain small group who sit in their offices and, as we have learnt to know them and have heard of them, write headings for certain articles. This kind of heading writer tries to create a sensation or to see what he can do to promote the sale of the newspaper. However, I want to make an appeal to those people and ask them, before they write a heading, please to use their common sense and to consider the harm which such a heading might cause South Africa. When the Part Appropriation Bill was being discussed here earlier this year, we saw the following heading in a newspaper of 9 February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Belastingskokke in vandag se begroting.</block>

<p>The Second Reading speech on the Part Appropriation Bill was only to be made that afternoon, but here one of the midday newspapers was already telling us in advance that there were going to be tax shocks. Was there any shock&#x003F; No! Why then this type of heading&#x003F;</p>

<block name="quote">Guns, not butter budget.</block>

<p>These are headings which I do not think do our newspapers any credit. I do not think that it is to their advantage or that of South Africa to print headings of this nature while the content of the articles to which they refer is completely different. I want now to mention the names of certain newspapers. I mention <i>The Argus</i> of 31 March with the heading&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Emphasis on economic and military preparedness. Defence big influence on budget.</block>

<p>This was positive. To people who understand this it shows that there is a necessity to have a budget to promote defence for the safeguarding of South Africa and all its people. <i>The Star,</i> on the other hand, had the following heading&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Boost for pensioners.</block>

<p>Sir, that is something positive. I do not wish to quote everything from the <i>Financial Mail</i> which was quoted by the hon. member for Ermelo, but this paper did say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hats off to Horwood!</block>

<p>Sir, I want to make an appeal to those people today. I did not see one of the newspapers which said &#x201C;Bravo!&#x201D; for the budget, or made an appeal to people to make a positive contribution towards the promotion of the economy of our country, the question of defence and everything else I will deal with piecemeal here just now. The Opposition was again silent about certain matters. They said that the Government was simply taking everything away. I want just to refer to a speech which the hon. the Minister made in Durban on 17 November in which he made it very clear that 549 000 individuals had been repaid an amount of R48 million in loan levies, and that there were 24 700 companies which had been repaid an amount of R26 million, a total of R74 million. Why do they not mention these matters&#x2014;that money that has been repaid&#x003F; This is an amount of R74 million that has been ploughed back, and yet they complain about the few million rand in loan levies that is to be collected under this budget. We also heard the complaint about the power the hon. the Minister will have to be able to change tariffs in the year that lies ahead according to the recommendations of the Franzsen Commission and also in pursuance of the mission of the International Monetary Fund which was here last year and which stated that the hon. the Minister should definitely have that power. I just want to point out that the hon. the Minister is only asking for the power to change the loan levy to 10% of the basic tax. Sir, it can only be reduced and not increased because it is already 10% of the basic tax. If it were 5%, we could have said that the hon. the Minister could impose a further 5% levy, but it is already 10% and the power which the hon. the Minister is asking for is simply to increase it to 10% of the basic tax. In other words, all this talk directed at the outside world carries no weight. The hon. the Minister can only reduce taxation in order to advance South Africa further.</p>

<p>Sir, we in South Africa have a capitalistic system where profit is the great norm. I want to put this question to hon. members on the other side: Why do they not help us to defend this capitalistic system in South Africa&#x003F; Why are they trying to break certain things down&#x003F; In South Africa it is the task of the entrepreneur to make his capital and expertise and energy available, to harness all the production factors and to produce. He employs the labourer and he pays for his services. I want to say that the remuneration that the labourer in South Africa has received over the past 25 years&#x2014;I am not going to mention all the figures here&#x2014;has increased. He has received more of that cake than the entrepreneur has received. There is after all a difference and I think it is high time that we should tell these people that the labourer in South Africa must not imagine that he is receiving less. What is the State doing in this process, for example, to promote this capitalistic system through the medium of this budget and not to have the distribution of wealth which these hon. members have advocated and in regard to which they have not yet replied to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; The function and the task of the <span class="col_4591-4592" refersTo="page_0978"/>State is to establish an infrastructure. What does this involve&#x003F; There is water, power, transport, communications, a defence force to protect the country, the administration of the country that has to be there, and so forth. The State makes all these things available to enable those people to produce. There is also the training of labour. This is in the interests of the labourer as well as of the employer and this is done through the medium of schools and universities and by the training of teachers, by technical training and immigration where we have a shortage of a certain kind of manpower. It is also the task of the Government to promote this capitalistic system by protecting the monetary system and preventing erosion, to combat inflation and to make food subsidies and so forth available so that the producer can continue to produce. If there were no subsidies I want to say very clearly that many of our sectors would not be able to continue because they would be priced out of the market. The consumer would not be able to afford those products and they would fall away. That is what the State does. There is however, a task and a responsibility which rests upon the employee as well as on the employer. They have to dovetail with one another. It is also the function of the employer to ensure that his workmen are trained and also to ensure that his own employees have a higher standard of living. That is not simply the task of the Government. The Government does not manage the factories. The employer and the employee have to ensure that they do everything to enable the consumer in this country to receive his share as well. Everyone, employer and employee, is a consumer of something. That is why it is necessary in this country for not only the Government but the Opposition as well to do something, and I want to ask them to encourage their people to ensure that this system is maintained and expanded.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville had a great deal to say about petrol prices that have been increased. Why did he neglect to tell this House what the petrol prices are in the rest of the world today&#x003F; As the petrol price stands at the moment, here locally it will be 21,4 cents per litre at the coast and in Pretoria and on the Witwatersrand 23,8 cents per litre. This is in respect of the 93 octane rating petrol. But what is the price abroad&#x003F; In France it is not 23,8 cents as in Pretoria and on the Reef; there it is 30,4 cents, our cents, per litre. In Great Britain it is 33,2 cents, in Italy 40,8 cents and in Portugal, 45,1 cents per litre. Those are the prices that those people pay, and we are a long way away from our import countries. After all, it is far easier for those countries to obtain oil. However, the hon. member neglected to tell us this. I want to tell him that if things are going so badly in South Africa, why is it that the Whites here have the second highest number of cars per 1 000 of the population in the entire world&#x003F; In the USA it is 480 cars per 1 000 while here in South Africa it is 384 per 1 000. In Canada it is 356, West Germany 269, Britain 252 and Holland 243. We in this country certainly have no reason to complain and, when we speak of saving, all we need do is watch our roads every morning. If we do this we will see that most cars have only one occupant. These people do not make use of public transport, neither do they try to get a lift with each other to work. A man told me recently that he was one of a number of partners who stayed near to one another but that each one of them drove to work each morning in his own car. When I asked him why, he said that they could afford to do so and that it was also more convenient. That is the sort of psychosis prevailing in South Africa that has to be eliminated.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Yeoville and Constantia spoke this afternoon about the high taxes, but how high are our taxes really in South Africa&#x003F; Take company tax. Here it is basically 40% plus the surcharge of 3% and a loan levy of 6%, and that loan is repaid to them with 5% interest. After all is said and done that is not a tax. In Britain they pay 52% in tax, and in France 50%. We can go on in this way. As far as income tax in South Africa is concerned it is also not so terribly high. In terms of the new tax plan a married man in South Africa will pay only R84 more over and above the R56 which he has to pay in respect of the loan levy, and he does so to be safe in South Africa. A married man with two children and earning R5 000 only pays R41 more while a man earning R10 000 will pay plus-minus R174 more. Is this something to complain about&#x003F; I say that the taxpayers are prepared to pay these additional amounts. The only complaints one hears come from that group of politicians sitting here in front of me. They are the people who feel badly about this. However, they have nothing else to complain about; they have to look for something to <span class="col_4593-4594" refersTo="page_0979"/>complain about and that is why they come to light with this sort of complaint. The hon. member for Yeoville spoke about unemployment. I want to ask the hon. member whether he realizes that 24 members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have said that in May of last year 15 million of their economically active people were unemployed and that this figure had risen to 17 million this year&#x003F; What is the position in South Africa&#x003F; In December 1974 we had only 8 823 unemployed among the Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>We must look further at this position. The hon. member must just remember that in 1974 there were 482 000 Bantu employed here in South Africa who came here from elsewhere. These were not South African Bantu but foreign Bantu. They work on the mines and elsewhere. In 1975 this figure was 414 000. The mines experienced many problems with their employees and recruited local Bantu. Ninety-six per cent of their labour requirements have been satisfied today, but why did the mines not also employ that remaining 4%&#x003F; I do not think that they are going to do so because the mines have mechanized. We find that the mining industry is mechanizing and replacing Bantu labour by this means. I do not wish to find fault with that. The Opposition always speak of the Bantu who work elsewhere. Does the hon. member realize that this is the way of life and tradition of the Bantu&#x003F; I had a group of Bantu recently who simply took leave and said that they were going back to their homeland. They had worked enough; now they were going to rest.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville also said that this budget was inflationary. But, Sir, this budget is not at all inflationary. In the first place this budget is financed from taxes. That money is forthcoming from the community. There cannot be any greater demand. People will have less money. The money that is being borrowed, is being borrowed from the non-banking sector. This is not inflationary either. Furthermore, the foreign loans are not inflationary either. This budget is not expansionistic but neither is there anything in the budget which will prevent the economy from growing. What is more, the Government has economized apart from defence, and I want those hon. members to tell us in what other respect the Government could have economized any further. Let them mention to us any item in respect of which they should have economized. Hon. members opposite are annoyed because there have been no salary increases. Which Vote should have been further pruned&#x003F; Probably Social Welfare and Pensions! I suppose the Government should not have paid out these pensions. Facilities have been created by the Government for the private sector, for the Post Office, the Railways, Escom and so forth, to borrow money abroad. We also see that the Sishen/Saldanha railway line will be financed to the extent of plus-minus 90% by foreign loans. This is not inflationary. I want to tell the hon. Opposition that besides those foreign loans, the budget in respect of defence is also not all intended for foreign purchases. The amount of R1 350 million spent on defence this year will also to a very large extent assist the economy in South Africa and promote it. The hon. member for <span class="col_4595-4596" refersTo="page_0980"/>Yeoville is, I am sure, not ignorant in this regard. Most companies and entrepreneurs in South Africa are involved in the whole defence project.</p>

<p>There are only certain things which will have to be imported, which are not manufactured here by the private sector. I want to mention one item as an example. The vehicles which form a large part of the budget are all manufactured by the private sector in South Africa. We know what the content has to be in respect of the vehicles manufactured locally. All these things are being provided by the private sector. I should just like to mention what was said by the economist. Mr. Milton Freedman, who is in South Africa. He said something with which I am in complete agreement, namely, that the fundamental source of prosperity is not determined by the monetary authority but that it depends upon the initiative and the ability of our people to work and the ability of our people to save. This is something which our people in South Africa will have to do, namely to save more. All the people cannot save. It is true that not all the people in the lower income groups can save. However, I think that we in South Africa are living quite prosperously enough. I do not wish to take it amiss of a man if he is prosperous and lives in luxury. However, I think that we in this country could save a great deal more. The hon. member also spoke of confidence. There is a tremendous amount of confidence on the part of the outside world in South Africa, particularly when we realize that this year Britain sent 19 trade missions to this country to promote their trade with us and there is also the possibility that Israel may send a number of trade missions here. This indicates confidence in South Africa because they know that the Republic has paid every cent of its debt in the past. They know that no matter what may have happened, every contract and every undertaking concluded by the Government on behalf of South Africa&#x2014;even in the days of the United Party&#x2014;has always been honoured. There is, therefore, absolute confidence in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that this budget, as the hon. the Minister said, shows us what these funds are required for. The new method of budgeting, namely, the aim-budget, and the consolidation of the Revenue and the Loan Account is going to enable the Government and the State to exercise better control over these funds. This is also an instrument in the hands of the authorities&#x2014;the department, the Minister and the Government. By means of this budget priorities can be better determined and the policy of the Government can be better appreciated. A great deal of good can be done in the whole setup of planning. I think that I can thank the hon. the Minister very much indeed on behalf of this House for having started with this budget this year. There are five departments involved in this regard, namely, Defence, Agricultural Technical Services, Health, Treasury and Forestry. I want to express the hope and the wish that all the departments will in the not too distant future&#x2014;say in two years time&#x2014;be included in this budget to make matters easier for South Africa, and that we will also then be able to show the Opposition where the money is going which the taxpayers in this country are paying. I think that it is a great privilege for us to have a Minister who has the backbone, the courage and the vision to introduce a budget of this nature this year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have heard the hon. member for Ermelo and the hon. member for Sunnyside defending the budget as best they could. We have heard apologetics, we have heard explanations and we have heard newspaper quotations. However, so far we have heard nothing which is truly convincing, and we shall have to wait with as much patience as we can muster until the hon. the Minister himself replies to the debate. When we heard the hon. the Minister introducing this debate, we were a little disappointed that he did not bring the usual spate of quotations. However, he did in fact amuse the House by quoting one economist. One might almost refer to him as an old testament economist. He is one of the original economists. The hon. the Minister quoted him I think effectively, by saying that defence was of much more importance than opulence. Of course, there is room for defence and there is room for opulence. I think if one looks at the writings of Adam Smith in <i>The Wealth of Nations,</i> the hon. the Minister would agree that what Adam Smith fundamentally tried to demonstrate in his thesis was that there is a logical case to be made for the concept that Government should renounce all interference with private initiative, except insofar as it may be necessary to prevent force and fraud, and to <span class="col_4597-4598" refersTo="page_0981"/>ensure national defence and domestic peace.</p>

<p>This is the essential theory or theme of Adam Smith&#x2019;s <i>Wealth of Nations,</i> and, since the hon. the Minister has quoted him on the maintenance of defence, I hope that, on another occasion, the hon. the Minister will also be prepared to follow the precepts of Adam Smith in respect of private initiative and a free economy. The question before us is not whether or not the philosophy of Adam Smith, this old testament economist, is still valid today. In many respects it is not. The question is whether, in the state in which South Africa finds itself today, politically, internationally and economically, our finances are being administered in a manner which is sufficiently sound, sufficiently stable, sufficiently prudent to ensure that South Africa&#x2019;s proper defence is being safeguarded. Let there be no mistake about this. We have had voices from the other side of the House talking about defence as though it were one thing, and talking about the economy of South Africa as though it were another thing. The two are wholly and inseparably tied together. The economy is our sinews of war. We cannot wage war, we cannot buy or make armaments, we cannot train men, we cannot maintain an army in the field, we cannot defend ourselves, or even give a credible imitation of defending ourselves if, behind the arms, behind the men, there is not a firm, strong, durable economy ready to sustain our men in the field, ready to sustain the credibility of our defence effort. This is essential. It is vital. If anybody thinks one can maintain defence while maintaining a shaky economy at home, such a person does not understand what modem warfare is about.</p>

<p>That is why we enter this debate accepting the need for the defence of this country, and prepared to accept the expenditures which are being incurred for its proper defence. We are, however, extremely critical, extremely suspicious, about the state of an economy which demands the kind of budget that has been presented to South Africa this year. It is our duty, it is our right, to enquire into that economy, precisely because we are concerned about South Africa&#x2019;s defence. It is our duty to inquire into what kind of economy it is that necessitates the kind of budget that has been presented to South Africa in 1976.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has received some praise for producing a realistic and pragmatic budget. Well, in the situation in which he found himself, he did a balancing act. We saw him doing it, and it was a show of virtuosity. If he receives congratulations for that, we would not wish to detract from it. However, we have the right to ask whether the situation which he was covering up, the situation which he was having to deal with, reflects a sound economy and a strong economy. I think that anybody who listened to the hon. the Minister in his desperate task, must agree that he was having a devil of a job. In fact, Sir, he reminded me&#x2014;and I do not mean it unkindly&#x2014;of Salome and the Dance of the Seven Veils. As he went through his reserves, as he indicated his needs, and as he proceeded to muster his resources in order to meet those needs, one began to feel that here was Salome with only seven veils to cover her nakedness, and that the dance was an excellent contrived dance, because never once could one really see through. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, what were the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s basic problems&#x003F; He found that he had to meet demands for something like R7 500 million. He had to find the revenue and loan financing to meet the amount of R7 500 million, which is quite a large sum.</p>

<p>Well, he began to look for these revenues&#x2014;and that is where the seven veils come in. He looked at customs, excise and sales duties, and there, I think, he was prudent, because in 1975 he took R1 136 million by these means, through these channels, and he very carefully assumed that in 1976 the sum would rise very slightly to R1 162 million. That, I think, was wise, and I think the target which he has set himself may be reached. But then, we come to inland revenue. In 1975 the hon. the Minister took R3 910 million by way of inland revenue. This year he sets himself the target, in order to cover his very large needs, of an amount of R4 890 million. This is a very large increase, approaching R1 000 million more than last year. I think the hon. the Minister is an optimist. It is true that he includes loan recoveries and loan levies in his inland revenue figure. He also, by way of a kind of trick with mirrors, includes the amount of R258 million, which is appropriated from State revenues in order to pay the Railways interest, and then &#x2026;</p>

<from><span class="col_4599-4600" refersTo="page_0982"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I agree, but it does not really add up to anything. One thing cancels the other out. That, Sir, is just in passing. However, the position is that, despite the fiscal plunder which is permitted by our inflation situation, the hon. the Minister has to find this amount before the new taxes are added, and I think that he is being highly optimistic if he imagines that he is going to get an increase of R1 000 million in his Inland Revenue Account before the new taxes are applied. I think he is over-optimistic, for several reasons. Firstly, as regards the defence bonds, which I regard as an admirable idea, because we obviously need the money, it is impossible to estimate how much money will be raised by these defence bonds, because the terms have not yet been stated. Nobody know as yet whether these bonds will be attractive, whether they will be insulated against inflation, and to what extent. Nobody knows what the period of the investment will be, what the interest rate will be, or any of the other conditions. We do not know, depending on these conditions, what their impact will be on other savings channels. There are other demands on peoples&#x2019; thrift. There are very necessary demands on peoples&#x2019; thrift. What is going to be the effect of the one on the other&#x003F; The supply of money from the private sector is not unlimited, and I believe that the sum of R120 million may or may not be a realistic figure.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of company tax. The increase in company tax and the additional savings levy, in the case of many companies, may well be fatal. In many cases it will certainly be counter-productive, because there comes a time when one cannot squeeze any water out of a stone; it simply will not work. There are companies, precisely because of the conditions of inflation, precisely because of the effects of tax in an inflationary situation, which are already in desperate trouble; some of them surviving, or thinking that they survive while they are already almost commercially dead. They have not been able to maintain themselves on a basis that will ensure their survival, and I think that this extra push is in fact going to drive even more companies to the wall than are already going to the wall.</p>

<p>Sir, when we look at the gold mining companies, we find a rather remarkable thing here, because as the hon. the Minister well knows, gold mining companies work on a special formula. That formula is related to the age of the mine; it is a special formula which takes into account the condition of the mine. The formula I think is</p>

<p>Y = 60 &#x2212;360/X</p>

<p>Here we have a formula specially tailored to meet the condition of each mine and which takes into account the conditions under which that mine works. When you arbitrarily add a figure such as the Minister proposes to add to a formula tax of that nature, then you distort the formula. While it is too early to predict yet what the effect is going to be on gold mines, I would like to suggest to the Minister that the result may well be highly detrimental in certain respects. I believe that one effect could well be that the mines will be forced to go to higher-grade ores, the effect being that more gold ore will be left underground, will not be mined, and will never be mineable in the future. That, Sir, is not in the interests of conservation of the gold resources of South Africa. There may well be a lower tax yield because of the fact that the mines are forced by this measure to restrict their production to certain shafts only. We may also find that if production decreases, as it already shows signs of doing, gold will make a lower contribution to our balance of payments or to our reserves. Sir, these are things which we cannot afford in our present situation, and I believe that this gold mining tax, which appears to be most arbitary in nature, may in fact also be destructive in nature. It could be killing the very goose that lays so many of our golden eggs.</p>

<p>With regard to foreign loans, the hon. the Minister has said that he believes it is economically feasible to get more foreign loans. We accept that with an economy such as the South African economy, with its basic resources, it should be possible to get more foreign loans. It is economically feasible, but is it politically feasible&#x003F; Already I believe there is a drying-up of the willingness to invest in South Africa. Private investors abroad are no longer investing in South African companies or shares. They are extremely reluctant to do so. Sir, if they are reluctant to do so, is it likely that institutional lenders will be able to extend loans on other than a very short-term basis and possibly at unacceptable rates of interest&#x003F; I believe, Sir, that the hon. the <span class="col_4601-4602" refersTo="page_0983"/>Minister may be very optimistic in assuming that he has in hand, to cover his expenditure, R320 million of renewable and new loans. I think the Minister, realistically, has his own doubts about this. He has taken the extraordinary measure of providing that he may impose, outside the parliamentary session, a 10% savings levy at his own discretion. He said that he must do this in view of the length of the parliamentary recess in South Africa. Well, Sir, we have already looked at certain defence implications in view of the length of the parliamentary recess in South Africa. We are concerned about the international situation in view of the length of the parliamentary recess in South Africa. I believe that we must begin to think seriously whether in fact, instead of Parliament abdicating its powers or delegating its powers to Ministers during the long recess, it might not be better in this modem age and with the urgencies and dangers of our times for Parliament to meet at regular intervals. Whatever inconveniences hon. members may experience in this regard, I believe that we must take South Africa seriously and that we must take our times seriously, and if we continue to use the present system, we are going to have to abdicate many of Parliament&#x2019;s powers, including the fundamental power of voting supply, which is what Parliament is really about, simply because of the traditional long recess into which this Parliament goes. I think that this Parliament should say, &#x201C;We cannot abdicate our powers; we cannot delegate the most important power of all&#x201D;, which is the power to vote supplies to the Government, and I think one should add to that that neither can this Parliament abdicate the power to decide whether or not South Africa goes to war. I believe that we have got to look very hard at our parliamentary recesses.</p>

<p>Sir, it is quite clear from what has been said that the hon. the Minister feels that he has certain rising commitments, that he has got to try to meet these expenditure commitments and that he has to meet them out of uncertain revenues. He is obviously having difficulty in balancing the two. It is clear that in certain respects he is scraping the barrel and that in certain respects he may be using non-renewable resources. Sir, we admire his virtuosity, but we cannot afford this kind of spectacle year after year; something has got to be done about it. I think the times are too grave to afford the luxury of this kind of budgeting and that the time has come rigorously to examine and to rectify the fault. Sir, in our amendment we have tried to put these faults under three heads. We have referred to the need to put ideology behind the economic necessities of our times. We have referred to a degree of mismanagement in the financial administration of this country and we have referred to the inadequate development of the very enormous resources which are at South Africa&#x2019;s disposal.</p>

<p>Let me come to the first one, the ideological one. Hon. members on that side say that we keep singing this refrain and they ask for examples. Sir, let me give them some examples. Why is South Africa, with its exceptional wealth, with its exceptional resources, left with a precarious balance of payments, a weak currency and a higher rate of inflation&#x003F; Why South Africa in particular&#x003F; South Africa is a great gold producer. We have an abundance of strategic minerals. We are richly endowed by a benign providence. Let us assume that a country like Switzerland or Austria or Belgium, or countries of similar size, were endowed with our natural wealth. Is it credible that they would today find themselves in the situation in which we find ourselves&#x003F; Without these benefits, those countries today find themselves in a stronger financial position than we do. They lend us money; they invest here when the times are good in South Africa. What makes us so different&#x003F; What single feature is it about South Africa which, in spite of its enormous advantages, makes us so vulnerable&#x003F; The seed of this difficulty lies in apartheid, in separate development. I will now show you, Sir, exactly how much it costs.</p>

<p>Let me just finish. What is the cost in productivity of refusing employers the right to give 92 000 jobs to African labourers&#x003F; That figure was disclosed in answer to a question in the House during this session. This happened between January 1968 and January 1976, in terms of the Physical Planning Act; 92 000 job opportunities were not able to be taken because of the Physical Planning Act. What is the cost of that in productivity&#x003F; What is the further cost of producing 82 000 jobs for Africans in border decentralization areas&#x003F; We happen to know the answer. It costs R80 million of the taxpayers&#x2019; money. 92 000 jobs which were available, having been offered by private enterprise, were turned down, while we taxpayers are obliged to spend R80 million in order to create 82 000 jobs in the border areas. A further R37 million is spent on 24 000 jobs at certain growth points. This is how we are going about this matter. R201 million was spent by the Bantu Trust. R64 million was spent just last year in purchasing land, mainly in productive hands, in order for much of that land to lie fallow or to be used for subsistence farming. Now, never mind about the question of race. I wish we could get this question of race away from the land problem, because it is vital to South Africa&#x2019;s future that we should be logical and sensible about this land. Only 12% of our land is arable, and we have a growing population.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am usually very happy to answer questions, but I really am pressed for time. The question is whether we can afford this kind of expenditure. Let us look at another example. 90 000 Coloureds and Indians have been moved in terms of the Group Areas Act. In fact, they have not just been moved. They have been taken away from where they lived. New homes and new job opportunities have to be created, all at vast cost. The Department of Community Development has spent R323 million to purchase properties. Of these it has so far disposed of R96 million&#x2019;s worth of properties. That amount of R323 million was in fact calculated at original cost price. It has disposed of R96 million&#x2019;s worth, which means that R227 million of the taxpayers&#x2019; money is lying unused. It is lying fallow and earning no interest. It is unproductive. The taxpayers&#x2019; money is being wasted on this sort of nonsense.</p>

<p>What is the cost of race classification&#x003F; What is the extra cost for our prisons and our Police in running this terrible system&#x003F; It is impossible to quantify it all. One can only boggle at the loss of productivity, the diversion of scarce resources to uneconomic places, the sheer misdirection of the products of the people of South Africa, the waste of time and money, the duplication of services and the vast bureaucracy created in South Africa, a proliferation of bureaucratic effort, the cost of which may well be of the order of magnitude of the product of our gold-mining industry. I say it may well be, because it is impossible to quantify. It is arguable, but it is a very large sum. What is unarguable is that apartheid is a great waste of our vital human resources and of our financial assets, and a great author of inflation. On this, economically speaking, there can be no argument whatsoever.</p>

<p>In the short time available to me I want to speak briefly of mismanagement. We have had an anti-inflation campaign. The Government has virtually admitted that it bears the main blame for what has happened with regard to over-expenditure and profligacy in the use of resources. There has been wild extravagance. There has been improvidence. It stands in the record books; it stands in the quarterly reports of the governor of the Reserve Bank. We have <span class="col_4605-4606" refersTo="page_0985"/>heard stories of the purchase of luxury cars, of the goings-on at the SABC and so forth. Can we afford this sort of nonsense in the economic difficulties in which we find ourselves in 1976&#x003F; In the financial year 1975-&#x2019;76 expenditure rose by R150 million over the amount budgeted. The amount budgeted, I may say, was a very large one. It was, in fact, part of the profligacy of which I was speaking. We went R150 million over that. For the year 1976-&#x2019;77 the Minister comes to this House and says that as a result of the exercise of the sternest self-discipline, he has in fact been able to ensure that the further increase will only be 10&#x00BD;% over the profligate year of 1975-&#x2019;76. He makes the claim that because inflation is so high, he has not in fact increased the real expenditure. Sir, where do these great savings occur&#x003F; Are they savings on what was actually being spent, or are they savings on what they thought they would like to spend and then decided not to spend or to reduce&#x003F; Sir, this is Bumstead economy. Dagwood Bumstead has problems with his wife, Blondie. Blondie says to Dagwood: &#x201C;I want 1 000 dollars to buy a fur coat&#x201D;. Dagwood practically turns a back somersault and says: &#x201C;I do not have 1 000 dollars.&#x201D; So she says: &#x201C;Well, how about 500 dollars to buy a fur coat&#x003F;&#x201D; He replies: &#x201C;Well, maybe I can borrow 500 dollars.&#x201D; So she goes and buys a fur coat. She comes back and says: &#x201C;Dagwood, you have saved 500 dollars. What shall we spend it on&#x003F;&#x201D; This is Bumstead economics, Sir. We find that more and more it is entering into the thinking of our economic system.</p>

<p>Sir, I could refer to the question of devaluation. I think the hon. the Minister, who is an intellectually honest man, is gradually coming to admit that devaluation in this day and age is no longer the great cure-all it used to be. We see very few benefits of it so far in our economy. On the other hand, we see many demerits and disadvantages flowing from devaluation. The hon. the Minister has to use these disadvantages almost as apologia in his budget speech. We have yet to see the final effects of devaluation. They are still coming on stream in our prices. When we look at our inflationary prices, we will be told in due course: &#x201C;This is due to devaluation. This must be expected because we devalued.&#x201D; Sir, I believe our forecasting has been bad. I believe that we were entirely wrong in our estimate and in our forecast of the gold price. I believe it will be prudent to assume, as the hon. the Minister does not, that there may be no increase in the gold price for quite a long time. We have doubts about the efficiency of statistics on our currency flows. The panic which gave rise to devaluation last year can no longer be found in the statistical tables. Whatever ripple occurred was not nearly as alarming as it then must have been. I think we need to look at that. I have spoken to the hon. the Minister about his exchange control machinery. When I spoke in January this year about the deficiencies in exchange control, the Minister shook his head at me in disbelief. I think he went back and had a look, because by February he announced very strict reforms.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the hon. the Minister went back and very soon announced important reforms in his exchange control system. I hope they are going to work.</p>

<p>Sir, my time has almost expired, and I come now to the third leg of the amendment. I would say that the gravest failure of all has been the Government&#x2019;s omission to develop the enormous human resources and the enormous natural resources of this country in such a way as to make us one of the rich countries of this world. This could make us a powerful country, a country with the very sinews of war on which we will depend for our defence in desperate times. I believe that these things have got to be done. They have got to be done by getting rid of mismanagement. They have got to be done by ensuring that our true economic needs, which are in fact our very defence and our survival, are put before ideological luxuries. Nothing is more important, as Adam Smith said to the Minister the other day, than to maintain the defence of your country. We are saying to this Government and to this Minister that the defence of this country depends essentially on a strong economy, and a strong economy depends on getting things the right way around. A strong economy has to be put before a fanciful ideology if we are going to care for the real defence of this country and protect this country in the very dangerous times with which we are faced. That is the reason why, while accepting the higher expenditure <span class="col_4607-4608" refersTo="page_0986"/>needed for the defence of this country, we are deeply concerned. We believe there are grave issues at stake for South Africa, and unless these three things are remedied, South Africa&#x2019;s true security and South Africa&#x2019;s true defence is in grave danger.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Von Brandis started with the pretence that he would be dealing with the budget and economic matters, but then lapsed into a political account and reduced all the problems of South Africa which the Minister had to take into account in this budget, to the political situation in South Africa. The hon. member for Constantia did more or less the same. He mentioned &#x201C;politically obstructionist policies&#x201D;, and the hon. member for Von Brandis even asked how it was possible that a country like South Africa, with all its natural riches, could compare unfavourably with the economy of Switzerland, for instance. Imagine, Sir, the hon. member comparing South Africa, with its particular situation and its particular population structure of four million White people, two million Brown people and sixteen million Black people, with a few Western European countries and their particular situations. I think that if the hon. member were only to look at the budget and consider the amounts this Government spends on the development of Bantu homelands, which, from the nature of the matter are backward areas and where development is therefore essential, and if he were to look at the money which is being spent on the development of these population groups, on providing education, on the building up of an infrastructure, he would realize very clearly that we in South Africa have problems which cannot be compared in any way to those of any Western European country. I think the hon. member ought at least to know this. When hon. members argue, they start with the simple premise that the fault in South Africa really lies in our policy of separate development, or apartheid, with the accompanying limitation in the provision of employment, such as job reservation, etc. They maintain that if this could only be abolished, then we would have sound growth and we would also have political and economic stability. The hon. member is nodding. He might as well pay some attention now.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to point out to hon. members that in any country which is in any way comparable to South Africa, where there is still a majority of underdeveloped people, one should constantly guard against disturbing the political stability, because if one were to disturb the political stability, one would also disturb the economic stability. I want to mention only one example. The hon. member for Hillbrow said that I was learning rapidly. I think he is correct, but not in respect of the matters he has in mind. I just want to point out to hon. members that there was a report recently concerning the situation in the Argentine, a country with great potential and a country which may certainly be compared with South Africa in more than one respect, but a country, too, with a population which, as we know, has recently found itself on the path of political instability. During the past 12 months the rate of inflation in the Argentine has been 475%. Now it is very easy for hon. members to wax lyrical and take short cuts when discussing development in South Africa and the weak aspects of the National Party&#x2019;s policy of separate development, but one thing at least is irrefutable, and this is that the National Party government has succeeded in maintaining political stability. And whereas it has maintained political stability, it has also, to a large extent, maintained economic stability. We do indeed have a fairly high rate of inflation, but not nearly as high as in the Argentine or Brazil and other countries. Together with that political stability we also have economic stability, and today South Africa is still attracting considerable investments from the Western world which in itself attests to that confidence. I want hon. members to consider that. This at least was one foundation upon which the hon. the Minister of Finance could build when drawing up this budget, viz. that we shall have political stability here in South Africa. In other words, he foresaw, when drafting the budget at least, that the United Party would not come to power within the near future, something which was confirmed by the result in the Alberton constituency. [Interjections.] Yes, that hon. member is also learning fast; he is coming on.</p>

<p>In my discussion of the budget, with reference to what has been said here, I should <span class="col_4609-4610" refersTo="page_0987"/>like to introduce a measure of perspective to the discussion. While we were listening to the hon. the Minister of Finance giving his budget speech, it became very clear that he had to take certain hard facts into account. Among other things, he had to take into account a serious recession in the Western world which has been weighing heavily on the economies of those countries for a considerable time. This is the worst recession since the depression of the thirties. The hon. the Minister referred to that on more than one occasion. He could not escape it. He could not draw up a budget in isolation, as if South Africa was not part of this world, but had to take that into account. The second very important point is that he had to take account of the sharp drop in the gold price which has taken place since the previous budget. In September 1975 there was a drop of 164 dollars per ounce to 130 dollars per ounce. As is now apparent, this was not merely a short-term fluctuation in the gold price; it was a drop which was closely linked to what I am tempted to call the &#x201C;crippling&#x201D; recession in the Western world, and as this recession goes deeper and lasts longer, we must bear in mind, and the hon. the Minister of Finance must also bear in mind, that the gold price will not soon rise and recover from that low so easily. We may expect, and in his budget speech the hon. the Minister clearly showed that he was indeed expecting it, that gold would offer strong resistance and as that recession passed and economic recovery occurred in the Western world, the gold price would rise again too. However, he had to take into account the fact that this recession may still continue for some time and that the gold price may continue at its present level for even longer.</p>

<p>There is a third important fact which the hon. the Minister should have taken into account and this is the constant vulnerability of our country&#x2019;s balance of payments, which is intimately bound up with factors in the Western world, <i>inter alia,</i> the recession to which we have referred, with lower prices for certain export products on the overseas markets, the lower gold price and conditions in the agricultural sector, which can fluctuate considerably from one year to the next and can have a substantial impact on the balance of payments. A fourth very important factor which the hon. the Minister had to take into account, was the political and military situation in Southern Africa. Even if he wanted to, he could not escape it. In any case it would have been very short-sighted not to have taken this into account. I should like to stress that the political and military situation in Southern Africa has changed dramatically since last year&#x2019;s budget.</p>

<p>We know about the developments in Angola&#x2014;by this time they are history. What we should bear in mind in this regard is that we in Southern Africa are experiencing a development of Russian military strategy and, one would almost say, an exhibition of its weaponry, and that a new power factor has come into operation in our part of the world. The government and the hon. the Minister had to acquaint themselves with this hard fact and take it fully into account. May I just point out that I recently read in a publication issued by the <i>Brookings Institute</i> in Washington, a publication called &#x201C;The Sizing up of the Soviet Army&#x201D;, that Russian military power is to an increasing extent reliant on the development of conventional weapons. People have started toying with the idea of a nuclear war and reducing the number of conventional weapons. They point out that the available figures and all indications reveal that the Russians are in the process of building up a vast arsenal of conventional weapons, an arsenal of tanks, cannons, armoured vehicles, fighter aircraft, submarines, etc. Added to this was the important fact which has been illustrated in Angola, namely that the West is simply not prepared to run the risk of a war in Southern Africa and is not prepared to supply money and arms on a large scale or to involve its military power to safeguard us against a communist onslaught. The Government and the hon. the Minister had to take account of these hard facts. Not only did they have to take into account the fact that Russian forces were deploying in the sea around us and had landed in Angola, they also had to take into account the fact that South Africa was finding itself in the position of having itself become responsible for the safety of Southern Africa, and that South Africa had been thrown on its own resources. When hon. members opposite are being clever about this or that aspect of the budget and when they pay lip-service in passing to the necessity for increased defence expenditure, I wonder whether they have really taken note of the situation and the responsibility and duty resting upon the <span class="col_4611-4612" refersTo="page_0988"/>Republic of South Africa to take vigorous action in this respect.</p>

<p>That is the background of this budget. I have referred to the recession, the drop in the gold price, fluctuations concerning our balance of payment and the different factors which influence it and the military situation in Southern Africa. This is the background of the budget. If we are to judge the budget, I want to ask hon. members opposite to look specifically at those matters and not to come along once again with the story of apartheid laws and the internal policy which supposedly makes such a big difference. I think Mr. Jan Haak, the present president of the Suid-Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, summarized the budget well when he said: &#x201C;Die begroting is ontwerp om die huidige situaste in ons land met realisme te hanteer en die ekonomie op die langer termyn op &#x2019;n gesonde grondslag te plaas.&#x201D; To my mind this is an objective viewpoint which is completely appropriate to this budget.</p>

<p>All these factors I have mentioned, especially the two first mentioned, definitely caused a levelling-out of the graph of the State&#x2019;s internal revenue. The further situation which arose, especially as regards the deployment of communist forces in Southern Africa, made it essential that an additional amount of R953 million be found by the Receiver of Revenue. The question arises as to whether the hon. the Minister is trying to collect the additional revenue required in a responsible, well-balanced manner. My reply to that is: Yes, definitely. The hon. members opposite pointed out that the basis of our tax structure was so narrow, but who has tried to widen it in the face of criticism from the Opposition in years past. It was this government which introduced a system of sales tax, with the specific aim of bringing the ordinary man into the picture and compelling him, too, to make a contribution&#x2014;the man who does not pay any income tax and nevertheless lays claim to the facilities and opportunities which are there for him. It was members opposite who then complained that the ordinary poor man, too, now had to bear a burden, that he was being oppressed. I recall that on one occasion the hon. member for Durban Point displayed a loaf of bread here to indicate how the poor people had to pay more for everything.</p>

<p>As I have said, these are some of the matters which the hon. the Minister had to take into account. They were facts which he had to face squarely. Not only was there a levelling-off of the revenue graph, there was also an pressing need for more funds, particularly for certain essential services. The hon. the Minister did this by means of customs and excise and sales duty, and by means of an increased surcharge on income tax and an increased loan levy. I should like to ask hon. members opposite whether they could mention a part of the population apart perhaps from the pensioners, the aged and the infirm, which the hon. the Minister had ignored or singled out in his effort to find these funds. He did not. The facts prove that his approach was very responsible and very careful and that he made a point of obtaining the required funds. Almost half the amount concerned represents an increase in our defence expenditure. I should like to tell hon. members opposite that they are underestimating the willingness of the ordinary man to accept this budget. They are underestimating the willingness of the ordinary man to contribute more towards the defence of our country. Already, on the day of the by-election in Alberton, we heard how attempts were immediately made to profit from this by means of posters stating: What more is the Minister of Finance asking&#x003F; What does he want&#x003F; The majority of the electorate voted after that and said: We are going forward on the road of South Africa; we are willing to meet our obligations. I want to tell hon. members opposite that an aspect I found striking in the speeches of the hon. members for Constantia and Von Brandis, was that they were utterly lacking in motivation as regards the problems of South Africa. I come to the conclusion that not only do they belong to a party which is suffering from political frustration, but that they themselves have in fact lost interest in the challenges of South Africa. The man in the street, however, is reacting favourably to this budget, as several speakers on this side have already pointed out. In the meantime the hon. the Minister of Finance and the Government are continuing to broaden the infrastructure in South Africa. The second Sasol is forging ahead, as is the Sishen/Saldanha project. Development is taking place across a very wide front. Richards Bay and the numerous railway lines leading to it, are forging ahead. There is the further development of practically all our harbours. These are things which are creating long-term prospects for the whole population of South Africa. Therefore, I <span class="col_4613-4614" refersTo="page_0989"/>should like to conclude by saying that the criticism levelled by the hon. members opposite is very superficial and frivolous. I want to give the hon. members the assurance that the taxpayers are accepting this budget and that they are willing to make the sacrifices, because they are in the interests of South Africa; this is the premium we are willing to pay for the safeguarding of the future of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened to some strange speeches in the course of the afternoon. We have listened to the maiden speech of a Progref, the hon. member for Von Brandis, and to the hon. member for Yeoville. The latter hon. member quoted from a newspaper to show how much had been spent on the occasion of the reception by the Broadcasting Corporation. This surprised me, coming from a person such as he, because he is the hon. member, after all, who always makes such a fuss about our image abroad and about foreign loans. If one thinks of the amount that was spent on the reception and one relates it to the amount that was spent on the project as such, I cannot understand why the hon. member for Yeoville should quote such a newspaper report. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>In looking at the budget, one must bear in mind that the purpose of the budget is not to balance revenue and expenditure, but rather to lay down general guide-lines for the development of the national economy. In his budget speech, the hon. the Minister made it very clear to us that he was faced with special circumstances. The economy has sustained a number of shocks over the past 18 months and the previous speaker referred to a few of them. There have been the continued depression conditions and the high rate of inflation in many of the countries with whom we trade. In addition, there has been the sharp decline in the price of gold, which I believe to have been largely influenced by the enormous grain purchases of the Russians, because they use gold on a large scale to pay for their imported grain. Perhaps we can find some consolation in the possibility that if agricultural conditions in Russia were to improve, we would also be in a more favourable situation as far as our gold position is concerned. Furthermore, there have been the events on our national borders, the political conditions in countries of Southern Africa, the essential credit restrictions on the commercial banks in order to stabilize our balance of payments and the necessity for a considerable devaluation of the rand. All the factors I have mentioned combined to have a very adverse effect on our national economy. The general expectation may have been that fiscal measures should be taken to encourage growth, but the hon. the Minister of Finance has pointed out very clearly that something of this nature would have a most unfavourable effect on our inflation rate. Apart from that, it would certainly not be compatible with the Government&#x2019;s undertakings as far as the anti-inflation manifesto is concerned. Instead of stimulating growth, the hon. the Minister decided to combat factors which have an inhibiting effect on the development of our economy, to strengthen the value of the rand and to create the right climate for considerable economic growth if conditions in the countries that are our trading partners improve as it now seems that they will. Consequently, the responsibility for stimulating our growth now rests on the shoulders of the industrialists. At the moment there is a very low occupation&#x2014; only approximately 88%&#x2014;of the total production capacity of our industry.</p>

<p>Therefore we have further production capacity available, and with the advantages to be derived from devaluation, as well as the possible upsurge in the countries that are our trading partners, there is a considerable possibility that our position may improve if the industrialists are energetic enough. If this happens and the hon. the Minister succeeds, by means of his efforts in this budget, in bringing down our inflation rate, we shall be entitled to say at a later stage that the budget we are discussing now was a budget for the future.</p>

<p>The budget has been called inflationary. However, the <i>Financial Times</i> thinks otherwise &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. This budget is not only important for the industrialist and the businessman. It is important for every South African, and although the hon. the Minister did not discuss this matter in detail in his budget speech, I think we must take cognizance of the fact that our balance of trade and balance of payments are being affected to a very large extent by the high price we have to pay for imported petroleum products. I think that much too much emphasis is being laid on the fact that we depend on imported oil for only 25% of our energy requirements. Because of the great size of our country and the long journeys that are undertaken by car, we use almost as much imported fuel as many of our trading partners in Europe, in spite of our favourable position. I think our private sector is able to make a definite contribution here and to use fuel even more sparingly and more efficiently with a view to our balance of payments. The increase in the price of fuel is a further reason for us to economize on it in order to make a contribution.</p>

<p>In order to achieve his purpose, the hon. the Minister of Finance made his tax base as wide as possible. With the exception of pensioners and people over the age of 60 years, there is really no person in the community who is not affected by this budget. It is striking that people talk about tax relief in certain categories. The hon. member for Constantia, for example, wants the taxation of married women to be eased to draw women to the labour market. However, I wonder whether it really is morally justifiable to draw people to the labour market in this way. Would it not be better, if we want to draw them, to pay them proper salaries&#x003F; According to the report of this commission, the group earning less than R1 000 constitutes 29% of the total. What relief would have been afforded by the tax reduction we could have granted them if they earn a pittance of less than R1 000&#x003F; The group earning between R1 000 and R2 500 represents 43% of the total, the one between R2 500 and R5 000 represents 25% of the total and the group earning more than R5 000 constitutes only 3% of the total. Since these are the facts, I believe that the blame must be laid elsewhere. I find it a great pity that people in this House should try to lay the blame on the shoulders of the Government, as do so many others outside, for according to this report, the reason for the adverse position of the married woman is definitely not the tax she has to pay, but the salary she is paid in the open market.</p>

<p>The PRP happens to be the party that speaks of distribution of wealth, but the hon. member for Houghton said in <i>The Argus</i> of 1 April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission, for example, said it regarded it as significant that even in the R15 000 to R20 000 income category, where the need to work was manifestly less pressing, no less than 34,7% of married women were economically active. This is putting the cart before the horse or mare in no uncertain terms. Surely the increase has reached that high level just because the wives are working.</block>

<p>However, her facts are not correct. According to the report from which she quoted, only 3% of the economically active married women are in the category above R5 000. Consequently, their influence on the total income of R15 000 is very small. However, we must approach this matter from a different angle. It is very clearly shown in this report that the category that would be adversely affected if the income were to be split would in fact be the group with a joint income or less than R10 000 a year. They constitute 92% of the total number of taxpayers. To a greater or lesser extent, these people would all have to pay more than they are paying at the moment if their incomes were to be separated, while the 8% earning more than R10 000 would benefit from it. For that <span class="col_4617-4618" refersTo="page_0991"/>reason I feel that the hon. the Minister acted correctly in accepting this recommendation of the commission, in deciding that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained and that the married woman should be taxed jointly with her husband as long as the present system of taxation is retained.</p>

<p>With these few words I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Finance on his budget.</p>

<p>I believe that it will have the right effect. I believe that in looking back at this budget in the years of growth that lie ahead, everyone will be able to say that it was not a budget for the moment, but a budget for the future, which in fact it is.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Losberg has made a plea for the retention of our present system of taxation, in terms of which wives are taxed jointly with their husbands. He added that we should rather pay the women more. The largest employer of women in this country is the State. Is the hon. member prepared to tell the Government to pay the women of South Africa more&#x003F;</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with what the hon. member for Piketberg said. He alleged that the Government was creating political stability. He said that this was necessary, because we should compare ourselves with Argentina. I concede that point to him. This Government consists of the best politicians I know. All they can think of is making politics of South African affairs, but when it comes to the national economy, or to matters which concern South Africa, they are nowhere to be seen. The hon. member went on to allege that the Government had created economic stability and that we had economic stability in South Africa. That depends on your norms, of course, because if anyone wants to believe that a balance of payments shortage of R1 600 million, a growth rate of only 2&#x00BE;%, as against a target of 6,4% set by the economic development programme, and an inflation rate of 11% add up to economic stability, he is free to believe this. The hon. member also alleged that we had underestimated the ordinary man&#x2019;s willingness to pay for the defence of South Africa. By saying that, he wanted to imply that the reason for this difficult budget was to be found in the fact that we have to pay for our defence. That is what he tried to give out. In other words, he wanted to cover up the inefficiency of the Government by dragging in the patriotism of the people of South Africa. The defence expenditure amounts to only R400 million.</p>

[Interjections.] Where does the trouble lie&#x003F; What caused this position which exists today&#x003F; It was caused by the policy of the Government. What is the true reason for it&#x003F; The reason is that we have too small a number of taxpayers in South Africa. According to the Franzsen Commission, only 8% of the South African population pays income tax. Out of that 8%, 6% pays two-thirds of the income tax in South Africa. [Interjections.] I am talking about income tax. Those people can no longer bear the burden. The fact is that the major part of our population in South Africa is unproductive, for what reason&#x003F; Because of the Government&#x2019;s policy in not having trained these people. Mr. Speaker, can you believe that there was a Government in this country that fixed the expenditure on Bantu education at R13 million up to 1972&#x003F; Now they do not know why we do not have taxpayers in South Africa. Talk to any industrialist today, talk to any farmer, talk to any man who has to produce in South Africa and ask what his trouble is. Every time the reply will be &#x201C;Labour&#x201D;: unqualified labour and restrictions on labour. For what reason&#x003F; Because of the policy of this Government. When the hon. member for Von Brandis spoke of job reservation, those hon. members laughed. In the Western world, where people are not <span class="col_4619-4620" refersTo="page_0992"/>prepared to work, we must be glad and we must go down on our knees every night if there are people who want to work.

<p>If this Budget had been intended to destroy growth and to encourage inflation, it could not have been bettered, because that is exactly what it does. What is the position of the industrialist today&#x003F; What happens to every company in South Africa&#x003F; We find that our companies have virtually been nationalized by this Government, that the Government has now become a partner in the companies. It now takes 49% of the profits of any company. Nor is this all. A company now has to pay tax on undistributed profits as well if its accumulated profits exceed R50 000. Everyone has an accumulated profit of R50 000. This means that if an industrialist earns R1, he must give 49 cents to the Government, and he must pay another 16 cents in taxation on undistributed profits, which leaves only 17 cents. Now I ask: Who on earth is going to invest in the industries in South Africa&#x003F; Who is going to invest in them now&#x003F; That is why we see that our manufacturing volume increased by only 2,2% last year. We have nothing to export and this is a consequence of this inhibiting policy.</p>

<p>The other day the hon. the Prime Minister attacked the Progressive Party, rightly, I think. He accused them of standing for a redistribution of land, wealth and power. Now I want to ask: What does this budget mean&#x003F; Is this not the most socialist budget we have ever had&#x003F; In listening to the hon. the Minister, I was not sure whether Harold Wilson or Samora Machel had taken over.</p>

<p>To get back to inflation, the hon. member for Losberg said that this budget would not be inflationary. If one takes the increase of 33% in sales tax, i.e. R660 million, together with the increase of R200 million in railway tariffs, 50% on livestock, one can see what will become of the cost of living under this Government. When there is an increase of 33&#x2153;% in sales tax, it does not only mean 33&#x2153;% more, because the wholesaler can take 50% on that amount. The retailer can also take 50%, and by that time the increase amounts to 75%. The R660 million then becomes R1 485 million, which is to be taken from the pockets of the consumer in South Africa. But the hon. the Minister says that it is not inflationary and that the cost of living will not rise. That is why we had demands for salary increases before the budget of the hon. the Minister of Finance was even cold. Mr. A. Nieuwoudt, chairman of the S. A. Confederation of Labour said the following yesterday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die begroting is &#x2019;n bitter slag. Daar kan nie langer op salarisverhogings gewag word nie. Geen alternatief is moontlik nie.

<p>Can hon. members see what it is going to mean if new wage demands are made&#x003F; Because no provision is made in this budget for wage demands.

<p>Another matter I want to discuss is the political games played by this Government and the suffering which the people of South Africa are made to undergo. We have been forced into this position by the actions of this Government. We shall have to save the situation and the people of South Africa will in fact save the situation, but what is the price we shall have to pay for it&#x003F; What is the price which my voters, the landowners of Braunschweig, Frankfort and Stutterheim, had to pay for the incompetence of this Government&#x003F; I do not want to tell the House again what this Government did to the voters of that area, because I discussed that last time. In 1972 that area was declared Black, against the will of the people. They begged to be allowed to keep their land, but this Government <span class="col_4621-4622" refersTo="page_0993"/>declared the area Black. These people had to accept this, for what else could they do&#x003F; In a circular the promise was made that they would be bought out in 1974. The election took place, promises were made, 1974 passed, 1975 passed, their land was valued and offers were made to them that were valid for 60 days. Those offers were withdrawn within 60 days&#x2019; time &#x2026;</p>

The mass declarations last year of places such as Port St. Johns, parts of Natal and parts of the Transvaal only came three years later. We look forward to the reply to a question asked here by the hon. member for Sea Point, with reference to the fact that land to the value of R57 million was bought last year, of which 212 000 ha was situated in the Transvaal and only 33 ha in the Cape Province.

<p>Yes, but there is no money for our people. [Interjections.] When I questioned the hon. the Minister here about the matter, he asked me why those farmers had not accepted the offers. They were unable to accept them because the offers were not correct. They were given 60 days and the offers were withdrawn within 60 days. The Government has made purchases all over the place.</p>

<p>Another case is in Amabela, where two farmers, whose land did not even fall in the proclaimed area, were bought out. I just want to say in passing that the one man had bought his land for R70 000 and that he got R146 000 for it 18 months later. However, that is not the point. I put the following question on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether any properties purchased in the Amabela area were unproclaimed&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The two properties which were bought are situated adjacent to a Bantu area and Parliament&#x2019;s approval or proclamation, as mentioned by the hon. member, is not necessary in terms of the law of the acquisition of such properties.</block>

<p>However, when I spoke to the people in my constituency, they said that his was not so at all. I then asked the following question in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether both the properties bought in Amabela bordered directly on the proclaimed area&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No. The property bought from Mr. Attwell is adjacent to a released area, while the property bought from Mr. Liebenberg, although not adjacent to a released area, is adjacent to the property bought from Mr. Attwell. The properties required are subdivisions of the farm No. 570 which is adjacent to a released area.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Why did I have to draw this out of them&#x003F; Then I went on to ask&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4623-4624" refersTo="page_0994"/>Whether any other proclaimed properties were bought in the Eastern Cape, and if so, from whom&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The particulars required can unfortunately not be ascertained without performing a considerable volume of work, which is deemed to be unjustified.</block>

<p>Now the hon. the Minister no longer wants to reply to it; it must be kept a secret. I went on to ask&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether any offers for properties in the Eastern Cape, other than the two properties in the Amabela area purchased in September 1975, have been made; if so, (a) how many and (b) how many offers have been accepted.</block>

<p>Do you know, Mr. Speaker, what reply was given&#x003F; It was exactly the same: The hon. the Minister refused to reply. I then asked: &#x201C;Whether any offers were withheld&#x003F;&#x201D; Surely this is simple. There cannot have been many in my constituency. In the Frankfort area, only 62 farms were involved. But again it was the same: the hon. the Minister refused to reply to my question.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Sunday Times,</i> Mr. Attwell&#x2019;s farm was bought on 16 September 1975. The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Kenneth Reginald Attwell of the Xhosa Development Corporation revealed this week he paid R70 000 for a 282 ha farm in the unproclaimed Amabela area on 19 January 1974. He sold it to the Government for R146 000 on 16 September 1975.</block>

<p>I am not talking about the price. I am concerned with the date, because that is important to me. I asked the hon. the Minister (Question 315)&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(ii) On what date were they (the Amabela farms) purchased&#x003F;</li>

</ol>

<p>The reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The two transactions were concluded early in September 1975.</block>

<p>The date is not furnished, but the date is important to me because we have to know when the offers in my constituency were withdrawn and we have asked the hon. the Minister to tell us repeatedly and he does not want to do so. However, we know that certain offers were withdrawn on 11 September; that is the one date I have. I do not have the other dates, because the hon. the Minister refuses to tell. The hon. the Minister then made a statement which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Minister admits mistake: The Government offers for the two Amabela farms in an unproclaimed area in the Eastern Cape were inadvertently posted before other approved offers &#x2026;</block>

<p>The report appeared in the <i>Daily Despatch</i> of 10 March 1976. I should have read the whole report, but I should prefer to give it to the hon. the Minister. I then asked the hon. the Minister another question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On what date were the offers despatched by his department and accepted by the owners&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply to this was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despatched on 12 August, accepted on 3 September.</block>

<p>Now we still do not know where we stand, because the hon. the Minister still refuses to say when he withdrew the offers. I then asked the hon. the Minister another question&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) How many properties have been purchased;</li>

<li>(b) how many owners (i) have received offers which have been withheld and (ii) have still to receive offers;</li>

However, I want to tell you that if we listen to the manner in which this hon. member makes calculations, we must also get the impression that we cannot attach too much value to the manner in which he put this case here&#x2014;probably from this own point of view. I believe that the hon. the Minister will answer him on that score in due course.</p>
