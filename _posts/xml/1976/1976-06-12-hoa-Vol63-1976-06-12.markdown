</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we now come to the last stage of an important financial measure which has been before this House for a very considerable time, in fact for fully two sessions. The contents of this Bill, however, go back even further than the time during which the Bill has been before the House, because they go back to the report of the Franzsen Commission which reported as long ago as 1970. This measure is a big step forward in implementing some of the recommendations of the Franzsen Commission. This is an omnibus measure. It covers no fewer than nine different types of financial institutions&#x2014;all important ones&#x2014;but very largely unrelated to each other. I think that the most important features of the Bill are those amendments which cover the insurance industry and the banking industry, and there are also amendments to the Pension Funds Act which we find very welcome. This is also a highly technical Bill in the financial sense, which probably accounts for the somewhat meagre interest which hon. members of this House display in it, and probably also accounts for the fact that there are a number of members of this House who find the attractions of Loftus Versfeld field more interesting than the debate under discussion.</p>

<p>I do not propose in what I have to say at the Third Reading, to go over in any sort of detail the ground that was covered in the previous stages of this Bill. However, I do propose dealing with two features of the Bill which I regard as being very important. The first feature that I would like to deal with is that this Bill delegates very far-reaching powers in certain respects to either the Minister or the Registrar of Financial Institutions. The second feature I would like to deal with is that this Bill aims to improve certain aspects of our banking system and provide further safety for the savings of people and institutions which are entrusted or lent to financial institutions.</p>

<p>As far as the powers which this Bill delegates to the Minister and to the Registrar of Financial Institutions are concerned, the first one I would like to deal with is the power delegated to the Minister to limit commissions and remuneration paid by the insurance industry to intermediaries, i.e. brokers and agents. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister is not going to find it necessary to exercise this power and that he will be able to persuade the industry to put its house in order on a voluntary basis. I do not believe that in saying that I am saying anything that is beyond the realms of possibility. If the broking industry were to get together and, after consultation with the insurance industry, voluntarily set a scale of limits to their commissions, I consider that that would be a very big step forward in solving the problem which the hon. the Minister is trying to solve by this delegated power. It would be a very big step forward, because if the scale set voluntarily by the broking industry was a scale acceptable to the hon. the Minister, he would only have to exercise his delegated powers in respect of brokers who did not conform to the voluntary scale. I think it would also be a very big step forward towards transforming the broking industry into a profession with its own professional body. If that were to happen, the broking business might ultimately be recognized as a profession and given statutory status to control its own affairs. I believe that this is an ideal towards which that industry should work and, if it could achieve it, a lot of the problems which this power delegated to the Minister aims to solve, would be solved without him having to exercise it. However, if the hon. the Minister is unsuccessful in getting the industry to act voluntarily, he must act in <span class="col_8959-8960" refersTo="page_0390"/>terms of the powers of this legislation. I do appeal to him only to act after full consultation, not only with the association of brokers but also with the insurance industry itself.</p>

<p>I think it is important to recognize the need in fixing commissions to have great flexibility. There is a great variation in the degree of service which is rendered by various brokers to the insurance industry and to the insuring public. There also is a great variation in costs incurred by different brokers. I think that this is a fact that must be recognized by the hon. the Minister in exercising this power. You get brokers offering a comprehensive service which obviously is costly and brokers offering a limited service, and you get agents offering merely a sales service and you get agents offering a very comprehensive service. You also get chief agents who get a very fat commission as far as I can see for doing very little. I think what is needed from the Minister in using this delegated power is a very careful balancing act. The Minister is taking power to interfere with private enterprise by fixing commission but he must be very careful to do so without killing competition which is so necessary for the protection of policy-holders.</p>

<p>The second delegated power which is conferred by this legislation is conferred on the Registrar of Financial Institutions and it is to declare certain banking practices irregular and undesirable. There was a full discussion on this matter in the Committee Stage so I do not propose to discuss it very fully at this stage, but I would like to repeat that this is a power which can have very far-reaching consequences on the institutions affected by it. It can have very damaging consequences on businesses and, if it is not very carefully exercised, it could even kill certain financial institutions. I believe that this is a power which must be exercised with very great discretion and, wherever possible, only after consultation with the banking industry and with the institution concerned.</p>

<p>The third power which is being delegated in terms of this legislation is the power to the Minister to enforce disinvestment in South African banks by foreign shareholders until a position of parity is reached between foreign shareholders and domestic shareholders. We have made it very clear in the earlier stages of this legislation that we favour the principle of parity between foreign and domestic shareholders as it has many practical advantages. But what does matter, when you do not have it, is how you get to that position. We must avoid any impression that foreign investment is not welcome in South Africa. The Minister knows as well as I do that foreign money is not only welcome but very necessary, and the fact that this measure is seeking to force disinvestment by foreigners is contrary to the concept of attracting foreign capital. The position therefore calls for very great discretion and patience in exercising this power.</p>

<p>As far as all the powers which are delegated in terms of this legislation are concerned, the Minister did give the assurances during the earlier stages of the Bill that he would consult very closely with the parties affected. I regard this matter of consultation as being so important that we on this side of the House would be failing in our duty if we did not emphasize our attitude to it at this last stage of the Bill.</p>

<p>The other important feature of this Bill which I wish to refer to is the provisions it contains to improve our banking system and to increase the security of deposited money. I am not going to deal in any detail with the many amendments which affect this principle and are contained in the Bill. Many follow the recommendations of the Franzsen Commission and as such are generally welcomed by us. In particular we welcome the measures which bring under the control of the Banking Act fringe institutions dealing in the grey market. I regard it as very important that if a financial institution accepts a deposit of money and then lends that money to a third party and does not just act as an investment agent for the person depositing that money with the institution, then that institution should observe the liquidity and the solvency ratios laid down by the Banking Act. We in this country have a banking system of which we can be justly proud. It has a fine record of safety, a fine record of enterprise in developing the economy and a fine record of providing a comprehensive and efficient range of banking services. I believe that this Bill, by eliminating some of the fringe weaknesses which exist in the banking system, will be improving the system as a whole.</p>

<p>This is a lengthy and complicated piece of legislation, and I would therefore like to pay personal tribute to those who have been responsible for compiling and drafting the Bill. This includes Dr. Franzsen and members <span class="col_8961-8962" refersTo="page_0391"/>of his commission, many of whose ideas are embodied in this legislation, and also the Registrar of Financial Institutions who has added important ideas to it. Let me say that I have a very high regard for the ability of the Registrar of Financial Institutions and for the ability of the members of his department. I wish them well in the implementation of this important piece of legislation.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Constantia mentioned certain aspects in connection with this legislation. I have no fault to find with that and I am sure the hon. the Minister will react to it in due course.</p>

<p>However, I want to remark on one matter which he raised. He said the measure which we have here might be to our detriment especially when it came to investment in respect of foreign banks. He said quite correctly that investments from abroad were to be encouraged and welcomed by us. However, I should just like to mention in passing that what we are dealing with here, is the control of banks and the distribution and registration of their share capital. Therefore this does not relate to any large extent to the investment of capital in South Africa. Consequently I do not believe that this aspect can have detrimental effects for us.</p>

<p>The principle accepted at the Second Reading of this legislation, relates chiefly to the domestic and foreign possession of and control over financial institutions. In my opinion the acceptance of this is in fact a milestone in the history of banking and in the history of financial institutions in South Africa. As was emphasized during the Second Reading debate, this is a strategic industry.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that some uncertainty apparently still exists amongst certain bodies in this country, with regard to certain aspects of this legislation, bodies which in my opinion interpret the position quite incorrectly. I want to refer to Press reports that according to Hansard I allegedly said that the Government favoured commercial banks in South African possession above others in its support. I think this is a completely incorrect interpretation of the situation. In fact, this is not what I said in my Second Reading speech, and this is not what I think the Government envisages. I want to emphasize that this has nothing to do with favouring one bank above another and nothing to do with the implementation of a policy in respect of any preference which was mentioned in the Press. We are dealing with a measure applicable solely to the possession and control of South African banking institutions; that is to say, as I have already adduced, to the distribution and control of share capital domestically; to the compulsory registration of controlling companies; to the mutual linking of interests in subsidiaries and associates in respect of investment, property, etc.; and to the elimination of foreign control which, in my opinion, is advisable and is also accepted by the Opposition. According to reports this is also accepted favourably by all financial and banking institutions in South Africa and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In view of what is being enacted by means of this legislation, I think there are certain aspects which we shall have to bear in mind now and in the future in the implementation of the legislation. The first is&#x2014;in my opinion this is the motivation for the legislation&#x2014;a consolidation of this strategic industry in South Africa and the strengthening of the industry, its functions, its responsibility and its duty and place in the economy of South Africa. This must be done so that the industry may serve, <i>inter alia,</i> as the mechanism by means of which the Government&#x2019;s monetary policy may be applied and implemented. In saying this, I have in mind, for instance, the application of present monetary measures, as envisaged and applied by the Reserve Bank. Henceforth it will be possible to apply such measures in a more disciplined fashion, because if the provisions of the Bill are going to be implemented to this extent, we shall be able to succeed in ensuring that the interests of South Africa and the interests of the economy of South Africa are served and not so much the various institutions&#x2019; own interests.</p>

<p>In implementing the Bill we shall have to and shall be able to consider very purposeful norms. In this regard I have in mind especially a selective registration of banking institutions so as to be able to guard against overcrowding. When I say &#x201C;overcrowding&#x201D;, I must point out at once that this is a very difficult criterion to define, but I nevertheless think that in the implementation of this legislation this is an aspect to which we should have regard in registering banks. We should have regard to this in view of the fact that abroad&#x2014;in this regard I am thinking of Germany and America, for example&#x2014;the mortality rate amongst <span class="col_8963-8964" refersTo="page_0392"/>banks has been particularly high in recent times. This is a position which we in South Africa shall definitely want to avoid in view of the fact that we should like to see our financial or banking institutions in South Africa particularly as institutions which enjoy the absolute confidence of the public since they are in fact the guardians of the public&#x2019;s money.</p>

<p>It is alleged that approximately 94% of the public&#x2019;s money is controlled by banking institutions and similar bodies. In order to implement the Bill we shall perhaps have to consider a clearer delimitation of functions and further diversification. It is a fact that the present dispensation reveals a completely new idea in connection with the banking industry. Some of the banks which are doing business at the moment, are specifically doing the work of a bank, but they also diversify. For example, they are also estate agents and administrators of estates. They even deal with third party insurance. I believe that these institutions are such prestige undertakings that, although diversification on a sound basis is right, we should ensure all the same that that prestige remains intact. This is of strategic importance. I believe that our banks and other financial institutions should have regard to the fact that they are specialized people and will be seen in that light and not as &#x201C;jacks of all trades&#x201D; to use a colloquial expression. In order to implement this legislation, we shall, in addition to these things, probably have to think of a more scientific delimitation of areas of operation and of an effective channelling of moneys. The following appeared in a Press report which I have here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Leasing industry leaders hope that, once adopted and tested, the code will be accepted by Government as the basis of all legislation governing all leasing contracts.</block>

<p>In other words, the people in this industry want to draw up a code in terms of which they will govern their industry. I also have in mind, for example, the short-term financing which will have to be handled by our banks and of the particular shortcoming existing in respect of short-term financing in our agricultural industry, something which is creating problems at the moment. Relations with the Land Bank and the Department of Agricultural Credit which hold the biggest amount of securities, sometimes create problems for banking and the commercial banks since people still have to fall back on them to a large extent to help provide short-term financing for the agricultural sector.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that in my opinion boundless confidence in banking and financial institutions is essential in South Africa. They are, as I have already said, indeed the guardians of the public&#x2019;s money. The bank as well as the bank manager in South Africa is a very old traditional institution in the South African way of life.</p>

<p>With these few words I should like to support this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as has already been pointed out, the Bill covers a very wide range of subjects. It would be inappropriate to endeavour to cover all these subjects in the very short time available to me. However, since we are dealing with virtually all the financial institutions in South Africa, I believe we have to look at the situation in which South Africa finds itself today and perhaps also at the situation in which the world finds itself today from an economic point of view. The world today is no longer the world of even a few years ago as far as economic and financial conditions are concerned. What I think is important is that in this time, a time which economically is quite a different time from what the past has been, our institutions should be sufficiently adaptable to meet the new conditions and the authorities should be sufficiently flexible to deal with them. What is especially important from the point of view of the ordinary man in the street, is the survival and the integrity of the financial institutions of South Africa This is absolutely vital. Because this measure adds to that, although individuals in this House have suggested amendments and improvements, there is in fact complete unanimity as far as the acceptance of its principles is concerned. This debate, which has stretched over a long period, has shown that there is an acceptance by everyone that the survival and the integrity of the institutions is in fact vital. The authorities, because they have been given discretions in respect of a variety of matters in terms of this legislation, have an even greater responsibility to make sure that these institutions remain intact and strong.</p>

<p>One of the interesting things which we have to look at is that we whereas on the one hand <span class="col_8965-8966" refersTo="page_0393"/>the financial institutions represent a mobilization of savings and of funds which are surplus from time to time, on the other hand they in the main are a safeguard for the savings and on the other extend credit in respect of two matters, particularly in so far as the banking institutions are concerned. In the first place, they extend credit in order to produce, and in the second place they extend credit in order to consume. One of the features of modem life is that we now rely upon credit in order to enjoy a higher standard of living. One of the tragedies that have come about as a result of this is that we not only mortgage our assets as consumers, but that we actually mortgage our future. This is one of the matters that we need to look at, because credit for the sake of consumption which mortgages the future is in fact a dangerous phenomenon. This is something which we have to look at and it is something in respect of which the institutions have to be very careful.</p>

<p>One of the interesting things about this legislation is that as soon as we have passed this Bill, we shall have to deal with the next one. There are many things which have to be dealt with in future legislation in this regard. Let me give one example. One thing which is not dealt with in this piece of legislation relates to the Insurance Act. I believe that we need to look at the Insurance Act in two respects. Firstly, in respect of the terms of policies issued in South Africa, and bearing in mind that increasingly these policies are taken up by unsophisticated people, we should look at the conditions which may be imposed in them which are in fact prejudicial to the consumer who does not always read them or who, if he does read them, is not always able to understand them. I feel that we should look at that, to make sure that in terms of the Insurance Act conditions cannot be imposed which are prejudicial to the insured and which are not ordinary free enterprise conditions. In other words, we should seek a balance between those who can protect themselves and those who cannot protect themselves.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sir, I believe that an amendment is urgently required to section 38 of the Insurance Act. The Minister has said that he is looking into this. I believe that the days when, in the case of people serving in the forces, one could distinguish between those flying aircraft or conveyed in aircraft, and those who do not fly aircraft or who are not conveyed in aircraft, are over. I think such a distinction is prejudicial to those who serve in our Air Force, and in our forces generally, because it is also prejudicial to those who are conveyed by air. In my view this is a matter which should be urgently attended to. In the meantime, until the legislation is introduced, I believe that the office of the registrar should make it clear to the insurance companies that they should delete these provisions from their policies where they still exist, and that if they do not do so, retrospective legislation will be introduced from a date to be announced by the Minister.</p>

<p>The war clause?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the war clause. I believe this should be made clear to insurance companies so that there should be no argument in regard to this particular matter.</p>

<p>The issue I should like to deal with very briefly, is the issue of banks. Whereas large institutions give a high degree of security to depositors, we should not on the other hand create a situation where entrepreneurial spirit of our people is killed and where on can no longer start financial institutions, a situation where it is only the game of the big batallions. Whether or not one should have a minimum amount of capital, I still believe that the entrepreneurial spirit should be encouraged and that, particularly in regard to merchant banks, those banks which lend themselves to entrepreneurial activity should not be kept quite so restricted in so far as licences are concerned or, if one may use the term, permission to conduct them. An entrepreneurial spirit is essential for the financial field, and I believe that entrepreneurial spirit should be encouraged, particularly in view of the restrictions that are now being imposed in respect of companies that are not banks and in respect of the acceptance of deposits.</p>

<p>The other matter which concerns me is that with the restrictions in respect of shareholdings, other than those which are still held substantially by particular institutions, we are now entering an era in respect of banks where, in fact, the executives are going to be in control of the banks. I believe that the next step that will have to be taken will be to make sure that no abuse can take place not only where there is a substantial shareholding&#x2014;in regard to which the hon. the Minister holds a <span class="col_8967-8968" refersTo="page_0394"/>view with which we, perhaps, do not quite agree&#x2014;but similarly, where one may find an executive in too powerful a position in a financial institution. With the type of banking institution we are seeking to create, we are making the executives into tremendously powerful figures.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister might give us some indication of his views in respect of the so-called gyro system&#x2014;who should, in fact, be involved in it, whether it should be left to banking institutions, or whether it is going to be headed by a semi-Government institution or the Government itself. What, in fact, is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view in respect of this gyro matter? The matter has been investigated and there have been certain recommendations. There is a variety of views in respect of gyros and I should like to hear what the future has in store in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>The other matter I should like to raise again, a matter I touched upon during the Second Reading debate, is the issue of credit cards. I believe that the law should be changed to put all credit cards, whether they are being conducted by banks, or whether they are being conducted by other companies, under the control of the Registrar of Financial Institutions. They are a means of creating credit. They are as akin to a modem banking practice as anything there is today. I do not believe that one should have credit cards issued by banks under the control of the Registrar and, on the other hand, credit cards which are issued by other companies not under that control or, for that matter, any control. The Registrar can intervene with a bank and say that he regards a particular action as an undesirable practice. He can therefore keep a degree of control over the situation. However, he cannot do this when it is not a banking institution. I believe that all credit cards should also be placed under the control of the Registrar of Financial Institutions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Would you also include a Buy-Aid card?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>If the Buy-Aid card is similar to a credit card, then I think it should, as the hon. member suggests be included. However, I do not believe that one can include things which are not akin to credit cards. One has to draw a line somewhere in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows what my views are in respect of liquid asset requirements and in respect of the credit ceiling. Now that some considerable time has elapsed since the imposition of that credit ceiling, I think it is a not inappropriate occasion for the hon. the Minister to tell us whether there are prospects that this will be changed within a relatively short time. I do not want to deal with all the disadvantages which exist as a result of the imposition of the credit ceiling because I think the hon. the Minister is fully aware of them. He knows, as well as I know, that the ingenuity of man and the ingenuity of bankers is almost unlimited and that the credit ceiling may not be achieving what he has in mind. I think it is an undesirable situation and I believe he should rather return to the controls as contained in the Banks Act in order to deal with the particular position.</p>

<p>I should like to draw attention to another matter on which I would like a reaction from the hon. the Minister. We are dealing with NCDs in this particular legislation. We are taking them out of the securities which may be held by some of the institutions. The hon. the Minister did not accept the amendment in this regard, but I would like a reaction from the hon. the Minister in regard to the banks which take a very large percentage of their total liabilities to the public in the form of NCDs. According to the fairly recent returns this year, I see that in the case of some banks the NCDs go as high as 40%, while others go beyond that, of the total liabilities to the public. I wonder whether NCDs were actually intended to play that big a part in so far as individual banks are concerned, and whether the hon. the Minister has any views in respect of what should be done in regard to NCDs as a whole.</p>

<p>One can carry on at length in respect of the variety of matters concerning this piece of legislation, but I should like to touch on one last aspect, viz. the issue of pension funds. The saver of today has very little in which he can invest which is secure against inflation. The pension funds themselves are not secure against inflation. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister should not look at some particular form of investment for pension funds as opposed to his attitude of investing more and more of these funds in Government stock. If there is to be that kind of investment at an increasing rate, will the hon. the Minister not consider a Government bond specifically for <span class="col_8969-8970" refersTo="page_0395"/>pension funds which is, in fact, an indexed investment?</p>

<p>Is the hon. the Minister not prepared to consider making it a right on the part of an employee that after he has contributed to a pension fund for, say, 10 years and then leaves it, he be entitled as of right not only to his contribution plus a degree of interest, but also his employer&#x2019;s contribution? Once a person has served for, say, 10 years, he should really get the benefit of it if he has to leave the pension fund. There should also be a legislative provision to make the transferability of pensions a compulsory matter. In other words, one should be able to transfer from one pension fund to another in terms of the law and it should not be necessary to start again if one changes one&#x2019;s employment.</p>

<p>There are many other things I can mention, but as far as we are concerned I believe that despite some of the things which are not quite as we should like to have them, this Bill is a substantial improvement in respect of the legislation relating to financial institutions and therefore we support it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#enthoven">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to add my support of the Bill to that of the hon. member for Yeoville. When one considers the extent to which the Bill goes, it is quite remarkable that only two clauses were opposed during the Committee Stage. I think this indicates that the House is unanimous that this Bill will add much to the interests of the commercial sector of our country and that it will not only be to the benefit of the country but also to all the people in it. However, I have one reservation, namely, that I still feel that the hon. the Minister is under the impression that the problems of the insurance industry relate mainly to commissions. If the hon. the Minister investigates these problems, and they are indeed problems, he will find that the commission problem is a red herring and that the problem actually is a far more fundamental one. I am very pleased that the hon. the Minister has expressed his reluctance to use clause 10 unless he feels that he is forced to do so. He also said that he would investigate the matter fully and acquaint himself with all the facts and that he would consult all the people concerned before he did use clause 10. If he does all that, he will find out for himself that the issue of commissions is a red herring, and that the problem is a far more fundamental one, and that using clause 10 is not going to assist him to solve the problems of the industry. I hope, therefore, that we can look forward to removing this clause from our Statute Books at some time in the future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to hon. members on both sides of the House for their support of this measure, a measure which has rightly been described as a very important financial measure. In fact, quite a number of measures have been combined in this one Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo went to the root of the matter when he said that it is very important, that it is essential, for people to have the fullest confidence in the financial institutions of the country. That is certainly what we intend to achieve here by effecting improvements, where necessary, to the already existing legislation. This is really the purpose of this comprehensive legislation. Perhaps hon. members do not always realize what a pervasive influence is exercised by these institutions all over the country. It is not only a question of the thousands of millions of rands which these institutions have available to them. If one were to analyse the true extent of the activities of the institutions, one would realize how important it is that the legislation should be as effective as possible in regard to banking, insurance, building societies, pension funds, etc. I am glad that the hon. member for Ermelo also removed certain misunderstandings, misunderstandings which arose in consequence of reports which appeared in the Press after the Second Reading debate and the Committee Stage of the Bill. I think he made his personal point of view quite clear.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Constantia thanked all the officials and others responsible for bringing forward this comprehensive measure, going right back to the Franzsen Commission, and also the Registrar of Companies and others who participated. I appreciate his sentiments because these measures have involved a tremendous amount of work, and one is therefore really glad to see an appreciation of that on all sides of the House.</p>

<p>As far as the various points are concerned that the hon. member raised, I think he and the hon. member for Randburg can rest assured that, as far as clause 10 is concerned and the <span class="col_8971-8972" refersTo="page_0396"/>question of possible control over the commission payable to intermediaries, the position is as I have tried to explain it earlier. I certainly hope that the industry itself will be able to arrange these matters domestically and I am quite sure that it can be done. After all, in the long-term insurance business an agreement already exists. It may not be perfect, and the Government constantly consults with the industry through the Registrar&#x2019;s office. However, an agreement exists, and I am sure that it is not beyond the capacity of the short-term insurance industry to come to an effective agreement which will protect the interests of all parties. After all, there are several parties concerned. There is the insurance industry, there are the brokers themselves, the intermediaries and, of course, the public. This is the object and I certainly do not wish to intervene in a matter such as this from the Government side if the industry can handle its own affairs in an effective and reasonable way, which, as I say, I believe they can do.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia referred again to other types of delegation of powers to the Minister and to the Registrar and to the need to be discreet in applying them. He also referred to the question of what one might refer to as the disinvestment of foreign financial institutions which have shareholdings in South African banks, and asked that we should not give any impression that we are not sufficiently aware of the importance of foreign capital. I think that he can rest absolutely assured on that point. All that we are trying to do, of course, is to assure that at this stage of our development, where we have evolved in this country a remarkably sophisticated and efficient banking system, we would perhaps have a little bit more of a South African flavour at this time. This is something which in fact is completely in line with the thinking in all countries of the world. One only has to look at the position in Canada, Australia and a number of other countries to see that they have gone further than we are going now in this respect. Therefore, I can give that assurance.</p>

<p>The question of prior consultation with interested parties is something which is very much, not only in our minds, but also in conformity with the whole approach of the authorities through the registrar&#x2019;s office. I think that the Registrar and his small group of officers do manage to conduct these consultations on a remarkably wide-ranging scale.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of the grey market, the keeping of a watchful eye on what might be termed the fringe institutions, and where they indulge in banking operations, to bring them in under the provisions of this Act, is a very difficult matter, as the hon. member knows. We shall constantly watch that situation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville made the point, amongst others, that when we are dealing with legislation affecting several financial institutions, we are in fact involved in a continuing process. This is correct. One never really reaches finality. In any case one can never reach perfection. In the light of experience we are constantly trying to improve, and this is indeed the spirit in which this legislation is brought forward.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the war clause under section 38 of the Insurance Act. The hon. member will recall that earlier this session he asked me a question about it and I replied that we were not entirely satisfied in that connection and that we were looking into the matter. That is so. We are very conscious of the importance of that issue. I shall be happy to keep the hon. member informed of what progress we are making here.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the importance of not restricting the activities, let us say the entrepreneurial activities of banks and not discouraging that type of enterprise. I fully agree with him. I think as the banking system has evolved over the years, it has managed to maintain a remarkable spirit of enterprise although it has had to set itself very important standards of conduct by virtue of the very nature of its business. He referred to the very important role which executives played in banking. I think that is correct. I think what he was saying is that we are looking very closely now at the position of the shareholder and the role he plays and that we must not lose sight of the very big influence which the banking executive plays in this important field of activity. This is perfectly correct. We try to keep a view of the whole industry. The hon. member referred to the gyro system. I can simply say that that matter, which is a very technical one, is still being carefully investigated by a highly qualified committee. We have not got a final view from they yet, but they have I think just about reached finality, and I look forward to seeing whatever recommendations they put forward. Perhaps <span class="col_8973-8974" refersTo="page_0397"/>we might find an early opportunity during the next session to discuss this more fully, because this is certainly a modem development. The practical possibilities and the possible advantages for South Africa are the issues being looked at carefully, and I certainly hope to be able to report on that very soon.</p>

<p>In regard to credit cards, I think the hon. member raised a very important matter. There is no doubt that there is a proliferation of these credit cards and I think it will get worse. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s point was that credit cards should all fall under the control of the office of the Registrar. I should like to look a little further into the possibilities. The hon. member will appreciate that we are keeping a close watch on the way the credit card systems are being operated, but we are prepared to look more fully into the possibility of pulling into the system certain pieces of paper which today are perhaps more in the nature of credit cards than is generally understood. I will make further inquiry into this matter.</p>

<p>Then there is the credit ceiling. The hon. member will remember that when the Reserve Bank introduced the credit ceiling earlier, it was stressed that it was purely a temporary measure. It was, in fact, a purely temporary measure, and we feel that it is very important under the conditions of inflation prevailing and the effect it has on the balance of payments and so on, that we should have this strong control over credit for a little while longer. I think there should be this effective control under present conditions, but, as I said, it is certainly a temporary measure and we would not wish to continue with it longer than we deem essential. But the view of the monetary authorities at the moment is that it is necessary for this measure to continue for a little while longer. We must bring the inflation rate under more effective control; we have to bring the inflation rate down, and therefore I think it is important that we should not allow a situation to develop where what is essentially cost inflation can move into demand inflation, and this is of course a safeguard in that respect. This is, I think, as far as I can go now. We shall try to do away with it as soon as we can.</p>

<p>In regard to pension funds, the hon. member raised the question of the problems that inflation causes. That is so. It is a very important problem. He asked whether Government bonds could not be devised specifically for the investment of pension funds&#x2019; moneys, perhaps based on the principle of indexation. I can say that up to now we have not really in consultation with the pension funds found or devised an effective device. But the matter is constantly under consideration and it is discussed from time to time with the pension funds. All I can say is that we are as conscious of the problems that the pension funds have as the pension funds themselves are, because they see it every day, and we will have to continue looking at the possibilities of solving that problem. I will bear that in mind. The hon. member referred to the possibility of an employee who might have 10 years&#x2019; service when he leaves not only drawing his own contributions but also the employer&#x2019;s contributions. This is of course a matter very much, I think for the pension funds. Up to now they have felt that it would impose a rather substantial burden on their financial position. As I-say, they already have these problems. Costs are rising for them, as for everybody else. However, we also continually discuss those issues. Who knows, if there is a financial improvement there, this sort of thing might be possible. I would not, however, like to express a firm view on that at the moment.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the possibility of a member&#x2019;s transfer from one fund to another if he left the service of one organization and went to work for another. Again that is very much a question in respect of which the Government would be led by the pension fund industry, if I may put it that way. It is really a question of the financial implications of this sort of thing. In our discussions with them, from time to time, I shall specifically have those points raised.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Yeoville also referred to NCDs and the substantial part they play in the activities of certain banks. I think, if I understood him correctly, that he asked whether they should play such an important part in some banks.</p>

<p><span class="col_8975-8976" refersTo="page_0398"/>stressed my view sufficiently earlier in this debate.

We are definitely doing that, and I shall keep the hon. Member informed on that as well. It is not easy to give final views on these matters because these matters are continually under discussion. This is one of the matters, however, that is having the careful attention of the Registrar and certain other financial authorities. This has been the case for the past few months.</p>

<p>I trust I have dealt with most of the points that have been raised.</p>

<p>*I should like to thank hon. members for their positive approach to this important Bill. I think the discussions were constructive throughout.

<heading>ELECTORAL LAWS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are dealing here with a Bill to amend the Electoral Consolidation Act in order to provide for the voting of persons who will find themselves in independent States after such States gain their independence. Clause 1 deals with various definitions and amends those definitions in order to provide for voters to exercise their vote in those independent States.</p>

<p>I am perturbed by two of the provisions which are contained in the new definitions. The first one is the definition of &#x201C;magistrate&#x201D;. As the Act stands at the moment and as it will continue to apply within the Republic, &#x201C;magistrate&#x201D; also means an additional magistrate, an assistant magistrate, an acting magistrate, a Bantu Affairs Commissioner or a special justice of the peace who is an officer in the Public Service. Throughout the Act certain duties are required to be done by magistrates as opposed to persons holding other lower qualifications. In terms of the amendments which the hon. the Minister wants to bring about by means of the Bill, we find that in the case of an independent State &#x201C;magistrate&#x201D; shall mean a judicial officer of such an independent State. I can accept that &#x201C;judicial officer&#x201D; will be one of the categories mentioned under the definition of &#x201C;magistrate&#x201D; as it applies within the Republic. However, the hon. the Minister seeks to add &#x201C;or any officer acting on the instructions and under the control of such a judicial officer&#x201D;. This, to my mind, implies that any officer, any person employed by the Public Service of the independent State as long as he acts under the control of a judicial officer, will be permitted to carry out the duties in the independent State which are reserved only for a magistrate within the Republic. Only a magistrate, or a person with the qualifications of a magistrate, is allowed to perform those particular duties in the Republic, but somebody with&#x2014;shall I say&#x2014;lesser standing and perhaps of lower qualifications will be allowed to carry out those duties in an independent State.</p>

<p>The situation, I believe, is further confused if we look at the definition of &#x201C;judicial officer&#x201D; in the principal Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Judicial office&#x201D; includes the offices of justice of the peace and commissioner of oaths.</block>

<p>In other words, when an officer acts on the instructions and under the control of such a judicial officer, I hope the hon. the Minister implies such a judicial officer being only a magistrate and not in fact a justice of the peace or a commissioner of oaths.</p>

<p>When we look at the provision amending the definition of &#x2018; &#x2018;presiding officer for votes of special voters&#x201D; we find that the extension introduced by the hon. the Minister is that a presiding officer for votes of special voters shall &#x201C;in relation to a special voter having his home in an independent State, include a judicial officer or an officer referred to in section 42(3)&#x201D;. Here again we get the term &#x201C;judicial officer&#x201D; being introduced for votes of special voters&#x2014;not absent voters. I know that the hon. the Minister knows the difference between an absent voter and a special voter <span class="col_8977-8978" refersTo="page_0399"/>and therefore I do not have to go into that now.</p>

<p>If we look at clause 10 we find again, where we are dealing with applications to vote as absent voters&#x2014;in other words, to vote as special voters&#x2014;that the Government of the Republic will enter into an agreement with the independent State concerned so that a judicial officer or any officer acting on the instructions and under the control of such a judicial officer shall perform the duties of a presiding officer for votes of special voters.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will tell us if it is really his intention to allow this extension to an independent State in order to allow a person holding a rank below that of a magistrate or an assistant magistrate to perform the duties which in the Republic he reserves solely for a person of the rank of magistrate.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have a very clear understanding of the matter which has been raised. The idea is that we make provision for circumstances about which we are not 100% sure at the moment as far as the Transkei is concerned. One does not know exactly how many people there will be who will be able to cope with the task fully, but because we must be practical, we shall have to issue the instruction that votes may be cast in the presence of persons who are acting on the instructions of the person who is fully equipped for the task in terms of the Act. Practice will have to show us exactly what we are to do. However, I want to give the hon. member the assurance that we shall keep an eye on the matter and that we shall not allow standards to drop. We do not want to run any risk in this regard. The Act is being amended solely for the purpose of allowing us the necessary scope for applying the system even in the absence of the right people. I want to assure him that we shall keep an eye on the matter.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think there is any need for too lengthy a debate on this clause. Most of the points that are raised by this clause were discussed in fair detail by all sides of the House during the Second Reading yesterday afternoon. I shall therefore be brief.</p>

<p>The effect of this clause is to prevent South African citizens who are resident in the Transkei or, for that matter, in any independent homeland, from voting or being registered as voters in South Africa in the event of any such citizens being convicted of contravening certain laws in the independent state concerned. As far as I am aware there is in fact no international precedent for a particular law such as this. The hon. the Minister was unable yesterday to quote any single precedent and I very much doubt whether he is in fact able to quote a precedent of this sort today. This clause really embodies a unique new concept, viz. that if a South African citizen contravenes a particular law of a foreign country, not only is he punished in that country but he will in fact also be penalized in South Africa. Whether the laws concerned are existing laws carried over into the new state or whether they are laws as yet unthought of and to be passed in those states in years to come, the principle, as far as I see it, remains unaltered. In other words, a double punishment is meted out. This is seriously in conflict with a very basic rule in respect of law as I see it, viz. that no person shall be tried, convicted or punished twice for the same offence.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>He can be punished twice. He will be penalized in the homeland state and he will again be penalized in South Africa for contravening a law which may not even apply in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not intend repeating all the arguments that have been dealt with, some of which, indeed, were even evaded yesterday during the Second Reading debate. However, there are just one or two points I should like to mention. The first is in regard to the severity of the offence and particularly the severity of the sentence. In the proposed new section 6(1)(a)(iv) reference is made to an offence committed by a person under any law &#x201C;in respect of which he has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment without the option of a fine&#x201D;. Similarly, in the provision dealing with the question of liquor and rehabilitation we read &#x201C;&#x2026; in respect of which he has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment without the option of a fine or ordered to be detained under&#x2026; &#x201D; In all honesty, I want to point out <span class="col_8979-8980" refersTo="page_0400"/>that different countries do have different legal systems and, in fact, even have different values and a different insight into offences and the application of laws. In Lagos, for instance, and in a few North African states a person who is convicted of being a thief may have his hands amputated. In South Africa the very same offence might lead to a fine of, say, between R20 and R50. In Mozambique under Portuguese rule when there was a stable form of law, if a person was caught driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, he was placed in prison.</p>

<p>Very severe sentences were brought to bear on such people. I think the same applies in Scandanavia. In South Africa, however, only a fine would be involved. In addition, although the assessment and the definition of the offence may be the same, a different interpretation and even different standards may apply. Let us take the case of a person who is considered to be under the influence of alcohol. The blood-count for the purposes of prosecution is different in different countries. It was 0,15 in South Africa until a year or two ago. It is now 0,08 in South Africa. In another country it may be 0,05. What I am trying to say is that different standards sometimes apply to the very same concept and the very same laws. Legal systems develop differently over the years in different countries. The Cabinet in one country, for instance, may take a far more serious view of a particular offence than a Cabinet in another country. In an independent homeland State in years to come persons may find themselves imprisoned, without the option of a fine, for several of the offences which in South Africa might draw only a fine or a caution and a discharge. That is not to say&#x2014;and I honestly do not mean it this way&#x2014;that one system is better or worse than another, or that one system has a higher or a lower standard than another. What I am saying is that the systems are in fact different, and I believe that rights in our country should be linked to the laws of our country as interpreted and applied in our country according to the standards of South African law. During the Second Reading debate it was said that in any event a check could be kept on this because, in terms of the measure which was passed earlier this year, appeals could be heard in the South African courts. Therefore, if a person felt aggrieved he could bring the matter before the South African courts. The situation is that until a few years ago, appeals against convictions and in connection with legal disputes could be heard in South African courts for Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland and even Rhodesia. The situation is, however, that even if these appeals were heard, we did not extend this sort of provision that if somebody was convicted in Lesotho, Swaziland or Botswana, he would be deprived of his voting rights in South Africa. It was not extended in those cases, as far as I know, and I do not believe that it should be now. So, to be consistent, I believe that the same attitude should be adopted in this law. I therefore move the amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like at this stage to deal with one issue which was raised by the hon. member for Sandton, and to make the position of this side of the House perfectly clear. The hon. member for Sandton drew a picture of the grave dangers which would face South African citizens if they were to be subjected to trial, in the limited field which is relevant to this electoral legislation, by the courts of justice in an independent State. We seem to lose sight of the fact that such independent States have been a part of our Republic, and that this Parliament has seen fit to give to them powers of government in the administration of their affairs because we believe that they have the capacity and the outlook of life which we accept as sufficient for them to govern a part of what has been South Africa. I want to say immediately that we on this side of the House disassociate ourselves from any suggestion <span class="col_8981-8982" refersTo="page_0401"/>that by passing this Bill we are going to make South Africans who are in the Transkei subject to some form of justice that chops off hands for theft or other things which have been suggested by the hon. member for Sandton. I believe that the suggestion which he has made is one of the most derogatory remarks that I have ever heard made about our South African Black citizens. [Interjections.] Those people are today citizens of the Republic of South Africa. In respect of those citizens, we are prepared to get rid of discrimination on the grounds of colour. And now we are asked to say that we cannot, in this particular context, trust that the administration of justice in an independent homeland, in this case the Transkei, will be done in a manner that would be acceptable to us. I want to say that we entirely dissociate ourselves from that attitude towards these people of the Transkei.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am afraid that the hon. member for Green Point can argue this matter neither in terms of precedents nor in terms of principle. My colleague, the hon. member for Sandton, has argued the whole issue on principle. If we want to argue the matter in terms of precedent, then I am afraid the argument the hon. member for Green Point has just presented is a very spurious one. Obviously most of the colonial countries that got their independence were members of their colonial mother countries and enjoyed the same systems of law in the mother countries. The example mentioned by the hon. member for Sandton developed subsequent to independence and indicated just what happened in those particular cases, without expressing any judgment on the ability or quality of the people there who construct their own legal systems. We might not agree with it, but that does not mean that we are saying in this particular instance it is bad or good. We are simply indicating as a matter of principle that there is a possibility that in other countries there might be different concepts of what constitutes misconduct under the law that we are now putting into this statute, that they might have different interpretations, and therefore we should maintain the discretionary freedom to determine whether, in fact, this conduct in terms of the interpretation of another court in another country constitutes such a crime that we in South Africa would deprive a person of his voting rights. That is all we are arguing about. I think it is mischievous and a deliberate misinterpretation on the part of the hon. member for Green Point to try to use it in this way.</p>

<p>As I said, the hon. member for Sandton is quite correct. There is no precedent for what we are doing here today. What we are doing here today is to make provision for voters in the Republic of South Africa, qualified voters, to exercise that vote outside the Republic, notwithstanding the fact that they are domiciled or permanently resident outside the Republic. As regards the law at the moment, if a South African citizen leaves the Republic permanently, he loses the right to vote. What we are being asked to do is to provide that those people who find themselves&#x2014;through no fault of their own, but through actions of the Government&#x2014;as South African citizens with the right to vote, in an independent State, shall have the right to continue to exercise their vote. Within the Republic we have certain laws and if a person is convicted of murder, of sedition, of an offence under the Suppression of Communism Act, of an offence under the Terrorism Act, of certain offences under the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act, or is committed under the Mental Health Act, or if he is committed to a reform school, he shall lose the right to vote. That is the position in the Republic today. I believe it is only fair and logical that those provisions should also be applied to the independent homelands, when they become independent states, in so far as qualified South African voters are concerned. They will have the right to exercise a vote within the Republic, although resident in an independent State. I believe this is a perfectly logical step and they should be allowed to do so.</p>

<p>I also have full confidence in the judicial system which will be established in the Transkei after independence and that they will administer our laws in exactly the same way as we do it. The point which the hon. member for Sandton has missed completely is the fact that it is not their laws which will apply. As from the date of independence our laws will continue to apply in the Transkei, for instance. Our Suppression of Communism Act, our Terrorism Act, our Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act and our Mental Health Act will be applied there and will be administered by them. I make this statement with one reservation, namely that raised by the hon. member for Green Point yesterday, that if and when the independent State repeals our laws as they are applied and then applies its own laws in this regard, the time will then come that we will have to take the provisions of this clause into review. We shall have to reconsider our attitude towards the application of these particular provisions. I hope the hon. the Minister took cognizance of this point yesterday and that he will take cognizance of it now.</p>

<p><span class="col_8985-8986" refersTo="page_0403"/>Yesterday the hon. member for Sandton raised the question which appears in subsection (b), which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A conviction and sentence to imprisonment without the option of a fine or an order detaining a person in a rehabilitation centre in terms of the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act.</block>

<p>He referred particularly to the provision in lines 55, 56 and 57, which has as its objective the combating of the abuse of dependence-producing drugs and alcoholic liquor. He claims that this introduction of the term &#x201C;and alcoholic liquor&#x201D; was a new addition, and that the abuse of alcoholic liquor on the Transkei, for instance, would result in a person losing his right to vote. I would, respectfully, refer the hon. member to section 30 of the Abuse of Dependence-producing Substances and Rehabilitation Centres Act, read with section 29(1)(a), which provides that a person can be committed to a rehabilitation centre if he is dependent on alcoholic liquor or dependence-producing drugs. In other words, I do not believe that there is an extension here at all, and it is with regret that I have to tell the hon. member for Sandton that we in these benches cannot support the amendments which he has moved.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is perhaps necessary for me to take up a standpoint immediately with respect to this amendment, then the argument on the other side will perhaps come to an end. I therefore want to reject the amendment immediately, and I do so because I have good reasons for it. I have never yet heard such a poor argument as the one of the hon. member for Sandton with respect to double penalties. If this is valid, then precisely the same argument is applicable to South Africa at the moment, because if a person contravenes one of those laws in South Africa at the moment, he is punished by the court and subsequently his name is also removed from the voters&#x2019; roll. This therefore applies in South Africa at the moment. This Parliament made it effective. It seems to me as if the hon. member for Sandton has put his foot in it once again, just as he did last night.</p>

<p>The second argument was raised by the hon. member for Rondebosch when he tried to save the situation by saying that he conceded that all the colonial powers originally gave independence to these people and that they all began with a legal system which they inherited from the colonial powers. He went on to say that over the years, the position has got out of hand to such an extent that people&#x2019;s hands may even be amputated. However, the position is very clear: at the moment, in accordance with the Bill at present being piloted through Parliament, the Transkei is taking over all the existing laws in their present form. It has also been provided that their highest judicial authority is an ultimate appeal to the Republic&#x2019;s Appeal Court at Bloemfontein. In other words, the legal system of the Republic is being transferred to them as is. The Roman Dutch legal system, which forms the basis of our legal system, is their system at present. During yesterday&#x2019;s debate it was said that if they were to pass unrealistic legislation not based on sound legal principles, this Parliament would be free at any time to amend this provision. However, I am not prepared to say in anticipation that the Transkei is not able to run a sound legal system, but such a statement is being made by the hon. member for Sandton and the hon. member for Rondebosch. They are saying in anticipation that the Transkei is not capable of anything of this kind. They therefore distrust the Transkei in anticipation and they request that we should even now detach our laws from the Transkei.</p>

<p>My argument is that here, in public and when they hold discussions with the Blacks as well, that party make a great fuss about wanting to co-operate with the Blacks and grant them equal rights. They also maintain that they will allow the Blacks into this Parliament and that it will be possible for the Blacks to be included on the common voters&#x2019; roll. Their point of departure, which <span class="col_8987-8988" refersTo="page_0404"/>has already been stated in public, is that a Black man may become Prime Minister in South Africa. However, this is a sham standpoint which is being adopted for outside consumption, because here, where it matters, they adopt the standpoint that the people will be inferior and that they cannot therefore be trusted. This argument is an interesting one because the issue here is one of specific matters and not merely about any limitations. It concerns specific aspects like murder, communism, high treason, terrorism and drug addiction. These are things which, in our country, are considered in a very serious light. Therefore we want to have equal treatment with respect to those people who live in the Transkei. We adopt the standpoint that the Transkeian Government is a responsible government and will also consider these things in a serious light and that they will implement, and continue to implement, our legislation concerning these matters, and do so in such a way as to make it clear that they consider them in a serious light. When the courts of that country find a person guilty of some serious offence, we believe that we must have sufficient respect for those courts to implement their findings immediately so that, as is the case in South Africa, the person concerned may be removed from the voters&#x2019; roll. This is the point of departure of the government and we stand by it. If hon. members tell me that there is no similar example elsewhere in the world, I tell them that a similar situation does not prevail elsewhere in the world. Why should our country always imitate other people? South Africa is often able to take the lead and this is what we are doing in this case. I think that there are several countries in the world that could profit by looking at what we are doing here. We are not at all behind. On the contrary. We are ahead in many spheres. Hon. members may just as well take a look around in the outside world. Therefore, in spite of all the other arguments raised, I cannot accept the amendment. I hope the hon. member has enough intelligence to withdraw his amendment, because in fact this is all that could save his party under these circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree with the previous speakers, but I want to raise a new aspect which has not been emphasized and I think it is important that it should be emphasized. In the reasons advanced for these amendments it was explained that in some countries a man may have his hands cut off for theft. What has not been emphasized is that there are four things which can lead up to losing one&#x2019;s vote: treason, murder, conviction of an offence of communism or terrorism, and drug abuse.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>This clause refers to section 13(4A) of the Act, a new subsection introduced by clause 5 to deal with the registration of voters. Section 9 of the Act provides that application for registration must be made to the electoral officer for the area in which the voter resides or carries on business, as the case may be. It is now to be amended by allowing applicants who live in an independent homeland to deliver the application to the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s office in the Republic. In the Second Reading I objected to the new proposal for the Whites living in the Transkei, contending that they should be registered in one area or office because of their community of interest. In section 43 of the Constitution of the Republic Act it is laid down that a delimitation commission shall give due consideration to certain factors. The first is community or diversity of interests. I pointed out that the voters in the Transkei would be dispersed over several constituencies and that this was against their interest. The hon. the Minister, in introducing the Bill, referred to Cofimvaba and said that the voters in Cofimvaba would be registered in Queenstown because the Queenstown office is the nearest office, as the crow flies, to Cofimvaba. That, of course, is incorrect. The voters in Cofimvaba will be registered at Cathcart because Cathcart is 27 km closer, as the crow flies, than Queenstown is. By road Queenstown is closer, but not as the crow flies. I see the hon. the Minister shaking his head. I have just consulted the map, however, and if the hon. the Minister checks up on the map he will find that, as the crow flies, Cathcart is nearest to Cofimvaba. The voters of Tsomo, which is alongside Cofimvaba, will be registered at Stutterheim, while the voters of Cala, on the other side of Cofimvaba, will be registered in the Aliwal North constituency. The voters of Lady Frere which also adjoins would be registered in the Queenstown constituency.</p>

<p>If we go to the other area, Umzimkulu is nearest to Ixopo, but Flagstaff, Lusikisiki, Port St. Johns and Bizana are nearest, as the crow flies, to Harding. Umtata and the surrounding areas are nearest to Maclear, so voters there will be registered in Aliwal North whereas voters in Butterworth and areas lower down are nearest to Komga, so they will remain in the East Griqualand constituency as it is now. As I have said, the Transkei will be cut up into about four or five different constituencies, and I submit that that is not fair to those voters. They have a community interest and should be all concentrated in one constituency.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my amendment to this clause on the Order Paper becomes meaningless unless my amendment to clause 5 is accepted. However, I shall not be able to move the amendment to clause 5 because, during the Second Reading debate, the House rejected our reasoned amendment which did, in fact, deal with this position. Since my amendment on the Order Paper will therefore be meaningless <span class="col_8991-8992" refersTo="page_0406"/>I shall not move it. I do ask the hon. the Minister, however, to reconsider this whole matter. He must please look at the map and see what will happen to that constituency and I request him, once he has done that, to reconsider the matter and introduce an amendment in the Other Place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we considered the matter before we drafted this Bill. It concerns one principle only. How it is to be implemented is merely a matter of the most practical method. The principle at issue here is whether the Transkei is or is not to be regarded as a unit for the purposes of delimitation in the future. That is the key decision to be taken. The hon. member and his party are in favour of the Transkei being regarded as a unit. However, our point of departure is that at the next delimitation&#x2014;we must bear in mind that until the next delimitation the position remains as it is at present; it is not being affected&#x2014;we shall have the position that the Transkei will then probably be independent, and when it is independent, there will no longer be borders making it part of the Republic of South Africa. In other words, as far as we are concerned that territory is then foreign territory and the people living within those borders cannot then be kept together as a group and placed in one constituency. How are we to do this? We must adopt a practical approach to the matter. We should have to take 5 000 or 6 000 Transkeian voters and add 2 000 voters from somewhere in South Africa to obtain the full quota. We should then have to give the constituency a name&#x2014;Konga or something of the kind. That is what it would amount to in practice. Then the people in the north of the Transkei would probably be much further away from this bottommost part than from Aliwal North or Harding. The community of interests is that they will all be living in the Transkei. However, the argument is that they must remain a unit because they have other interests which will extend across the borders. Our point of departure is therefore one of principle.</p>

<p>We do not see our way clear to continue to regard the Transkei as a unitary bloc after independence and after the next delimitation, as if nothing had happened with regard to the Transkei. In other words, for delimitation purposes we are not prepared to regard the Transkei after independence as we regard it now. Naturally we must give the voters in the Transkei the franchise. We have undertaken to do so, and we have just confirmed it again here. However, we think the most practical method is to register the people in the nearest bordering constituency. The place where the application for registration is submitted is the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s office in the Republic of South Africa, but whether it is Cathcart or Queenstown makes no difference to me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But those two places are in different constituencies.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is true, but it makes no difference where the application is submitted, because the chief electoral officer in Pretoria will eventually decide what constituency the person who submitted the application will fall under. The determining factor is the magistrate&#x2019;s office nearest to the person who has applied. It is not true, therefore, that because a person decides to apply at Cathcart, he will be registered in the constituency in which Cathcart is situated. It is provided that he must apply at the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s office but that does not mean that he will automatically be placed on the voters&#x2019; roll of the constituency in which that magistrate&#x2019;s office is situated. Furthermore, it may happen that after delimitation, different borders may be determined for constituencies. It is a pragmatic solution that he should register at the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s office. We then know what magistrate&#x2019;s office is nearest to him. At the time of delimitation the delimitation commission will be able to take into account the fact that a certain number of voters in the Transkei have registered themselves in magisterial districts falling under the constituency of Queenstown, whereas others will have registered in the magistrate&#x2019;s offices of other constituencies. When delimitation takes place, the number of voters in the Transkei who have registered themselves in the various magisterial districts will be taken into account in determining the quota.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 5 deals with several issues, and by way of our amendment to the Second Reading we placed before the House our attitude to different aspects of this clause. We recorded our objection to certain of its provisions. The issues dealt with under this clause are, firstly, the retention of franchise rights in the Republic by those South African citizens who find themselves in a homeland at the time of its becoming independent. They have those franchise rights whether they are registered or not. If they are qualified to register, they can still do so. The second issue is the question of the retention of franchise rights in South Africa by South African citizens who are qualified to vote and who leave South Africa to take up residence in the independent homeland after it has become independent. The third issue concerns the method of dealing with these persons in the interim period up to the date of the next delimitation and also the method of the delimitation and the effect that delimitation will have on them afterwards. Or reasoned amendment at the Second Reading, I think, made our attitude quite clear. We strongly support the retention of the right to vote in respect of the South African citizens who are entitled to vote and who are in the Transkei or any other independent homeland at the time of its becoming independent.</p>

<p>However, we are opposed to the second aspect, as we made clear in our amendment yesterday. I merely want to repeat our argument for the record under this clause. We are opposed to the extension of the principle which is applied by the Government in respect <span class="col_8995-8996" refersTo="page_0408"/>of the urban Bantu, viz. that where your residence is is no longer a matter of concern as regards your voting rights in the country of which you hold citizenship. Just as the urban Bantu in, say, Cape Town or Johannesburg will be required to vote in the independent State to which he is attached by law, so the franchise rights of the White voter, who takes up residence in a foreign State after it has become independent, remain attached to the Republic in terms of this Bill. We are obviously opposed to that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Griqualand East has already dealt with the question of administration in this connection and therefore I do not need to repeat that issue. Let me just say that I do hope that, as regards the delimitation aspect, the Minister will take cognizance of the need to take into consideration the community of interest of these people. This is indeed a factor provided for in our constitution. However, that is a question that will arise only when it comes to the next delimitation. Our attitude, as we expressed it in the Second Reading, remains unchanged. The amendments which appear on the Order Paper indicate our approach to these matters. However, the House has already expressed its views on those matters and, therefore, for obvious reasons I shall not move the amendments standing in my name. Nevertheless, I hope the hon. the Minister will give full consideration to the possible introduction of further amendments&#x2014;not specifically those I have placed on the Order Paper, but amendments of a similar nature.</p>

<p>As regards the clause now before us, I want to say that we regard the retention of rights of the persons in the Transkei at its date of independence as the most important aspect of this clause. We believe that this right should be retained in respect of those persons, and we shall therefore not oppose the clause at this stage.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment is concerned, we want to indicate that we are still committed to the views we expressed at the Second Reading, and will therefore oppose that amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to indicate that I agree with the principle of this clause, which in effect grants voting rights to persons who find themselves in their homeland at the time of its becoming independent. However, I share with the hon. member for Green Point the view that people who of their own free will and volition emigrate to the homeland after it has become independent should in fact enjoy no special preference other than is enjoyed by any South African citizen in regard to any other State and particularly in regard to States in Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Well, because the rest of Africa is right next door. Let me give an example. Public servants are protected in whatever country they serve South Africa. However, many ordinary citizens serve South Africa very loyally and very properly in their private capacity or for their companies in States outside South Africa. This concerns Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Rhodesia or any other State. These people are not accorded any special preferences in regard to their voting rights. I feel that since the Transkei is in due course to become an independent State, the situation should not be any different from the position in respect of any other African State. That is why I used that example. I think the creation of these special circumstances in fact destroys the consistency of the treatment which is afforded to South African citizens who serve South Africa, in a private capacity perhaps, in other countries in Africa and abroad. I feel that the natural consequence of accepting the wording proposed by the hon. the Minister is that we should look at the rights of voters who are in other African States, such as the ones I have mentioned, and see whether the rights of voting which are to be granted by this Parliament to voters in the Transkei should not also be granted to voters who go out of South Africa on contract, on business or for any other purpose, and who retain their South African citizenship. I believe that they too should have those rights.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think there is anything new <span class="col_8997-8998" refersTo="page_0409"/>I can add to the arguments I advanced yesterday during the Second Reading concerning the principle of this matter. Perhaps I could just summarize briefly by saying that we believe that after independence, the Transkei will be sovereign and independent, just as any other state is sovereign and independent. There will be no restriction of any nature on its independence. However, we envisage for the future that the States which at present form part of South Africa and which will become independent in accordance with our policy, will be a community of states enjoying specially privileged positions mutually in respect of each other, which will differ from the relationship between South Africa and states which do not at present form part of the Republic of South Africa and which must therefore be dealt with in another way. This is our point of departure; this is our policy and we shall carry it out. Once again I want to refer briefly to the example I mentioned yesterday. In the old British Commonwealth, all the states enjoyed total sovereign independence. That very opposition party pointed out how strongly independent South Africa was as a member of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>That is the sort of answer one can expect from that hon. Minister. In the past, the hon. the Minister has expressed himself on the subject of confederation. Is this what he means by a &#x201C;confederation&#x201D;?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I shall come to that shortly. As I have said, our point of departure is very clear. In the old British Commonwealth, its various members enjoyed total sovereign independence, but there were privileged relations between them and the mother country with regard to entry and departure, passports, visas, imports, exports, etc. In the present Republic of South Africa and its homeland states which are becoming independent, a similar relationship will exist. It will certainly not be on the basis of a commonwealth, but the same principle, viz. one of privilege with regard to the individual members and the mother country, will remain. For example, I refer to the Public Service Act which was amended yesterday to provide them with permanent appointments here and which does not apply to Malawi or Rhodesia. Then, too, there is the issue of entry and of movement, in regard to which there will be certain arrangements in terms of which this will be easier than in the case of foreign states. The franchise, too, we see in the same light. White South Africans who go to one of these homelands after independence or find themselves there will retain their franchise in South Africa. On a mutual basis, Blacks from that area who find themselves in South Africa will also retain their franchise in the homelands. This is the principle behind this.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sir. I should like to ask what this is going to mean to those people. It means that where at the moment you have a community and where then you will have a community which is a closed community and a community with certain intimate interests, their right to vote as a unit in terms of the Constitution Act is going to be removed as they will be divided amongst various constituencies. The effect of this, I submit, is going to be that they will not be heard as a community. Their whole voice will be dissipated in these various constituencies. I wonder if the decision of the hon. the Minister and the Government in this case has not been dictated by political consideration rather than by practical considerations, the interests of the persons concerned. It has been shown during the last three general elections that the Government has not even contested that seat because it knows that it cannot win it. In other words, as a seat it can be won by the Opposition. Now if 5 000 voters are going to be dispersed over five constituencies their voice will be lost. They will no longer have any voice whatsoever in this Parliament.</p>

<p>The argument remains that a party with a two-thirds majority is not concerned about a single seat. After all, we do not want to become a one-party state eventually.

<p>Clause 8:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 8 of the Bill deals with deletions from the voters&#x2019; roll, whereas in terms of the Act as it is at the moment, a person who has left the Republic with the intention of not returning thereto, automatically has his name removed from the roll. In terms of clause 8 that provision will not apply to any person who has left the Republic with the intention of retaining a home in an independent State.</p>

<p>The question I want to raise with the hon. the Minister, is the question whether&#x2014;from the date of removal to the independent State, up until the next delimitation&#x2014;that particular individual is to remain in the particular constituency in which he was registered at the time of his removal. For instance: If a family of eight in my constituency were to take up residence in the Transkei, are they then to remain on the Green Point voters&#x2019; roll until the next delimitation, or can they avail themselves of re-registration on the basis of the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s court? When the next delimitation is made, those persons will then be grouped together with those who are registered with the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s court. I see the hon. the Minister is nodding his head. Therefore I take it that I am correct when I say that they would remain there until they themselves apply for re-registration at the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s court.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<p>Not necessarily.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that it is not necessarily so. The present position is that if voter A moves from constituency of Green Point to constituency of Pretoria Central, he must apply for a transfer to the new constituency. If a voter of the Green Point constituency goes to the Transkei, he will remain on the Green Point voters&#x2019; list, unless he avails himself of the opportunity of re-registering at the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s court. The question which now arises is under what constituency he will fall before the next delimitation. For instance, if a voter is registered in Cathcart, does he then become a voter in the present delimitated East Griqualand constituency, or does he become a voter in the constituency in which the specific magistrate&#x2019;s court is situated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Green Point has stated this problem. I think it would be best if I were to deal with the problem as a whole. One possibility is that the voters register themselves when they arrive in the Transkei. If they do so&#x2014;at the nearest polling district outside the Transkei&#x2014;then they immediately and automatically become voters of the constituency under which that magisterial district falls. If these people do not register themselves there at all, then they could remain on the voter&#x2019;s roll of Green Point in the normal way except for certain specific possibilities. The voters of Green Point, when departing from the Republic, will fill in a form at whichever border post through which they enter the Transkei, as proof that they are leaving the Republic permanently. If they envisage settling in the United Kingdom, for example, then their vote falls away entirely. However, if they want to settle in the Transkei, then this legislation at present being piloted through Parliament applies to them. It means <span class="col_9003-9004" refersTo="page_0412"/>that they will arrive in the Transkei and if they have not registered themselves, then we shall in any event be aware of the fact that they have left the Republic. We shall also know where they have settled and we can therefore send them the usual forms which they must then fill in and return to us in terms of section 30 of the Electoral Laws Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>However, there is no obligation on them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They may do so voluntarily, but because a voter has left his constituency and is permanently settled in a new place of residence, the Government can direct him to fill in a new form. Section 30<i>bis</i> of the Act authorizes this, and I can quote it to the hon. member.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<p>But there is no penalty if they do not do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The voter can be directed to fill in the form. However, the fact remains that section <i>30bis</i>(1) of the Electoral Consolidation Act provides that if a permanent change has occurred in regard to the residence with reference to which a voter has been registered in the constituency, any person may after the expiration of a period of two months since the change occurred, give written notice of the change in a prescribed manner to the electoral Officer appointed for the area in which such division is situated. Section 30<i>bis</i>(2) goes on to provide that on receipt of any notice referred to in subsection (1), the electoral officer shall direct the voter concerned to complete and lodge with him in a prescribed manner the form of application of registration as a voter within the specified period. The voter is therefore directed to fill in a new form and lodge it with the electoral officer.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am glad the hon. the Minister has taken up this attitude in regard to this matter, because I believe that it is going to raise an issue which has, if I can use the expression, been ducked by the Government. That issue is that when a voter changes his address, there should be a compulsory obligation upon him to register his new address. That compulsion is not there.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find it hard to follow the reasoning of the hon. the Minister in this respect. Clause 8 of the Bill deals with section 18 of the Act. Section 18 provides that certain voters shall have their names removed from the list of voters. Included among those people who shall have their names removed from the list of voters, are those who leave the Republic with the intention of not returning thereto. In this amendment the hon. the Minister is saying to the electoral officer: You shall remove the names of all those people who leave the Republic without the intention of returning thereto, but you shall not remove from the roll the names of those who leave the Republic to go to an independent State with the intention of remaining there. If that is the case, how can the hon. the Minister, when the voter crosses the border, use another means to say to the voter that he must supply the card which is going to remove his name from the voters&#x2019; roll.</p>

<p>No, that is not nonsense at all. That is what is written here. An obligation is placed on the electoral officer not to remove the person&#x2019;s name. That is where the argument of the hon. member for Green Point is correct. The voter from Green Point who goes to live in Umzimkulu, will remain on the voters&#x2019; roll in Green Point and the electoral officer is told he is not to remove that voters name from the Green Point roll. He is to leave it there. Let us take the case &#x2026;</p>

<p>Until the next delimitation or until he re-registers. His name will remain there until the next delimitation when, if he does not re-register, his name will automatically be placed in the constituency in which is situated the magistrate&#x2019;s office which is nearest to his place of residence. I would like to point out, however, that there is no compulsion upon him to re-register as those sections of the Act have never been applied by this Government. Let us deal with the situation in the interim. What happens when we have an election before the next general election? We can have a voter from Green Point who has moved to Umzimkulu and if the hon. the Minister has compelled him to re-register, that voter, whose residence is in Umzimkulu, which is within the boundaries of the present constituency of Griqualand East, will be compelled to register in the Ixopo magisterial district. Ixopo is in the South Coast constituency. So you are going to have people resident in Umzimkulu voting in two different constituencies. [Interjections.] It is not nonsense. People who are in Umzimkulu today will still continue to vote, before the next delimitation, in the Griqualand East constituency while those persons who move into Umzimkulu and who are compelled to reregister there will find themselves registered in the South Coast constituency. I believe the hon. the Minister must have a look and see what he is doing with this clause and think about it again.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we opposed this Bill at the Second Reading by way of reasoned amendments and recorded our objections to it in the first place, because it allows South African citizens who take up permanent residence or domicile in an independent homeland after the independence of that homeland to register as voters in the Republic. This is contrary, we believe, to any other accepted practice in the rest of the world. We objected to it also because it alters the position of those people who are permanently resident in the Transkei at the moment and who are on the voters&#x2019; roll in the constituency of Griqualand East, in that it would dispose the effect of their votes because they would then be placed in different constituencies which would vary in number in terms of the proposition now that they would be registered in the nearest magistracy as the crow flies. We stress the point that these voters in the Transkei have a community of interests and that their interests are quite different from those of voters living outside the Transkei and that in the circumstances they should have been kept as one block to use their influence and their pressure where necessary, but unfortunately we lost on that in the Committee Stage. I would point out again that according to the proposals now, you can have the present voters registered in the Transkei being placed in about four or five different constituencies. The question has been raised by some hon. members as to whether those who are closer to Harding and Ixopo, as the crow flies, will be put into Natal constituencies, which is a different province from the Cape, while they have always been associated with the Cape. I take it now that when there are independent States, the provincial boundaries will no longer apply and these people will now find themselves registered in Natal and others in the Cape. We oppose this. We have tried to get <span class="col_9007-9008" refersTo="page_0414"/>our amendments accepted to provide that those who enter the Transkei after independence will not retain their citizenship rights and that those in the Transkei will be kept in one block. But in this Third Reading we have to take a different attitude. If we oppose the Third Reading of this Bill, it will mean that we will be denying South African citizens now living in the Transkei and registered as voters, the right to vote after independence. That we do not wish to do. We wish them to retain their rights because they are in a foreign country not of their own accord but many of them because they cannot get out and will be compelled to stay in the area. Because of this factor, we wish these people to retain their political rights in the Republic and therefore we will not oppose the Third Reading.</p>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, two of the matters raised by the official Opposition were supported by us in the Second Reading. There is firstly, the question of people moving into the independent State after the independence of that State. Our feeling is&#x2014;and I put it in the Committee Stage as well&#x2014;that those people should not be accorded privileges which do not pertain to people serving South Africa in private capacities in other States of Africa. That point was lost.</p>

<p>The other point raised in opposition to this Bill was that it is our belief that it is incorrect to apportion, in such a manner, South African voters in the Transkei who register prior to the next delimitation but after independence. We felt that this would have the effect, in some circumstances, of crossing provincial boundaries, a principle we believe to be incorrect. We also stated that this could well affect the loading and the deloading of seats and that Parliament would be acting as an arbitrary mini-delimitation commission, a principle we also consider to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Our third point of opposition seems to have raised a certain amount of ire in this House. Our third point was that we believe that citizens of South Africa should be responsible to South Africa for any offences they may commit and that they are punishable for those offences if found guilty, but we also feel that the rights of South African citizens should not be subject to laws applied and interpreted in foreign countries. On that basis, too, we opposed this Bill at Second Reading and at the Committee Stage. Those points, however, were also lost in debate and in the vote after the debate.</p>

<p>Unlike the official Opposition, however, we believe that if one takes a stand in which one believes, one based on principle, one sticks to it. One does not, because one feels one has lost even a few major points, raised with quite some vehemence in the debate, I might add, suddenly change one&#x2019;s viewpoint at Third Reading. Our view is that although this Bill provides for the rights of voters who find themselves inside the Transkei on the date of independence, certain wrong principles are being introduced and remain in the Bill, and those wrong principles are sufficient for us to say that we will be consistent in opposing the Third Reading of the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall be very brief in replying to the hon. member for Sandton. As has been indicated by the hon. member for Griqualand East, we have made it clear that there are various issues involved in this Bill. We have assessed the issue of paramount significance, however, and that is that one should ensure that there is no deprivation of existing rights. We have therefore indicated that we shall support this Third Reading. The hon. member for Sandton is now prepared to throw overboard the rights of the existing voters in the Transkei in case, in the future, certain South African citizens may take up residence or permanent domicile in the Transkei. I think, however, that we have made abundantly clear&#x2014;in fact, so clear that I do not think I need to elaborate on it during this Third Reading debate&#x2014;what issue is of greater importance. As far as rights of the vote in South Africa are concerned, we believe that there are certain conditions that should be retained and should continue to apply, and we believe that if a man is guilty of the offences set out in the Electoral Act, offences which deprive him of the right to vote in South Africa if he is within South Africa, if he is convicted in terms of laws to combat terrorism, communism and drug abuse&#x2014;amongst others&#x2014;and of course if he has been convicted of murder and treason, he should likewise lose his voting rights extended to him while he is in another country.</p>

<p><span class="col_9009-9010" refersTo="page_0415"/>Finally, I want to emphasize that when we in this party talk about a federal concept for South Africa, we do so because we believe that we can rely upon and seek the support of the Black people who today are South African citizens and are a part of our South African nation. Sir, if it is the wish, as Parliament has already indicated in the Status of the Transkei Bill, that they should have exclusive control over a part of the ground of South Africa, it does not in any way shake our belief that they will carry out their responsibilities, which we would like them to carry out on a federal basis, in such a way that it will ultimately lead to a confederation in South Africa, as the hon. Minister has said.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, since we have reached the end of this debate, I should like to reply very briefly to the matters raised this afternoon. In the first place I want to refer to the standpoint of the hon. member for Griqualand East. He made an appeal once again with regard to the community of interests of these people. He said that they had common interests, and that we should retain them as such. I just want to put it to him for consideration that the community of interests of the people who will be in the Transkei after independence will be in respect of the Transkei. The franchise they exercise here has no influence on what happens in the Transkei. It concerns the situation in South Africa. In other words, the vote they cast in that regard cannot change their position in the Transkei in any way. To that I want to add that the Transkei as an independent State will have its own laws, its own members of Parliament, etc. The rights which those people retain as South African citizens, they will therefore exercise in South Africa, and in that connection they will be involved in the constituencies on their immediate borders. This is clear to me.</p>

<p>Secondly, if they want to exercise influence in this Parliament to bring about certain arrangements between us and the Transkei, they will be in a better position to do so under our system than under the system proposed by the hon. member, because they will then have a say in four or five constituencies. They will have four or five representatives of various parties who can put their case here in this Parliament. Under such circumstances they will even be able to submit petitions. [Interjections.] It is therefore very clear that our system will be far more beneficial to those voters than the system proposed by the hon. member. Furthermore, I want to confirm that as I read the legislation, I believe that some of those voters may be included in Natal constituencies at a subsequent delimitation. Those who are in the northern parts of the Transkei, whose nearest magistrate&#x2019;s office is situated in Natal, could probably land up in a Natal constituency.</p>

<p>In what way will numbers of people in the Transkei be used to establish the provincial quota for delimitation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, surely it is clear as crystal that the people will be registered in the nearest magisterial district. The 5 000 White voters at present in the Transkei will, as a result of this legislation, eventually find themselves, after a subsequent delimitation, in five or six different magisterial districts where they will then be registered. Those who fall under Natal will be included in Natal and those who fall under the Cape will be included in the Cape. The quota will be established in this way. This Parliament in no way puts itself forward as a delimitation commission. I am now speaking entirely hypothetically, but say, for argument&#x2019;s sake, there are a thousand votes in the north of the Transkei which will fall under Natal. At a subsequent delimitation those thousand votes will be included in the nearest magisterial district of Natal. Those thousand votes will be taken into calculation at a subsequent delimitation. It is as simple as that. To say now that this Parliament is playing at being a delimitation commission means that the hon. member does not understand the legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sandton once again repeated a standpoint which he stated earlier. I had thought he would have tried to get out of it in an easier way by simply remaining silent. However, he repeated the standpoint that they objected to the fact that if a person is guilty of a serious offence in the Transkei, according to the Transkeian laws, for example if he is found guilty there of high treason or murder or something of that nature, then that should disqualify him for the purpose of our voter&#x2019;s roll. That was the hon. members point of departure.</p>

<p><span class="col_9011-9012" refersTo="page_0416"/>This once again brings me to the standpoint that those hon. members, whichever weak arguments they may try to hide behind, have one of two things in mind in this connection. The one possibility is that they are contemptuous in advance of the Transkei&#x2019;s legislative ability, and what this amounts to is that they will immediately amend and change reasonable laws in order to make them unacceptable to the voters in South Africa in this way. The other possibility is that they are not prepared to adopt a strong standpoint with regard to these offences or, in other words, that they do not feel so strongly about high treason, communism or the abuse of drugs. One of these two reasons must be behind the argument they advanced.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. the Minister whether there is not perhaps a third reason, namely that they only just managed to retain their deposit in a recent by-election in Griqualand East?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that may be a further reason. In any event they have not received much support in that constituency. That party is now proclaiming in public that they are in favour of giving the franchise to the Black people in this Parliament on a common voters&#x2019; roll. These, now, are the people who say that they are prepared to accept Black people as members of this Parliament. They are the people who say that they are prepared to recognize a Black majority government in South Africa. They say it openly. I have proof of this if anyone should question it. I refer hon. members to what Senator Bamford said in the Other Place on 11 May this year. I may not quote it here, but it appears in column 2177 of the Senate Hansard. To be specific, Senator Bamford confirmed that his party was in favour of a Black majority Government being able to come into power in South Africa. It is as well that we know this. It is as well, too, that the voters know this. Those hon. members are supposedly so prepared in public to afford so much support to the Blacks and to express so much confidence in them that they are prepared to entrust such powers to them, but when it comes to a Bill such as this, they register the strongest objection that the legislation of those people should be passed in such a way.</p>

<p>The issue of loading and deloading I have already dealt with. In conclusion I just want to refer to the concept &#x201C;confederation&#x201D; to which reference has been made. I do not use the concept &#x201C;confederation&#x201D; with regard to the final answer. Please, anything but that! There must be no mistake about this. The final concept which this party envisages has been expressed in various ways over the years. Dr. Verwoerd referred to something like a commonwealth. Our hon. Prime Minister refers to a power bloc. Indeed, some people refer to a confederation. We have not yet decided on a name which will describe the final position, but it is very clear that under our policy of independent homelands, a number of states will develop out of the Republic of South Africa. Each of those States will enjoy sovereign independence in its own right on both the political and the constitutional level. But in the field of economics and in a number of other fields, too, these States will be interdependent. Furthermore, there will be special relationships between us and them in specific spheres. For example, this legislation makes special provision with regard to the franchise of people. The Public Service Commission Act, again, provides for permanent posts in the Public Service. In this way various arrangements are being made. In other words, there will be a community of nations, as I would call it, which will develop out of the present Republic of South Africa, and which will eventually be able to move forward together and which will attempt under all circumstances to constitute an anti-communist bloc to ensure peaceful co-existence in this part of the world. This is the ultimate goal we are moving towards and this Bill is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Following on the Government&#x2019;s decision to grant full independence to the Transkei and whereas it is envisaged that, by way of agreements between the respective Governments, to continue the services presently rendered by the Administration of Coloured Affairs to Coloured persons resident in the Transkei after independence, it is right and proper that those Coloureds should for the foreseeable future retain their right of participation in the highest Coloured representative body in the Republic for as long as they remain South African citizens, by having the right to be registered as voters and to vote for the Coloured Persons Representative Council of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Due to the provision in the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, 1964, i.e. that a person who is registered on the Coloured voters&#x2019; list must have been resident in a particular province of the Republic for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding nomination or election to the council, and the fact that the Transkei after independence will no longer form part of a province, a person remaining in the Transkei will no longer qualify for nomination or election as members of the council. Until such time as the Transkei is omitted by a re-division of electoral divisions&#x2014;which must take place at the latest during May 1979&#x2014;Coloureds resident in the Transkei will, however, still be entitled to register as voters and to vote in their present electoral division, namely Eastern Cape.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned Act the definition of &#x201C;Coloured person&#x201D; is tied to classification under the Population Registration Act, 1950, and since this Act will not be applicable in the Transkei after independence, the definition would have to be extended as reflected in clause 4 of the Bill: firstly, whereas its general functions and powers are at present restricted <span class="col_9015-9016" refersTo="page_0418"/>to the Republic, to enable the Coloured Persons Representative Council to render services to all and to use its funds outside the Republic and, secondly, to make it possible for Coloured persons residing in the Transkei to remain on and to be included in the voters&#x2019; list for the council.</p>

<p>With regard to this amplification, it is considered advisable to provide not only for the Transkei, but also for any other territory in the Republic which may later become independent.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Electoral Consolidation Act, 1946, are, with certain exceptions&#x2014;provided for in section 9 of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, Act, 1964<i>&#x2014;mutatis mutandis</i> applicable to the registration of voters, the preparation of voters&#x2019; lists and any matter affecting the election of members of the Coloured Persons Representative Council. Following on the amendment of the Electoral Act to regulate the registration of and voting by any voter who resides in an independent State, it is necessary that the differing provisions of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, i.e. the exceptions mentioned previously, be adapted to the new set-up in order to bring the prescribed registration and voting procedures into line. This is being done in clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill, while clause 3 contains a correction of an obsolete term.</p>

<p>In further explanation I wish to add that section 13 of the Electoral Act, as amplified by clause 5 of the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, 1976, is <i>mutatis mutandis</i> applicable to the registration of Coloured voters having their homes in an independent State. It amounts to this, that a Coloured person, as re-defined in clause 4 of this Bill, provided he is, in terms of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, entitled to be registered as a voter, may continue after a territory has become independent to have himself registered as a voter for the council, the only change being that he has to do it at the nearest magistrate&#x2019;s office in the Republic. Mention of section 13(4B) of the Electoral Act in clause 1 of this Bill is intended to ensure that Coloured persons having their home in a territory and whose names already appear on the Coloured voters&#x2019; list, remain so registered after the date of independence.</p>

<p>And, finally, Mr. Speaker, I wish to announce that I shall move an amendment as printed in my name on the Order Paper during the Committee Stage in order to bring clause 5 of this Bill into line with the corresponding clauses in the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill and the Status of the Transkei Bill passed yesterday.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has set out in reasonable detail what steps are being taken to protect the franchise rights of the Coloured people in the Transkei or those who will move to the Transkei later, after the independence of that territory. I have little quarrel with all the hon. the Minister has said. I think he has given us a fairly full explanation which is completely clear to me.</p>

<p>However, there are one or two further comments I should like to make. In the first instance, I want to reaffirm that this Bill seeks to regulate the registration and voting rights of Coloured voters who may find themselves resident in an independent State, an area which was formerly an integral part of the Republic of South Africa. Because this situation may arise through no fault or desire of such voters, this legislation is now necessary as the Status of the Transkei Bill has been passed by the House and will subsequently become a law of the country. To protect the voting rights of those Coloured voters who will be resident in the Transkei after its independence, it is necessary that this Bill be passed now. The voting rights of Coloured people are provided for in the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, but the mechanics, as the hon. the Minister has tried to point out, of how they exercise that right, are provided for in the Electoral Act, which is presently being dealt with.</p>

<p>Amendments to these provisions in the Electoral Amendment Act before the House will therefore apply, as I understand it, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to Coloured voters in terms of section 9 of the CRC Act. However, to ensure that the voting rights of Coloured persons resident in the independent Transkei, or who may in future take up residence there, are provided for. Clause 1 of the Bill we are considering makes doubly sure in this regard. In paragraph (b)(ii) it is provided that the roll of Coloured voters resident in the Transkei shall continue until the next delimitation, which means that the present voters retain the right to vote. Qualified Coloured voters who <span class="col_9017-9018" refersTo="page_0419"/>have their homes in the Transkei after independence, will continue to be registered as voters in the Republic. Any other Coloureds who qualify as voters in the Republic and who move to the Transkei, will be registered as voters. Coloured persons resident in the Transkei who qualify to vote after independence will also qualify to be registered as voters. Apart from these differences, it is pleasing to note that the Coloured voters are being dealt with in exactly the same manner as the White voters in respect of the protection of their franchise rights. For this reason we will support the Bill.</p>

<p>There is an additional provision in the Bill regarding the disqualification of voters for reasons of conviction for certain offences or detention under certain laws applicable also in respect of conviction or detention under certain laws within an independent State. These provisions are acceptable in that the offences will be committed and convictions obtained under laws passed by this Parliament and applicable in the Republic. This is, in terms of the provisions in both the Status of the Transkei Bill and the draft Transkei Constitution Bill, which provide that such laws will continue to apply in the Transkei after it becomes independent. If the Transkei, in the future, radically amends its legislation, there will be time enough for a review of the provisions of our relevant laws. In the meantime, we in these benches are completely satisfied that the laws which apply there&#x2014;those passed by this Parliament&#x2014;will be properly administered by the Transkei and are happy indeed that the situation can be treated with confidence. In fact, we have confidence that the new State of the Transkei&#x2014;which we have created by legislation passed in this House&#x2014;will properly administer those laws. Therefore we do not think the amendments which have been moved by the hon. member for Rondebosch are necessary and we will certainly not support them.</p>

<p>I have indicated that we support the Bill, but in doing so I have also to indicate that although the Bill protects the franchise right of Coloured voters in an independent Transkei, that franchise right is of less value than the franchise of the White voters. The Coloured voters are in fact voting for an authority which is subordinate and subservient to this Parliament. This Bill flows directly from the granting of independence to the Transkei by this Parliament. I myself and all hon. members in this House, the representatives of the White electorate, have had the opportunity of participating fully in that momentous debate. I advisedly call it that, because I think the debate we have had has ushered a new era in the South African political field. However, this is not the case in respect of the Coloureds. The White voters whose stance differs from that of the Government and who believe that the fragmentation of the Republic is not in the best interests of all the people of South Africa, have had ample opportunity to state their case. We in these benches have had to opportunity of emphasizing the great advantage which a federal arrangements has for regulating and managing the affairs of a plural society without resorting to the fragmentation of the Republic. I have no doubt in my mind that this view coincides with the view of the vast majority of the Coloured electorate. However, in this great debate on a matter which affects their future as much as it affects our future, they have not had the opportunity of participating, and of making their point of view known.</p>

<p>Apart from that, we on this side of the House have no objection to this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to start with, I want to congratulate the official Opposition on the realism they have displayed in the case of this Bill, by immediately lending it their support. However, they did not do so in the case of the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill. Initially they opposed it at the Second Reading and subsequently during the Committee Stage, and they only gave it their support during the Third Reading.</p>

<p>Basically, what we have here is a Bill which is similar in effect to the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, which has just been passed by the House. It is also a Bill which is consequential to the Status of the Transkei Bill and, in point of fact, is in the first instance an administrative measure by means of which to maintain the franchise of Coloureds, as in the case of the Whites, after the independence of the Transkei. The principles involved here have already been discussed in depth during the discussion of the Status of the Transkei Bill and also during the discussion of The Electoral Laws Amendment Bill. There is therefore no need for a lengthy debate on the principles contained in this Bill.</p>

<p><span class="col_9019-9020" refersTo="page_0420"/>However, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central referred to the Standpoint of the official Opposition, in this case in regard to Coloureds who may settle in the homeland after it has become independent. The hon. member repeated the misgivings voiced by the hon. member for Green Point during the previous debate, viz. that S.A. citizens in this category cannot lay claim to the protection of their franchise in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>I cannot agree that there is a difference in principle between those who will settle in the homeland after it has become independent and those who, for example, settle there between now and the date of independence. Basically their position is the same in the respect that in both cases they know exactly what their position will be in the future, after independence. They are aware of the fact that they will then be resident in a foreign State. If, despite this, they then go and settle in that State after today, then surely they know that from the date of independence they will be living in a foreign state. The people who will go and live there between today and independence are therefore in the same position as those who go and settle there after independence.</p>

<p>I also want to maintain that White or Coloured citizens of South Africa who are already resident in the Transkei, in this case, should also have realized a long time ago that they would sooner or later be living in an independent State. Surely it has not been from today only that the Government&#x2019;s policy has been to move in the direction of independence of the homelands. If these people have stayed there voluntarily over the past few years, then surely they have voluntarily placed themselves in a position where they will eventually be living in a foreign State. However, if one accepts that there is justification for upholding the franchise of these people&#x2014;and I believe there is, and I believe, too, that we all agree that there is&#x2014;then one can find no justification for discriminating against S.A. citizens who settle there later. I say that I do not believe that there is any substance in the misgivings of the UP about this measure. I think that the misgivings voiced in this connection by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central have already been replied to very effectively in previous debates, and I think that the reason for his nevertheless having mentioned them in this debate as well, is only so as not to say quite straightforwardly that they agree with the measure, and thereby have done with it. They did just want to try and score a point.</p>

<p>The amendments printed on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. member for Rondebosch are also a precise repetition of the standpoint stated by the hon. member for Sandton in connection with the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, a standpoint which, I believe, has also been thoroughly exposed in a previous debate, <i>inter alia,</i> by the hon. member for Green Point and&#x2014;if I may say so in passing&#x2014;I cannot understand how a man can adopt so correct a standpoint in regard to one matter and then be so wide off the mark as the hon. member for Green Point was in that case. But I entirely agree with him that what the attitude displayed in this connection by the hon. members of the PRP really amounts to&#x2014;and the hon. member also said this&#x2014;is one of two things. The one possibility is that they have no confidence in the legislative abilities and the courts of law of the homelands after independence. Alternatively, this attitude is merely a further manifestation of their accommodating standpoint with regard to communism, terrorism and permissiveness, as we have found it to be in innumerable other cases. It is pointless for those hon. members to come and assure us that they are not soft on these things, because every time measures aimed at dealing with this kind of thing are considered, they come along with this kind of amendment.</p>

<p>Sir, suffice it to say that we welcome the support of the Official Opposition, and we reject in advance the standpoint which will be advanced by the members of the PRP, as it appears from the amendments on the Order Paper.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if hon. members do not interrupt me, I shall be brief. The hon. member for Mossel Bay made one point with which I agree entirely, and it is that this legislation is equivalent to the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill. However, what I find very astonishing&#x2014;and I shall come back to some of the points made by the hon. member in connection with the amendments in my name&#x2014;is specifically that despite the fact that the legislation is equivalent, there is such a major variation in the standpoints adopted by the Official Opposition. As far as the Whites and their electoral laws are concerned, they advanced a reasoned amendment and argued <span class="col_9021-9022" refersTo="page_0421"/>the matter rather hotly, but now, when the electoral laws of the Coloureds are affected, they have no argument at all, except that of support, and they say that they simply accept everything that is stated. To me this standpoint seems to involve a certain amount of contradiction and inconsistency. If it is true that the nature of the legislation in this specific case is precisely the same as that relating to the Whites, then it seems to me that the same arguments apply, and consequently the same standpoint must be adopted with regard to this matter. This is exactly what we intend to do here. We are going to adopt the same standpoint as that which we adopted with regard to the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill. [Interjections.] I am not going to repeat all the previous arguments, and if there are not so many interjections, perhaps I shall be able to state my standpoint very briefly. This of course depends entirely on the nature of the interjections. As far as we are concerned, three points are involved here.</p>

<p>The first is the status of the Coloured voter before independence. It has already been said&#x2014;and we agree&#x2014;that something must be done about this. Then of course we come to the voters who are going to live there after independence. This is the second aspect. While we were discussing the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, the hon. the Minister of the Interior made the point that the position with regard to this legislation was equivalent to that relating to the urban Bantu. I need not, of course, repeat all the arguments we have had with regard to the urban Bantu, but there is a difference in principle between the Government and ourselves in that regard. The point at issue there is that the urban Bantu has to exercise his political rights in an area he does not reside in. The position with regard to the Coloureds is therefore similar to the position with regard to those urban Bantu. This is a basic difference in principle. I believe that initially the Official Opposition differed with regard to this point too, but apparently they do not feel so strongly about it now. The third principle concerns the fact that the franchise of a South African citizen must not be dependent on the judicial administration of another country. Of course, to a certain extent the hon. the Minister of the Interior had already sketched for the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs the lines along which he could argue this matter, and we are of course told that our standpoint in this connection can be explained in one of two ways.</p>

<p>Either we have no confidence in the ability of the Transkeians to pass legislation or to apply it in a way which would be acceptable to us, or else we are &#x201C;soft&#x201D;&#x2014;as the hon. member for Mossel Bay says&#x2014;on things like terrorism, communism, etc. With one of those typically resounding declamations which -sound fine in the House but mean nothing in practice, the hon. member for Durban Point said that terrorism here was the same as terrorism there, and that communism here was the same as communism there.</p>

<p>However, I want to mention a few illustrations. Solzhenitsyn was sent to an institution for the mentally ill in his fatherland because he wrote things which were not acceptable to the rulers of his country.</p>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<p>Precisely. He was declared mentally ill in that specific society. However, suppose he was a Coloured who had come to South Africa. Under the previous legislation he would be regarded as someone who was either subversive or mentally ill. This of course illustrates the principle. In various societies, in various states, there are various ideas about what is subversive. However our standpoint is very clear, viz. that our amendments do not aim to create a situation in which any Coloured, White or other person should be excluded from the jurisdiction of the South African courts of law&#x2014;viz. outside the jurisdiction of these specific laws. That is the point we are making. Legislation of this kind which seeks to deal with specific problems such as subversion and communism is usually contentious legislation and to a large extent it is consistent with the standpoint of the government in any specific society. There are illustrations of this. In some societies in Africa&#x2014;and I am not going to mention any names now&#x2014;if a person who refuses to stand still when the State President&#x2019;s motor-car passes, then that deed is regarded as nigh treason. This is an illustration, and when I quote these illustrations, I do not want to imply thereby that the same is going to happen here. This merely reflects the difference there can be between various systems of law. This also reflects the fact that every society must <span class="col_9023-9024" refersTo="page_0422"/>have the right to determine under which circumstances its own citizens may lose their franchise, without providing statutorily in advance that whatever the nature of the legislation which may be brought into effect in another society, it automatically means that it can affect the rights of those people as voters. These are the same arguments we have had before. I have simply made another attempt to illustrate the matter here.</p>

<p>I want to state very clearly that the two alternatives which the hon. the Minister of the Interior mentioned earlier, which were repeated by the hon. member for Mossel Bay, form no part whatsoever of the motivation for our own amendments. They concern the fundamental standpoint on principle that the franchise of the South African citizen, whether he be Coloured or White or whatever, should not be dependent on the judicial administration of another country. For this reason, and on the basis of exactly the same standpoints which were stated with regard to the previous piece of legislation, we are unable to support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Mossel Bay seems to have got himself a little bit mixed up. He said that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central had expressed doubts regarding this Bill. I do not believe that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central expressed any doubts at all. I believe that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central put it quite clearly to the hon. the Minister that, accepting what is here now, and what has already been approved by this House, he supported the Bill. Apart from the one reservation that if in the future an independent State should amend or repeal the Acts which apply today, we should have another look at this, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central gave his unreserved support to this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is the whole point. I believe that both the hon. members for Mossel Bay and Rondebosch have a procedural problem in this regard. The Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, which has just gone through all its stages in this House, contains certain provisions which we in the official Opposition opposed, but it is not competent for us, in a debate on this Bill, to oppose those provisions. There is nothing in this Bill which is now before us which applies those provisions to this particular Bill, or to the Coloured people. If the hon. member for Mossel Bay looks at the Electoral Act, he will see that in terms of section 9 of the Act, those provisions do apply to the Coloured people, but there is nothing in this Bill which enables me at this stage to discuss those provisions. If I did so, I would be out of order, because there is nothing in the Bill which refers to section 9 or to those provisions in the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member means paragraph (b)(ii), as amended by clause 1. All that is done in terms of paragraph (b)(ii) is to apply the new section 13(4B). I want to say here and now that, as far as we are concerned, section 13(4B) was acceptable to us. The one which was not acceptable to us was section 13(4A). Where was the hon. member when we discussed that? The amendments we moved were to section 13(4A) and not to section 13(4B). I am not empowered to deal with section 13(4A) in terms of this Bill. [Interjections.] Now the hon. member at last concedes the point, Sir. He sees my point entirely. I wonder whether the hon. member for Rondebosch has paid attention to the argument. Exactly the same argument applies as far as he and his party are concerned. The attitude which they are adopting is out of court, and certainly out of Parliament, as far as this Bill is concerned. Let me put it to the hon. member for Rondebosch in another way. He suggested that we should now move the amendments in respect of the Coloured voters which we tried to move when we debated the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill. If it were competent to move those&#x2014;I have already satisfied the House that we cannot do so&#x2014;and if we did in fact move them and they happened to be accepted by the House, we would be placing the Coloured voters in a weaker position than the White voters. I do not believe that it is right that we should be asked to do such a thing. In fact, we are being absolutely consistent when we say, as did the hon. member for Port Elizabeth <span class="col_9025-9026" refersTo="page_0423"/>Central, that whatever is decided in respect of the White voters in the Transkei must also apply to the Coloured voters. The Coloured voters must not be put in a weaker position, as my friend, the hon. member for Rondebosch, implies we should do.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch mentioned the question of our opposition to the fact these people will now be registered in the magisterial offices closest to their homes. That argument cannot apply to the Coloured people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>With reference to the Government&#x2019;s decision to grant full independence to the Transkei, the Executive of the Coloured Persons Representative Council has decided that the education services and the payment of social pensions and allowances which it now provides to Coloureds with South African citizenship in the Transkei, are to be continued after the date of its independence.</p>

<p>In order to give effect to the abovementioned decision and authorize the Coloured Persons Representative Council to devote its funds to this end, it is necessary to amplify the definition of &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; in the various Acts which are applicable. At present the definition is based upon the Population Registration Act of 1950, which will not be applicable to an independent Transkei. As the co-ordinating department with regard to the payment of social pensions and grants with respect to the various population groups, the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions deals with the necessary amendments by means of the Pension Laws Amendment Bill. As far as education is concerned, the necessary amplification of the definition of &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; is effected by means of the Bill under discussion.</p>

<p>Since it is possible that other Bantu homelands in the Republic will also obtain independence in the near future, it is deemed advisable not merely to pay special attention to the Transkei, but to amplify the laws concerned in such a way that they will also make provision for continuing the above mentioned services in any other area in the Republic which may become independent.</p>

<p>The actual provision of the services concerned in the Transkei by the Administration of Coloured Affairs is arranged by means of formal agreements with the Transkeian Government, which have already reached an advanced stage. As far as education is concerned, the agreement makes provision for: (a) the establishment, erection and maintenance of Government schools and hostels; (b) the granting of financial aid to state-supported schools; (c) the equipping and supply of such schools; and (d) the provision of staff and related matters such as conditions of employment and accommodation. In this connection is must be borne in mind that the present Coloured teaching staff are either inhabitants of the Transkei, or have come there or settled there of their own free will.</p>

<p>All immovable property which belongs to <span class="col_9029-9030" refersTo="page_0425"/>the Administration of Coloured Affairs, will be transferred to the Transkei and let for teaching purposes at a nominal rent, after the date of transfer. At present there are three types of Coloured school in the Transkei, namely: (a) government schools of which the buildings and grounds belong to the government; (b) government schools on rented grounds; and (c) government subsidized schools and hostels of which the buildings and grounds are the property of private bodies&#x2014;for instance church authorities.</p>

<p>It is only with respect to the junior schools at Butterworth, Umtata, Lady Frere and Sterkspruit that the buildings and plots are Government property. Only one Government school, namely the junior school at Mount Frere, stands on rented property. The rest are government subsidized schools on private property&#x2014;a total of 32 schools which are attended by Coloureds. According to the latest information the number of pupils is 2 355 and 100 teachers are employed.</p>

<p>The Government considers it right and proper that services provided to Coloureds, should not simply be cancelled if a territory obtains its independence. The question has been raised whether the education service for Coloureds in the Transkei should not be continued for a limited period of time only, after independence. A definite reply cannot, however, be given to this question at this juncture, since large numbers of Coloureds may decide in time to move to the Republic, while others may decide to accept Transkeian citizenship and will therefore be compelled to integrate with the Transkei&#x2019;s own education service. Due to these possibilities provision is made in the above mentioned draft agreement for the education services to be terminated by mutual notice, if and when such a step may appear to be necessary. The same principle will also be applied to other parts of the Republic which may obtain their independence.</p>

<p>In this case, too, I shall move an amendment as printed on the Order Paper during the Committee Stage in order to bring the provision concerned into line with other legislation dealt with today.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has explained the implications of the Bill in his Second Reading speech, and I think he has explained it in reasonable detail. The basic thing that is important is that in terms of the Bill provision is now being made to make it possible for the Administration of Coloured Affairs to maintain schools that it presently maintains in the Transkei for Coloured education once the Transkei receives its independence. The most important issue is the fact that there will be an agreement between the Government of the Republic and the Government of the Transkei. The hon. the Minister, if I heard him correctly, outlined some of the details that will figure in the agreement.</p>

<p>It seems to me vitally important that there must be an arrangement which the Government of the Transkei agrees to accept, because at the present time the Administration of Coloured Affairs owns considerable property in the Transkei, and I presume that the property will then be handed to the Transkeian Government and that these properties will be leased back for a nominal fee. On that basis the present institutions which are providing education for the more or less 2 000 Coloured pupils that are there will continue to function.</p>

<p>From our side we are satisfied that, in terms of the Bill and in terms of the agreement that will be concluded with the Transkeian Government, the education of Coloured children who are presently resident in the Transkei and their future educational requirements, are being properly dealt with. We therefore support the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members will recall that during the short session of 1974 a comprehensive amendment to one section of the Nuclear Installations (Licensing and Security) Act, 1963, namely section 12A, a section which referred to visits by nuclear ships to South African harbours, was submitted to Parliament for approval. Owing to developments in the national nuclear programme during the past few years, it has now become imperative for certain amendments relating to nuclear installations on land to be effected to the Act as soon as possible. The objectives of this Bill are, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) to improve certain definitions and terminology;</li>

<li>(b) to enable the Atomic Energy Board to confine its licensing and inspection functions to those plants, sites and situations where the potential for nuclear damage is or may in its opinion be significant as far as health and safety requirements are concerned;</li>

<li>(c) to make provision for the levying of fees for the licensing and inspection of nuclear sites on land;</li>

<li>(d) to extend the conditions under which persons sustaining nuclear damage may claim compensation;</li>

<li>(e) to extend the powers of the inspectors of the Board; and</li>

<li>(f) to make provision for the revision of fines.</li>

</ol>

<p>Consequential amendments arising from previous amendments of the Act and the Atomic Energy Act, 1967 are also being included in the Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is current practice to use the term &#x201C;nuclear accident&#x201D; to describe an occurrence which causes nuclear damage and to reserve the term &#x201C;nuclear incident&#x201D; to describe any fault or maloperation or abnormal transient which, if not corrected, could lead to a nuclear accident. The term &#x201C;nuclear incident&#x201D; in section 1 and where it appears in other sections of the Act is therefore substituted by &#x201C;nuclear accident&#x201D;.</p>

<p><span class="col_9033-9034" refersTo="page_0427"/>The present definition of &#x201C;nuclear damage&#x201D; relates nuclear damage only to radio-active properties of nuclear-hazard material. Since the energy releases which may cause nuclear damage, arise not only from radio-active properties, but also from the nuclear energy and the radiations associated with nuclear fission of such material, an amendment to the definition of &#x201C;nuclear damage&#x201D; is proposed so as to include both these processes.</p>

<p>As a result of the amendment in 1974 to section 2, the Act no longer bears any reference to the term &#x201C;fissionable components&#x201D; and it can therefore be deleted. The definition of the term &#x201C;nuclear energy&#x201D; is amended to bring it into line with the definition thereof in the Atomic Energy Act, 1967.</p>

<p>An amendment to the definition of &#x201C;nuclear-hazard material&#x201D; is necessary as the present definition lacks precision and does not include the many processes associated with the nuclear fuel cycle which involve solutions, mixtures or compounds of nuclear fuel, which under certain conditions can cause a serious nuclear accident.</p>

<p>Hon. members will notice that it is also suggested that the term &#x201C;nuclear installation&#x201D; be amended. This amendment will be explained simultaneously with clause 2 of the Bill for reasons which will soon be obvious.</p>

<p>Clauses 2 and 3:</p>

<p>In terms of the definition of &#x201C;nuclear installation&#x201D; in section 1 of the Act, any kind of installation designed or adapted for, or which may involve the processing, storage or disposal of nuclear-hazard material referred to in subparagraphs b(ii), (iii) and (iv) of the definition, is a nuclear installation for the purposes of the Act only if these activities are capable of causing nuclear damage. So far as present scientific knowledge is concerned, however small the amount of nuclear-hazard material and however low the intensity of radiation associated with it, nuclear damage can still be caused. Many activities concerned with the handling and processing of nuclear-hazard material involve potential and actual risks which are extremely small and these risks may, for example, often be lower than the risks of nuclear damage arising from natural background radiation. It is argued that the Act was not intended to relate to activities associated with such low-potential risks. It is accepted that it is impossible to eliminate all risks to health and safety. The Atomic Energy Board, in giving effect to the provisions of this part of the Act, has established standards for the normal and accidental release of radioactivity and applies corresponding controls to the design, manufacture and operation of nuclear installations to ensure that the risks associated with these installations compare favourably with the risks arising from other similar major enterprises. The risks corresponding to the Board&#x2019;s standards are, for example, somewhat lower than the risk associated with civil air travel or the risk of being killed by lightning. Where even the potential for exceeding these low risks does not exist, it seems pointless to invoke the formal licensing procedures.</p>

<p>*In view of what I have just said, provision is being made to exempt activities associated with nuclear-hazard material, and of which the potential for nuclear damage is so low that the standards of the Board will be complied with even without the application of any control measures, from the formal licensing procedure. However, the amendment that is being proposed in clause 2 is to the effect that no person, other than the Atomic Energy Board may use a site for the purposes of a nuclear installation except under the authority of a licence granted by the Board or unless, in the case of a nuclear installation for the processing, storage or removal of nuclear-hazard material, the Board has in writing declared that the potential for nuclear damage associated with the actual activities in or at the nuclear installations in question is of such a nature that the limits of risk which conform to the health and safety requirements as determined and laid down by the Board from time to time cannot be exceeded. It is also being provided in clause 3 that a declaration by the Board that the limits of risk in respect of a nuclear installation associated with the processing, storage or removal of nuclear-hazard material are not being exceeded, may at any time be amended or repeated.</p>

<p>In accordance with the policy agreed upon by my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, and myself, provision is now being made in this clause for the levying of fees for the licensing of nuclear installations. The amendment of section 12A of the Act that was <span class="col_9035-9036" refersTo="page_0428"/>approved in 1974 already makes provision for the levying of licence fees in respect of nuclear-powered ships visiting South African harbours.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the Act in 1963 the actual value of the rand has diminished by a factor of 1,95. As a result of this, and mindful of the present high rate of cost increases, it is being proposed that the maximum fine of R1 000 if a person should be convicted of having used a site for the purposes of a nuclear installation without having obtained a licence from the Atomic Energy Board or of having contravened other provisions of section 2 of the Act, be doubled to a maximum of R2 000.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with the question of fines, I want to point out to hon. members that for the same reason we are also proposing in clauses 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the Bill that the maximum fines which may be imposed on conviction for offences in terms of the provisions of the Act, be doubled. Section 7 of the Act provides that, if a nuclear accident occurs on or in connection with the use of a licensed site, the licensee in question shall report the same forthwith to the board, and if he fails to do so, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding R200. The fine of R200 in this case does not reflect the serious nature of such an offence. Because it is necessary for emergency measures to be taken as soon as possible after a nuclear accident, delay may result in the injury and death of people and damage to property. In clause 6, therefore, it is being proposed that the maximum fine of R200 increased to a maximum of R2 000.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of section 5, the licensee is liable for all nuclear damage that is caused by anything which occurs on the licensed site or arising from the carriage of nuclear-hazard material to and from the site. However, subsection (3) provides <i>inter alia</i> that the licensee is not liable for nuclear damage that may be attributed to <i>vis major.</i> This exclusion is not in accordance with the concept of absolute liability where the licensee is held liable throughout even though he can in no way be responsible for the cause of the accident.</p>

<p>In addition I must point out that the provision which is being made in the Act that the Government may intervene to ensure that claims are met, refers only to those claims for which the licensee is held responsible but which he cannot pay in view of the fact that the security required of him is inadequate. No provision is therefore being made in the Act to protect the community through the medium of indemnity in the case of certain possible major causes of serious nuclear accidents.</p>

<p>The Atomic Energy Board investigates the risks of nuclear accidents which are caused by <i>vis major,</i> for example natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and tidal waves, in the same way as major risks associated with other possible causes of major accidents which are not included in the concept of <i>vis major.</i> Before the licence is granted, all these factors are taken into consideration, and there appears to be no reason for the licensee being held liable in certain cases and not in others.</p>

<p>In anticipation of possible accidents, the Act provides that the licensee shall provide security to the satisfaction of the Minister. However, the Act also provides that, if the security provided in this manner is not sufficient to meet any claims that may arise, I have to submit a report on the particular accident to Parliament in which a recommendation is made that Parliament appropriate the money for the granting of financial assistance in respect of the amount by which such claims exceed or are likely to exceed, the security so available. There is no reason to assume that the need caused by <i>vis major</i> will occur more often, or that the amounts will be higher than in the case of accidents which arise as a result of so-called conventional causes, because the latter causes cover a greater range of possibilities.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

<p>&#x2020; Subsections (2) and (3) of section 7 of the Act relate to the investigations leading to the <span class="col_9037-9038" refersTo="page_0429"/>defining of the area and period of duration of a nuclear accident and the recording of particulars of persons concerned therein. Taking into account the meteorological and hydrological dispersion characteristics associated with a nuclear site, the radio-active decay properties of nuclear-hazard material, the area affected by a nuclear accident will continually expand with time. However, the risk of nuclear damage associated with the accident will attenuate quite rapidly with increasing distance from the site and with time will eventually fall below the level of risk associated with natural background radiation, although it will never completely reduce to zero. It will therefore be possible to define boundaries for the affected zone outside which, in the opinion of the Board, the risks are acceptably low and consistent with the requirements for health and safety. The amendment of subsection (2) makes provision for the definition of the boundaries of the affected zone on a practical basis.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

<p>*In terms of section 9 of the Act action for compensation for nuclear damage shall be commenced within 10 years after the date of the event or series of events which gave rise to the right to claim such compensation. According to the latest available information it is accepted that nuclear damage might in certain cases only be discernible after an even considerably longer period than 10 years after exposure to radiation has taken place. When claims for compensation are settled by way of negotiation, it is also deemed necessary that the claimant should be protected against deliberate delaying tactics, and that the person who is liable to pay compensation should also be protected against exorbitant claims. The amendment of section 9 is intended to make provision in the Act for these possibilities.</p>

<p>Clause 9:</p>

<p>In paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) of section 10 of the Act it is being provided that the inspectors of the Board shall have access to any licensed site and to certain information connected therewith. However, to enable the Board to fulfil its responsibilities in terms of the Act, an additional right of access to certain information is necessary. For example it is of the utmost importance that the inspectors of the board have the right of access, as well as the right to carry out inspections in order to ensure that the proposed sites are suitable, that the necessary high production standards of components for nuclear installations are maintained and that the appropriate licensing procedures can be put into operation in respect of any activities involving nuclear-hazard material. Consequently it is being proposed that paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 2 be amended accordingly and that paragraph (c) be inserted to make provision for the aforementioned additional powers for inspectors of the Board. Consequently the proviso after paragraph (c) is also being adapted. The expression &#x201C;creates no danger&#x201D; appearing in the present proviso is not in conformity with the true state of affairs since any action constitutes a measure of risk, no matter how small. Consequently it is also being proposed that the intention of this proviso be elucidated by stating that if a dispute arises as to whether a specific test is likely to have a detrimental effect on any person&#x2019;s health or could result in injury to any person or damage to any property, the matter shall be referred to the Board, whose decision in that regard shall be final.</p>

<p>As I have already said, an agreement has been reached with the hon. Minister of Finance in regard to the policy as far as the levying of fees for the licensing of nuclear installations is concerned. It has also been agreed that the Minister of Mines be empowered to demand that fees in respect of the inspection of nuclear installations be paid, and the necessary provision is now being made in this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in view of the recent news that South Africa is to have its first commercial nuclear reactor at Koeberg, this Bill would seem to be very topical. It is topical because the announcement <span class="col_9039-9040" refersTo="page_0430"/>of the order of the twin reactor for Koeberg does, in fact, initiate a new phase in the development of nuclear installations in South Africa. Since the nuclear installations will not be operational until 1982 one wonders, however, what the reason is for the urgency of introducing these amendments at the present stage, six years in advance of those reactors becoming critical.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has in fact said that developments up to the present time have created such a state of urgency. We have, however, already reached a late stage of this session, and looking at the largely technical and regulatory changes which are being made to the original Act by the Bill, one really wonders what exactly the nature of this urgency is. The hon. the Minister has not in fact given us any convincing reasons as to why this urgency should have arisen and as to why, since this major new development in nuclear installations is not likely to become effective for another six years, we should in fact be passing this Bill at this stage, six years in advance.</p>

<p>The Bill, as I have said, is mainly technical and regulatory. I do not believe that we have any serious objections to any of the provisions of this Bill. Such minor comments and suggestions as we have to improve certain clauses, we shall raise during the Committee Stage. At this stage I should merely like to say that we have no objection in principle to this Bill. We shall give it passage at Second Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when it comes to nuclear installations, nuclear reactors and the like, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. I want to concede immediately that there is a great deal of technical nature linked with this Bill, of which I have very little understanding.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>I can well understand the hon. member&#x2019;s comment, Sir, but there are a certain number of associated factors which I think all of us can appreciate and understand. Reference has already been made to this by the previous speaker. We have heard, for instance of the intention to set up a nuclear reactor at Koeberg. Whilst it is true that it will only come into operation in 1982, I believe that it is right and good that we should have this legislation as soon as possible, if for no other reason&#x2014;and there may well be other reasons&#x2014;than to give the assurance to the people of South Africa that adequate provision is being made for the best safety measures possible.</p>

<p>As far as we are concerned, we welcome this Bill. We welcome the extra provisions and the changes that are being made, for instance in regard to the increase in fines and amounts of money that have to be paid. It is not often that we in these benches welcome the increase of fines, but we believe that this is an important matter and, bearing in mind the point the hon. the Minister has already made regarding inflation, we believe that this is highly necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think we should allow this moment to pass without emphasizing what the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So far as present scientific knowledge is concerned, however small the amount of nuclear hazard material and however low the intensity of radiation associated with it, nuclear damage can still be caused.</block>

<p>This is why we believe that the necessary precautions and the necessary measures, which are introduced in this Bill, are so important. It is even more important and noteworthy to emphasize in this House and, indeed, in the country&#x2014;because we are now moving into another era&#x2014;that it is accepted, in the words of the hon. the Minister, &#x201C;that it is impossible to eliminate all risks to health and safety&#x201D;. That is a very serious statement and I am very grateful that the hon. the Minister has stressed it, because I think it is something we ought to keep in mind.</p>

<p>There is only one other point I should like to raise, a point that will be raised again in the Committee Stage. I just give notice of it now <span class="col_9041-9042" refersTo="page_0431"/>in order that the hon. the Minister may reply to it a little later on. I wish to refer to clause 6 of the Bill, which substitutes a new section for section 7 of the principal Act. Whilst I appreciate that we cannot really speak about the principal Act itself, certain changes are in fact being made to it here. I wish to refer to the proposed new subsection (2), which in part reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the board is in terms of subsection (1) advised of the occurrence of a nuclear accident it may direct an inspector to investigate and report to it upon the accident, its causes &#x2026;</block>

<p>In view of the serious nature of this legislation, it seems to me that it would be far better to say that the board &#x201C;shall direct an inspector&#x201D; to act as is provided for. The very fact that an accident has been reported seems to me to indicate that this should be directive rather than permissive legislation in this particular connection.</p>

<p>With those few words we support the Second Reading of this important piece of legislation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank hon. members for their support of this Bill. As they themselves would have noticed, it is of a highly technical nature. Since we are now entering a new era, we must be very careful in regard to these matters.</p>

<p>Perhaps I could reply at once to the problem raised by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. Actually, the previous hon. speaker, the hon. member for Von Brandis, had already referred to that problem. He wanted to know why it was necessary to introduce this measure so long before the time. The fact of the matter is that we are engaged in further developments, and that companies supplying the materials want the necessary security long before they participate in export projects. Hon. members will know that these substances are very sensitive. That is why one must have the necessary security and protection which this Bill affords long before the time. The hon. members will also know that the Atomic Energy Board is the responsible body which has to examine all sites and conditions and make sure, long before the time, that these are the necessary built-in safety measures. Take for example the developments at Koeberg. The Atomic Energy Board is the body which, in the last resort, will have to take care of security there. Therefore this Bill is quite timeous. Since we may possibly proceed to the development of a commercial uranium enrichment plant, the Atomic Energy Board has to carry out site inspections, etc., long before the time. Hon. members will therefore understand that we have to introduce this legislation now in order to be able to do so. Therefore it is not an untimely action on our part to introduce this legislation now. In this regard I should like to refer back to what I said in my Second Reading speech, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The objectives of this Bill are, <i>inter alia,</i> to enable the Atomic Energy Board to confine its licensing and inspection functions to those plants, sites and situations where the potential for nuclear damage is or may in its opinion be significant as far as health and safety requirements are concerned.</block>

<p>As I have said, this is a highly technical matter, and I do not take it amiss of the hon. member for having submitted here that we should not make laws long before the time. That is quite in order, and in view of this I think the hon. member will agree with me that the Atomic Energy Board does in fact need this legislation at this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as you will know, you and I both attended the University of Stellenbosch. For that reason I think it would also interest you to know that the score at the moment is 7&#x2014;0 in favour of the Maties. This is just by the way.</p>

<p><i>Committee Stage</i></p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to refer you to paragraph (g), which provides for the definition of &#x201C;nuclear installation&#x201D;. Sir, &#x201C;nuclear installation&#x201D; is really the key word in the entire Bill and here we have a new definition of what a nuclear installation is. Without necessarily asking the hon. the Minister for a reply now or to give me any assurances, because these are admittedly highly technical matters, I would like to ask the Minister to consider whether the definition of &#x201C;nuclear installation&#x201D; is entirely adequate. The definition of &#x201C;nuclear installation&#x201D; covers a nuclear reactor and also &#x201C;any other kind of installation designed or adapted for, or which may involve&#x201D; several other things. These things are: (1) the production or use of nuclear energy and (2) the carrying out of any process involving nuclear hazard material.</p>

<p>Nuclear hazard material has been redefined in paragraph (e) to include &#x201C;other material containing nuclear fuel&#x201D;. Paragraph (g)(b)(iii) and (iv) deal with the storage and the disposal of nuclear hazard material. I would like to put to the hon. the Minister that there are certain kinds of equipment which are in fact able to cause radiation danger, but which are not precisely defined under these four headings as being nuclear installations. I have in mind such things as accelerators, which are designed to send nuclear particles along a defined path in order to strike a target and there to produce a certain effect which can give use to nuclear radiation damage. I am not certain whether this is included in paragraph (g)(b)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). I also have in mind certain kinds of industrial equipment which also may not be covered under these four headings because they do not involve the production or use of nuclear energy, they do not involve the carrying out of a process necessarily involving nuclear hazard material as defined, and they certainly do not involve the storage of such material or the disposal of such material. Without taking it any further at this stage, I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that some thought might be given to the addition of a further paragraph to deal with research or industrial equipment which requires shielding against radiation damage or, alternatively, research or industrial equipment which is likely to cause, or which may cause, radiation damage. I believe, Sir, that there is a special class of equipment or installation which falls between the definitions of &#x201C;nuclear installation&#x201D; that we have here and which may be looked at. Apart from that suggestion, we have no objection to clause 1.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to pretend to be clever about these highly technical matters, for I think we should be very careful here. The terminology used in the Bill is international terminology. It is scientific terminology. Perhaps the hon. member&#x2019;s views are correct, but I doubt it, because the people who worked on this are very expert people in this highly specialized field. If I, as Minister and layman, have to venture into this field and find that the legislation refers to &#x201C;any other kind of installation designed or adapted for&#x201D; and goes on to refer to &#x201C;the production, the carrying out, the storage and the disposal of&#x201D;, then it satisfies me, but the hon. member wants us to look at this again. However, I think the hon. member must agree that we leave it as it is. If it appears to be necessary, we can return to it again. We shall look at this again, but for the present we must allow it to go through as it stands.</p>

As far as I am concerned, I can only say that the <span class="col_9045-9046" refersTo="page_0433"/>Atomic Energy Board is highly satisfied with the formulation as it stands at present.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in raising certain points in the Committee Stage, I am not pretending that I know better than the Atomic Energy Board. It sometimes takes a very simple mind to see where the experts have perhaps left something out. If the Atomic Energy Board were infallible in its legislation, we would not have to deal with so many amendments in respect of the Bills affecting nuclear energy as do in fact come to this House. Quite clearly one does not hold it against the Atomic Energy Board, for they cannot anticipate every contingency. I merely raise this as proof that even the best of us are not infallible.</p>

<p>The only point I wish to raise under clause 2 is that in terms of subsection (c)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may require (i) any person who applies for a nuclear site licence, in respect of the issue thereof; and (ii) any licence &#x2026; to pay such fees as the Minister may from time to time determine after consultation with the Minister of Finance.</block>

<p>As far as one can anticipate at this stage, it is Escom, as the statutory body authorized to produce electricity for South Africa, that is most likely to be the body applying to the Atomic Energy Board for a licence to develop nuclear power. The question arises, therefore, whether it is in fact a useful principle that a statutory body like Escom, which is obliged in terms of its statutes to produce electricity at the lowest possible cost for South Africa, should be obliged to pay a fee to the Atomic Energy Board&#x2014;another State institution&#x2014;for a licence in order to get permission to produce such electricity. I would entirely agree that if electricity were privately generated in South Africa and if this clause, in the Minister&#x2019;s view, is only intended to apply to such municipalities or private organizations as might in due course wish to generate electricity by means of nuclear power, then it is fair enough that such organizations, private enterprises, should apply to the Atomic Energy Board for a licence and should pay a licence fee. Since electricity is very largely generated by a corporation of the State in this country, the necessity for Escom to apply to the Atomic Energy Board and to pay licence fees seems to be a little bit unnecessary. It amounts to robbing Peter to pay Paul. It all comes out of the pockets of the taxpayers. This is merely a comment and I do not ask the hon. the Minister necessarily to amend the Bill, but perhaps he will merely give an indication of what his policy would be in such cases.</p>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is not clear to me what argument the hon. member for Von Brandis wants to put forward here. Throughout, as I see it&#x2014;I am saying this in all humility&#x2014;the Government is not differentiating between private bodies and its State utility organizations. If any private or other body also wants to produce electricity on a daily basis&#x2014;there is a very wide field which can be covered by nuclear energy&#x2014;then the same regulations which we are now discussing and approving here should be made applicable to it. I do not know whether the hon. member now wants us to adopt the standpoint that companies such as Escom or Iscor should receive special preferential rights in terms of legislation, such as those with which we are now dealing. I am putting it in this way, and the hon. member may react to it in any way he wants to.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, my proposal was not that Escom should be given preference above any private companies or municipalities. Nevertheless, I put <span class="col_9047-9048" refersTo="page_0434"/>the question to the hon. the Minister whether it was in fact good policy to expect one State corporation, which has a specific commission on behalf of the State, to pay licence fees to another State corporation or State institution to be able to do those very things for which it was established. Escom was established to generate electricity. To be able to do so it must pay licence fees to another State organization to be granted the right to do the very thing for which it was established. That was in fact the point I made. I am simply asking whether the hon. the Minister has a policy in this regard.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the first point that I would like to raise is the following: In terms of clause 2, if a person uses a site for nuclear purposes without having got a licence to do so, he is subject to a maximum fine of R2 000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years. This applies to producing nuclear energy or using a site for nuclear purposes when not authorized to do so. In terms of clause 3, however, if he has in fact obtained such a licence and is then told to stop producing nuclear energy and fails to do so, he is subject to a fine of R400 or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. There seems to be a very slight difference in the degree of transgression between a person who produces nuclear energy without having obtained permission to do so and the person who continues to produce nuclear energy after permission to do so has been withdrawn. In other words, if you do something without permission the fine is high and if you do something having had permission and the permission is then withdrawn, the fine is low. It seems to be an extraordinary difference in approach and I wonder if the hon. the Minister would explain this discrepancy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, all that I can say is that this legislation, and the practice which is here being made part and parcel of it now, is actually based on the kind of legislation and practice of other countries which have had longer experience. I have no quarrel with that, for this is what usually happens. I also understand that the kind of prohibitions which are being imposed on people in one way or another are even more onerous abroad than here in South Africa. I do not want to argue about this because it is a highly technical matter. This matter was very thoroughly deliberated by the Atomic Energy Board before they produced legislation. I do not know whether there are any other reasons why the board felt that it ought to present the legislation in this way, but my department and I are perfectly satisfied that as it has been stated here, it expresses the will of the board. Research has been done on the legislation and practices in other parts of the world and I think we should allow this legislation to go through in this form.</p>

This is something which has often been repeated by the hon. member for Berea. There is, however, something very much more important. In this specific case, where the matter is so highly technical, it may be necessary for the Department of Mines to institute a course so that inspectors will know what they are inspecting. These people will, in fact, be specialists. In view of the type of inspection and the type of work they are going to do, I feel that provision must be made &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I accept the point. I should then like to refer to clause 9(c), which introduces a new section 10(3), reading as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who obstructs an inspector in the exercise of his powers under paragraphs (a) or (c) of subsection (2), or who refuses or without reasonable cause fails to provide any information or to permit any inspection reasonably required by an inspector under paragraphs (b), or (c) of that subsection</block>

<p>The word &#x201C;reasonably&#x201D; is, in fact, to be deleted by this Bill, and I believe that that is wrong. I believe that an inspector visiting an installation of this kind is, in fact, approaching an installation which, in the nature of things, contains dangerous processes, and where there are security aspects, and that if in fact the inspector in this installation does things which are unreasonable &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; unreasonable in the eyes of the people operating the plant because of their special knowledge of the conditions within that plant, then I think they have a right to demand that the inspector, in inspecting the plant, should act reasonably. The inspector of course is presumed to know what he is doing. The inspector has certain rights and powers, but we are dealing here with a dangerous process, a process which can expose many people to danger if it is not conducted with the most meticulous care, and none know better than the people who are actually in charge of that plant what is reasonable and what is unreasonable. Now, if an inspector enters a plant I think it is reasonable that the people who operate in that plant would expect the inspector to act reasonably, and I think &#x201C;reasonably&#x201D; is a very good word. Therefore I believe it is wrong to leave out the word &#x201C;reasonably&#x201D; from this clause.

<p>As the hon. member has put it now, it means that the clause would read &#x201C;or who without reasonable cause fails to provide any information or to permit any inspection&#x201D;. He does not want the word &#x201C;reasonably&#x201D; to be deleted. He wants to retain the word.</p>

<p>*I do not think this Committee should argue in this way about such a delicate matter. Nuclear power is very sensitive material and I should like to put this beyond doubt. The word &#x201C;reasonably&#x201D; is a word which may cause considerable dispute. It is my personal feeling that in such a delicate matter, where one really has to protect the public at all costs, it would be more dangerous to retain the word &#x201C;reasonably&#x201D; than it would be to leave it out. For that reason we differ on this score. I am unable to agree with the hon. member. There are very sound reasons why this word has been omitted. It is not being omitted for nothing. I was not present during the discussions when the Atomic Energy Board discussed this matter with the law advisers, but I also feel that this word should not be retained.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in dealing with clause 3, it is necessary to point out that the provision which is being amended is in the existing Post Office Act and deals with the question of the prescribing and the alteration in fees, rates or charges. That appears at present in section 3 of the Post Office Act, No. 44 of 1958, which is being amended. This section provides that such alteration can only take place subject to the approval of the State President. This approval of the State President is, I believe, a time-consuming process. I think we should bear that in mind that if we amend this section in the manner suggested, alterations to tariffs will be done very much sooner than what is the case now. The second point we have to take into account is the fact that business and industry and commerce generally, rely on fees, rates and charges which have been prescribed or determined from time to time by the Postmaster-General and approved of by the State President, in their budgeting for business purposes. I should imagine that there are certain firms which do a great deal of business through the post, like the mail order houses, which, I believe, work on a fairly tight budget. That being the case, it would be very unfortunate if a mail order house or similar organization were to budget for a particular rate or a particular tariff and then find, before it can complete its contract, that the rate or charge has been amended and consequently that the business would have to suffer a loss because it would not be able to adjust the contract under which they were dealing at that particular time. I am referring to the provision that the Postmaster-General may with the approval of the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> determine from time to time to alter the fees and charges, etc. The point I want to make is that I can understand that the Postmaster-General and the department, generally speaking, are bound by certain international <span class="col_9053-9054" refersTo="page_0437"/>agreements and conventions and that obviously if in terms of these conventions they are required to increase or alter or to substitute or to redetermine the present tariffs the Postmaster-General is bound by such conventions and has to do so. But there are a number of tariffs which do not fall under tariffs covered by conventions or agreements.</p>

<p>It is in regard to those tariffs and charges that I wish to address the House. I should also like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that this is an occasion where, with a bit of ingenuity, I believe we can get over the hurdle. I should not like the hon. the Minister to say to me that because I am asking for something to be enshrined in the law&#x2014;which is the practice at present&#x2014;he is not prepared to do so because of the fact that he is bound by international conventions and international agreements. I am prepared to concede that in so far as the hon. the Minister or the Postmaster-General is bound by such international agreements or conventions, effect can be given to them immediately and there should be no delay. However, I believe that in so far as all other fees, rates and charges are concerned, there is an opportunity for the Postmaster-General to give the general public, commerce and industry fair warning. That is all we are asking for. We believe fair warning of an impending rate change should be given and I think three months is a reasonable period for that, especially if the rate changes are domestic and bear no relation whatsoever to any rates, tariffs or charges that may have to come about as a result of international agreement or convention. Because I feel that is the way in which the matter should be dealt with, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 9, &#x201C;department&#x201D; in lines 53 and 54, to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">: Provided that, except in the case of adjustments of such fees, rates or charges consequent upon international agreements, such notice shall not take effect until a period of three months has elapsed after the date of its publication</block>

<p>I believe this amendment takes care of any reservations which the hon. the Minister may have and I believe he will be able to accept this amendment because it is merely including in the clause the provision that three months&#x2019; notice should be given of all domestic changes in the rates and charges, thereby making it law.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I feel that when the department disposes of movable property, R10 000 is a reasonable limit. When one deals with second-hand machinery, it does not take very much to reach R10 000. For instance, when rebuilding a post office, telephone exchange or when replacing a manual or automatic exchange, one often finds that there is redundant equipment. For instance, there could be a stand-by diesel lighting plant, sometimes hardly used, which could easily fetch R5 000 or more, depending on its condition and size. Together with a few redundant switchboards and some other odds and ends, the limit of R10 000 is very easily reached or surpassed. The hon. the Minister might argue that this clause, concerning gifts and the disposal of articles, only refers to redundant articles or items which are no longer serviceable. However, this is not always the case. The hon. the Minister is aware that it is customary&#x2014;when, for instance, rebuilding post offices, carrying out alterations, improvements or replacing a telephone exchange by an automatic exchange&#x2014;that the successful tenderer is entitled to the material from the old building, unless otherwise specified in the bill of quantities. The hon. the Minister might argue that everything of value is always precluded in the bill of quantities. However, I am not suggesting that this custom is being abused, but it could very easily be abused. Who is to judge the value of any stand-by diesel lighting plant, a manual switchboard or an electric motor? Is it to be the quantity surveyor&#x2019;s clerk or the architect&#x2019;s clerk? A diesel plant can perhaps be 20 years old, but it might have worked for a total of 100 hours only. Who is going to value it? I should prefer the tenderers to submit a price for the equipment, for all the material in the buildings <span class="col_9055-9056" refersTo="page_0438"/>which they might collect if they do the work. It would be much better to compare the prices as submitted by the different tenderers. If there are items of little intrinsic value, but of value to collectors, then certainly the builder will know what the value of such items is.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister wishes to make a donation out of some of the equipment&#x2014;I note that it has been done, <i>inter alia,</i> to museums, various institutions or even to local authorities&#x2014;he has a value for the particular item, viz. the value which the tenderer attaches to it. I feel that if the intention is to run the Post Office on business lines&#x2014;as stated in the Bill&#x2014;I feel it is only business that all the materials of the Post Office, redundant or not, should be disposed of and not merely given away. They should be accounted for without exception. If the hon. the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, he must tell us why we should accept that the Post Office is a benevolent institution. Therefore I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 13, in lines 9 and 10, to omit &#x201C;, except in respect of the gift of movable property of the department,&#x201D;.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are now dealing with the first of a series of amendments proposed by the Official Opposition. These amendments were formulated under the guidance of the hon. member for Wynberg as the leader of the Postal Service group of the Official Opposition. He presented a whole series of interesting standpoints. However, I want to bring it to the attention of this House that these amendments have already been debated in the Other Place, and hon. members of the Opposition are fully aware of the standpoints which I adopted there as well as the grounds on which I did so. What is more, hon. members are aware that I accepted two of the amendments which they moved. In spite of that they have now moved the same amendment again here. The Other Place is sometimes called a House of Review, and I now want to address the serious request to the hon. Opposition not to make the House of Assembly a House of Repetition. I really think that we could expedite the discussion in this debate very considerably, for the standpoints of both sides have already been stated and have been weighed up against one another very thoroughly.</p>

<p>It would seem to me as though the Opposition cannot be very serious about the amendment the hon. member for Wynberg moved here. The existing section in the Act does not provide that a change in tariffs may only come into effect after a period of notice has expired. In other words, what the hon. member is advocating in his amendment is a new principle, which he wants to introduce. The amendment which he is now moving is in fact his fourth different attempt at introducing it. First the Opposition proposed a period of three months in the Other Place. After that they proposed a period of two months, and eventually a period of one month. Now the hon. member is proposing that we draw a distinction between internal tariffs and international tariffs, and that I should give three months&#x2019; notice in respect of internal tariffs before the change comes into operation.</p>

<p>I explained in the Other Place, and I also want to emphasize it here, that it has always, in the past, under the existing Act, been the practice in the Post Office to inform commerce and industry of any amendment which may arise. Let me give a few examples. As far as the increase in telephone and postal tariffs with effect from 1 May 1973 was concerned, we issued a detailed statement in Parliament, 30 March 1973 during the debate on the Post Office budget. In other words, everyone knew about this long in advance. On 29 January 1975 the Minister issued a Press statement and also announced over the radio that telephone and postal tariffs would be increased with effect from 1 April 1975. It has always been the endeavour of the Post Office to inform the public in advance of any future changes in the tariffs. I am sorry, but I am not prepared to insert a provision in the Act which will require the Post Office to give the public such notice within a specific period.</p>

I did not want to refer to the debate which had taken place in the Other Place, but since the hon. the Minister has referred to it, I shall also refer to it now. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to his reply to the amendment moved by Senator Poorter in the Other Place. On that occasion the hon. the Minister said that he was unable to accept the amendment because there were international agreements and conventions he could not commit through this legislation. This is the reason he advanced.</p>

<p>I do not want to argue with the hon. the Minister about the matter. He said so and he can look it up in the Hansard of the Other Place. This is also why the amendment I have just moved differs from the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper. I was being accommodating, because we on this side of the House believed that the hon. the Minister might have a case to make out on this score. It is for this reason, that I have now suggested that prior notice be issued only in respect of local changes. The hon. the Minister should not complain if we persist with this. We believe this is a particularly sound amendment. The hon. the Minister did not say at all why he was unable to accept it. He simply said he was unable to accept it, but he did not say why. When I asked, by way of interjection, for an example of the practical problems, he did not reply to it. I do not think we can accept it as it stands. The hon. the Minister should tell us what the practical difficulties are.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. the Minister must remember that big brother Jac de Villiers is watching him. He is watching his antics here this afternoon. I should like him to know that. We want him to perform properly this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not arguing about the foreign tariffs now. The hon. member conceded, with his altered amendment, that I had a valid standpoint. As regards my standpoint in respect of domestic tariffs, I just want to say that, as I put it in the Other Place, it is for practical reasons that I do not want to impose that obligation on the Post Office. One of those reasons is that such a measure would imply that the Cabinet might have to decide four months before the time on any changes which are to be made, so that three months&#x2019; notice has to be given before the change can come into operation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>It is only the Minister who has to decide. The Cabinet has nothing to do with it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The custom is that when a person effects drastic changes to tariffs, the Cabinet has to be consulted because the Cabinet has to keep a watchful eye on economic conditions in the country. This practical problem therefore makes it impossible to impose such a burden, one which is laid down in legislation, on the Post Office. In addition it has been the practice of the Post Office throughout, and the Post Office intends to continue to do so, to inform commerce and industry and the general public in advance of any future changes in tariffs, and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading debate I promised to reply to certain questions put by the hon. member for Bryanston. He referred to the proposed new section 2(b)(i)(m) and clause 3 of the Bill, namely the power of the <span class="col_9059-9060" refersTo="page_0440"/>Postmaster-General to vary or cancel a contract to the detriment of the department. I want to point out to the hon. member that the State Tender Board Act, which is also applicable to the Post Office, provides that the State Tender Board may amend a contract to the detriment of the State. However, if this is done in the case of a contract of the Post Office, the consent to this of the Postmaster-General has to be obtained. This clause is merely an empowering clause to enable the Postmaster-General to give such consent.</p>

<p>I am also replying to the amendment moved by the hon. member for South Coast. When this amendment was discussed in the Senate, I could not escape the impression that the discussions which followed there might even to a certain extent be a reflection, when the Hansard is subsequently read, on the Postmaster-General. I wondered whether I should accept that amendment. Before I did so, however, I caused a full report to be made to me on the reasons why that provision had been worded in that way. The report which I received was very interesting and I want to inform hon. members of its contents. The relevant provision in the Bill before this House, gives statutory expression to a decision taken by the Select Committee on Public Accounts as long ago as 1960. It is in line with section 31 of the Exchequer and Audit Act of 1975. Although there is no objection to the principle which the hon. member advocated, the arrangement which he has in mind is not feasible. A gift of moveable property does not lend itself to appropriation because there is no payment of money involved in the transaction. Of course such donations have to be reported and the Auditor-General therefore informs Parliament of this matter in his report if he considers it necessary. Hon. members need not in any way be concerned that irregularities will occur in such cases.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation with interest. As I have said before, I am not casting any reflection on anyone in the Post Office, particularly not on the Postmaster-General. The point is, what I am trying to guard against is the possibility of connivance between the architect, the quantity surveyor and the builder. The hon. the Minister speaks about disposing of Post Office equipment in the form of gifts or donations. What I want to know, however, is who places a value on those particular items when a report must be made to the Auditor-General? Does the Postmaster-General himself do it? Surely that is not very satisfactory from his own point of view because such procedure lays him open to accusations. I would much rather it were done another way, for example by way of tender. The builder or contractor can tender for the building of a post office, and in his tender indicates what he is prepared to pay for the stuff he takes over in the old post office. That could then be knocked off his price. I do not really see what the difficulty is. I am trying to suggest a method for protecting the Post Office and the Government against the wastage of money because I have seen very valuable equipment being given away when a job is being done. It is the builder who stands to gain, and in many cases one has suspicions about whether the architect knew the value of the stuff or not. For that reason I think this is a very important consideration.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telecommunications">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think the hon. member understands the entire set-up correctly. He assumes that the contractor retains all material after demolition. This does not happen in the case of the Post Office. The equipment taken from an old post office remains the property of the Post Office. The difficulty is of course&#x2014;and I tried to explain this briefly to the hon. member&#x2014;that an amount of money has to be appropriated in the Estimates. In the Estimates it cannot be specified that we have donated &#x201C;one obsolete post box&#x201D;. This cannot be included as an item in the Estimates. This is the problem we have to cope with. Therefore I say that I have no objection to the principle raised by the hon. member, but apart from the uncertainty about the value of old equipment&#x2014;and what is involved here is not diesel locomotives and similar items&#x2014;a gift of movable property does <span class="col_9061-9062" refersTo="page_0441"/>not lend itself to appropriation because there is no payment of money involved in the transaction. That is why I am retaining the wording as it is at present.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendments printed in my name on page 440 of the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 15, in line 12, to omit &#x201C;profits&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;total earnings&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(2) on page 15, in line 17, to omit &#x201C;reasonable reserves,&#x201D;</li>

</ol>

<p>Since the hon. the Minister has pointed out that this debate has also taken place in the Other Place, I just want to say that these amendments were also moved there. On that occasion, the hon. the Minister also replied to these two matters, and I want to say that the replies that were given by the hon. the Minister were totally unsatisfactory. They are not acceptable. We on this side of the House are not prepared to accept those replies given by the hon. the Minister. It is for that reason that we are again moving these amendments. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will, on this occasion, come forward with a more satisfactory reply. As I have already pointed out, his replies on that occasion were certainly not satisfactory. I should like to point out to the hon. the Minister that he is altering section 2(2) of the Post Office Re-adjustment Act which at the moment reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as possible the total earnings of the department shall be not more than is sufficient to meet the necessary outlays for capital expenditure out of revenue, the repayment of loans and the payment of interest on loans, operation, maintenance, replacement, betterment and depreciation and, subject to the provisions of section 5</block>

<p>This section relates to the payment of a subsidy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to meet any other financial liability imposed on the department by law.</block>

<p>That is how it reads at present. The hon. the Minister now suggests that we should accept quite a different provision. If you look at the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in the Other Place, it makes you no wiser at all. One cannot understand why the word &#x201C;profits&#x201D; should be used instead of &#x201C;total earnings&#x201D; and one cannot understand why the words &#x201C;reasonable reserves&#x201D; should be included. From the explanation given by the hon. the Minister, it appears that what he really wants, he is already doing. So, why change the existing law? We on this side cannot understand it. In addition to the Items listed in section 2(2) of the Post Office Re-adjustment Act, to which I have referred, the hon. the Minister wants to include &#x201C;reasonable reserves&#x201D; and &#x201C;the provision of new fixed assets&#x201D;. Those are two items which are additional to the items referred to in section 2(2) of the Post Office Re-adjustment Act.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that he must have the word &#x201C;profits&#x201D; included here. In his reply to this point in the Other Place he said that it was not really a profit and that it was just another way of saying &#x201C;total earnings&#x201D;. Why then must he have the word &#x201C;profits&#x201D; if he is satisfied with &#x201C;total earnings&#x201D;? For heaven&#x2019;s sake, Mr. Chairman, let us stick to the words &#x201C;total earnings&#x201D;. And, Sir, if he does not really want &#x201C;reasonable reserves&#x201D;, let us stick to &#x201C;surplus&#x201D;. There has been a surplus on this account from time to time. The hon. the Minister says there is no need to change this, although in the balance sheet of the Post Office last year an item of R19 million appeared under the heading &#x201C;reserves&#x201D;. He <span class="col_9063-9064" refersTo="page_0442"/>said there is no need to change it, but in the same breath he says that the Auditor-General said: &#x201C;Look, Mr. Minister; What is this item &#x201C;reserves&#x201D; doing in your balance sheet? You have no right to put reserves in your balance sheet. Show me how you can do it in terms of the law.&#x201D; That is why the hon. the Minister is introducing this amendment. He wants this amendment because he wants to keep the balance sheet in the same position as it is now. All he should do is to delete the word &#x201C;reserves&#x201D; in his balance sheet and to substitute the word &#x201C;surplus&#x201D;. That will be the end of it. What is happening here, as I said during the Second Reading debate, is that the hon. the Minister is introducing two new sets of words, namely &#x201C;profits&#x201D; and &#x201C;reasonable reserves&#x201D;. By doing so, he is introducing a completely new concept in respect of the Post Office. The hon. the Minister says he is not doing so, but I say he is. He is on the road to making the Post Office a public corporation, and this is the surest way of doing it. He is doing so, firstly, by introducing a profit motive, and secondly, by introducing a requirement that there must be reserves. Now, Sir, the Minister must get this straight. When he replies to the debate on this clause, we on this side of the House want good and sufficient reasons for the changes in terminology which he proposes. If he does not give us good and sufficient reason, we are going to vote against this clause, because we do not believe that there is any reason that the Minister can advance which will satisfy us.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 21, in lines 13 to 39, to omit subsections (1) and (2).</block>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that this is an identical amendment to one moved in the Senate, which was not accepted by the hon. the Minister in that House. My attitude is that if this House cannot differ in its decisions from the decisions taken by the Senate, then I can see no reason why we must continue to have a bicameral system of government. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I have moved affects the new section 12G, which seeks to introduce two provisions which I consider to be in direct conflict with the established practice for budgetary control of operations or organizations whose finances are subject to direct parliamentary control. That includes all State departments, the Railways, and up to now it includes the Post Office.</p>

<p>The first of these two new provisions which are in conflict with established practice is that money appropriated for one financial year, and unspent during that financial year, may now be carried over into the next financial year. This is a practice which is specifically prohibited, as far as State departments are concerned, by the Exchequer and Audit Act of 1975. Up to now it has been prohibited as far as the Post Office and the Railways are concerned, by the Exchequer and Audit Act of 1956. It is a practice which is allowed in respect of certain State corporations such as the Uranium Enrichment Corporation, the South African Bureau of Standards and the CSIR, but these are corporations which do not come directly under Parliament as far as financial control is concerned. But even then I regard the practice of allowing them to retain unspent balances and to spend them in the next financial year as a very doubtful practice. I think that there are very good reasons why this practice is prohibited where Parliament exercises direct control over operations. You cannot exercise that proper control unless you have control over appropriations and expenditures as far as the specific purposes of those appropriations and expenditures are concerned and as far as the periods for which those appropriations have been approved are concerned. If money is to be allowed to be spent over a longer period than the period for which it is appropriated, then that means tolerating overestimating, which can only lead to unhealthy and slack practices. I believe that a feature of well-run businesses, that separates them from less well-run businesses, is that they maintain a very tight control over expenditure and insist on tight, accurate and careful budgeting. The Select Committee on Public Accounts takes a <span class="col_9065-9066" refersTo="page_0443"/>very, very critical view, as far as Government Departments are concerned, when they are responsible for over-budgeting. The second new principle introduced by this clause is that which allows the Post Office to spend money in a new financial year which has not yet been appropriated for that financial year. It allows expenditure to go on in a new financial year for the first two months of that financial year, although I see the hon. the Minister has an amendment on the Order Paper to reduce that period of two months to one month.</p>

<p>I interpret the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposed amendment as being that he has some doubt about the wisdom of the two-month period. However, reducing the period from two months to one month does not make black into white. It will still be black, because it introduces a completely new practice in an organization the finances of which are controlled, whether directly or indirectly, by Parliament. It opens a loophole which makes an absolute farce of parliamentary control over finances. If control is to be effective over finances, it has to be complete control and not partial control. This is introducing partial control. I see no reason whatsoever why expenditure in a new year, if it is not already covered by the Appropriation Bill for that year, should not be covered by a Part Appropriation Bill so that expenditure does not take place until it has had parliamentary approval. This is a principle we on this side of the House just cannot support. By not supporting it, it does not mean that we do not have the utmost faith in the management of the Post Office. In fact, we do. What we do say is that, if this clause is allowed to go through, one is abrogating one of the main functions of Parliament, and that is the control of public finances.</p>

<p>I join my colleagues in saying that I am surprised and that I regret that the hon. the Minister saw fit to tell us of the introduction of this Bill in the Other Place in such great length and to try to suggest that everything said there had been motivated by the hon. member for Wynberg. This may be so, because we work as a group. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that it surely is the right also of hon. members of this House to express their opinions. Surely this is what it is all about. This is what Parliament is here for. I respectfully suggest therefore that his remarks were not in keeping with the better thinking of Parliament. We are not here to be ridden over rough-shod.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sir, I will. As I see it, the very essence of the Bill is to ensure that the Post Office is run on sound and business-like lines and that it subscribes to the better aspects of accepted business principles.</p>

<p>In the running of any normal business undertaking, if one were to ask for a period of four months to elapse before the close of the relevant financial year for the preparation of the balance sheet for presentation to one&#x2019;s auditors, then I should venture to suggest that one may as well shut up shop. To ask for four months before one is able to prepare one&#x2019;s final set of accounts, is to court disaster. If it is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention, by medium of this Bill, to get the Post Office to run on a business-like basis, then I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should consider two months as being a limit, the extreme limit, to which he should go before presentation of his balance sheet to the Auditor-General for audit and approval.</p>

<p>It is not a question of what the limit in the case of companies is. It is <span class="col_9067-9068" refersTo="page_0444"/>a matter of what the accepted limit is amongst business houses. If one is running this as a business, it must be run as a business. If one wants to run it as a business, one must run it as a business of which one is the director. If I were a director of this business I would want the answers and I would want them soon. And to this end, and particularly as we are living in an era of highly inflationary times, I suggest that this is a waste of money. It is a waste of the country&#x2019;s money to allow this period to just go happily on for four months. I think the hon. the Minister would do well to consider my amendment. I have said that the limit should be two months. However, let us be accommodating and let us say that a period of no longer than three months should elapse before the relevant set of accounts is prepared and submitted to the Auditor-General. Otherwise I submit that we are doing the country a great disservice.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to deal with clause 5 and with the various amendments which have been moved by members of the Official Opposition. The matter we are dealing with relates to good management. My approach to this matter is that the Post Office is a very large and intricate organization, rendering as it does a large range of very significant services. One must accept a number of things. One of the things one must accept is that the top management of the Post Office consists of highly qualified, competent and dedicated people. The second thing one must accept is that if one wants the Post Office to operate efficiently, it must be run on modem business lines. Thirdly, one must accept that if one wants the management of the Post Office to perform satisfactorily and efficiently, they must be given modem management tools. One must also be prepared to entrust to them modem management powers.</p>

<p>If the purpose of the amendment is to bind the managers of the Post Office to such an extent that they do not have sufficient management flexibility, then one cannot at the same time expect of them efficient management of the organization they are running. My attitude therefore is different. My attitude is one of acceptance of the competence of the management of the Post Office and of the dimensions of their job. I accept that, if I want them to run the Post Office efficiently as a modem business organization, then I must give them modem business management tools. I accept that this will lead to increased efficiency, to better services and to the control of charges rates and fees.</p>

<p>However, I believe there is one important aspect. Having given these powers and a management tools to the Post Office, the managers must be held accountable for all their actions by way of reports to Parliament. We must have the right to scrutinize the actions of the Post Office in terms of the powers given to them. I think that this is very important, and for that reason I am opposed to a number of the amendments of the Official Opposition because these amendments would not give the Post Office management the flexibility which they need to ran the Post Office on modern business lines.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the first amendment which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 15 in line 12 to omit the word &#x201C;profit&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;total earnings&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I believe that it may be a matter of semantics. What the official Opposition does not want, is that the total income of the Post Office should exceed its total expenditure.</p>

<p>Vote No. 9 and S.W.A. Vote No. 4.&#x2014;&#x201C;Labour&#x201D;:</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I ask for the privilege of the half hour.</p>

<p>Since this Vote was discussed last year, a number of changes have been made, the most important of which is that a new Minister has taken over. We congratulate the hon. the Minister on his appointment and since we are aware of the importance of this Vote, we also wish him every success in the difficult task which lies ahead of him.</p>

<p>I think I may say that the Labour Vote has often been approached in a pedantic and stereotyped way in the past. A new insight, a new approach to the problems is undoubtedly necessary. We believe that this is probably the main reason why this portfolio has been entrusted to the hon. the Minister. We hope that we will get this new insight and approach from him.</p>

<p>There is no doubt about the fact that his predecessor compromised himself so deeply in respect of most matters of policy that he left himself virtually no room for manoeuvre. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why he has received a kind of Irish promotion. I believe that what is necessary is a flexible approach and a new insight which we hope to get from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>We had initially decided not to launch a direct attack on the hon. the Minister and to give him the opportunity to find his feet in the new position. For this reason I must say that I find it a pity that he deemed it necessary a short while ago to express himself on certain policy aspects outside this House in a way which we regard as highly controversial. Nevertheless, in an attempt to be constructive, we should like to state our view of some of the labour problems with which the hon. the Minister is faced and to suggest to him how we believe he should tackle those problems. It is a pity that labour has so often become a political playball in the past and that more attention has been given to the number of votes which could be gained than to the economic interests of South Africa. Had this not been the case we would have progressed much further in this connection by now than is the case at the moment.</p>

<p>We on this side believe that there are certain background factors which will dominate the labour scene in the next few years. Let me refer to a few of them. In the first place, the manpower dynamics in South Africa are naturally complicated as well as fluid. They are complicated because there is a shortage of entrepreneur types, especially among our Black people. At any rate, this is the position at the moment. There are groups in our country at the same time which show an extremely high and an extremely low profile of economic development. There is a diversity of concepts and value systems. This complicates the matter. Nevertheless, it is fluid as well, for no matter what is provided by law, a factual situation is developing which is completely outside the law. To indicate what I mean, I should like to refer to a survey which was recently made by Prof. Nieuwenhuizen of RAU. In his survey he refers to a particular industry in which 500 people are employed, and industry which seems to play an important strategic role in South Africa. He tells us that in this organization, all the administrative tasks are performed by White women, while <span class="col_9071-9072" refersTo="page_0446"/>all the technical tasks of production and distribution are performed by Black men. In the whole organization of 500 people, scarcely half a dozen White men are employed. So irrespective of what may be provided by law in connection with job reservation, etc., we have the situation here that structural changes are taking place in the work context, changes we cannot ignore and for which we must indeed make provision.</p>

<p>In the second place, there is the question of the number of new workers for whom job opportunities have to be created. As regards provision for our potential economic population, I should like to mention a figure&#x2014;I assume that the figure is correct&#x2014;which has not been mentioned here before. If we want to create job opportunities for all races in South Africa, we shall have to create 300 000 new jobs a year over the next ten years. This amounts to almost 1 000 a day. I wonder whether we have any idea of what is at stake. Let me explain how I arrive at that figure. Just the natural increase of our population will give us 2,5 million new workers over the next ten years. If we take it that there are 500 000 people at the moment who are not being properly utilized, economically speaking, this means that we shall have to provide for 3 million new people over the next ten years. We should like to know from the hon. the Minister, in the first place, what arrangements he is going to make to provide for these requirements. Secondly, we should like to know how he is going to reconcile it with the present labour policy of the Government.</p>

<p>In the third place, there is the massive training programme which will be required by this kind of situation. In the USA, only 8% of the workers are considered to be unskilled at the moment. To be able to compete with them and with other countries, we shall have to work in the same direction. This gives us an idea of the enormous training programme that we have to undertake. In addition, we must remember that the Whites, as well as the Coloureds and the Indians, are withdrawing from the so-called blue collar jobs. From this we may conclude that within 20 years, most of the highly skilled work in South Africa will have to be done by Black people. The attempts at training which are being made at the moment in order to cope with this matter are quite inadequate and futile, of course. I also refer, in this connection, to the importance of education, for education has to be incorporated into such a training programme. It is generally accepted today that there is a direct connection between the money spent on education and the value of the national product. As regards training, including university training, for our Whites in particular, there are many experts who believe that we have already passed the saturation point. If one accepts this, there must, of course, be strong misgivings about the present policy for educational expenditure in South Africa.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to point out that we shall have to act against a completely different socio-economic background, which is going to change radically our approach to the labour problem. There are homelands which are going to become independent within the next five years. Indeed, one of them is already on the eve of independence. This is going to give a new dimension to the whole bargaining process. Bargaining is now going to become multilateral. In the future, bargaining will not only be concerned with the price of labour. It will be concerned with satisfying the aspirations of workers, both in the economic and in the political field. We have not the slightest indication that the Government has any idea of what is at stake here and that they are making any attempts to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>Finally, there are the conflicts which are going to arise from the expanding role of the authorities. Here I think in particular of the form of macro-management by the Government, of the requirements of the Government, which often clash with the interests of micro-management, i.e. the interests of the entrepreneurs themselves. These are only a few facets of the new development in this field, and we should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what his programme entails, what his view is in this connection and what he is going to do to cope with these matters.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, if you view the labour problem in this light&#x2014;and I have tried to indicate the broad panorama against which we must view it&#x2014;then it seems to me that certain questions immediately arise. Perhaps I can raise these under the headings of what should be done, who should do these things and how should they be done. I shall indicate to the hon. the Minister how we on this side of the House view these matters. We trust that he will seek every opportunity and take every <span class="col_9073-9074" refersTo="page_0447"/>advantage of the opportunity to indicate to us whether he agrees with our views or not.</p>

<p>First of all, what should be done? What should be the basic objective in South Africa at the present time? A primary aim in our view is sustained economic growth, not as an end in itself, but as a means to create new jobs and in order to raise the standards of living of all our people. A second main objective is that we would accept the complete interdependence of all the races in the economic advancement of South Africa. Thirdly, we would aim at creating a trained work force which would be capable of meeting the technological needs of our time and of our society. Fourthly, and concurrently with this, we would accept as a commitment that one should equalize as soon as possible the employment opportunities and the training facilities in South Africa for all our workers. In the last instance, we on this side of the House would implement a labour policy which is dictated by the human and the economic needs of our society and not by ideological considerations. Those are the aims as we see them and, as I have said, we will be anxious to hear whether the hon. the Minister also accepts them, or whether he rejects them, and if so, why.</p>

<p>If we have decided that these things are our aims, then the next thing we must decide is who must carry them out. Here our view has been consistent and clear for years, namely that labour is indivisible. It makes no difference whether the hands that do the work are Black, White or Brown. They must either build together, or else they might well destroy what has already been built. Therefore we would be opposed to the fragmentation of the labour function. At the moment in this country it is fragmented, first of all on colour lines, because the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Affairs deals with all Black labour issues. Similarly, other hon. Ministers deal with Coloured and Indian labour, and it would seem as if this hon. the Minister confines himself virtually to White workers. Secondly, the labour function in this country is also fragmented on functional lines. Each and every department seems to have a finger in the pie, for example the Department of Mines, the Department of Agriculture, etc. That is the reason why the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut recently said, almost on a note of despair, that if one deals with labour issues in South Africa, there are more than 10 different Government departments and agencies involved. We believe that this creates a totally impossible situation. All labour matters should be correlated and co-ordinated by this hon. the Minister. We feel it is an obligation which he dare not shirk, and any steps he might take in order to persuade the hon. the Prime Minister to rearrange the functional set-up to ensure that labour issues are co-ordinated and put under the umbrella of his portfolio, we will support.</p>

<p>I have indicated what ought to be done and who ought to do it. We now come to the important issue of how it should be done. With the limited time at my disposal, I can merely refer to a few of these aspects. In the first place, we regard it as essential for South Africa that there should be a defined and co-ordinated manpower strategy for the whole country. This means that the labour needs of our country should be studied, correlated and co-ordinated on a nation-wide basis. In order to do this, one obviously requires a national manpower planning agency. In the past we have advocated this frequently, but the Government has never reacted to it. I believe that the FCI has made similar overtures to the Government and we understand, from Press reports, that these have been sympathetically considered by the Government. We do not mind where the advice comes from. It is sound advice wherever it comes from and we can assure the hon. the Minister that if he were to accept it or work in that direction, we would give him our full support.</p>

<p>Particularly in a country like South Africa with its diverse and plural community, certain rights of workers should be accepted by all of us. I believe there are four fundamental rights of workers, rights which are universally accepted throughout the world. I shall indicate them to the hon. the Minister and we shall be pleased if he could indicate whether he accepts them or not. A fundamental right of every worker is to be trained to his full potential. Secondly, there is the right of equal pay for equal work and endeavour. Thirdly, there is the right all workers should have to organize themselves for collective bargaining. Fourthly, a worker should have the right to be protected by legislation against exploitation and abuse of the other rights I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Concurrent with this, I wish to mention the permanence of the Black worker in our industrial set-up. We can no longer shy away <span class="col_9075-9076" refersTo="page_0448"/>from this. Yet we cannot find a single hon. member on that side of the House who is prepared to stand up and say that he accepts that the Black workers are here for all time. The moment their permanence is accepted, it means that the discrimination, which is prevalent at present, is no longer tenable. It means that one should work rapidly towards equal pay for equal work. The Government is committed to this and the hon. the Prime Minister has told us that the policy of his Government is to close the pay gap. As a matter of fact, we have promised it to the United Nations. However, what is in fact happening? The most recent statistics produced by the Department of Statistics for the manufacturing sector show that the gap in pay between White and Black in 1969 was R225. In December 1974&#x2014;I do not have statistics available for any period after that&#x2014;the gap was R393. In other words, over a period of practically five years the gap was not narrowed, but actually increased. As a matter of fact, it almost doubled itself. It is quite clear why this is happening. It is no good the Government telling us, as they often do, that our Black workers here do better than the Blacks elsewhere in Africa. The Black man who works in South Africa is not interested in what the man earns who works in Kampala. He is interested in what the White workers who work side by side with him earn.</p>

<p>The moment one accepts the permanence of the Black worker, one comes to the issue of his bargaining procedures. What a strange history we have in this regard! It is universally accepted throughout the world that workers can organize themselves into unions so that they can bargain. In this country this is apparently in order for Whites and for Coloureds and for Indians, but by some strange method of reasoning it is not in order for Black workers. Look at the history of this. When we said it, and we saw it as inevitable when we said that Black workers should be unionized, we were attacked viciously from the other side. We were, in fact, told that all we wanted to do was that we wanted the Blacks to strike. To my mind this shows the strange understanding of the role of trade unions, because obviously their role is not to facilitate strikes, but to obviate them. However, what happened in any event two or three years ago? Thousands of Black workers struck. These strikes were illegal and the Blacks should all have been gaoled. Did the Government gaol them? No. They changed the procedures and they changed the law and said that the Black could strike in future. However, they are still denying them trade union rights. This does not make any sense. We have nothing against works and liaison committees, but they can at best be complementary to trade unionism and not a substitute for it. The danger of the present situation is that Black unions are being formed and are operating outside the parameters of the law. There is yet a further danger that follows from the Government&#x2019;s present policy, and that is that Black unions are developing separately. Anybody who has any understanding of what happened in a place like Zambia, for example, will try to avoid this at all costs. In Rhodesia they have accepted the principle of integrated unions, and this is the one field in which they have never had any problems.</p>

<p>The hon. member may also take part. We shall be very happy to listen to his contribution.</p>

<p>This brings us to job reservation, on which the hon. the Minister recently had all sorts of things to say when he spoke outside this House. Can hon. members imagine: Here is the hon. the Prime Minister due to meet Dr. Kissinger. Dr. Kissinger will most probably say to the hon. the Prime Minister that we discriminate in South Africa. The Prime Minister will answer that we are not and that we are moving away from discrimination. Dr. Kissinger will then say: But what about job reservation? This puts us in a completely untenable situation. The Government says it applies to only 2,8% of the work force. If that were the case and this was the whole story, then I think there is very good reason why it should be done away with immediately.</p>

<p>We also have the problem of training. When we mentioned a few years ago the need for accelerated training, think of the sneers that came from that side of the House. &#x201C;All you want to do is to open the sluice gates for non-Whites to come in&#x201D;, they told us. However, this happened years ago already. They are here and they must be trained. When I say that job opportunities for some 300 000 people must be created in South Africa every <span class="col_9077-9078" refersTo="page_0449"/>year, it gives indication of the massive training effort that is required. Why can&#x2019;t they be trained? Because there are not the understrutting technical college facilities. There is Mr. Drummond of Seifsa, whom the Minister&#x2019;s colleague and predecessor often quoted with such approval. Mr. Drummond recently said we cannot do the training properly because we do not have the technical college facilities here in White South Africa. The Government has decided that they should be trained in the homelands, but the homelands have not got the jobs. They account for 2% of South Africa&#x2019;s economic activities. How long can we continue with this kind of absurdity? South Africa is suffering in the process because of the way the Government is handling this issue.</p>

<p>And as the result of all these things, look at the effects on productivity. I want to quote figures which I quoted last time, because the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor never took any notice of them. All he told us was how many liaison committees he had constituted. Sir, if we do what Prof. Reynders and others do and express productivity as an output ratio per unit of input&#x2014;he took some 12 developing countries&#x2014;we will find that France is 82%; Belgium, 74%; the UK, 54%; and South Africa, 23%. How do you explain that? The Minister cannot just grumble about it, but must give us an explanation and say what is going to be done to rectify this. One can express it in a different way, according to the PLU index, the production per labour unit. They took 17 developing countries and an index of 100 in 1963. On that basis they found that Japan at present was on 229&#x2014;in other words, they had more than doubled it&#x2014;Holland was on 193 and South Africa on 102. In other words, over a period of 10 years we had advanced by two points. One of the most recent issues of the <i>Financial Mail</i> expressed it differently. They produced a graph and this again shows South Africa at the bottom of the league, because on an index of 100 all these other countries are ahead of us: Australia, USA, Canada, UK, Western Germany, Switzerland, France and Japan, the latter with an index of 594. Sir, these are figures which speak volumes. That is why we have inflation; that is why we have balance of trade problems. One of the major reasons therefore is the low productivity in South Africa. The hon. the Minister is new to this Vote. He has just taken on this important assignment. Yet he must now tell us what he is going to do about it. The reasons for it are quite obvious. There is an increase in productivity if there is mobility of labour both in the vertical and in the lateral field, but in both cases the Government prohibits this, the first by way of job reservation and the second by way of the Physical Planning Act. Sir, it is unbelievable that the Government could react in this way.</p>

<p>Many years ago I happened to be at Witrand, an institute for the feeble-minded at Potchefstroom. There were about 100 of these people working away. Half of them were building benches around the sports field, and they were happy about it. They were laughing and thinking they were doing a constructive job. But behind them came the other half and they were breaking all these benches down again. Both groups were entirely happy; both were doing a job. The Government to my mind is doing precisely the same sort of thing, because while some Ministers are building, others are breaking down. It is unbelievable. Here we have a situation where, as I read recently, 350 Koreans were permitted by this Government to come and help erect an oil refinery outside Cape Town. Now, I have nothing against Koreans, but we have a history. Do you remember, Mr. Chairman how we brought in Chinese to work on the gold mines and how we brought in Indians to work on the sugar farms? But here we have thousands upon thousands of our own Coloured people and thousands of our own Black people who are clamouring for opportunities to do higher skilled work, yet the Government sanctions the importation of 350 Koreans from the other side of the world. Sir, it is unbelievable.</p>

<p>Sir, my time has virtually run out. I still want to make brief reference also to the migratory labour in South Africa. I have no doubt that we do need foreign workers in South Africa, but at the moment it is estimated that we have nearly 2 million migratory workers in South Africa, one in three of our labour force, and if the Government&#x2019;s separate development and separate freedoms policy were to be fully put into effect, 80% of the workers in South Africa will be foreign and migratory. Lots of things stem from this. One important thing that we overlook too is that the average work life of a migratory worker is at best 20 years, half what it is for a normal worker. Have we any idea of the loss in <span class="col_9079-9080" refersTo="page_0450"/>manpower sustained purely through this? We were interested too recently to see that the Department of Bantu Administration, Deputy Minister Punt Janson when he was still there and was doing valuable work before he was put out on pension, was at least thinking in terms of a charter for migratory workers. We on this side of the House believe that is a function of this department, of this hon. Minister. His labour force is of a migratory nature and is bigger than any such force in existence in the world. He should think in terms of a charter for them and what their rights are, what they can do and what they are not permitted to do.</p>

<p>There are so many other issues to which one would wish to refer, but I cannot do so now. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that our view on this side of the House is that he is new in the job and that he has an excellent opportunity to remove all the cobwebs which exist at the moment. He should do what ought to be done, namely to put South Africa&#x2019;s labour on a more rational and more advanced footing, because in the long term it is only through economic strength that we will be able to defend ourselves, and this can only be done if labour is put on a sound footing.</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to avail myself of the opportunity to pay tribute to the former Minister of Labour, at present the President of the Senate. Hon. members know that ex-Minister Marais Viljoen was for many years attached, and very closely attached, to the Department of Labour, initially&#x2014;from 1958 to 1966&#x2014;in the capacity of Deputy Minister and subsequently as Minister of this department, from 1966 until the beginning of 1976. If memory does not fail me, I think that this is the longest term that any Minister of Labour has served in that portfolio in the Republic of South Africa. Looking back over that time it is clear that the former Minister, the present President of the Senate, succeeded in managing this vital portfolio with great success.</p>

<p>Certain beacons were established by ex-Minister Marais Viljoen during this period, beacons one cannot fail to see, and I want to refer to a few of them. In the first place I want to refer to the amendment of the Industrial Conciliation Act. He made possible the establishment of training schemes, since the training of workers in South Africa was a subject very near to his heart. In the second place I want to refer to the Industrial Conciliation Amendment Act, by means of which he created the opportunity, and made it compulsory, for the trade union membership fees of the workers of South Africa to be deducted from their wages by employers on a monthly basis. In the early days this was a delicate and sore issue among the workers. However, I am of the opinion that the outstanding Act placed on the Statute Book over the past few years is the Bantu Labour Relations Regulation Act. By means of that legislation the hon. the Minister created opportunities for negotiation for the Black man with regard to wages, working conditions and conditions of service. Those are the outstanding characteristics. However, over the years he has also devoted his energies to effecting various improvements to the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. These are the beacons he has established in his term as Minister of Labour. We want to wish him success and all of the best in his new post. I should also like to avail myself of the opportunity to extend a special welcome to the present Minister of Labour in the post he occupies today. Over the years he has shown himself to be an extremely capable and hard-working man who has devoted his full attention to the portfolios he has occupied in the past and has made a great success of them. We are all aware of his characteristics of humility, humanity and integrity, and also perseverance. On behalf of this side of the House I want to convey my cordial congratulations on his appointment to this portfolio. We know that he is going to make an outstanding success of the important task of labour, too. Furthermore, he will have the loyalty and the support of this side of the House and it is in that spirit, too, that we approach the discussion of this debate.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the hon. member who had just resumed his seat. When this hon. member starts talking, he is captivated by the sound of his own voice, just like a nightingale singing to itself. Then he gets lyrical, and as he goes on he tends to put both feet into a trap. I want to refer to this. Over the past few years, in his short political career, the hon. member has committed the most monumental blunders, blunders he later regretted. I don&#x2019;t know whether he did so on purpose.</p>

What is the hon. member doing? On 22 April he told the hon. the Prime Minister that he and the South African Ambassador had said that they were moving away from discrimination. However, he asked what exactly they were doing. He used this example, which I regard as a reprehensible one.</p>

<p>Good. At this stage there is a Bill on the bench of the hon. member&#x2014;who is chairman of the labour group of the United Party&#x2014;amending that very clause so as to equalize the burial allowance for White and Black. Why, then, does the hon. member use that as an example? Why did the hon. member not use that amendment to thank the hon. the Prime Minister? The hon. the Prime Minister is keeping his word, he is eliminating discriminatory measures where possible. Now I shall tell hon. members why he is doing so. He has no reason for doing so. He is doing so in order to take a back-handed swipe at his own fatherland, and then they take it amiss of one when one questions their <i>bona fides,</i> when their patriotism is the point at issue. Then we question it. However, I want to leave the hon. member at that. The hon. member raised a few points in this debate&#x2014;I cannot deal with all of them&#x2014;to which I shall reply in the course of my speech. I took the trouble to look up what this Government has been charged with this year in regard to the labour policy. In the sources to which I referred, I saw what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had said in the no-confidence debate. I wonder what their chief spokesman on finance, the hon. member for Constantia, had to say? I saw what the hon. member for Hillbrow had to say, during the discussion of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. They have consistently accused this side of the House of just one thing, and that is the acts passed that discrimination against Blacks, and our ideological labour policy. That was their finding and subsequently they accused us of having a low productivity as a result of those Acts and also of causing inflation thereby. Once again, this is exactly what he said again in this debate today. He added nothing new. He said exactly what those hon. members had said before. The steps suggested by the hon. member were that we should do away with job preservation. That is what he said today. He went on to say that we should do away with influx control.</p>

What did the <i>Financial Mail</i> find then?

<p>I thank the hon. Whip for the opportunity to continue. With reference to this I feel that the <i>Financial Mail</i> now has the fullest right to write another article like this and ask: Speak up, United Party! They must stand up and state where they stand now in respect of job reservation. That hon. member asked where we were going to find the people and the employment opportunities. However, they are aware of the projects such as a second Sasol, a third and fourth expansion of Iscor and the nuclear installation at Koeberg. Surely those projects create employment opportunities. We on this side of the House, as the National Party, are therefore not ashamed to say that we shall make better use of the Black people. We shall utilize them better, and that is what we are doing.</p>

<p>Where? Sir, did the hon. member not listen to the radio the night before last when Mr. Roos said that 18 000 people were now occupying posts on the Railways previously occupied by Whites? We find the same thing in the Post Office and in industry. However, we are doing so on a different basis because there are historical reasons for this. They want to turn South Africa upside down, and in that way cause chaos. However, we are doing so in an orderly way. We are doing so in the closest cooperation with the trade unions. It can only be done on that basis, of course. It can only be done if one has the co-operation of the trade unions.</p>

<p>However, they are asking for the abolition of the job reservation provision. I say that that provision in particular must remain on the Statute Book to afford protection to the White man in the event of his employers wanting to eject him from his traditional employment to make place for the Black man. Mr. J. P. Coetzee said that job reservation had to be abolished, but he did not say that it should be totally abolished. He clearly emphasized that the whole issue had a historical background. He even warned the industrialist that it could be dangerous to his industry if he allowed influx to occur unchecked. I have the speech by Mr. J. P. Coetzee, the General Manager of Iscor. Articles about this appeared in the newspapers too, of course. The newspapers <span class="col_9085-9086" refersTo="page_0453"/>maintained that he had said that job reservation should be abolished. However, what did he say? He said that we should have to switch over more rapidly in certain categories of employment. The other day I said in this House&#x2014;and I say it again without hesitation&#x2014;that if it is necessary, and if there are shortages in certain categories of work as a result of the expansion which is taking place in South Africa, we shall have to make more use of the services of the Black man. It would be a foolish Government which spent millions on the training of Black people and did not subsequently make better use of their labour. Is the hon. member perhaps under the impression that we are fools? After all, the White worker of South Africa does not lack sense, nor are the trade unions unreasonable, and if the employers consult with them and co-operate with them properly, then we shall be able to utilize these people better.</p>

<p>This has always been the case and the hon. fool should have&#x2014;I apologize and withdraw the word &#x201C;fool&#x201D;. The hon. member should have known it, but apparently he does not know any better. I think he should rather go and play marbles, because possibly that is the only thing he knows something about.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow said that we should give the Black worker the right to negotiate. Surely it has been stated repeatedly in debates of this nature what the policy of the NP is with regard to Black trade unions. That is why we introduced legislation to regulate the labour relations of Black workers. By means of that legislation we made it possible to establish works and liaison committees. We also created the channels through which those committees could act. How many of those committees did we have in the year that the legislation was placed on the Statute Book? A mere 162. However, today we have more than 2 400 liaison and works committees by means of which almost 650 000 people are afforded the right to negotiate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow added that we were discriminating against the Black man in that the Black worker was not regarded as a worker in terms of the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D; in the Industrial Conciliation Act. He said that if the Black worker was defined as such, he would be able to enjoy trade union rights. The hon. member accused the hon. the Prime Minister of discriminating against the Black people in that they did not have the right to be members of trade unions, but I now want to ask the hon. member whether a Black man can become a member of his party.</p>

<p>But surely, then, the UP, too, is discriminating against Black people. [Interjections.] Of course it amounts to discrimination, because the hon. members maintain, after all, that we are discriminating against Black people because we do not allow them to belong to trade unions. We also have the testimony of Chief Buthelezi, who said that in the young, developing Transkei he would not allow Black trade unions since this could pose a threat to him.</p>

<p>But what has Chief Buthelezi to do with the Transkei?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow states that the Black man would be better off if a trade union could negotiate on his behalf, but does he not remember the &#x201C;Laundry Traders and Dry Cleaners&#x201D; trade union on the Witwatersrand? That trade union negotiated with the Industrial Council, and one of the companies of which the hon. member is chairman of the board of directors, served on the Industrial Council. What happened in regard to the negotiation by that unrecognized trade union? The wages proposed were so low that the Bantu Labour Council was not prepared to accept them. The Black workers <span class="col_9087-9088" refersTo="page_0454"/>concerned would simply have been exploited if the Labour Council had acceded to the representations made by the &#x201C;Laundry Traders&#x201D; trade union. There is another example, too. I refer to the &#x201C;Liquor and Catering Trades&#x201D; on the Natal south coast. There were negotiations on their behalf, too, but in their case it also happened that the wages proposed were so low that the Labour Council was unable to accept them. However, the hon. member creates the impression that Bantu membership of trade unions is the alpha and the omega as regards the solution of our problems.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to productivity. He said that our productivity was too low, and in order to support his statement he whisked through a whole series of statistics relating to other countries. However, he forgets that these are the statistics of established industrial countries. He cannot compare South Africa with such countries. Thousands of our workers are not yet productive enough; we are, in fact, a developing country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<p>I was referring to the growth in productivity.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member referred to our low productivity. He said that one of the reasons was the wide wage gap. Surely my hon. friend knows that the wage gap was narrowed substantially in 1974 when the White workers were awarded an increase of 11% or 12%&#x2014;I do not have the exact figure&#x2014;whereas the Black workers were awarded an increase of more than 28%, with the specific aim of narrowing that gap. Hon. members opposite must not come up with the kind of rot they have been speaking today. They also referred once again to the training of the Black man. How much is the State not spending on the training centres that are being created to train the Black people properly so that they can be better utilized! In conclusion I just want to mention an example: At the end of 1972 we had 6 000 Bantu construction workers, but at the end of 1975 there were more than 9 000 of them. Of course we are making more use of the Black man, but I want to stress that we are doing so in an orderly way in co-operation with our trade unions. Our trade unions consist of reasonable people, and when it is necessary and when categories of work are available, we shall certainly accelerate the pace.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to claim the privilege of the second half hour. I should like to associate myself with the remarks made already by the two previous speakers in wishing the new Minister of Labour well in the work he has now been given to do. Reference has also been made to his predecessor. Certainly, he served as Minister of Labour for a long time and during that time some very important legislation was placed before the House. Mr. Chairman, the whole question of labour is a very vital factor in any nation&#x2019;s economy. Therefore, not only do we congratulate the hon. the Minister but we also wish him well with this very difficult job.</p>

<p>Labour has, I believe, direct relevance to the problem of inflation and to the possibilities of increased productivity, and therefore it is doubly significant. Before I try to sketch in the background of the four major areas in which I believe labour and economy are so vital, I wish to reply briefly to the hon. member who has just sat down. Firstly, I regret very much his remarks about the necessity for the maintenance of job reservation. We strongly differ with him on that point, as we have done consistently. In the second place, I want to say that he did make noises about the better use of Black labour which seemed to me to be highly encouraging. Who knows, it may be that that is the first signal we are getting from the other side that job reservation in the final analysis will have to disappear. Further, I just want to put the hon. member right on two points he made. Firstly, he referred to Chief Buthelezi as having said that he would not allow trade unions. That of course is quite incorrect. It was Chief Minister Matanzima who said that and not Chief Buthelezi.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Sorry. Thank you for correcting me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>I am prepared to help at any time. Secondly, by asking the hon. members of the Opposition whether or not they would allow a Black man to join their party and by his saying that this was an act of discrimination, he showed a singular lack of knowledge of the legislation governing improper interference which, of course, forbids that <span class="col_9089-9090" refersTo="page_0455"/>taking place. It is very distressing to notice this kind of ignorance.</p>

<p>The first point I want to make in order to sketch in the background is that the South African economy is indivisible. Thus the prosperity of one group will be dependent on the prosperity of any other group in South Africa. We can no longer pretend that there is separation. As one man put it, you can have separation into separate States if the Government believes that this is right and they have the power to implement that; you may even be able to have separation into separate nationhoods, but you can only have one labour force in South Africa. A fact of life which must be accepted by any who seek to build up our economy is that that economy is a single, integrated economy.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is that a very high percentage of the labour force working in the industrial areas is Black. Figures have already been quoted in the House in this connection. I believe it is necessary for them to be quoted again. In 1932 and 1933 the percentage in respect of Black labour was 57%. By 1972 it had risen to 75%. I believe that in 1976 that percentage of Black workers is reaching a figure of nearly 80%. The point I want to stress is that the number of economically active Blacks is increasing at a higher rate than that of Whites. This, too, is a fact of life which we must come to terms with when we talk about the harnessing of the productive potential of our total labour force.</p>

<p>The third point I want to make, by way of background, is that most of our industrial development is, and will remain for some time, in the urban areas. Because Blacks form such a vital and integral part of our labour force, we must face up to the fact that they are a permanent part of South Africa. Whether we like it or not, our cities are not White. We have built this country together and not separately, and the economy and the future of our country will depend on our ability to work in partnership for the future. This inevitably will bring about a heavy emphasis on the need for transport, housing and education for our Black labour force.</p>

<p>The fourth and final point, by way of background, is that our economic growth rate must increase. We are all agreed on this. It has been stated again and again during this session. We cannot, to put it at its strongest, defend South Africa unless our economy is strong, and unless we take the facts already mentioned into account, we will not be able to achieve a stable and growing economy.</p>

<p>With these four facts having been sketched out very briefly, I want to address myself to two crucial facts relating to our labour force, which mitigate against economic growth and long-term industrial peace. I have only chosen two, because I believe that these two are the major matters which must get the attention of this House. I hope they will receive the immediate and urgent attention of the new hon. Minister. The first is in the area of labour representation. Because of the facts of our economy, it is self-destroying to separate the labour force as we are doing, in terms of their normal aspirations. I refer now to the right of workers to negotiate, to engage in collective bargaining on an organized basis. The hon. the Minister of Community Development, when he was still in the Opposition benches, had this to say (Hansard, 1973, col. 1050)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we want to have peace in South Africa, if we want to survive as White entrepreneurs and privileged White workers in South Africa, we cannot hope permanently to deny the Black workers of South Africa the right of collective bargaining on an organized basis.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am quite sure that the hon. the Minister of Community Development believes that still, and I believe that it is absolutely essential to do exactly that and to do it without delay. But this Government, despite the addition to their ranks of that hon. Minister, persists in splitting the labour force in half. It is true that Black unions are not illegal, but they are of course unregistered, and in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, a Black worker is not an employee. This creates confusion. I believe it is creating tension at a growing and alarming rate amongst Black workers. Of course, it also creates tension and confusion in management. Instead of the Government being an enabling force, it is divisive. An example of this is the recent events at Heinemann Electric, events which emphasizes the tension which exists just below the surface in South Africa. The disturbances which took place at that industry were not about wage demands, but rather as a result of the refusal of the management to recognize that 75% of their Black labour force had joined a Black <span class="col_9091-9092" refersTo="page_0456"/>union&#x2014;I want to stress that this is not illegal&#x2014;and they wanted the management to recognize this union rather than the liaison committee which existed. I believe that this incident and other incidents of labour unrest should act as an alarm bell in order to awaken the Government from its slumbers. The Federated Chamber of Industries, which can hardly be described as a radical organization, states in its labour policy for the 1970s that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the areas of the settlement of disputes in the negotiation of employment conditions, present legislation does not allow sufficient, meaningful, direct participation and representation by Black employees.</block>

<p>The report states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This deficiency has become a cause of discontent amongst Black workers and, in the interests of maintaining industrial peace as well as a satisfied, well-motivated and productive Black labour force, warrants serious attention.</block>

<p>The FCI acknowledges that the Bantu Labour Relations Regulation Amendment Act, 1973, has created new opportunities for Blacks, but stresses that despite this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The present system is inadequate in that the majority of the negotiations conducted in terms thereof are not afforded statutory recognition, neither does it place at the disposal of Black workers collective bargaining machinery in the broadly accepted sense of the term.</block>

<p>The FCI concludes with the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These shortcomings require the early and urgent attention of the authorities.</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>From which report are you reading?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>This is a report by the FCI entitled &#x201C;A Manpower Planning for the 1970s&#x201D;. I have the report here if the hon. the Minister would like to see it. Of course, it is quite clear that the Government itself, including the previous Minister of Labour, was well aware of that situation. That is why a draft Bill was circulated during 1975, a draft Bill amending the Bantu Labour Relations Regulations Act of 1953. This was sent out about seven or eight months ago, and some of us expected to see it on the Order Paper this session. I can well understand that we have a new hon. Minister of Labour and perhaps he wanted to familiarize himself directly with the problems before introducing the measure, but we note that the FCI and many other people have expressed the need for urgent action. When one looks at the draft legislation, although it is a matter of regret that we are not to have the legislation this session, when one sees it as an <i>ad hoc</i> piecemeal amendment of only one part of the industrial relations legislative system, one is grateful that the Bill has not come before us yet. However, one assumes that further legislation is going to be introduced in order to overcome these shortcomings.</p>

<p>The second major area to which I wish to make reference this morning&#x2014;the hon. member for Hillbrow referred to it towards the end of his speech&#x2014;is the fact that the overwhelmingly large percentage of our total labour force is migratory. In order not to waste any time, I want to concede immediately that migrant labour is not confined to South Africa and also that migrant labour has been a factor in South African economy since the discovery of diamonds. It was aggravated by the discovery of gold as well as by South Africa&#x2019;s rapid industrial development. Let me also make it clear to the hon. the Minister that I am concerned, in this debate, not with migrant workers coming from foreign territories, although this itself has many wide-ranging complications, but with migrant labourers from the Republic of South Africa to their place of work. In this connection I, in this session, have requested to have sight of two reports, one of which deals directly with a study on migrant labour by the Department of Labour and the other dealing with a commission of inquiry into disturbances on our mines. In both instances this was refused, and one can only surmise that both reports offer very strong criticism of the migratory character of our labour force. People from many walks of life have criticized our widespread dependence on migrant labour. For example, the then Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions said: &#x201C;Migratory labour is a bad thing&#x201D;. I assume that if he indeed said this, he meant it. And if he meant it, it should be done away <span class="col_9093-9094" refersTo="page_0457"/>with. One cannot simply make a statement and describe something as bad unless one then attempts to try to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>The majority of churches in South Africa have raised their voices against this system. It is well known that the Cape Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church summed it up perhaps best and most powerfully when it described migrant labour &#x201C;as a cancer which rages in the life of the African population&#x201D; and we must give urgent attention to what the Synod went on to say when it stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By virtue of God&#x2019;s laws the Whites will not remain untouched by the sickness which is ravaging the moral life of the African.</block>

<p>However, it is not only the churchmen and politicians who are expressing their concern, but management itself is beginning to change its perspective. There is already an increasing questioning in the mining industry, not merely on moral grounds, not only because of certain international pressures, but because of hostile confrontations and of mass walkouts from our mines. It is interesting and encouraging to see management questioning very much more than they did before the wisdom of the migrant labour system which previously was taken as a fact of life which was going to be with us for ever. Furthermore, with the increase in wages, with the shortages of skilled White labour and with Blacks moving into more skilled positions, there is an accompanying resolution that where we are paying higher wages, there is obviously the need to increase productivity, and to achieve this the workers have got to be able to do, on a systematic basis, more skilled work. I submit that they can only do this if we have a stable work force.</p>

<p>Much has been said about the consequences which flow from migrant labour, and it is salutary to note the position of the migrant labourer before the law. This is something which is not always borne in mind. All African workers who do not qualify for permanent residence rights must, on turning 15, or on becoming unemployed, register as a work seeker with their tribal labour bureau. At these labour bureaux they will be given a work category. They must then wait in the tribal area to be recruited by a licensed recruiting officer. When recruited, such migrant labourers enter into a service contract with a maximum duration of 12 months. At the end of this period his passbook must be signed off and I emphasize this. He must then return to his tribal area for at least 28 days. He can never be a tenant in a township house, he can never change the work category he was assigned to when he first registered as a work-seeker, he cannot bring his wife or children into a prescribed area where he is working, and as all migrant workers can only work for a continuous period of up to 12 months at a time, he can never qualify for permanent citizenship under section 10(1)(b) or (d). He must therefore&#x2014;and this is the important point&#x2014;remain a migrant worker all his working life.</p>

<p>Sir, it is hardly necessary for me to rehearse all the effects of migrant labour on family life. There can be little doubt, however, that migrant labour contributes to problems like separation, informal bigamy, marital alienation, prostitution, homosexuality, excessive use of alcohol&#x2014;and that is to say nothing of the effect this has on successive generations of children who are deprived of their father and very often of their mother as well. There can surely be no argument that we must unite in condemning a system which can destroy the moral fibre of the majority of human beings living in South Africa. When one realizes the extent of this, the solution of this problem becomes urgent. It has been recently estimated that 59% of the economically active men in the so-called White areas are migrant workers, and if we exclude the agricultural sector, that proportion shoots up to 85%. One economist points out that &#x201C;half the adult males in the homelands and in rural areas are absent from their homes for the greater part of their working life, and among the better educated echelons this absentee rate reaches nearly 90%&#x201D;. Sir, this system, I submit, divides the Black man in half: on the one hand a labour unit and on the other hand a person with a family. These two are rigidly separated. What we have in South Africa is that Whites in large measure have control of the capital, of the entrepreneurship skills and the property, while the majority of Blacks are labour units. Now what does this really all add up to? Sir, what we have in South Africa is a modem system of economic feudalism, with landlords on the one hand and vassals on the other.</p>

<p>What we have is a classic situation which must lead to a confrontation unless changes are made. Management cannot possibly know <span class="col_9095-9096" refersTo="page_0458"/>its Black labour force, because for a variety of reasons, not least of which are political and legal factors, the labour force represents what is called in economic and sociological terms a &#x201C;stranger&#x201D; group. The migrant worker is employed in a society which does not offer him status, recognition, housing, security, education for his children, ego rewards, diversion or opportunity. The migrant worker knows no mobility. Anyone who knows anything at all about industrialization, knows that it requires a broad mobilization and motivation of those who are participating in it. We can only conclude that South Africa&#x2019;s industrial giant has a soft underbelly, because we are pursuing the task of economic development with a labour force of which the vast majority cannot really be expected to extend a moral commitment to the social system which the economy serves. In short, the migrant labour system puts at risk the very fabric of our society. If we have a problem of security in South Africa, it is due to this system. Sir, there is only one attitude we can adopt to this system, that we ourselves must accept responsibility for our economic system and for our values. Reading past debates over this whole area which have taken place in this House, I have read with interest comments made by the hon. the Minister of Community Development, and I am sure that he will maintain that position, and that is when he said: &#x201C;In order to achieve the high standard of living we need the labour of Black men, and if we build our prosperity and our well-being on a wicked system, we should pay whatever it costs to get rid of that wicked system or do without that labour. It is as simple as that.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I believe that hon. the Minister is absolutely right. It is not an easy, simple way, and there is no well-fashioned blueprint before us, but until such time as we accept responsibility for our own value system, until such time as we accept responsibility for our migrant labour system as a central factor in our labour economy, we will go on, perhaps here and now bemoaning and bewailing the effects of this, but never ever coming to terms with it. The hon. the Minister continued and I quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, if one wants Black labour, one should give him the right to live as human beings &#x2026; I want to know whether any human being has the right for his own enrichment, to destroy the family life and character of another human being.</block>

<p>I believe that he meant that and I believe that he still means it today. I want to underline it. Change must come, and while one appreciates that the process of change will be difficult and very complex, the very complexity must not be used to avoid the issue or to procrastinate about beginning immediately to eliminate the dehumanizing effects of a system which demeans us all. Migrant labour is morally indefensible, economically wasteful and fundamentally dangerous to all of us.</p>

<p>I want to make a few suggestions as to what I believe can be done to tackle this vast problem, a problem which leaves none of us untouched. It is important that neither employers nor the Government wait on each other to initiate action. Both sectors, the employer and the Government, need to do different things and must, of course, work in close co-operation. An example of what can be done is what is taking place in Kimberley. The diamond mines, where the migrant labour first began, have now made it possible for many hostels in the compounds to be closed down and are making use of local labour living in the townships at Kimberley. This is a very significant step and has only been taking place during the last few years. Hundreds of men are now working under perfectly normal conditions because the will to make the change is there.</p>

<p>Of course it is not as simple and easy as that in every area in South Africa, but that is an example of what can be done. I am aware of the costs involved, but I believe that employers can be encouraged through tax incentives to stabilize their work force and to assist with housing. This is a long-term solution and there is much that can be done by employers in the meantime to alleviate the effects of the system until such time as the major changes can be made. Such measures are intermediate long weekends, subsidized transport so that migrants can visit their families, the provision of visiting accommodation for wives and children, the humanizing, as far as possible, of existing hostels and, in particular, in the planning of new hostels. It is distressing that large firms with large Black labour forces are building new hostels perpetuating the system of double bunking and having 15 men to a small room. A final <span class="col_9097-9098" refersTo="page_0459"/>measure is the construction of a better communication system between the place of work and the home area.</p>

<p>Concern and debate are not sufficient. I have raised with the hon. the Minister the two major areas of concern in our labour economy, the first being representation for all workers and the second the question of migrant labour. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to appoint a commission and to appoint it as soon as possible, to take a long look at these far-reaching problems. I believe there must be adequate representation from management, from labour and from the Government, to assist not only in ensuring industrial peace, but to ensure the prevention of confrontation in our South African society. These two problems could be looked at, and I believe there are hon. members on that side of the House as well as on this side of the House who have both the experience and the training and the insight into the nature of these two problems. There are many people in management and in labour who are desperately concerned about these problems, and during the recess there will be a wonderful opportunity for a commission to do a piece of work which can only result in better labour relations in South Africa and to the growth of our economy.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mindful of the fact that there are 4 728 109 economically active people in this country&#x2014;this is the amount according to the 1973 survey of labour force&#x2014;it is good and right that we should have the opportunity from time to time to speak about this very important matter of labour. Year after year we listen in this House to the standpoints of the UP and the PRP in order to determine to what extent their approach to this problem has become more profound. There can be no doubt that this is indeed a problem.</p>

<p>To our great disappointment we find that the same old story is dished up to us year after year. We also find that there is still a lack of proper perspective among these two parties. It is important that the voters outside should take note of this. The UP creates the impression that it is the alternative government and the PRP alleges that it is just a short head behind the UP. This morning it happened again that the UP&#x2019;s speaker on this matter dished up the old story, but I do not want to go into this matter again. The hon. member had half an hour at his disposal and I have only ten minutes. In these ten minutes I want to try and react to the speech made by the hon. member for Pinelands, the PRP speaker on labour. I should like to react to him because in my opinion he at least tried to approach this matter seriously. Now, one must start at the beginning, when one looks at their standpoint. We heard this beginning again from the hon. member for Pinelands. They approach it from one point of view only, namely that the economy and the economic progress and development are the alpha and the omega of the whole matter. If this is accepted and we plan accordingly, this country would ostensibly be a Utopia. I do not have the time to go into this in any depth, but I want to quote the following to you. Years ago Dr. Jooste, director of Sabra, said that&#x2014;and I do not want to go into details&#x2014;the second great deficiency in this approach is that it is determined economically. It also sets economic goals and he also believed that economic laws will presently put an end to apartheid. This is their approach and this a totally wrong approach. It is a totally wrong approach because, and I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ekonomiese mikpunte kan slegs verwesenlik word as daar vrede, veiligheid en goeie verhoudinge in die land is.</block>

<p>With their approach they want to bedevil those sound relations which have existed over the past 28 years in this country, thanks to a National Government. This morning the hon. member once again advocated his standpoint here in connection with trade unions for Black workers. What is the question as far as trade unions are concerned? Here we have that one of the leaders of the trade union movement in South Africa, Mr. Nieuwoudt, had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die plan om vakbonde vir Swartmense in die lewe te roep, is oneerlik.</block>

<p>He refers to the plan of the Federated Chamber of Industries. He says it is dishonest and he gives his reasons. He gives his reasons why it is dishonest and why it will not work. However, if one forces the Black trade union system down the throats of the White workers&#x2014;something I shall refer to again later on&#x2014;what will the consequences be? The people who have to carry the economy in this <span class="col_9099-9100" refersTo="page_0460"/>country, will, after all, revolt. Then one would be destroying the co-existence and sound relations in this country which are responsible for our being able to maintain our economic growth rate which we have been able to maintain so far. In other words, for an intelligent member like the hon. member for Pinelands &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; it ought to be clear that if one comes along with something which is not acceptable to all the workers in this country, one is going to experience problems.</p>

<p>This is the point. I want to ask the PRP to rid itself of this standpoint of trying to take political capital out of this situation. There is too much at stake for South Africa. After all, there are the proper channels. I wish I had more time this morning to speak on this subject, but I emphasize that the proper channels do exist. The system works excellently. Has the time not arrived for us in South Africa&#x2014;and now I am speaking of all responsible trade unionists, the Government and everyone who has an interest in this matter&#x2014;once again to consider the whole question of trade unions in general? What we have in South Africa today, is a system which we inherited from England and it does not suit the conditions we have in South Africa at all. Therefore, many of our people today are not very fond of the trade union movement, and it is an unhealthy situation in itself.</p>

<p>My time is running out, but in conclusion I just want to refer to the establishment of an Institute for Labour Relations at Unisa earlier this year. When announcing it, the hon. the Minister had the following to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Die vereistes wat gestel word aan georganiseerde arbeid vandag is om meer en beter opleiding daar te stel en gebalanseerde beskikbaarheid van werkkragte om die hele spektrum van ontwikkeling moontlik te maak, en die regte gesindheid teenoor die plig om beter te presteer en harder te werk vir groter en ho&#x00EB;r besoldiging en &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;r lewenstandaard.</block>

<p>This is what the hon. the Minister said at the establishment of this Institute for Labour Relations, and I support what he said. I think I am speaking on behalf of all of us here when I say that we heartily congratulate Unisa on the establishment of this institute and that we also wish them the best of luck for the future, because that institute may lay down very clear guide-lines which we in this country may follow. I hope that one of the matters they will consider, will be the whole question of the trade union movement in South Africa. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#ballot">

<from><span class="col_9101-9102" refersTo="page_0461"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. BALLOT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Springs must pardon me if I do not react to his speech, because I should like to express a few thoughts on a matter which concerns in another sphere.</p>

<p>I represent a constituency of which the voters are predominantly factory workers. I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister and wish him everything of the best on behalf of those voters. They are convinced that the right man was appointed at the right time. We wish the hon. the Minister well for the task which lies ahead.</p>

<p>Hon. members said many interesting things. They spoke about the Black man, the Black labourer, productivity and the so-called &#x201C;wage gap&#x201D;. I immediately want to point out that these are important matters and add that the Government realize that the non-White labour question in South Africa is a difficult one, but that the Government&#x2014;we in these benches&#x2014;are doing our utmost to comply with the requirements of the Black labourer as well. Apparently the impression has been created that the Government is doing nothing for the Black labourer. No, a great deal is being done and I shall return to this later.</p>

<p>Very little has been said about White labour, about the White factory worker. I trust that during the course of the debate we shall also hear a plea on the part of the Opposition in favour of the White labourer, the White factory worker. We must never lose sight of the fact that these people also have needs in our civilization. It is the duty of the Government to protect White identity and pride at all times. The White labourer, the White worker today constitutes the most valuable means of production in the South African economy and at all times we must strive towards developing and utilizing his talents and abilities to their utmost. The White man as a great responsibility and we appreciate this.</p>

<p>If one looks at the world, one realizes that one of the greatest challenges in the whole world is not technical or financial implications, but it is largely the problem of human relations, and to be more specific, labour relations. In South Africa we have peace and order in the labour sphere and we are grateful that the Government brings about peace and order, because no country in the world can afford to have unrest and problems in the sphere of labour relations.</p>

<p>As I have already pointed out, the Government realizes that the Black worker&#x2014;this is what I want to discuss&#x2014;also has a great task and responsibility in our labour set-up. I should like to quote from the <i>Suid-Afrikaanse Werker</i> of March/April this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Slegs &#x2019;n snel groeiende ekonomie kan werkgeleenthede verskaf en dus &#x2019;n bestaan bied aan die duisende mans en vrouens wat as gevolg van die bevolkingsontploffing jaarliks op die Suid-Afrikaanse arbeidsmark kom.</block>

<block name="quote">Die werklike posisie vir werkgeleentheid is besonder bemoedigend vir die land se Swartes. Die jongste syfers wat deur die Departement van Statistiek bekendgemaak is, toon dat vir elke Blanke wat gedurende die afgelope tien jaar in die ses grootste werkkategorie&#x00EB; in diens geneem is, ses Swartes werk gekry het.</block>

<block name="quote">In die dekade het die totale indiensneming van alle bevolkingsgroepe met 741 000 gestyg tot die rekordgetal van 2,8 miljoen &#x2026; en Swartes met 480 000 tot 1,8 miljoen.</block>

<p>Figures prove the great responsibility the Government has towards the Black labourer.</p>

<p>Reference has also been made to the worker. I immediately want to say that it is not only the Government which has a duty in this respect, but the Black labourer as well. If the Black labourer wants to earn more, he will have to realize that he simply will have to work more and work harder. He also has a responsibility in this connection. A great deal has been said about productivity and about &#x201C;closing the wage gap&#x201D;. We are in favour of this, but the figures I have here, are alarming and therefore I want to emphasize even more that a large responsibility also rests upon the non-White labourer himself. The annual increase in remuneration to Black male unskilled labourers increased from 7% in 1972 to 18% in 1973, 28% in 1974 and 22% in 1975 while the labour productivity, excluding agriculture, amounted to only 2,3% in 1973 and increased by 3,9% in 1974. I should like to quote from the magazine <i>People and Profits</i> in which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Affairs, Mr. Cruywagen, is quoted as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is die plig van elke werkgewer om vas te stel wat die behoeftes van sy Swart werkers is en om hulle lone aan te pas sodat <span class="col_9103-9104" refersTo="page_0462"/>hulle minstens hul minimum gesins-en gemeenskapsverpligtinge kan nakom. Maar haastige en ondeurdagte verhoging van alle werkers se lone is nie die hele oplossing nie. Vergoeding vir werk wat verrig is, is natuurlik &#x2019;n aanvaarde economies beginsel, maar wanneer die minimum loon die economies waarde, vir die werkgewer, van die werk wat verrig word, oorskry, gaan die werkgeleentheid noodwendig ophou om te bestaan.</block>

<p>These are true words. The article in question goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Ek moet dit weer beklemtoon,&#x201D; het Cruywagen ges&#x00EA;, &#x201C;dat, hoewel werkers se lone deur politieke en sosiale oorweging be&#x00EF;nvloed word, werkgewers in gedagte moet hou dat lone altyd in ooreenstemming met die waarde van die arbeid wat verskaf word en die produktiwiteit van die werker moet bly. Loonsverhogings moet altyd sorgvuldig oorweeg word, want as lone buite alle verhouding tot die waarde van die werk of die produktiwiteit betaal word, kan dit die ekonomie benadeel.&#x201D;</block>

<p>These are important words. The Government is doing everything in its power to increase productivity. I should like to refer hon. members to the tax concessions which were granted in this connection. If one looks at section 11 <i>sept</i> of the Income Tax Act of 1962, one sees that in practice it amounts to the fact that in the case of a company undertaking such training, 82% of the training costs are subsidized and that the actual costs therefore amount to only 18% of the total costs incurred. Any industrialist who is prepared to have his non-White labourers trained, is entitled to this concession. Tribute should also be paid on the part of the Government to the various in-service training centres which have been established for Bantu.</p>

<p>In this connection there is not only an obligation on the part of the Government or on the part of the worker himself, but also upon the employer towards the non-White labourer whom he employs. I should like to quote from &#x201C;Die Benutting van Nieblanke Arbeid&#x201D;, a study undertaken at the University of the Orange Free State by Van Breda and Langenhoven. They have the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die inherente geaardheid en die tot nog toe noue bande met die stamlewe het die manlike Bantoe se uitkyk op werk as sulks in &#x2019;n vorm gegiet wat verskil van di&#x00E9; van die Blanke en van dit wat die Westerse beskawing van hom eis. &#x2019;n Proses van aanpassing en herskommeling van gevestigde gewoonte patrone word dus van hom ge&#x00EB;is.</block>

<p>Every employer must make a thorough study of the tribal traditions of the Bantu which will include his customs, Bantu law as well as the personal outlook on life of the various ethnic groups. The Bantu all differ from one another. A Bantu is a strange person, Sir; he always clings to his tribal traditions, and if an employer does not consider these matters concerning a labourer, he will not understand him, and he will not be able to get the maximum productivity from that employee. That employee must be understood; the employer must know the heart-beat of his employee. I am convinced that should greater efficiency be brought about, it will compensate for the actual training of the Black labourers over and over again. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one naturally does not mind being attacked for one&#x2019;s standpoint during any debate but one at least hopes that one&#x2019;s standpoint will be correctly expounded. During labour debate afer labour debate we have struggled with exactly the same misrepresentations about the UP&#x2019;s standpoint. I do not want to say now that hon. members are doing this deliberately, Sir, but really, these misrepresentations of the facts with respect to our standpoint are not conducive to the debate. This debate concerns an extremely important matter. What happened here this morning? The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark spoke for 20 minutes and raised extremely contentious matters, and now he is nowhere to be seen. In any event, what he said, is probably said by most of the speakers on the other side who are going to participate in this debate. What was his first point? He said we wanted to abolish influx control.</p>

<p>It has been put to this hon. House countless times that this is not the standpoint of the UP at all. After all, this is the brainchild of the UP. If the hon. member <span class="col_9105-9106" refersTo="page_0463"/>persists in that standpoint, we are at cross purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not have time to answer questions now. Influx control is a measure which was introduced by the UP, and we have never said that it must be done away with. What we did say, is that job reservation should be done away with. We said this repeatedly for the simple reason that it has no sense at all and no socio-economic value in South Africa. The tragedy of the matter&#x2014;and everyone agrees with me on this&#x2014;is that job reservation has become a label which does not do the name of South Africa any good. Since this is so, and since we are all speaking in the interests of South Africa here, we simply say this: Do away with it. We shall lose nothing by doing so. The Whites will not succumb. All that will happen is that South Africa&#x2019;s good name will be restored in one sphere at least.</p>

<p>But what did the hon. member for Springs have to say? He said that we want to force trade unions down the throats of the labourers. Sir, who has ever alleged this? Even if this were possible&#x2014;and I do not think it is&#x2014;the hon. member is basing his whole argument on this wrong premise. How can one argue upon that basis? What we say, is that there are already a few dozen trade unions to which thousands of Black labourers belong.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>My information is that it is approximately 50 000 but I know that no one can tell me this. Now I want to know how many Black trade unions there are. I am not referring to trade unions which are accepted in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act. How many Black trade unions already exist, and how many member belong to those trade unions? We say that we are dealing with a fact here, and the question which occurs to me, is the following: We must either abolish these trade unions or bring about a situation in which this developing phenomenon in the labour sphere in South Africa can be controlled in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act. This is our standpoint.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Overvaal levelled the same accusation. He said that we create the impression that nothing is being done for the Blacks: Who has ever alleged this? The hon. member went further and suggested that in this connection there is a great responsibility and obligation upon the Blacks. I now want to ask the hon. member what he will do if a Black man comes to him and asks for vocational training?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>He will get it, as you know.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member will tell him that he cannot get it because he is in White South Africa. The hon. member may perhaps tell him to undergo vocational training in his own homeland, where the Blacks know that there is no labour available to them. [Interjections.] Who has the opportunities there? The Blacks ask for the opportunities but there is nobody who wants to give it to them. To return to the reality of the situation, I should like to quote to hon. members a passage from <i>Volkshandel</i> of April 1976. I do not even have to deal with the testimony of this book. I quote the following from page 13&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die taak om die Swartman in Wit gebied, in eie belang, op die pad van samewerking te lei, is groot en die tyd is kort.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow said this and it is also the first statement I want to make in this connection. On the same page the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Swartes het verdriedubbel in die stede van 2 miljoen in 1948 met die NP se bewindsaanvaarding tot sowat 6 miljoen tans.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] I do not want to make a mockery of this statement, because it is simply economic development which has taken place and these people are here. This is a fact and we can all accept it for the purposes of this debate. Allow me to read the following extract&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die economies integrasie &#x2026;</block>

<p>We have argued about this term for years. The NP said that such a thing does not exist, but now <i>Volkshandel</i> comes along and says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_9107-9108" refersTo="page_0464"/>Die ekonomiese integrasie van die Swartman is onvermydelik en onkeerbaar indien work en welvaart geskep en gehandhaaf wil word. Die gevaar moet very word dat werkloosheid, in besonder in Blanke gebied, kommunistiese teelaarde skep.</block>

<p>Now hon. members must listen carefully because the following is important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die klein bo-bou Blankes bo-op die arbeidspiramide word steeds relatief kleiner teenoor die onderhou met &#x2019;n bre&#x00EB; Swart fondament.</block>

<p>Here we are dealing with facts which are often denied.</p>

<p>I should now like to raise a few matters in this connection. As has been said by the hon. member for Pinelands, labour is indivisible and to me this is the prime requirement, i.e. that the hon. the Minister of Labour should be in control of the overall labour situation in South Africa. If I want to know how many mechanics are being trained at the institute for Coloured mechanics in Bellville, I do not want to approach the Department of Coloured Affairs to ascertain this. In my humble opinion it is the duty of the hon. the Minister of Labour to have a finger upon every labour facet in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Your opinion does not count at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course: that hon. member&#x2019;s opinion counts even less, but I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p>The second point which flows from this statement made by <i>Volkshandel</i> is that the moment one accepts that economic integration is irrevocably the order of the day, it is said that the Bantu are here to stay. This necessarily means improved training and improved accommodation for him, as well as all the other social facilities. This also means labour organization for him, because one cannot bring about a state of affairs in South Africa in which people are being trained for ever higher posts with ever higher salaries, unless facilities are offered to them which are commensurate with those incomes. I do not even want to discuss politics, but want to confine myself exclusively to the economic aspect of the matter. Should the Government do this and should we have a state of affairs where the Black worker in White South Africa were to become more and more sophisticated, we would also have to create a situation in which there is no difference between the labour organization of the Whites and the labour organization of the Blacks. The same pattern will simply have to be affected.</p>

<p>Although I support the standpoint of my hon. friend for Hillbrow, namely that the liaison committees and works committees offer an excellent transitional stage, it is no use our staring ourselves blind on the fact that we have a final answer to this. We shall have to think ahead, because we realize that a situation is going to develop where the White labourer and the Black labourer will appear on the same labour scene, a situation in which they are going to have the same feelings, the same approach to life, the same facilities and the same training. They will necessarily have to be given the same kind of organization. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Maitland, on behalf of the UP, has taken up a standpoint in respect of job reservation. In the course of my speech I want to state the standpoint of this side of the House in contrast to this. Up to now we have listened to the criticism of the hon. members for Hillbrow, Maitland and Pinelands. The hon. members may criticize the labour policy of the NP until the cows come home. The fact of the matter is that the interests of the workers in South Africa, White and non-White, have always been of primary importance to the NP. The record of the NP since 1948 is irrefutable proof of the fact that the party has in fact looked after the interests of the White worker as well as the interests of the non-White worker in South Africa. What a unique achievement this is for South Africa, seen in the light of the labour set-up in this country! Many countries in the world envy South Africa because, despite our labour set-up, we have had peace and quiet and order in the labour sphere in South Africa under the NP Government.</p>

<p>Hon. members also referred to wage adjustments today. In this regard, too, I believe South Africa&#x2019;s is a unique achievement. I can prove this in no better way than to quote briefly from what the former Minister of <span class="col_9109-9110" refersTo="page_0465"/>Labour said. I quote from col. 4958 of Hansard, 28 April 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Up to 1970 the annual increases in wages in the case of Whites exceeded those of Coloureds and Bantu. However, in 1971, as a result of the attitude of this Government, that ratio pattern was changed. In 1971 the Whites received an increase of 11,5% and the Blacks an increase of 12,3%.</block>

<p>But what is significant, is that we find that the Whites, as a result of the policy of the Government, received an increase of 8,7% in 1974 as against an increase of 28,5% received by the Blacks. This is clear proof of the fact that the Government is making a sincere attempt to narrow the so-called wage gap in South Africa. I want to say, so as to state the standpoint of the Government consistently and clearly, that it has always been the policy, of the NP to eliminate racial friction in South Africa. I want to ask hon. members on the opposite side to say whether or not they support the attempt of the NP Government. If they do not want to tell me this now, the next opposition speaker may do so.</p>

<p>I say once again that we are eliminating racial friction in South Africa and that we are restricting the mixing of Whites and Blacks in trade unions. I want to put it very clearly that this is the unequivocal standpoint of this side of the House, and I should like to know what the reaction of hon. members opposite is to this. I should like to know what the standpoint of hon. members opposite is in respect of the practice of placing the management of mixed trade unions in White hands and in respect of imposing a prohibition on the appointment of Bantu to industrial councils and conciliation boards.</p>

<p>Provision has been made in the Factories Act and in the Shops and Offices Act for the various races to be separated at their places of employment. Now what is the standpoint of hon. members on the opposite side, as clearly stated by the hon. member for Maitland? I quote very briefly from a speech by the hon. member for Hillbrow of April 1975 (Hansard, col. 491, 28 April 1975)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What we want to advance as our main theme is this particular debate is that the Government&#x2019;s labour policy has come to the end of the road &#x2026;</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member why he said this. I shall tell hon. members why the hon. member said this. The reason is to have increased Black employment which will result in Black workers being assimilated with Whites at all levels. I want to ask the hon. member: Does he agree with this?</p>

<p>I also want to quote what the hon. member for Maitland said on 28 April 1975. (Hansard, col. 4921)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Work reservation is one of the concepts which has no value other than propaganda value in South Africa today. Work reservation is one of the terms which has made us the polecat in the eyes of overseas countries.</block>

<p>Now I want to come to the hon. member for South Coast, and in referring to him I just want to say that we are very good friends, because he is an ex-resident of Welkom. While he was living in Welkom, however, he was under my wing. At that time he was still on the right road but the day he crossed the Drakensberg&#x2014;I am sorry to say this&#x2014;he went completely astray. What does he say?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Werkreservering beskerm alleen die lui Witman in Suid-Afrika.&#x201D;</block>

<p>What a scandalous remark, Sir! The latest phenomenal development under the National Government, is that the unemployment rate in South Africa is a mere 0,6%. This situation will therefore be a good breeding ground for the integration plans of the UP. Years ago, we know, the United Party pinned its hopes to come into power on unemployment which did not exist. With job reservation out of the way, and with the UP&#x2019;s battlecry of full employment, its integration plans in the sphere of labour and elsewhere will be given substance. After all, we know that the UP has irrevocably taken up the standpoint that we must utilize all our available sources of labour. If not, according to the hon. member for Hillbrow, South Africa will go to rack and ruin. Now I want to ask you, Sir, what is behind this unfounded allegation? One thing only and that is to persuade the Government to throw open the doors and sluice-gates to uncontrolled Black labour in our White areas. This is the fact of the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow spoke about the lack of training for our Whites and <span class="col_9111-9112" refersTo="page_0466"/>non-Whites. Unfortunately I do not have time to dwell on this for any length of time, but I shall simply furnish a few figures. In 1946 there were 65 000 White students&#x2014;expressed in round figures&#x2014;in South Africa. In 1965 they numbered 102 000. The number of indentured apprentices increased over the past ten years from 28 000 to 36 000. Since 1948 the number of industrial workers has increased from 115 000 to 373 000. The number of non-White workers has increased as well, but what is of cardinal importance in terms of the policy and standpoint of this Government, is that between 1965 and 1976 the percentage of Bantu in our factories has increased from 53,2 to 54,38 only. I can quote further figures in this regard, but unfortunately my time has virtually expired. I want to put it very clearly that the NP has never hesitated to put its policy relating to the employment of non-Whites honestly and frankly to the Whites of South Africa. We reaffirm&#x2014;and I want to state this here today&#x2014;that it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to protect the White worker, because the White worker with his high standard of living is, indeed entitled to such protection. The Government relentlessly maintains four basic requirements which I want to mention in brief outline. They are that a White may not be replaced by a non-White, that the White may not work shoulder to shoulder in the same employment circumstances with a non-White, that a White shall not work under the authority of a non-White and that a White may not become involved in mixed trade unions. The labour policy of the NP has been determined by congress resolutions from year to year. Our labour policy has been determined since 1948 from one election to the next; time without number &#x2026; [Interjections.] If the present labour policy of this National Government has to be changed, it can only be done by means of the ballot box and I want to assure you that I believe that this will not happen for many years to come. The UP on the other hand, and the phenomenon of these hon. members who are sitting very close to me over here&#x2014;perhaps too close&#x2014;is that the PRP want to try and sweep away all restrictions imposed in South Africa with a view to maintaining order. I believe that these hon. members to my right and those hon. members who are sitting there are simply allergic to order in South Africa.</p>

<p>The NP will continue to implement its labour policy. This is the undertaking of the NP to the White workers of South Africa. This is the NP&#x2019;s undertaking to the Black workers of South Africa, and in this regard we are prepared to fight to the bitter end.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one&#x2019;s life is chiefly&#x2014;indeed, almost exclusively&#x2014;taken up by four things, viz. working, eating, sleeping and relaxing. A year consists of 8 760 hours, or 365 days. Of these 8 760 hours 730 hours, or 30&#x00BD; days, i.e. one months in a year, is taken up by eating. This represents 8% of the year. Of the 8 760 hours in a year, 2 537 hours, or 3&#x00BD; months, are devoted to relaxation. This represents 29% of the year. Of the 365 days, or 8 760 hours, 3 285 hours, i.e. 4&#x00BD; months, are devoted to sleeping. This represents 37% of one&#x2019;s time. I now come to the most important activity in the 8 760 hours, namely that only 2 208 hours of the years are devoted to working. This is equal to 92 days of 24 hours each. This is equal to 3 months and 2 days in a year and represents 26% of the year.</p>

<p>A person who works from the age of 20 up to the age of 60, will be in employment for a period of 40 years. These 40 years consist of 14 600 days, of which he spends 1 168 days, or 3&#x00BC; years, in eating, and 14,8 years in sleeping. This man may perhaps work himself to death, because 40 working years is a long time. It consists of 14 600 days, or 350 400 hours. Therefore he also has to relax. If the working man relaxes from 5 o&#x2019;clock to 9 o&#x2019;clock in the evening, as well as on Saturdays and Sundays, and his annual leave as well as public holidays are added to this, he will relax for 11&#x00BD; of the 40 years. Of the 40 years 26%, i.e. 10,4 years, is spent in working.</p>

<p>I am not going to say that our people work too little, that the 10,4 years out 40 years are too few. Nor am I going to say that our people eat too much, or that they sleep too much, or relax too much. However, I do want to say: Let our people work with the gusto with which they eat; let our people work with the pleasure with which they go to sleep, and let us work with the enthusiasm with which we relax. If we do this, there will be no need for us to call for a longer working week, because the man who works five days a week and is dutiful, enthusiastic and dedicated in his work, does a great deal more than he who loafs at work for seven days.</p>

<p><span class="col_9113-9114" refersTo="page_0467"/>I want to express the hope today that in the economic situation prevailing in South Africa and the world today, a new spirit will develop between the employer and the employee, something which cannot be laid down in legislation. That something is a mutual trust and loyalty between employer and employee. The employer of the employee who gives of his best, will look after him because he will realize that he cannot lose a good worker. I do not say these things without reason, because there is reason for concern and reason for serious concern in South Africa. A very knowledgeable man, an authority on economies and labour affairs recently said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ontledings het aangedui dat Suid-Afrika se produktiwiteit baie ongustig vergelyk met ander lande in die w&#x00EA;reld.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>It is not the Government&#x2019;s fault. It is due to the lack of productivity and labour achievement amongst our workers. These must increase. This man went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In sektore soos klerasie, skoeisel, hout, meubels, metaalprodukte en masjinerie het dit seifs gedaal. Lae produktiwiteit is &#x2019;n groot struikelblok in Suid-Afrika se poging om ekonomiese stabiliteit te herwin. Dit lei tot prysstygings, dit verlaat die lewenstandaard en help inflasie aan. Daar is ook bevestig dat die gemiddelde lone gedurende die vier jaar 1970 tot 1974 vinniger gestyg het as die gemiddelde verbruikersprysindeks en veel vinniger as arbeidsproduktiwiteit. Indien inflasie effektief bekamp gaan word, sal loon-en salarisaanpassings meer tred moet hou met werkprestasies. Lone en salarisse is meestal die grootste kostefaktor in die produksie van dienste en goedere. Daar is heelwat fabrieke in SuidAfrika waar die kapitaal per werker min of meer dieselfde is as in gevestigde ge&#x00EF;ndustrialiseerde lande, maar waar die produktiwiteit per werker laer is as in daardie lande.</block>

<p>Therefore I want to sound this warning; our authorities as well as our employers should guard against unrealistic wage increases, wage increases which outstrip the contribution made by the workers. No employee can expect his employer to remain in business if he, the worker, demands more from the business, than he, the worker, is prepared to put back into it by means of productivity and work achievement. If he loafs at work, the spark which must provide the fire for the machine will become weaker and weaker until the machine eventually stops. This will not be good for anyone, not for the employer, not for the employee, nor for the State. If workers demand unrealistic wage increases, employers will have to mechanize and automatize as much as possible. In this way the worker is going to price himself out of employment. I therefore want to address an appeal to labour leaders to act in a responsible manner and, in the first place, to realize that their objective should be full employment for their people and not an unrealistic wage for certain people which may result in unemployment for others. Full employment and a reasonable wage for everyone must be the motto.</p>

<p>If we compare our position with that in the rest of the world, we have every reason to be grateful. We can say to our Black workers: Compare your position with that of your brothers in Africa, and you will realize that in comparison with many of them you are at the fleshpots of Egypt. We should like to provide employment for as many Blacks as possible, but as a result of unrealistically high wages mechanization will take the place of many Black workers. Therefore, our objective must be full employment at a realistic wage, rather than high wages with half employment. I am not alone in holding this view. From an American from Washington we have the warning that unrealistic pressure to effect drastic increases to the wages of Black workers in South Africa, will give rise to unemployment, not only in South Africa, but also in other countries of Africa.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to convey my wishes and the wishes of the people in my constituency, of whom many are workers, to the hon. the Minister and say that we are confident that he will make as great a success of this portfolio as he made of the Water Affairs portfolio. Our good wishes accompany him.</p>

<from><span class="col_9115-9116" refersTo="page_0468"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we agree wholeheartedly, of course, with a great deal of what the hon. member for Meyerton has said. He was the first one to show a realistic approach to our problems. I do not agree, however, with his feeling that the Black people should compare their position here in South Africa to that of the Black people in the rest of Africa. They should rather compare their productivity to that of the Whites. In that way they will be able to increase their productivity.</p>

<p>I should just like to say how surprised and disappointed I was about the speech of the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark. As a man with a wide knowledge and experience of labour activities in South Africa he has really said nothing positive today. Most of his allegations about what the hon. member for Hillbrow had said were not true, and the allegations of the hon. member for Welkom were not true either.</p>

<p>However, I should like to stress what the hon. member for Meyerton said. He said that productivity was hampered by working hours, and he was quite correct. My productivity, too, is greatly hampered by time in this speech. Therefore I am unable to reply fully to all the allegations hon. members have made.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I am perfectly right in saying, however, that job reservation protects the lazy White man, and I will not withdraw that statement under any circumstances. Job reservation protects the lazy White man in the sense that he will not work harder&#x2014;in fact, he will not work at all&#x2014;because he knows he cannot be fired. It is not because he is a White man but because he is protected by his colour. All the hon. members in this House know how the White men work in the garages to which they take their motorcars. They know who does the actual work on their motorcars. It is therefore untrue to say there is no protection for the lazy White man. Apart from the lazy White man, job reservation also protects a certain evil in the industry. White employers are exploiting the Black man because of job reservation.</p>

<p>I now want to come to our new hon. Minister. We have the greatest hope and faith in our new hon. Minister who has proved himself so capable in his previous portfolios. He has made himself highly competent and has fully informed himself of the problems relating to irrigation and forestry in South Africa, and I am sure he is going to do the same in this new department of his. We therefore look to him with great hope and faith.</p>

<p>I do not want to speak disrespectfully of absent friends, so I will not refer to the past. I do hope, however, that the new hon. Minister will not simply be satisfied with playing Nelson and turn a blind eye to infringements of job reservation legislation. I hope he will rather try to amend&#x2014;or better still repeal&#x2014;this legislation which is regarded by many as stupid and unnecessary. Notwithstanding news reports to the effect that the hon. the Minister is opposed to the removal of job reservation, I am sure he will change his attitude in time.</p>

<p>I just want to quote briefly from <i>Public Opinion,</i> a paper published many years ago, probably even before the hon. the Minister was born. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Organized (building) labour in South Africa has tried by restrictive legislation and arbitrary regulations to confine the Coloured races to the field of unskilled labour &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is in the building industry. The report goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but already the pure Native is following here upon the heels of the Coloured man.</block>

<p>This was printed on 16 January 1914. One can see that the trend was to keep manual labour in the building industry for the Coloured man, but that policy has failed completely because the Black man has been moved upwards. Now in the building industry we are trying to keep manual labour jobs for the Black man, but in the same way that policy is doomed to failure because economic circumstances demand a change. Now we are simply trying to limit the Black man, instead of the Coloured man, to unskilled work. I know the hon. the Minister will say that the Blacks do work in their own areas, and also do certain jobs in White areas by exemption. Although the trade unions claim to protect the White worker, however, the Blacks are doing more and more work. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark says that any changes in connection with labour are done in consultation with the White trade unions. If he has such great faith that the White trade unions will protect the White worker, why is it <span class="col_9117-9118" refersTo="page_0469"/>necessary to retain job reservation? We have the greatest faith in the trade unions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before the suspension of proceedings I told the hon. the Minister that I should like to tell him why I thought that job reservation protected an evil and I should now like to continue. First of all, notwithstanding job reservation, I am certain that no hon. member here can argue that he has not seen job reservation being more observed in the breach thereof than in its implementation. For instance, on any building site one can see Black people laying bricks, plastering, installing doors, pulling up comers, doing brick work, laying conduits, working with reinforced steel and so on without anything being done about it. Somebody has said that legislation usually trails behind facts to the extent of about two years, but we have all taken advantage of this. Not one of us in this House has not at some time or other taken advantage of this and has not used Blacks to do a little plastering, brick laying or similar jobs because we find it cheaper to have a Black man doing those jobs. Furthermore, we also had those jobs done immediately without having had to wait some time. I therefore say that blind eyes are being turned all the time except perhaps on non-residential buildings or on work constructed by the Department of Public Works because they can afford to pay more to have the work done by Whites. On all other sites and even on the occasional Department of Public Works site have I from time to time seen that job reservation is not being observed. I have no complaint about this, but this illegality&#x2014;I say this advisdedly since of late I have not seen any prosecutions because of the breaking of job reservation regulations or because of exploiting&#x2014;gives rise to employers exploiting Blacks.</p>

<p>When one can get a Black man to do the job of a White man, one does not have to pay him the same rate of pay. On the other hand, the Black man cannot object because he is doing a job that he is not supposed to do. Therefore hundreds of employers are exploiting the Blacks today. They are not employing Whites, but they are exploiting the Blacks because they pay the Blacks less than they should pay them. Employers are profiteering.</p>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>This is why I say that job reservation is not fulfilling a need and should be scrapped immediately. It has been said that job reservation is necessary in order to protect the White man, but the hon. the Minister cannot advance that argument any more, since it is becoming more and more obvious that we cannot get White people to enter into the building industry. In 1973, for instance, out of approximately 1 600 applications for apprenticeships in the building industry, only 600 were from White youths. Since 1973 the number of applications received from Whites has dropped each year. The obvious role of the Whites in the building industry is that of supervisor or manager. Mr. Lindeque, Secretary for Labour, said a year ago that a fund had been established especially to guarantee the future of the White worker in the building industry. The White&#x2019;s future, he said, should lie in supervisory or managerial work. The Master Builders&#x2019; Association started a course for this very purpose&#x2014;they wanted to train Whites to become supervisors and managers&#x2014;but notwithstanding the wonderful pay they offered during the training period&#x2014;a successful applicant undergoes this extensive training over seven months&#x2014;they could not get a sufficient number of applicants and after the first course the whole scheme collapsed. There were not enough Whites interested to enroll for this course. I may point out that the members of the Master Builders&#x2019; Association were prepared to contribute by way of a levy towards defraying the costs involved with such a course.</p>

<p>What is more, more and more Whites are leaving the building industry. We find this particularly today as a result of the recession in the building industry, a recession largely caused by Government policy. However, we are not supposed to discuss this at the moment. All these people are leaving the industry and I doubt whether they will ever come back. Once a man has found a job outside the building industry, he is not going to come back to an industry which is plagued by recessions and subject to bad weather and adverse working conditions. Therefore, those people who have <span class="col_9119-9120" refersTo="page_0470"/>left the industry will stick where they are and we will find less and less Whites who are prepared to come in to the building industry.

<p>If the hon. member for South Coast thinks that I am going to support his argument about work reservation, he is making a big mistake, especially if he says that work reservation is only there to protect the lazy White man. Work reservation is there to guarantee the prosperity and progress of all our people in South Africa. By applying work reservation, the Government regulates labour in an orderly manner and develops it in an evolutionary manner in order to maintain the peace which exists in the labour and industrial spheres. The hon. member simply has to look at history.</p>

<p>These days, everybody is talking and complaining about the problem of inflation with which we are faced. Inflation cannot only be solved by action on the part of the Government. This would be an impossible task for any Government, especially under a democratic system, to solve inflation by its own action. Every citizen, White, Black and Coloured, must make his contribution. Every citizen in South Africa will have to make his sacrifices in order to solve this problem. There are many ways in which it can be solved. I only want to refer to a few which concern labour. All of us realize that it is a great privilege to be able to work and to be allowed to work. I do not expect the younger generation to understand this, because it has been decades, especially under this Government, since we have experienced anything like unemployment in South Africa. It is true that the increase in the production of our manpower in South Africa is amongst the lowest in the world, but if we do away with work reservation, it will be even lower. For the promotion of productivity, peace in the industrial and labour spheres as well as healthy co-operation and interaction between labour and capital, is essential. I am of the opinion that there should be a far more intimate understanding between labour and capital.</p>

<p>As far as the employer is concerned, better and more effective training should be provided. In this connection we are faced with a problem&#x2014;I do not know why hon. members of the Opposition have not yet referred to it. I am referring to the industrial training of the Whites in South Africa, which leaves much to be desired. On page 19 of the latest annual report of the Department of Labour, mention is made of the fact that of the total number of apprentices tested at Olifantsfontein, only 3 941 passed in 1972, 4 275 in 1973 and 4 688 in 1974. Expressed as a percentage, 42,61% passed in 1972, 43,79% in 1973 and 42,64% in 1974. After I had received certain complaints, I went to discuss the matter with the authorities concerned. I was informed that these apprentices do not fail because they are stupid, but because they are not placed in the work for which they want to be trained and also because they do not receive the necessary training. After complaints had been lodged with various large business concerns, however, the position did improve. There must also be better utilization and more effective application of labour and there must be an appreciation of labour.</p>

<p>The employee himself must do his work more effectively, he must work harder and must be compelled to work for longer hours. I said that capital and labour should co-operate in order to serve the country in the economic sphere. Furthermore, workers should change their jobs less often, because it takes time and money to train people. Furthermore, the worker in South Africa should not demand a higher wage than that which he really deserves.</p>

<p>South Africa asks every inhabitant and every citizen to discipline himself, so that he can work for the welfare of himself and of his country and its people. As I said, he ought to work harder and even for longer hours. Great powers and mighty kingdoms have perished as a result of indolence. Here I am thinking of one of the most powerful empires which the world has ever known, namely the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire came to its downfall and destruction as a result of indolence. The slaves looked after the children while the citizens of the country visited the arenas. They indulged in sport more than they were interested in work. Indolence eventually <span class="col_9121-9122" refersTo="page_0471"/>leads to suffering. We in South Africa&#x2014;and when I say this, I mean all the inhabitants of South Africa&#x2014;will have to reflect very seriously about the 4&#x00BD;-day working week in some sectors. In the annual report we find that the total number of persons employed in factories alone amount to 1 598 076. If all these people only work 4&#x00BD;days, the country is losing an immense number of man-hours. We cannot afford these unrealistic luxuries, and in these times we may not allow it ourselves.</p>

<p>Apart from the man-hours which have been lost, we also have increased spending, because every weekend is turned into a long weekend, and together with these long weekends, we have various problems in connection with the spending of leisure time. For instance, people travel unnecessarily by car to remote places. One simply has to look at the traffic on our roads in order to realize this. I am especially referring to a 4&#x00BD;-day working week, because I believe that there is not one hon. member in this House who has not yet noticed that in many sectors one has many people who no longer work on Friday afternoons. One does not have to go any further than having a house built in order to realize this. After lunch time on Friday one simply does not see these people at work any longer. I realize that there are people in some sectors who work six days and even seven days per week, but I say nevertheless that the time has arrived for all of us to think about working harder and for longer hours. We shall also have to think very seriously about considering Saturday morning a working day once again. Hon. members know that in the past people were rather sluggish on Saturday mornings. Once that same feeling is transferred to Friday afternoons, I think that we are losing valuable man-hours. I therefore want to make a very earnest plea to managements as well as workers to consider returning to the position as it was in the past when Saturdays were working days.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in congratulating the new Minister of Labour on assuming office, I should like to say that I hope he pays some attention to the very constructive and, I think, most objective address of the hon. member for Hillbrow, who spoke first in this debate. I make bold to say, Sir, that the hon. member divorced this matter entirely from the political field. Particularly in a year which I think is an entirely different year from what has been our experience in past years, I think we have to approach the whole question of labour from a completely fresh point of view. We should not be haunted by some of the ills, slogans and adages of the past. I should like to add one point to what the hon. member for South Coast said with regard to job reservation. Just recently, the managing director of Iscor, Mr. Coetzee, himself stated at a congress of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut that the days of overall job protection for Whites were past. I think that contains a great deal of common sense and a great deal of import of which the hon. the Minister should take note.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I have read a great deal of his speech and I know what appeal he has made to the trade unions. Our main concern in South Africa today is industrial peace, because we are facing an entirely new industrial picture in our country. According to the survey that was made at the end of 1973, we are dependent on Black labour to the extend of 56,6% of our labour force. It has probably since increased by another 10% to 15%. I think the hon. the Minister must be aware of the importance of paying attention to this entirely new picture in the whole of the South African economy. I think that the very fine record of industrial peace which we have maintained over the years, has had certain ripples during the last year or two. Although we shall overcome them, I think we must take serious notice of them. We are aware of the fact that the hon. the Minister intends bringing a Bill to the House in order to amend the Bantu Labour Regulation Act. The Bill has been in circulation amongst various persons and various organizations for their comment. It has been spelt out, in clear detail, by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor in an address to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council in September of last year. Therefore we more or less have some idea of what the hon. the Minister has in mind. Secondly, we are also conscious of the provisions that have been made for in-service training.</p>

<p>I feel we must take note of what is happening in our labour society today. Our whole economic structure has taken enormous <span class="col_9123-9124" refersTo="page_0472"/>strides during the last decade or two. The economy has modernized itself in every field, even in respect of the most menial occupations. In my opinion, this requires us to improve and modernize our labour relationship with all workers, more particularly the Black workers, and to have an entirely different concept of the training and skills that are required to adapt ourselves to a more modem stage of the economy. I too regret the fact that the hon. the Minister has given utterances and assurances to a certain section of organized labour. Therefore I feel that in his reply to this debate, the hon. the Minister is in duty bound to make a statement to this House regarding his policy. As mentioned, a new institute for industrial relations was recently born to enable management and labour to find a common forum to exchange their thoughts and to expand opportunities for communication and co-operation. They will find many opportunities to assist both participating forces, to learn and to understand the various aspects of conciliation in consultation with each other. One can only hope that all sections of labour&#x2014;I underline the term &#x201C;all&#x201D;&#x2014;will eventually be encompassed within the purview and scope of the activity of this institute.</p>

<p>I should like to refer the hon. the Minister to another interesting research that took place regarding the question of productivity of Black workers in South Africa. This was undertaken by Prof. Open of the Cape Town University. He states, amongst other things, that the answer lies not only in raising wages&#x2014;which is, of course, a very laudable purpose&#x2014;but it also calls for a planned form of action which is to be embarked upon almost immediately. One of the few issues he raises is improving the poorest Black worker&#x2019;s wages to above subsistence level, regardless of his productivity&#x2014;in other words, to bring it to a minimum subsistence level. I have pleaded for this during past years. He also advocates equal pay for equal work and responsibility in respect of all professionals and technically qualified workers. I think the hon. the Minister must pay attention to this step immediately. He also proposes a narrowing of the wage gap by judicious increases at all levels, raising the standard of productivity, not only by in-service training and other methods, but also by training which will raise the skills and efficiency of Black workers, leading to their qualification as skilled workers. To stress that point, I should like to say that it is accepted that at the moment we are short of 20 000 or more skilled labourers in our various skilled trades and undertakings. It is being projected by experts, of whom the hon. the Minister cannot fail to take notice, that the greatest shortage in the future in this country is going to be skilled labour. We have the most remarkable pool of labour available, and I think the time has come for us to get away from the attitude of not wanting to train Black people to be skilled workers. Whether we use the apprenticeship system or the system of technical training colleges&#x2014;whatever method we use&#x2014;it has become vitally important that we must train the Black worker to the stage of a skilled worker and no longer satisfy ourselves with what we call the semi-skilled or operating type of worker.</p>

<p>He also needs better opportunities, and this follows on the research work that has been done for wage negotiation and labour conciliation studies aimed at bringing about better understanding and, above all, improved methods of communication.</p>

<p>If we are to maintain our rate of growth, if we are to generate capital, if we are to continue producing wealth, we will be obliged to make the fullest use of our entire labour potential comprising all sections and all race groups. I feel this is one of the fundamental issues we have to face. I think it might be interesting to note how Black people react to the situation today and to look at the statements made by a Johannesburg personnel consultant, a Black man himself, at the &#x201C;Paypower&#x201D; convention which was held by the Institute of Personnel Management in Johannesburg recently. I have merely a few of the quotations, and these are very interesting indeed. He says, for instance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Black pay is seen as poverty-pay.</block>

<p>This is a Black man&#x2019;s attitude. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Poverty is costly, not only to the Black individual, but to society itself.</block>

<p>By that he means the whole industrial society in our country&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the Black man&#x2019;s point of view, to be poor in an affluent South African society is to have no work.</block>

<p><span class="col_9125-9126" refersTo="page_0473"/>He goes further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the lower level of the wage-earning categories there is indisputable evidence that possession of the required skills does not necessarily lead to pay equity. For the Black youth this is something to which he is an outside spectator. This makes for a great deal of frustration. It makes for something else&#x2014;hate for South Africa.</block>

<p>This comes from a Black personnel officer, trained in the field. I believe we have to face the situation in our country much more realistically, because irrespective of whether we believe that the Black man is here permanently or not, irrespective of whether he is a citizen of another country, we are going to have many millions of workers in the country who will, by law, be foreigners in the country and who will, in numbers, completely outnumber the White workers of the country, but who will be necessary, vital and important in the entire industrial labour structure of the country. For that reason we have got to take note not only of the weak viewpoint of persons who wish to enjoy being entrenched within the affluent society in which we live, but also of those who have to make their contributions and who wish to play their part. I say this in the interest of our own White community. Even if one concedes the Government&#x2019;s attitude with regard to the preservation of certain political structures in the country, we nevertheless cannot run away from the fact that, despite that, it is completely dependent on the whole labour pool that exists in this country, whether it be foreign or whether it will be indigenous. As far as we are concerned, we look upon it as labour which is found within the confines of the country and which must be used in order not only to generate wealth for the country itself, but to give them a better standard of living, to provide improved conditions and, above all, to maintain the growing industrial strength of our country.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this debate is an interesting one. There was no recognition on the part of the Official Opposition, as well as on that of the PRP, for the White labourer in South Africa. The White labourer was not even mentioned in any of the speeches. I should like to know who these hon. members are representing in this House. The hon. member for Jeppe comes from a workers&#x2019; constituency and I tell him and the hon. members of the United Party today&#x2014;I do not even want to speak about the Progref Party&#x2014;that they do not represent the workers of South Africa. I tell you, Sir, that no word of recognition has been given to the White workers of South Africa. In the sixties, a whole decade, the growth rate in South Africa, the real growth, was more than 6%&#x2014;higher than in any other country in the world. Now I want to ask hon. members whether this was practically possible if we did not have a sound labour corps in South Africa? No, it is clear what the whole set-up in the Official Opposition as well as in the Progressive is. They have one consideration only, and this is that the Black workers must have trade unions and that job reservation should be abolished. The Blacks in South Africa must have trade unions. The Official Opposition does not realize what they are doing, but the Progs know what they are doing, and I make the statement today with the greatest responsibility, namely that the Black trade unions are seen by the PRP as a platform for their political ends. [Interjections.] Sir, they may say that this is nonsense, &#x201C;but the lady protested too much&#x201D;, and sometimes the hon. member for Pinelands looks just like a lady. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let me put it very clearly that the PRP sees the Black trade unions as a political platform in South Africa. There is only one member of the PRP&#x2014;unfortunately he is not here now&#x2014;namely the hon. member for Yeoville who, if I interpret things correctly&#x2014;and I predicted that he would leave the UP&#x2014;will disappear from the Prog Party for the simple reason that he has a sense of responsibility towards South Africa, something which the rest of the party is lacking. [Interjections.] Black trade unions are an intricate set-up. [Interjections.] I do not even want to talk to the hon. member for Hillbrow because he moves on a level which does not impress me in the least. [Interjections.] Let us consider the Black trade unions. It is not only the NP that says that they are undesirable. When the UP was in power, they undertook an inquiry and found that it would not be advantageous for the Black workers. After 1948 the NP Government appointed a commission of inquiry, a commission which found that it would not be advantageous. It <span class="col_9127-9128" refersTo="page_0474"/>was not the NP alone who thought so; the NP is in good company. After all, these people like the international set-up and the international arena. They think, after all, that this is the level at which they ought to move. What did they say? The International Labour Organization, in a report prepared for their African regional conference held in Lagos in December 1960, said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indeed, one of the most serious obstacles to effective collective bargaining in Africa lies in the limitations which are often discernible among trade union leaders. As already indicated, this emanates from the inability of many unions to employ persons of the highest calibre. Other factors are deficiency in general education and lack of understanding of economic principles and practice, as well as inexperience in the art of collective bargaining. The result is that, as management often claims, a large number of union officials tend to be unrealistic in their demands and this makes collective bargaining unduly tiring to tempers and leads to extravagance of language and unhelpful attitudes on both sides. Political activity would seem in many African countries to have affected the role of trade unions in collective bargaining.</block>

<p>Trade unions are used as instruments by certain political organizations. We have had this in South Africa too. There was a trade union which tried to embarrass the Government, but they had close links with the ANC, close links with those people to whom the Terrorism Act applies. Indeed, many of them were arrested. This is the danger. The Opposition must realize this.</p>

<p>Black trade unions are not conducive to the Blacks, because the Industrial Conciliation legislation is sophisticated legislation, which is difficult to interpret. It is instrumental in our industrial tribunals. It is the instrument in the Government&#x2019;s whole attempt to create improved working conditions. If it is not tackled in the right way, it is to the detriment of the workers. It is sophisticated legislation.</p>

<p>Black trade unions will not be conducive to the Blacks. However, the PRP sees matters in a completely different light because they see it as a platform. However, I do not want to associate this party with the ANC. Nevertheless, I want to allege that they intend using the Blacks in South Africa for their political ends. Why is there no recognition today for the Bantu Labour Relations Regulation Act? Why are those people not prepared to admit that this Act, which was amended and improved in 1973, resulted in there being 2 400 works committees in South Africa today? The University of the Orange Free State undertook research and investigated the functioning of these works committees. An inquiry was made into 326 of the largest industries in South Africa. It was found that in 97,4% of the cases there was improved communication and that in more than 30% of the cases an improvement in production could be seen. Is it not evident that those works committees were a success and that the liaison committees in South Africa are functioning excellently? Those committees represent 648 000 Black workers, i.e. almost three quarters of a million Black workers are being represented on the works committees and the liaison committees.</p>

<p>Why is the Official Opposition not prepared to admit that these committees are conducive to labour peace in South Africa? South Africa is faced with major threats from outside, and what is our basic duty in this country today? Our basic duty is to bring about capital formation, to utilize mineral and natural resources and to utilize labour as effectively and productively as possible. We must stop saying that no work is being done in South Africa. I want to put it the other way round by saying that, in order to create efficiency and increased production, the initiative must come from the management level. The workers must be given recognition and they must be told: You must participate in this challenge in order to make South Africa economically viable against threats from outside. The workers must also be told: We are going to support you; we are going to show you from the management level how to act more effectively. Then production in South Africa would increase. I have no doubt about it. If what the Opposition and the PRP are asking is done we would be creating labour unrest in South Africa. This will happen if one abolishes job reservation and establishes Black trade unions to serve as platforms for frustrated politicians who know that they can never impress the Whites in South Africa and never govern the country; people who just want to exploit the Blacks in South Africa. If this happens the country will experience economic problems. South Africa <span class="col_9129-9130" refersTo="page_0475"/>has a great future; we must be proud of the labour peace which prevails in this country. Hon. members would do as well to visit other countries in order to see what labour unrest is. South Africa will have isolated cases of labour unrest, but there is labour peace in South Africa, something of which we may be proud. This Government represents most of the White workers in South Africa, and the White workers in South Africa know that they are dealing with a responsible government and that they do not have to live in fear as far as their working conditions are concerned. In the process we are also training the Blacks. The hon. Opposition forgets that the workers of the homelands must also be taken into consideration. It is within the reach of the homelands eventually to establish trade unions for the Blacks in their own areas&#x2014;if they want this. However, the homelands will have to think carefully and establish a Black trade union system which will fit in with their traditions and the set-up in their own states. However, this is their own affair, and I ask myself why the Official Opposition does not support the decentralization of industries. In this way they would assist the Blacks in their own area.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to become involved in long arguments with the hon. member for Rustenburg. However, he does not seem to realize that we, the White people, just do not have enough skilled workers to do the work for the Blacks and the Whites. If I read to the hon. member what Mr. Zurich, who, as hon. members know, is the president of the Artisans&#x2019; Staff Association, said, perhaps he may get a clearer picture of the situation. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This country cannot go forward economically unless a more tolerant and progressive attitude is adopted for the advance of Black workers towards skilled and better paid occupations.</block>

<p>What is wrong with that? If people talk along those lines and we agree does it mean to say that we, on this side of the House, do not have the interests of the White workers at heart? But I do not wish to elaborate further on this matter.</p>

<p>I want to deal particularly with one or two aspects of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and its present relationship to accidents and occupational disease. The Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act would appear to me to be almost purely accident orientated. Over the years it has been a measure which has concerned itself particularly with accidents which take place suddenly, during working hours, and are treated as emergencies. After that the workers are further treated depending on the severity of the disease. There are two schedules that have been drawn up by the hon. the Minister, namely schedules A and B. Schedule A deals with accidents only. In this schedule there is ample provision for the types of injuries that are compensated for and the percentage disability that is allowed. This is quite a comprehensive schedule, but it does leave out one or two other conditions which I shall deal with presently.</p>

<p>I am more concerned at the moment with occupational disease which is not a condition which comes on suddenly, but is an insidious condition which develops over a large number of years. Whereas the man who has an accident is compensated as soon after the accident as possible, the man who is suffering from an occupational disease may continue working while his condition is deteriorating. That is the important aspect I want to draw to the attention of the hon. the Minister. No compensation is given to the worker during this period when his condition is deteriorating, and he continues to work in the atmosphere or with the materials that are the cause of his disease. When we look at what happens to the underground worker, the mineworker, during the period of his work underground, we know that by law this man must be examined periodically. If any deterioration in his condition is found during his working days, he is warned that if he continues to work at that occupation, there is a strong possibility of his condition deteriorating even further. This does not happen under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. The first thing that I do not like of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act is that it has a wage ceiling up. People earning more than that sum are not covered. Any person earning more than R7 260 is excluded from insurance. He cannot get it. And yet he may be working with the most dangerous material. He may be a worker working in a factory dealing with nuclear energy. He may earn far more than R7 000, but he is not covered and therefore has to take out his own insurance. That is totally wrong. I ask the hon. the Minister to do <span class="col_9131-9132" refersTo="page_0476"/>away with the ceiling. Let every person contribute and let every employer contribute. The Government must also do its share in the matter as well. Let me come back, however, to persons suffering from occupational diseases. In the schedule I find about 15 different conditions accounted for, and there is a description of what each condition is. Let me, however, quote to the hon. the Minister what section 89 of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act states in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the commissioner in such manner as he may determine that a workman is suffering from a scheduled disease due to the nature of his occupation and is thereby disabled for employment, or that the death of the workman was caused by such disease, the workman shall be entitled to compensation</block>

<p>Look how far the man has got to deteriorate before he gets compensation. In the few minutes at my disposal I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that in my opinion the law as it stands at present is inadequate. I think the hon. the Minister must now consider whether it is not advisable to bring in new regulations&#x2014;or even to amend the Act or to introduce a new Act if necessary&#x2014;containing provisions making it imperative for those people who are working with materials or under conditions injurious to their health to be examined before they are allowed to do the work that they apply for.</p>

<p>Let me give an example. A man may be highly sensitive to a certain resin or to a certain plastic material, but he is not examined beforehand to test his sensitivity. He is simply put to work and may then, at a later stage, show signs of sensitivity or reaction to the materials with which he is working. However, a man who goes underground on the mines is examined thoroughly before he goes underground. His height and weight are measured and his lungs are examined etc.</p>

<p>I wonder how many young girls and women have been examined before they are employed to stand behind counters in shops. How many of those young girls or women&#x2014;especially those who have already had babies&#x2014;are not already suffering from varicose veins? However, they do not get any compensation for a common condition like that, which can be aggravated by the standing job they are doing. A simple matter like that is not covered by this Act. No mention is made of it, but it is important because there are hundreds of thousands of girls standing behind counters today. What compensation do they get, however? They get nothing at all. I therefore say that they must be examined thoroughly, and after the initial examination I maintain that these people should be examined at least every six to nine months. Every factory worker should have a regular examination to determine whether he is suffering from the effects of the &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rosettenville discussed the Workmens Compensation Act and requested that certain adjustments to it be effected. In my opinion, our economic development in South Africa and the working conditions under which people have to render their services probably makes it necessary for the amendment of the Act to be considered from time to time. I want to agree with the hon. member that one should not be static in one&#x2019;s approach to the Workmens Compensation Act and the compensation paid to people in accordance therewith. However, the matter of occupational diseases is a very complicated problem, and the hon. member, who is himself a medical practitioner, will agree with me that it is very difficult to determine whether a person&#x2019;s disease results from the work he <span class="col_9133-9134" refersTo="page_0477"/>does. However, in the past the Government has shown that as far as occupational disease in mining are concerned, it has effected the necessary amendments to our pneumoconiosis legislation from time to time as the need arose. In my opinion the workers of South Africa display the greatest confidence in the sympathy the Government has for them in this regard.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to another aspect of the debate. Every year that this Vote is discussed, attacks are made by the Opposition on the traditional labour pattern we have in South Africa. One of the Opposition&#x2019;s points of attack is that our traditional labour pattern discriminates against the Black worker. The Opposition casts suspicion, in the eyes of the outside world, on our labour pattern in South Africa, one that has developed over the years.</p>

<p>In 1973 the British Labour Party decided that they wanted to investigate the conduct of the employers of British companies towards Black workers in South Africa. They allowed the British Trade Union Congress to pay a visit to South Africa. Negotiations were conducted with some of the so-called Black trade unions and consultations also took place with representatives of the biggest industrial enterprises. What is interesting is that before the five-man commission the TUC returned to Britain, one of the members, Mr. Jack Jones, made a statement to <i>the Rand Daily Mail</i> on 7 November 1973, in the course of which he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The recent visit of the TUC delegation to South Africa broke new ground in establishing outside contact with the emerging African trade unions.</block>

<p>I quote further from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is possible within existing South African law for individual employers to meet the representatives of Black trade unions to negotiate with them and to conclude collective agreements which can be set down in writing and operated.</block>

<p>Mr. Jones then came to the conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is possible to create genuine union representation for the majority of industrial workers&#x2014;the Africans.</block>

<p>These people admit, therefore, that our existing legislation in South Africa has been drafted in such a way that we can look after the rights of the Black worker in South Africa, too, and that their interests can be looked after in terms of the existing legislation which applies to them and in terms of the multi-racial and multi-national pattern followed in South Africa. This also means that it does not necessarily follow that we should implement the TUC system in South Africa. However, these people would naturally like the Black trade unions to be treated on the same basis as the White trade unions.</p>

<p>I have already said that the Opposition launches an annual attack on our traditional labour pattern. One aspect of the traditional labour pattern which has developed in South Africa is nothing but job reservation. Job reservation has to be seen against the background of our special circumstances in South Africa. The principle contained in section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act is aimed at ensuring that due protection will be afforded to the White, the Asiatic, the Coloured and the Bantu worker. A situation in which one group outstrips another group in the labour sphere by way of inter-race competition, must be prevented.</p>

<p>The fact that there is only about 2,9% of statutory job reservation in South Africa, cannot be advanced as an argument in favour of the abolition of job reservation. Job reservation is only the legal confirmation of the traditional labour pattern in South Africa. When one race group feels threatened, it can fall back on the section of the Act in question. It is pointless to discuss this matter in high-flown language&#x2014;one has to come down to the level of the worker. Let me give an example. A few years ago, certain experiments were carried out in the samplers&#x2019; category, when the Chamber of Mines decided to replace the White workers who had always done that job, with Black workers. In my constituency I could see the frustration which was caused as a result of the impairment of the security of the White workers within that community&#x2014;to such an extent that for two years we had an unhappy community as a result of a small group of workers whose security was effected by this experiment. As a result of the fact that there was only a small group of them within the larger employers&#x2019; organization, viz. the Underground Mine Officials <span class="col_9135-9136" refersTo="page_0478"/>Association, and they did not, therefore, have a very strong negotiating position, they fell back on this provision in the Act. After an industrial court had been appointed in terms of the Act, it was decided that this work should be reserved for Whites. Since then there has been peace and quiet among both the Whites and the Blacks in the mining industry. In other words, this is a very important measure in this legislation.</p>

<p>I want to quote further evidence in this connection. I refer here to a book entitled <i>The Black Worker of South Africa,</i> which was compiled by Dr. G. E. M. Leistner and Dr. W. J. Breytenbach in connection with job reservation. Let me quote a paragraph from it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A total of 26 work determinations had been made by the end of 1971. These determinations affected only 2,9% of the country&#x2019;s labour force. The principle of work reservation is therefore not applied rigorously but only with a view to eliminating inter-racial competition and possibly friction between races. Work reservation is thus designed to protect the position of the group of workers, irrespective of racial background, who have traditionally performed a particular type of work and whose position is threatened because workers of another population group are offering their services at lower wages. The intention is therefore not to freeze a given labour pattern but to promote conditions conducive to orderly and peaceful change in keeping with the needs of South Africa&#x2019;s expanding economy. These goals and principles apply to both Blacks and Whites in South Africa and are not only intended to protect White workers against inter-racial competition but also to protect Black, Asian and Coloured workers against competition from workers of other population groups who intrude in the particular spheres of traditional employment in the South African economy.</block>

<p>There is no better evidence for the value of, and necessity for, the provision relating to job reservation, as the traditional labour pattern, in our legislation. The fact that Black workers are constantly entering fields previously occupied by Whites, cannot be advanced as a reason for abolishing job reservation. Job reservation exists, more than anything else, in order to ensure that the various categories of work are grouped in an orderly fashion in accordance with the requirements of the various races.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, right at the outset I want to associate myself with the congratulations conveyed to the hon. the Minister by various hon. members on the acceptance of this important portfolio. It is my considered opinion that in view of his personal traits, and the enthusiasm and the dedication with which he is prepared to carry out his task, the Department of Labour is going to be happy under his leadership.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to associate myself with what has been said by various speakers, <i>inter alia,</i> by the hon. member for Rustenburg, and make an appeal to hon. members in both parties opposite to bear the White worker, too, specifically in mind when considering the employment situation in South Africa. Another appeal I want to address to the hon. members of the Opposition is that they should at least be consistent in the standpoint they adopt from year to year. The hon. member referred to &#x201C;stereotyped conduct&#x201D;. He is at least consistent in his attitude from year to year, because year after year he makes the same speech in a stereotyped way. Year after year he asks for the same concessions. He, too, referred to job reservation as the inexorable or unyielding measure which has already caused industrial unrest in South Africa, and will continue to cause it to an increasing extent. Then again we get the hon. member for Maitland who maintains that job reservation has no socio-economic effect in South Africa. In today&#x2019;s debate, too, the hon. member for Maitland said that it had no socio-economic effect in South Africa.</p>

<p>That is correct.</p>

<speech by="#ungerer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, how is it then that members of the same party can differ so much about a specific measure. The one regards it as a measure which causes industrial unrest, and the other maintains that it has no socio-economic effect. In other words, what the hon. member for Maitland says is that it is not only the economy that is not affected; it has no effect whatsoever on the worker within the economy either. The main question that occurs to me is: Why, then should it be abolished? How can those members be so <span class="col_9137-9138" refersTo="page_0479"/>inconsistent about an issue? But, Sir, let me leave the hon. members at that. I want to refer to what has been said by hon. members of the PRP. In the first place, I want to quote what was said by the hon. member for Orange Grove, or, as the hon. member for Kimberley South calls him, the farmer from Lemoenfontein. On 16 September 1974 he said the following (Hansard, Vol. 51, col. 3046)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, as long as the Nationalist Party, the Government and the hon. the Minister tie themselves to the gross selfishness of job reservation and the industrial colour bar, so long will all the nice things they say about their good intentions in other directions be worth absolutely nothing.</block>

<p>Only the following year the hon. member for Johannesburg North, who is usually just as fiery an advocate for the so-called oppressed, made the following statement (Hansard, Vol. 57, col. 8304)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am not in any way suggesting, neither would we recommend, that Black South Africans should simply be allowed to move into jobs which are at present occupied by White South Africans.</block>

<p>That hon. member comes along and says exactly what the Government says and advocates, after the hon. member for Orange Grove objected to job reservation. The question I want to ask them now is: How can they be so inconsistent? How is the White worker to be protected other than by means of a certain, specific measure? After all, one does not protect people by means of vacuums. Surely there must be measures in accordance with which these matters are regulated. This is precisely in accordance with the policy of the NP. We agree with them that non-Whites should progress to higher categories of work, and that this is necessary for our industrial growth and for the maintenance of our standard of living. After all, this is exactly what we are doing. I again want to ask those hon. members: Are they not living in the South Africa of 1976, in which these measures are in fact being implemented? However, they are being implemented in an orderly fashion, so that the fiasco they caused in this country in 1922 will not occur again.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go further. I said that these things were in fact being done in the South Africa of today. However, the Opposition is always coming up with the cry, and the moan, I am tempted to call it, about the improved training of workers, and non-White workers in particular. When one considers the training of workers, one should really start at the scholastic level. In the first place, one has to be sure that there is a place for those workers where they can achieve work fulfilment with the training of theirs. We are a developing country and we are not already a developed country with unlimited employment opportunities. If these people had been trained 20 years ago, where should we have accommodated them? At the moment we are doing so in a way which will not bring us industrial unrest, but instead, industrial growth. Furthermore, this will eventually result in greater fulfilment for the Bantu. In order to achieve this one has to begin at the scholastic level. I want to ask hon. members on that side of the House, in all fairness, to be constructive sometimes as well, and grant recognition when the Government progresses dramatically in certain directions. I want to make the statement with regard to trade and technical training, that dramatic progress has in fact been made as far as the Bantu are concerned. Apart from this, we passed legislation recently which put it beyond question that in-service training could be carried out in an orderly and organized manner, but in such a way as not to get out of hand. In this respect, too, dramatic progress has already been made. Thousands of people have already been trained, and thousands are to be trained next year and later. Apart from this we have the system of differentiation in education for the White child today, which is calculated to achieve this very aim of developing the talents of each of them to the maximum. If we see it in this light, then the cry of the Opposition that nothing is being done in regard to the training of workers in South Africa is surely a hollow one and one without any significance whatsoever.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member himself has said it repeatedly. All the speakers on the Opposition side have, too. The Government&#x2019;s present policy is permitting the <span class="col_9139-9140" refersTo="page_0480"/>Bantu to qualify themselves for higher categories of work. This Government is practical, realistic and has both feet on the ground. The Government knows, too, that they must allow these people, with their higher training, to come into their own in higher categories of work, because if they do not do so then this will create the most extreme frustration and these people will not be able to reap the fruits of work fulfilment and happiness in their work. This very year, all possible efforts are being made to ensure that these people may be permitted to enter higher categories of work and this is happening over and over again.</p>

<p>As I have already said, it is being done in an orderly and ordered fashion. The labour councils in which Whites are involved, do in fact have a say with regard to the degree of progress and the rate at which the progress is made as regards permitting these people to enter higher categories of employment. Particular emphasis is laid on higher categories of work in our border industries. This proves two things beyond all doubt: Firstly, that the Government is determined to continue to protect the White worker within the White area, and furthermore that they are sympathetic towards the Black worker and his aspirations. In the course of time the NP has proved that it has an understanding of its peoples&#x2019; aspirations in the labour sphere, and in other spheres too, including the political sphere. To our White workers I want to say this afternoon that through my personal contact with them&#x2014;I represent what is largely a workers&#x2019; constituency&#x2014;I have developed a great deal of respect for their realism with regard to this specific matter. I have no doubt whatsoever about this. To a large extent they have been guided to this stage by the Nationalist Government and its policy because they have confidence in the Government. This afternoon I want to express the hope that their realism will triumph in the future and that they will take further note of the needs of the Black man and the Black worker as he progresses. I want to give them the assurance that they can consider these matters with realism and that they can consider them without fear. I have also come to know the fears of these people, their fear that they will be ousted from their employment. However, I want to give them the assurance this afternoon&#x2014;they already know this&#x2014;that they can consider without fear allowing the Black man to come into his own in the White area, because the Government will continue to protect the White worker within the White area to the extent that he needs protection. Within a short time it will probably no longer be necessary. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in his speech the hon. member for Sasolburg talked about the 1922 strike and, regrettable to say, the attitudes which he expressed come right from that time. It is more than 50 years ago; so it does not seem as if it has progressed at all during the ensuing period. He states his party&#x2019;s policy as being protection for the White worker in the White areas. This might be so, but as long as job reservation is in existence, it is a discriminatory policy and the Government&#x2019;s claim to be moving away from discrimination therefore becomes absolutely meaningless. I say it again as I did in 1974: As long as job reservation persists, South Africa will be seen to be discriminating. There is no room for it now and we must get away from it. It is not in the best interests of the Whites either, because it bedevils race relations. Could I tell the hon. member that if he really wants to improve race relationship between White and Black workers in the best interest of the White worker, he should allow the Black workers to join trade unions, because it is only when Blacks can come into trade unions together with Whites as the labour representatives of one industry, that we will get anywhere?</p>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that that will be the day. I sometimes wonder whether hon. members on the other side want trade unions at all. In fact, I am glad to see one hon. member has changed his tune today. When I asked the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark for his views on this, it was only with a great deal of reluctance that he admitted that he was in favour of trade unions for Whites. I am certain there are hon. members in the benches to the left of me who are just not interested at all in any trade unions, White or Black.</p>

<p>There is another matter I should like to raise this afternoon. I believe it is a matter of considerable importance. This has to do with <span class="col_9141-9142" refersTo="page_0481"/>the question of wage determination. I believe the procedures for wage determination are too lengthy and too cumbersome and that they take far too long. At a time when we are faced with inflation and a rapidly rising cost of living, wage determinations are often out of date by the time they are made. Wages, and certainly minimum wages, tend to lag behind a realistic figure in terms of the cost of living. I believe the hon. the Minister must review the whole machinery in regard to wage determination and revise this machinery to allow for more rapid decisions to be made. Under the present system minimum wages never keep up, but are always behind. By the time a determination is made, it is already out of date, and the process for yet another determination becomes necessary, so that one gets an ever-extending chain which never stops. Somehow or other a system must be devised which will enable wage increases to be realistic rather than always in arrears.</p>

<p>Perhaps I could ask the hon. the Minister a question at this stage. How far does a Wage Board in its determination allow for future inflation? Does it project for future inflation at all? I think clarity on this point would be of considerable interest, because I believe that the policy is not clear at the moment. As a matter of fact, as far as I know, it never has been made clear.</p>

<p>Reverting to the question of delays, I know that the department has already taken certain steps to streamline the process in that in certain instances the Wage Board has merely changed the clauses relating to wage increases rather than reviewing a whole determination. Reviewing and revising a whole determination is, of course, a tremendously lengthy process. I must say to the hon. the Minister that this shortcut is a step to be welcomed. Regrettably, although there has been some improvement, the situation is still not satisfactory, because it still may take from six to eight months to make a determination. I think it might be worthwhile to examine the whole process. Firstly, the Minister is requested to call a Wage Board hearing, and this can sometimes be a lengthy process in itself. Indeed, I heard of a case the other day where a wage for Black workers determined in 1972 at R3,90 per week, is only now in the process of review in spite of the fact that the hon. the Minister was petitioned to allow a determination on three separate occasions over a period of two years. I realize that it was not this hon. Minister. After this a Wage Board is called together. This is gazetted, representations having to be made round about a month later. Approximately a further month goes by before the Wage Board sits and thereafter a six to eight-week period elapses before a report goes to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister then gazettes the findings and calls for the lodging of any objections, usually within a further period of one month. There could then be a further oral hearing a month or so after the lodging of objections and it then usually takes up to two or three months before the final determination is gazetted.</p>

<p>As I have said, it takes up to eight months for the whole process to be completed, and during that period the cost of living is going up all the time and workers&#x2019; interests are thereby prejudiced. I believe this is a most unsatisfactory position and that the whole machinery must be re-examined with a view to improvement. A case could well be made out for an increase in wages without a full inquiry. I realize there could be great difficulties in the way, because the Wage Board has to take into consideration the general profitability of an industry and has to give a full hearing to the employers. But I believe that a brief process of interim consultation could take its place and that an interim increase could be granted if it appears reasonable. The procedure of a full determination could then follow. What is reasonable can be assessed in part from the official cost-of-living figures, for example. I would ask the hon. the Minister to institute an inquiry into the ways and means of speeding up the whole process of wage determinations, especially in regard to minimum wages, because I believe that this is a very sore point at the moment with the unions. They are not happy about it.</p>

<p>Another matter concerning the operation of the Wage Board which comes to my notice is the allegation that Wage Boards are frequently inconsistent in their rulings. More specifically, this has to do with the assessment of minimum wages for Black labourers. I am told that negotiations conducted for various industries in the same area on behalf of Black workers by the Central Bantu Labour Board vary tremendously in what is asked for. Determinations may vary with regard to the classification of, for example, general labourers. In the same area there are sometimes different representations <span class="col_9143-9144" refersTo="page_0482"/>by the Central Bantu Labour Board, between say R15 and R21 per week, while there are negotiated agreements for a minimum of as much as R28. I know it is difficult, because in every industry the classification of general labourer means something different, and also that skills vary. But the point I am making is that I believe there is a case for laying down a consistent minimum wage policy. We in these benches would like a statutory minimum wage to be laid down, if only on an area basis.</p>

<p>One point on the question of Wage Board hearings is that it has been known in the past for the chairman of a Wage Board to refuse to accept evidence from a Black trade union. Now, Black trade unions may well not be recognized, but there is nothing in any law that I know of that would enable the chairman of a Wage Board to say that it is illegal to accept evidence from a Black trade union. As far as I am concerned, it is perfectly legal, and a Wage Board chairman should accept representations from a Black trade union.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to raise another matter with the hon. the Minister. That concerns the situation in the diamond-cutting industry. I do not know what stage has been reached in regard to the diamond-cutters&#x2019; strike. The diamond-cutting industry brings in a considerable amount of foreign exchange for South Africa and it is therefore very important indeed that the hon. the Minister should do everything in his power to solve the strike situation. I would be very grateful indeed to hear from the hon. the Minister just what is happening in regard to that strike.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not wish to react to the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Orange Grove. He put quite a number of questions to the hon. the Minister, to which I believe the Minister will reply in full.</p>

<p>It is a great privilege to me again this afternoon to take part in this debate. When we speak of labour and of labour matters and of labour peace in this country, it is a great privilege to everyone in this House to participate in the debate. But you will allow me, Sir, to extend my sincere congratulations to our present Minister, whom I have known well for many years, on his new post and to wish him all the best for the future. Things will not always run smoothly, and he will be kept very busy sometimes, for if one is Minister of Labour one has to work hard, but we know the Minister to be a person who is capable of hard work. I wish him every success. I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity of thanking a friend and colleague, I may say, ex-Minister Marais Viljoen, for all the years he occupied this post. Minister Viljoen and I became acquainted as far back as 1930. We have come a long way together and we know each other. I want to thank him very much for his loyalty and for his devotion to duty, to the benefit of the Republic of South Africa, during the years in which he occupied this position.</p>

<p>However, I want to come back to the speech made by the hon. member for Hillbrow. One of the arguments he advanced today was concerned with the wage gap between White and non-White. I want to make it quite clear in this House today that a great deal is being done. However, I ask myself whether in many respects this is the right thing to do. I believe that many good things are being done as regards the salary of the non-White. However, I want to concentrate more on the Bantu who often earns a salary which he is not sufficiently educated to use correctly. Abuse of liquor has assumed alarming proportions among the Bantu during the past year. The percentage has doubled and redoubled; that I am convinced of. If the hon. members say that the salary of the Bantu, as far as certain kinds of work are concerned, should be comparable with that of other non-Whites, I disagree with them. When hon. members speak of the general level of the cost of living, the biggest item of expenditure every month is accommodation. However, the Bantu can live more cheaply because his accommodation is mostly subsidized and because his transport, whether by rail or by bus, is further subsidized by the Government. A great deal has been done up to this stage to reduce the wage gap, but I believe that it would be a foolish step if the Government were to reduce the gap too drastically.</p>

<p>I want to return to the hon. member for Pinelands. His speech was devoted mainly to the foreign workers in the country. I believe that the hon. member spoke mostly of the mining industry, as well as of the large numbers of Bantu who come to sell their labour in our country.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member is right. However, I just want to make it clear that if our Bantu had not been so well off, it would not have been necessary to draw large numbers of foreign Bantu to this country to sell their labour to the mining industry. One of the hon. member&#x2019;s lamentations was that it is immoral to cause the Bantu from the Transkei, from Lesotho and from anywhere else to come and live here, on a family basis.</p>

<p>However, if there is any industry today which treats its workers well, then it is the mining industry. The mines do everything in their power to make their Bantu workers happy. Their workers receive benefits which surpass almost any benefits offered by any other employer in this country. The mining industry spends millions of rands every year in order to make its workers happy, especially the Bantu. Their accommodation, their food, their medical benefits and their sport facilities are among the best in the world. How on earth can one accommodate those Bantu who come to work here on a family basis as well? What do hon. members of the PRP want? It is impossible. Furthermore, I want to allege that the mines are presently recruiting and employing thousands of local Bantu, with the advantage that those Bantu are in fact accommodated on a family basis. However, most of those Bantu are accommodated in the Bantu townships in the urban areas today. This is a sound basis. Why? Because the mines have offered such a tremendous increase to the Bantu workers in their service. This is actually the bait which is being used in order to attract the local Bantu as well. Those people are being accommodated on a family basis in the local Bantu townships, and they are happy there. I cannot see how on earth it could be allowed&#x2014;whether the churches speak of this does not matter&#x2014;or how it could be justified for the mines, or any big industries, to accommodate thousands of people from Malawi &#x2026;</p>

<p>What I do concede to the hon. member for Pinelands is that&#x2014;this is my opinion as well&#x2014;facilities should be created in the labour pattern of those people, and with the assistance of the rapid means of transportation available today, for the large numbers of Bantu employed by the mines to visit their families during week-ends. This is a matter one can argue about. However, it will first be necessary to determine the cost this would involve, and as soon as the homelands have become a reality, we could provide to those people the necessary transport which would enable them to visit their families over weekends; or perhaps even every second weekend.</p>

<p>A second aspect I want to discuss is the one which was raised by the hon. member for Orange Grove. He raised the complaint we are always listening to, the one concerning job reservation. Job reservation is a nail in the coffin of both Opposition parties, and it will remain a nail in their coffin until we have finally buried them, politically speaking. If one looks at the symptoms on the part of the Opposition, it is clear that they cannot keep going much longer. The only thing that could possibly save them would be a sudden and merciful death.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must take issue with the hon. member for Stilfontein over the way in which he has attempted to justify the wage gap which exists in South Africa between the incomes earned by Black workers and White workers.

<p>It may be true, Mr. Chairman, The hon. member said that this is true, but I have seen many White people misusing their money on drink. The real issue here is, if a person is doing a particular job of work, what the value of that work is and <span class="col_9147-9148" refersTo="page_0484"/>whether he should not earn that value for the work. I do not think that race, home life or any of these things should be any criteria for what a man should be paid. It should be what the job is worth. I should like to ask hon. members: How many White people do we know who came from humble backgrounds who, by virtue of their own effort&#x2014;by studying and being prepared to work&#x2014;have raised themselves up to where they are enjoying a good living and are prosperous people? Why should we deny a man this just because of the colour of his skin?</p>

<p>The hon. member talks about subsidies. He referred to the fact that Blacks get subsidized transport. Do not Whites? They talk about subsidized housing. How many big companies today supply houses for their employees at R10 or R20 per month? Does not this very Government do it with their Cabinet Ministers? I therefore really feel that the hon. member should forget about all this kind of talk because, with all due respect to him, he is making a fool of himself by trying to debate an issue such as this. As long as these inequalities exist, men who labour for their livelihood will join together to fight for their rights, and they will do so in the accepted form, i.e. by way of unions.</p>

<p>I now want to say a few words to the hon. member for Bethal who spoke about the British labour union movement and said that representatives of that movement had tried to come into South Africa and bring their labour union methods into this country. Unfortunately that hon. member does not seem to be here at the moment, but I nevertheless want to make clear to him&#x2014;and to all hon. members on that side of the House&#x2014;that we of the Official Opposition want nothing to do with the British labour union movement.</p>

<p>As far as we are concerned those people should stay right out of South Africa, and the main reason why I say that is because those labour union movements are completely and utterly saturated and motivated by politics. They are completely left-wing political organizations and we totally oppose their interest here in South Africa, as we do their coming to South Africa to try to bring their type of trade unionism into this country. This does not mean to say, however, that we are opposed to labour unions. As long as labour is exploited by employers, who have the opportunity to exploit labour, men must be allowed their right to join together to fight for their share of the value of the work that is being done. After all, is it not so&#x2014;as I have said&#x2014;that the Whites throughout the world have thus been able to make their place in the sun? Here I agree with the hon. member for Springs who said earlier that it was time to take a good look at the whole subject of labour unions. I think his concern lies with an aspect I have already mentioned, i.e. that many labour movements are playing too great a role in the political scene. I agree with this danger, and we have already mentioned what has happened in the United Kingdom. I agree that we must take a fresh look at this matter.</p>

<p>We must ask ourselves why there are labour unions. Why do labourers want to get together into some type of movement? As I have already said, historically this has occurred because men have had to gather themselves together in order to get a fair and square deal. We have already heard from the hon. member for South Coast that there are White employers today who are exploiting Black labour because this Black labour force falls outside the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act. Surely something must be done about this, and if the Government does not do something about it, the labourers themselves will. If the Government, which is elected to protect them, cannot see its way clear to giving them that protection and to giving them a fair and square deal, these people will gather themselves together to do something about it.</p>

<p>In the South African context, however, there is only one thing they can do, and that is to become politically involved. This is the danger that we on these benches see facing South Africa today. Because of this Government&#x2019;s refusal to include Blacks in the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act, the Blacks today are forming themselves into unions. We heard a moment ago that 50 000 of them are already involved in union movements.</p>

<p>Eighty thousand, we now hear. These people are being politically motivated now because they say they are not getting a square deal and are now going to do something about it. This is the history of what happened in Britain where these people eventually formed themselves into political organizations. And what do we have in Britain today? We have a socialist state and the nationalization of many businesses. This is also happening in Africa today. To the North of us we see how this mentality has crept in and how labour groups are, in fact, running the country politically. I believe it is up to the Government and to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;I want to appeal to him in this regard&#x2014;to re-examine what is required in South Africa at this particular time in our history. I believe we must examine what our Blacks want. There are hon. members on the other side who give the impression that these Blacks want to run the political scene. The average worker does not want to become politically involved.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>How do I know? I carried a union card at one time in my life. I have attended union meetings and I have been at strike meetings. I know a little bit of what motivates a worker. At the same time I was on the other side of the fence when I managed a large employee force at one time. I think I do know a little bit of what motivates the average worker. He wants to make sure that the basic needs of himself and his family are satisfied. He wants to know that the aspirations which he has for his children are satisfied. He wants to know that they can get an education and that they, in their turn, will have a fair deal and the opportunity to rise to the top of the ladder in their due time. I do not believe that the average worker is really interested in politics.</p>

<p>However, as I said earlier on, unless the Government alters the Industrial Conciliation Act to include Black labour, I am quite sure that we shall see a Black political labour movement grow in South Africa to the detriment of the country&#x2019;s future.</p>

<p>I should like to refer briefly to the annual report of the Department of Labour. I refer to it in connection with the question of labour unions. I was pleased to see that at the end of 1974 there were all told 1 482 liaison committees and 207 works committees as opposed to 773 liaison committees and 125 works committees at the end of the previous year. This means that nearly 210 000 more Blacks have been brought under the scope of these various liaison and works committees. This is one way of getting the point of view of Black labour across to management and I am very pleased to see that this has happened. I was also very pleased to see recently that in one particular industry an African worker representative appeared at industrial council level. In that particular case the African worker representative appeared along with Indian and White union representatives before the industrial council in order to negotiate a new deal for the Black workers. Although it is very good indeed to see that Black workers can now have this representation on industrial council level, I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that this is the thin edge of the wedge, because Black workers are sooner or later going to request&#x2014;in fact, they will demand&#x2014;that their representations be submitted on a union level. After all, does the hon. the Minister feel that these Black labourers&#x2019; representatives are going to be happy to have this rather junior status on the industrial council for all time? We talk about giving people their identity, giving them equality, giving them their integrity and giving them their self-respect, but in this particular case we are going to have a sort of fourth-class labour representative coming on to the industrial council.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Amanzimtoti made a few statements which are actually in complete contradiction to reality. I do not understand the logic of his argument. He says that the Black man must be given trade union opportunities, but at the same time he says that we are afraid that the trade unions will engage in politics. Is the hon. member a stranger in Africa and does he not know that all the political leaders to the north of the Republic of South Africa came from the trade unions of the various countries? Does he know where President Kaunda, President Nyerere and others received their training as far as organizational work is concerned? I simply cannot imagine how the hon. member could have come along with such a misrepresentations in this House. However, I want to leave the hon. member at that.</p>

<p>Arising from the question of job reservation <span class="col_9151-9152" refersTo="page_0486"/>and the shocking statements made by the hon. member for South Coast, I want to make a few remarks. The hon. member for South Coast make an accusation against our White workers which I believe to be shocking. It is shocking because it contains an untruth and I say categorically that the hon. member does not know what he is talking about. He simply made a statement which is completely unfounded.</p>

<p>In this connection I want to refer to a statement made by Harry Oppenheimer. I do this for the information of the hon. member for Orange Grove and the hon. member for Pinelands as well, because Mr. Harry Oppenheimer is their monitor. The issue he referred to was the relations between the White workers and the Black workers. Mr. Oppenheimer said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An important point to be kept in mind is that the Black worker will need the goodwill of the White worker. We must therefore, in consultation with the White trade unions, make sure that the organization of the Blacks will not be carried through at the expense of the security of the established standards of the Whites.</block>

<p>If Mr. Harry Openheimer is not advocating a form of job reservation in making this statement, I do not know what he is doing. He makes it quite clear that there are two parties who must consider each other&#x2019;s standpoints. This was explained here by the hon. member for Bethal, but the hon. member for Orange Grove did not accept it. It seems to me that he did not listen to what was said on this side of the House about the question of job reservation. It is a question of collective agreements in this connection. It holds advantages for both the Black worker and the White worker. This applies to all workers in South Africa. As the hon. member for Welkom, said, since that principle of reservation and conciliation began to operate in our whole labour organization in 1924, we have never had the shocking strikes in our economy that we had before 1924. There must be some form of protection, otherwise we should not enjoy a peaceful co-existence in our country. In this connection we must start with our workers&#x2019; organization, and as I have said, we have had great success with this since 1924.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Amanzimtoti said that we could not accept that we in South Africa should apply the same methods as the ones applied by the British trade unions in England. However, if one looks at the trade union system used to the north of us in Africa, what does one see? Why are the countries to the north of us experiencing the problems they are in fact experiencing in the economic field? In this connection I want to refer to the book <i>Unions, Parties and Political Development&#x2014;A Study of Mineworkers in Zambia;</i> London, Yale University Press, 1971. The book is written by R. H. Yates, I say this for the information of the hon. member for Hillbrow, because he mentioned the workers&#x2019; organizations in Zambia. This book gives a long exposition of the problems which arose in Zambia because of the action of the trade unions in the Zambian economy. That hon. member, who is such an authority on the subject of economy, will realize the importance of a trade union, especially when that trade union acts the way trade unions in Britain act. There, for example, they have caused the whole strength of the English pound sterling to collapse. The whole economy of England has been deteriorating over the years because of their actions. What has recently happened to the pound again because of their behaviour? In spite of this, Sir, the hon. member comes along here and tells us with sanctimonious wisdom what we ought to do. I now want to refer to what is said by Mr. Bates in this book on the position in Zambia. Since Zambia attained independence, there has been continual agitation for higher wages, and the Government simply granted the higher wages at the time. Mr. Bates quotes what certain people in Zambia had to say about these events. The first quotation is this <span class="col_9153-9154" refersTo="page_0487"/>one of the Zambian Minister of Labour, who said the following in 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On this question of wages, I have stated time and again that wages must be related to productivity. At the moment our wages have gone appreciably higher whilst, on the other side, productivity has remained relatively low. Now we must have a pause, just a pause, while we get our breath back. Wide differences in wages and other conditions exist between expatriates and local employees &#x2026;</block>

<p>The expatriates to whom he is referring here are the Whites. Then he goes on to give the reasons for that difference between the wages of the Whites and the wages of the Zambian citizens. There is a very valid reason for it, and it is the same reason one has here in the Republic. It is a traditional situation. [Interjections.] Sir, I challenge those hon. members to tell me that there are fewer Whites in Zambia today, precisely as a result of the situation in Zambia, than there were before independence. The fact is that there are more Whites employed on the mines of Zambia today than were employed there before independence. This is so because the people there cannot get along without the Whites. But, Sir, this writer goes on to say on pages 48 and 49 of this book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Assistant Commissioner of Labour places the prevention of strikes among the two most important tasks of the union.</block>

<p>Then this person says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let me say that in my opinion, the role of the trade union movement in national development is purely and simply the maintenance of industrial peace and increase in productivity.</block>

<p>He does not say that their role involves agitation for an increase of wages. The trade unions themselves believed that they should continually agitate for higher wages. That is what they are doing everywhere, after all. The trade unions in Britain and all over Africa are continually agitating for higher wages. This is something we want to avoid. A channel must be created for them, such as we do in fact create for them by means of the conciliation councils. This is precisely the reason why we got the success of our labour relations in South Africa. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, after hearing the viciousness of the attack which the hon. member for Etosha made on all trade unions as such, I expected him to advocate the complete banning of trade unions in South Africa. He concluded by saying that they were agitators and that people of this nature could cause economic chaos in a country. Of course, irresponsible trade unionism could bring about such a situation, but in South Africa we have had responsible trade unionism for many years. The hon. member for Etosha appears to be completely opposed to the whole principle of trade unionism, which of course is the very essence of the bargaining power of the worker. I wonder how many members opposite, who represent working constituencies where there are many workers, would repeat the speech which the hon. member for Etosha has just made in this Committee. Certainly, it is not the type of speech one would have anticipated from a party which professes to look after the interests of the worker. The trade union is regarded as the organ whereby the worker can express his opinion and through which he has bargaining power as between employer and employee.</p>

<p>The question of job reservation has been raised by many members on both sides of the House. We on this side have certainly been waiting for some hon. member opposite to try to justify job reservation in present-day circumstances. We are often told that it only affects a small minority of workers, but for that reason it seems irresponsible on the part of the Government to persist with its policy of job reservation. Indeed, I think hon. members on that side of the House will agree that every person has the right to work and to realize his/hers full potential in such employment. I think they should try to apply that as a yardstick to see whether they can still justify the retention of job reservation in the statutes of South Africa.</p>

<p>The matter I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister under this Vote, also deals with the question of certain persons wishing to realize their full potential as far as their employment is concerned. I want to refer particularly to the position of the physically handicapped people. In terms of the Government&#x2019;s policy of <span class="col_9155-9156" refersTo="page_0488"/>providing employment for these people, we know if we look at item H of the estimates which is before us, that there is an amount of money to be voted under &#x201C;sheltered employment services&#x201D; for handicapped persons. In terms of these figures it would appear that there is to be a reduction of the expenditure in this regard, from R1 545 000 to R1 402 000. There is a smaller deduction in regard to the subsidization of workshops for the blind. I believe that this reduction of the amount which is to be allocated for persons in sheltered employment, requires some explanation from the hon. the Minister, in view of development that has taken place in providing job opportunities for the physically handicapped. In terms of the arrangements which the Government has with various factories, sheltered employment and the subsidization of workers, we can see the Government is doing something to assist these people. The basis upon which sheltered employment is provided, has been in existence for a long time. According to the figures provided by the hon. the Minister earlier this session, there were some 1 800 posts filled out of the 2 000 posts that are allocated to persons in sheltered employment. Many of these people look upon the Government for increases in their rates of pay as and when they show an increase in their productivity. Therefore one should have expected an increase in the amount to be voted rather than a decrease. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister if he has given consideration to reviewing the wages as far as these people are concerned.</p>

<p>If one looks at attempts to assist this group of people, one realizes that there are a number of organizations which do assist them in seeking employment. However, if one looks at the background and at the increases that have occurred with regard to the physically handicapped, one will soon realize that the problem is growing in immensity. Figures indicate that three out of 100 South African babies that are born, are disabled. We know of the ravages of diseases such as polio and cerebral palsy. In addition to this there are the industrial accidents that occur from time to time. Above all this, we have an alarming increase in the number of persons injured in road accidents. It is rather interesting, if one visits one of the schools for the physically handicapped, to see the increasing number of children attending these schools, children who have been injured and physically disabled as a result of road accidents. The latest figures indicate that some 14 000 people suffer serious physical injuries as a result of road accidents per year. This means that the question of finding employment for the school-leavers, and others who are already in employment and have to be reintegrated into the economic field, shall require urgent and additional attention. These children are being trained in 25 of these schools. Many of them are suffering from various disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, etc. They have to attain a certain degree of proficiency before they can seek any form of employment. We know that in other countries a great deal has been done in this regard. In Australia and in the USA recent surveys indicate an alarming number of this population group, percentagewise, to be physically handicapped and disabled. Here in South Africa it is extremely difficult to assess accurately the percentage or the number of people that are required and who require special attention and assistance. If one discusses the matter with people associated with assisting the physically handicapped, it becomes clear that all these people wish to lead as normal a life as possible. Consequently the assistance that is rendered to them by the Department of Labour is appreciated.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to planning for the integration of these people, and particularly for the finding of work for school leavers, we do find a problem. Many of these young people turn to the Department of Labour to find employment. After having a discussion with a vocational officer they are told to call at various firms where there might be vacancies. This can sometimes be very damaging psychologically for the physically handicapped person who has to go from one company or firm to another to find some form of employment. Therefore, I consider it to be essential for the hon. the Minister to give attention to a complete investigation into the position of the physically handicapped persons, into the question of placing them in employment and finding job opportunities for them. I believe it is important that the hon. the Minister should have available to him statistics in order to examine the extent of the problem, to find other avenues of employment and job opportunities for them, to see that they receive the necessary vocational training and to equip them for those opportunities.</p>

<p><span class="col_9157-9158" refersTo="page_0489"/>As I indicated earlier, there is the position of the younger person, the young school leaver, who finds it increasingly difficult to find employment when there is keen competition for any particular job or vacancy where it occurs. If one looks at the position in the Federal Republic of Germany, one is impressed by the tremendous strides that have been made in that country in trying to assist these people. Indeed, in a special survey that was recently undertaken, a survey dealing with the rehabilitation of the physically handicapped, as a result of legislation that was passed in Germany it was found necessary to provide special employment through employers on a percentage bases. 6% of all jobs in a particular type of employment, provided an employer had more than 15 persons in employment, had to be set aside for the severely handicapped. Where this was not done, a compensatory payment has to be made into a fund which is utilized for the betterment and for the promotion of the rehabilitation of these people. In addition to this they have a special arrangement whereby severely handicapped persons receives extended dismissal protection. The dismissal, before being confirmed, must take place in agreement with a welfare officer, so as to ensure that the person is suitably dealt with. There has to be a dismissal period of at least 4 weeks. In addition, they also receive supplementary leave of 6 days during a year so as to assist them. There are, furthermore, various other provisions in regard to the training of these people to ensure that they receive the maximum degree of training in order to assist them in every way.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. Mclachlan</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Umbilo has approached the debate from a different angle, and I, too, should like to enter the debate from a different angle. The hon. member for Umbilo dealt with a type of person in our community who is most definitely receiving the attention of the Government. However, if more could be done for them, it would definitely be welcomed by all of us.</p>

<p>I, from my side, should like to express a few ideas in connection with Coloured labour. I do this against the background of the idea that the basis of our present labour policy is the same as the basis of our ethnic policy, the policy with which the NP has been trusted by the electorate of South Africa for a period of more than 28 years. At times we speak of the Coloureds as an emergent nation. We see the Coloureds as a group of people who are developing politically, socially and in other spheres within our community in a special way. At the moment I do not know what the Theron Commission has to say about them. I shall deal with the factual position with which we are faced at the moment, and nothing more. The fact of the matter is that of our population of just over 21 million, according to the 1970 census, approximately 2 million are Coloureds. Of these 21 million, 8 million are economically active, and of the 2 million Coloureds 700 000 are economically active. As far as the Whites are concerned, we have the position that 1,5 million are economically active, 0,2 million of the Asians are economically active and 5,6 million of the Bantu are economically active. If we make a further analysis of the position as regards the Coloureds, we find that of the total Coloured population 35% of the Coloureds are really economically active. Of the Indians, on the other hand, only 29% are economically active, of the Whites something over 40% and of the Bantu something in the region of 37%. The fact is that 10% of our total population is Coloured, and about 700 000 of approximately 2 million are economically active, as I have already said. Here we have a large number of people in our community to whom we have to see, and these people are relatively poor. They are employed in the unskilled and semi-skilled trades. These people constitute a very small percentage of the more highly skilled trades, of the professional trades in the higher technical classes, etc. In addition we have another phenomenon. Sometimes we hear that basically the Coloureds are not very reliable in the field of labour. There is a degree of work-shyness, but we do not have the statistics to enlarge of this.</p>

<p>What we do have in the official statistics is proof of a very large labour turnover amongst the Coloureds due to resignations and dismissals which have a connection with this work-shyness, although, on the other hand, they may also have a connection with seasonal labour in various parts of the country. But the fact remains that this figure is very much higher than amongst the other population groups. We find that in the manufacturing industry, in various sectors of this industry, the <span class="col_9159-9160" refersTo="page_0490"/>Coloureds work far shorter hours than any of the other population groups, with a few exceptions, for example, in the tobacco industry where they work longer hours per week. But on the average they work much shorter hours. They also work less overtime. Far fewer of them are economically active, as I have already proved. That is to say, if we take an overall view, we find that physically the Coloureds make a smaller contribution to the economy of our country, to the things about which we have a great deal to say; growth rate, higher productivity, and combating inflation, etc. I am not saying this to disparage those people; there may be social and other circumstances which give rise to this. I am saying this, however, to emphasize the point that we shall have one million people here before long, and together with the Asians we shall have more than one million people who, relatively speaking, actually make a very small contribution to the things which should in fact help us to establish a strong economy so that we may be of assistance in uplifting those less developed peoples. Now my question is whether we can afford this. I say we cannot afford it, Sir. The Government is indeed prepared to help the Coloureds and to protect them just as it is prepared to help the Whites and to protect the Whites. Indeed, it is protecting the Coloured in more than one respect already, <i>inter alia,</i> by means of job reservation, which the opposite side of this House wants to have abolished. I see as the answer to these things only one concept, a concept which we must introduce into our terminology, and consequently into our policy as well. We must start speaking of a Coloured labour policy. If this group of people is seen as a separate group in our community, one which may ultimately be dealt with in a separate way in a political sphere, I think a special approach is necessary in respect of the one factor which is going to be instrumental in uplifting them, viz. their labour. Consequently it is necessary to speak of a Coloured labour policy just as we speak of a Bantu and a White labour policy.</p>

<p>It is estimated that by 1980 the Whites will constitute only 13% of our economically active population. It is time that an attempt is being made to make good that shortage with immigrants, but surely it is clear that this is not the answer. Now the question arises whether we should not look at certain matters once again in working out a labour policy for the Coloureds. I have made a note of some of these, but because of lack of time, I shall not be able to deal with all of them. Included in those matters is the question of supply and demand on the Coloured labour market or on the labour market as a whole, and the source from which the available Coloured labour comes. Then there is the question of training and upgrading, the question of a recruitment policy for Coloured labour so as to combat the problem which the hon. member for Morreesburg raised the other day, viz. the concentration of Coloured squatters in the Western Cape while huge extensions are being undertaken on the West Coast, which, traditionally is a Coloured area. Planning has to be undertaken so as to ensure that these people will be attracted to the areas which have the employment opportunities. Serious consideration will have to be given to the contribution which the Coloured women are able to make. The major stumbling block, however, is the Coloureds&#x2019; attitude to labour as a whole, especially as far as the wage gap is concerned, so that the Coloureds may realize what the narrowing of this gap means. In this regard the Department of Labour will have to bring in other State departments in order to provide assistance. Hon. members on this side of the House are not always present when the Opposition, especially the PRP, speaks to the Coloureds. We do not know what they tell the Coloureds, but we listen to their speeches in this House. If one reads what they have already said this session, it becomes apparent that they are telling the Coloureds: &#x201C;We shall give you a small seat somewhere in a federal context.&#x201D; Having said this, however, they leave the people with another question which is unanswered and this is: What will happen to your economy? What will happen to your labour position? What will happen to your place on the labour market? What are you able to contribute to combating inflation and developing the country&#x2019;s economy? The industrial development of South Africa and the stable economy will have to grow and it will have to grow not only in the interests of the Whites as some people are inclined to think. Whatever is done in this regard, will have to be done for the very advancement of the Coloureds and their development as well. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Westdene has drawn the <span class="col_9161-9162" refersTo="page_0491"/>attention of this House to the situation of the Coloured people and has once again emphasized the policy of the Government in its determination to put different people into different compartments. He went so far as to suggest that there ought to be a special labour policy for the Coloured people. I believe this is a fiction; this cannot happen. Earlier on in this debate I tried to indicate that our economy is indivisible. If we are going to have a labour policy, it must therefore be a labour policy embracing all workers in South Africa. It may well be that special attention will have to be given to one group or another because of the historical factors involved in the development in South Africa. But to reinforce and formalize this, I believe, cannot be done. I hope it will be resisted.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs, when he replied to my own contribution earlier on in the debate, tried to make the point that the Opposition on both sides always sought to make political capital out of this very serious problem of a labour policy for a growing industrial giant in Southern Africa, this despite the fact that both the hon. member for Hillbrow and myself said at the beginning of our speeches that our primary concern was with the economic growth in South Africa and with industrial peace. The reason why I raised the two major areas of labour representation on the one hand and migrant labour on the other, was because, unless we resolve these two key problems in South Africa, economic growth is at risk. If we do not go beyond that and resolve these two issues, I believe that industrial peace in South Africa can well be threatened.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said about job reservation. I confess that I have not intended raising this matter again. It has been raised year after year and certainly has been raised a number of times by a number of speakers today. I believe that in essence job reservation is an insult to the White worker. That is all it is. It is an insult to the White worker, because what the Government is saying is that the White worker cannot stand on his own feet.</p>

<p>The whole policy of job reservation is an insult. It is the same as saying that a White worker does not have the ability to do the work. We on this side of the House believe that the White man can stand on his own two feet and does not have to be protected in this way. Let us be very clear on this issue. That does not mean that when we talk about Blacks moving into a whole hierarchy of jobs, from which they have been precluded up to now, that we are saying that we need not have regard for the people who have been doing this work up to now. This does not mean that one must push people aside and throw them out of jobs. Of course not! That is why one does it by means of consultation; one does it in the course of the development of an industry, whatever that industry may be.</p>

<p>When we come to labour representation a number of responses have been made here today. The hon. member for Rustenburg unfortunately flits in and out of the House and is not here at present. He made a number of scathing remarks about hon. members in these benches. He said amongst other things that the Black man in South Africa and in Africa as a whole is simply not ready for trade unions. He seems to forget the very history of our country, where over 50 years ago there existed a very powerful Black trade union. Many remarks have also been made concerning other countries in Africa and, indeed, other countries in the world. When one looks at the history and at the present situation of the trade union in Zambia, for example, one finds that their record in terms of work stoppages is one of the best in the world. There a trade union does exist where all its key office bearers just happen to be Black. This business of always saying that we must relate everything to the customs of the people and that we must keep them back in some sort of tribal mentality for the rest of their lives, is totally at odds with the growing industrialization in South Africa and we have simply got to come to terms with that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal spoke about the British delegation that came to South Africa. I spent a full day underground in a mine with that British delegation, showing them the developments which have taken place in one of the mines in the Free State. I <span class="col_9163-9164" refersTo="page_0492"/>had a very long discussion, debate and argument with Mr. Jack Jones. I want to tell the hon. member for Bethal that Mr. Jack Jones completely misunderstands the situation in South Africa. Mr. Chairman, you know what it is like when these foreigners come along and try to tell us what to do. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The real test in trying to prove that Mr. Jones is wrong is that if any Black trade union goes to the Department of Labour and tries to refer complaints of workers who belong to their trade union, the Department of Labour will not take these complaints up. We have a number of instances on record of this happening. That is why I say that Mr. Jones is completely missing the point, and I therefore implore the hon. member for Bethal not to listen to these foreigners. [Interjections.] The political implications, of course, are great&#x2014;and of course there are political implications in the trade union movement. Anyone who does not recognize that fact does not understand what trade unions are all about. For example, we all know that Dr. Albert Hertzog was the main speaker at a meeting of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union only last year, and he was the main speaker there for a very good reason. So I warn this Government to watch very carefully for political &#x201C;inmenging&#x201D; with trade unions. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>There is a last point I want to make about trade unions. Hon. members opposite constantly hold out the example of British trade unions, as if this were the only system in the world. Only last year in this debate, however, reference was made to the German system of trade unions. We have talked about the decline of sterling and the way the pound has devalued, but what about the German mark? This is a very dominant currency in the world today, and Germany has one of the finest and best trade union systems in the world. One of the reasons why they have so little trouble is because on the one hand there is a national trade union movement for all workers, while on the other hand there are works councils that work in a complementary system. That is what we ought to have in this country.</p>

<p>I am in a great hurry, but I do want to put one further question to the hon. the Minister. I want to refer to the whole question of unemployment in South Africa. All of us are aware of the fact that jobs are getting scarcer. One is aware of the down-turn in the economy and one hopes this will not last very much longer. However, if one reads the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>&#x2014;one of the favourite newspapers on that side of the House&#x2014;one sees, and I quote, that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More than 1 000 Coloured artisans in the engineering industry on the Reef are reported to be out of work.</block>

<p>I merely quote this as one single example. The point I am trying to drive home here to the hon. the Minister is that we still have no record whatsoever of the number of Blacks or unemployed in South Africa, and I say this in the light of the rise in unemployment, which is always a very dangerous thing in any country, but specifically in South Africa.</p>

<p>I asked another Minister last year whether consideration had been given to the registration of unemployment Bantu and the reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No, because unemployment Bantu are already required to register as work-seekers at labour bureaux.</block>

<p>Whenever we want to know what the rate of unemployment amongst Blacks in South Africa is, there is no reply from the department or from the Government. My plea is that this reply should be given today.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pinelands said, <i>inter alia,</i> that work reservation provides protection to the White workers, which is actually an insult to them. Perhaps I should speak to him in a language which he will be able to understand better. I therefore say: Do not judge in order that you may not be judged yourself, or as they say in Holland: &#x201C;Practise what you preach.&#x201D; He speaks of protection which insults the Whites, but how should we understand his condemnation if he begrudges the Blacks a place in the streets of Pinelands let alone in industry or other places of employment? It was <span class="col_9165-9166" refersTo="page_0493"/>that hon. member who objected to the presence of the Blacks in the streets of Pinelands. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>However, I want to deal with another subject this afternoon, and that is the shortage of White artisans. In the latest report of the Department of Labour, in the manpower survey which was made in 1973, I see that the metal and engineering trades experienced the biggest shortage of White artisans, namely 6 565. In the building industry there was a shortage of 4 034 and in the motor industry 2 374. This is a total shortage of 16 800 artisans.</p>

<p>If the White workers are channelled and trained properly, there would not be a shortage of White artisans. I want to prove my statement on the basis of the following: At the moment slightly more than 70 000 White operators are employed in South Africa as against a skilled labour corps of 226 500 Whites. This amounts to approximately a quarter of the total White labour force being in posts which are classified as &#x201C;operator&#x201D;. I respect the work which anyone does and I believe that each of those 70 000 Whites are proud of their work. However, I believe that those 70 000 operators could be used to far more advantage in our industry. Operators are usually the people who are the first to be exposed to unemployment when there is an economic recession. I believe that we could use those people far more productively as full-fledged artisans.</p>

<p>I know that a great deal is being done to train White adults. I am thinking for instance of Westlake where excellent work is being done and where approximately 200 White men per annum are receiving intensive training at the moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mcintosh">

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and it was also done before the Haas Das programme was started. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Since the training scheme was begun in 1951, 2 286 of the people who registered there, have achieved artisan status. However, I believe that not enough is being done to train adult White males in order to obtain artisan status.</p>

<p>Is there not a possibility of having a similar institution to that of Westlake established for the Witwatersrand? A new institution like this would, after all, be situated in the heart of our industrial complex. The remuneration which is at present being paid to people who receive their training at Westlake&#x2014;basically it is R20 per week plus R10 per week for every dependant&#x2014;is not sufficient for a man with a family. I often come across unqualified people who would like to receive training like that provided at Westlake, but they do not see their way clear to going to Westlake from the Witwatersrand. Westlake is situated far away from the Witwatersrand and a man with a family on the Witwatersrand does not see his way clear to going so far away from his family in order to undergo training. If an institution such as Westlake should be made available to the Witwatersrand, we could also think of making it possible for people to receive part-time training in specialized directions, whether by evening classes, or classes on Saturdays.</p>

<p>One also hears complaints of firms not affording certain people the opportunity of gaining practical experience. It is often a question of the person simply having to gain the necessary practical experience in order to qualify for a higher profession. I wonder whether the Department of Labour could not arrange for those people who want to qualify as full-fledged artisans, to be employed in firms which are prepared to provide the necessary training.</p>

<p>However, there is another reason for the shortage of qualified artisans, and I want to place the blame for this squarely upon the shoulders of those industries who are indulging in wasteful exploitation as far as our young boys at school are concerned. They entice these young boys away from school by offering them attractive salaries. Those boys then have to work as operators without receiving any training at all and without having the opportunity of qualifying as full-fledged artisans.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to appeal to our schools to warn our boys against this evil. Rather let the boy enter a certain sphere and qualify in a trade in which there is a future for him. I want to ask our industrialists to show more responsibility towards the young boys by offering them the opportunity of qualifying in a sphere in which there is a future.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question of trade unions, a question about which a great deal has been <span class="col_9167-9168" refersTo="page_0494"/>said. Once again, the hon. member for Hillbrow, as he does year after year, asked that we should open the door for mixed trade unions and Black trade unions. Perhaps I may just refer him to someone whom, I think, is a greater authority in the sphere of industry and a greater economist than what he likes to think he is. The person I am referring to is an ex-United Party MP on top of that. I am referring to Dr. Frans Cronje, who serves in their executive and is one of the executives in their party organization. On 3 September 1975 he said, <i>inter alia</i> the following during an interview with <i>Die Vaderland</i>&#x2014;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. LIGTHELM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Boksburg will pardon me if I do not respond to his speech. This is the first opportunity I have to pay tribute to my predecessor, Mr. Marais Viljoen, who represented my constituency for 23 years. Since he was also a Minister of Labour for a long time, I should like to pay tribute to him specifically for the labour peace which prevailed in the constituency while he represented it and also while he was Minister of Labour. Then I also want to tell the new Minister of Labour that we know that during the years in which he was Minister of Water Affairs, a great deal of rain fell and many dams were built. We trust that the Department of Labour will also achieve the same success under his supervision.</p>

<p>This afternoon, I should like to talk about job satisfaction. The most important source for any industry or business is its employees. If those employees are unwilling, uninterested or unskilled to carry out their duties and responsibilities with dedication and satisfaction, the best equipment, tools or methods for achieving efficiency, will not be able to produce the desired results. No machine can offer the unique characteristic of the human factor of initiative and imagination in solving problems. In addition man is the only elastic source of effectiveness. Man is able to progress through growth and experience. Therefore the human factor is the most important factor when it comes to effectiveness. I should like to indicate that job satisfaction is more important than salary or wage.</p>

<p>Various studies and research have been carried out. In the USA R. Stranger published findings in his book, <i>Psychology of Industrial Conflict</i> to the effect that workers in the retail trade, the chemical industries and office workers placed job satisfaction as being first and salary as being third in importance to them. A similar investigation in South Africa by Drs. Sandra and Andre van der Merwe of the University of Stellenbosch proved that achievement, promotion and recognition are considered more important than salary. This was the opinion of employees in the retail trade and office workers. Similar studies have also been undertaken in Sweden and Australia and in other parts of the world. Researchers there came to the same conclusion. Therefore it is necessary for an industry or any organization to realize that recognition, security, promotion, perks and status symbols are among the most important considerations they <span class="col_9169-9170" refersTo="page_0495"/>can offer their employees. The manner in which these points may be implemented and dealt with in an organization determines the quality of the management, the quality of the workmanship and the degree of satisfaction among the employees.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is the duty and responsibility of every successful employer to ensure that every employee is granted the opportunity of working effectively. In order to achieve this, the relationship between employer and employee is of the utmost importance. It is important that they should take cognizance of each other&#x2019;s inspirations, skills, ideals and aspirations and appreciate them. A climate must be created in which an employee is afforded the opportunity of finding and achieving satisfaction in his work. There must therefore be a good employer-employee relationship. The management and the manager must recognize the human element and involvement in his or her work. People must be motivated in their work because only then will they carry out their duties effectively. There must be communication between employer and employee because this will result in team work and purposefulness.</p>

<p>In these times when we are dealing with inflation, every organization or undertaking needs creative talent more than analytical thought, because creative talent is what keeps man, the employee, the labourer, active and dynamic in his goal of effectiveness. When one has the opportunity to display creative thought in one&#x2019;s work, one finds satisfaction in one&#x2019;s work. Effectiveness results in increased productivity and therefore in increased profits, which in their turn determine the salaries or wages. The person who achieves most as a result of a condition of job satisfaction, is nevertheless remunerated for his contribution in the end. However, it is important to realize that from the ranks of the top management through the entire organization, the need for recognition is of the utmost importance. Paying attention to this need can indeed alleviate a great deal of pressure from the financial aspects. It must be borne in mind that we are working with people and all they ask from their employers, is that when results are achieved, they should receive their due for it and be treated as people and as individuals.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to react to the speech of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I only hope that he will derive great satisfaction from his new job. He has a safe seat, and now he is trying to curry favour with the hon. the Minister. [Interjections.] This is a good way to begin his career here. Sir, I am pleased that the hon. member for Boksburg mentioned Westlake. This is a fine UP institution which was established in the interests of the White workers. I have no fault to find with the hon. member&#x2019;s plea for another and similar institution to be established in the Transvaal, because I think the better we train our labour force, the better it will be for the country and I am convinced that a similar institution in the Transvaal will be able to serve a good purpose.</p>

<p>I do not think that hon. members on the opposite side of this House understand our policy in respect of trade unions. We are not opposed to industrial representation, whether in the form of works committees, liaison committees or trade unions. We do not have an ideological standpoint which supports trade unions only. However, we accept that trade unions do exist and, as the hon. member for Maitland put it, one either has to accept them or destroy them. One cannot allow the existence of a vacuum in which these people may float about. After all, hon. members on that side of the House ought to know in what Dr. Albert Hertzog is engaged at the moment, but it is easy to keep an eye on him. If trade unions are not registered, however, we do not know what is going on, and this is the source of danger.</p>

<p>I think the Government has realized at long last how important a trained and skilled Black labour force is. It is probably difficult for the Government to admit that the UP, as usual has pointed out the way to the Government in the field of labour. Now the Government is offering major tax concessions to employers to train non-Whites; the Department of Bantu Education has established in-service training centres, and everywhere today Blacks are doing work which they never did 30 years ago. Gert Beetge worked for my father at one time, and if a Black man were to have picked up a hammer at that time, all the Whites would have left immediately. These days Blacks everywhere are doing work which they never did before. The Government accepts this and I personally consider our Blacks to be an asset and an untapped source of riches for our economy. The Black labourer constitutes no <span class="col_9171-9172" refersTo="page_0496"/>threat to the White man, if the Black man is properly trained, and is paid the same wage for the same work with the same responsibilities. If this policy is not going to be implemented, the position of the White worker is going to be undermined in the long term. In the short term, job reservation is in the interest of the White worker, but in the long term, as the White worker becomes an ever decreasing minority of the percentage of workers, it is going to be of no importance and is going to undermine their position.</p>

<p>I want to come back to what the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark said here. I have to assume that this hon. member is the chairman of the NP&#x2019;s labour group. The hon. member said the following with reference to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He ought to know that a wage is determined according to the job that has to be done and not according to the colour of the worker&#x2019;s skin.</block>

<p>This is the UP&#x2019;s policy. If this is done, the Black man as well as the White man will be protected, because then an employer will not pay a Black man an inferior wage to do the same job as a White man, and consequently the White man will not be undermined.</p>

<p>Through job reservation the Government is undermining the White man, because job reservation causes employers to employ a Black man, a Coloured or an Indian in the same job but at a lower wage. In this way the White man is being exploited.</p>

<p>We need an established Black labour force and I believe that migratory labour runs absolutely contrary to this principle. If I were a member of a church or of a synod, I would have disciplined a Christian Nationalist Government if it persisted in implementing a policy of compulsory migratory labour in South Africa. It is a source of misery and it is a glaring injustice which the Black man is being done. Not only does it destroy the family life and moral life of the Blacks, but also the contribution of these people to the economy of the country. All I am asking is for the hon. the Minister as a new Minister&#x2014;and we are told by the hon. members on the opposite side who are sitting around the hon. the Minister making purring sounds, that he is entering a fine career&#x2014;to say that his Government is prepared to move away from compulsory migratory labour. His colleague, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development says that if the people of the Transkei become independent and if the Black Xhosa-speaking South African citizens accept Transkeian citizenship, they will have a better opportunity in the cities than previously. So why can the hon. the Minister not ask these people to move away from the system of migratory labour? After all, his colleague has left the door open for him to move in that direction.</p>

<p>We have heard a great deal about unemployment amongst the Blacks over the past two years, especially in view of the recession we had in our economy. We accept that there has been unemployment, and that there still is. What I want to know from the hon. the Minister, however, is what he thinks the situation would have been had the mining industry not created 90 000 new employment opportunities for Blacks in 1975. I think we must take cognizance of the fact that 90 000 Blacks were given employment opportunities which did not, exist previously. These thousands of Blacks were given employment opportunities without such opportunities having cost us a cent. What a difference this is to the XDC and the BDC, which cost us millions of rands to create a few thousand employment opportunities in the homelands. I believe, and I want to urge the hon. the Minister to do this, that we should introduce a thorough administrative system of labour statistics in respect of the Blacks in the country. We cannot carry on if we do not know how many Blacks do not have employment; if we do not know what the position is. Suddenly, within a period of 12 months, 90 000 new employment opportunities were created for Blacks in our mining industry. However, we see nothing in this regard in the general economy. There is no shortage of Black labour. How high is the unemployment rate amongst Blacks? I believe that we should know this, because these people are going to become more and more important in our economic life.</p>

<p>I want to return to the aspect of Black labour on the mines, a matter which the hon. member for Stilfontein also raised. This is the strongest possible lever which we have at our disposal <span class="col_9173-9174" refersTo="page_0497"/>for raising our economy to greater heights. It is a fact that our mining industry is becoming more and more dependent on South African Black labour. I believe that this can make a major contribution towards the development of our economic life by building up a consumer corps amongst the Blacks, by giving them decent conditions in respect of their family life and by combating over-population in the homelands by attracting people to our towns and cities, to the mines throughout the whole country.</p>

<p>I also want to mention the importance of obtaining labour from the tropical zones, as they are known I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us&#x2014;now or during the discussion of the next Vote&#x2014;what the position is as regards recruiting Black labour from the tropical zones. How many people come from Malawi and those places? Do they still come here, and if they do not, why not? What attempts is the hon. the Minister making to bring them here? [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not wish to delay for long, because one cannot achieve anything in ten minutes. Nor am I at all in favour of these short ten minute speeches. No decent speaker can say what he wants to in ten minutes. It is built into the policy of separate development in South Africa that migrant labour will virtually come to an end in the future. The hon. member must just understand that, but I do not have the time to go into that now.</p>

<p>Today I want to discuss two matters. Against the background of the annual entry into the labour market of economically active sections of the population, I want to say two things. I want to discuss a sound population policy; then I want to discuss a proper education programme which must provide for the inculcation from an early age&#x2014;from Std. 1&#x2014;of a labour awareness in our country. About 200 000 economically active people enter in the labour market annually. The second point is that our population pressure is increasing. The annual population increase per thousand per annum among the Whites is about 21, among the Coloureds 38,2, among the Asiatics 32 and among the Bantu, 39. This implies about 600 000 new people per annum in South Africa. Sir, what is this pushing us towards? It is pushing us towards bigger schemes; Saldanha and Richards Bay, etc. It is pushing us towards a greater need and towards greater and sustained growth in order to provide employment. Thirdly, it is pushing us towards a greater need for production volume. Fourthly, it is pushing us towards the realization that everything relating to growth, everything relating to the labour market, must be supported to an increasing extent by schooling and by technology. It is forcing us to a fuller realization that in order to provide so many people with an infrastructure, food and services, these will all be processes and actions which involve technology and science as essential and indispensable components. We must realize that out of three groups in this country, the Blacks, the Asiatics and the Coloureds&#x2014;their technological progress; their technological ability to progress; the capital available to provide for their technological progress&#x2014;the increase in their numbers is such that in the years that lie ahead we shall never be able to master it. We shall never be able to build a sufficient number of houses and schools. We cannot keep pace with the population increase. We shall have to realize urgently that a realistic population policy is an absolute necessity. Other countries in the world are openly engaged in this. We shall have to realize that in order to escape from the tragedy which Uhuru has brought to Africa&#x2014;in countries without a population policy and without a proper labour evaluation and education programme&#x2014;we shall have to learn that political emancipation and the political freedom we are now acquiring through the liberation of some of the Bantu&#x2014;in fact we are now only making a start with our process of liberation&#x2014;does not really bring about any true freedom unless labour awareness and a realistic ability to evaluate labour, capacity for work and the task of labour, is instilled in every young child.</p>

<p>Thousands of speeches have been made in this House about the political rights of Coloureds, Bantu, Whites and Asiatics; thousands of speeches about accommodation, schools, roads to be built, about subsidies awarded, family allowances and pensions. There have been hundreds of speeches about our mineral wealth, our strategic position, the necessity for the preservation of our identity and about language awareness. We have had hundreds of speeches comparing us with Black States elsewhere. But very little has ever been said in this House about the crime and the <span class="col_9175-9176" refersTo="page_0498"/>outrage and the injustice of seeing a stream of children enter the world, Brown, Black, White and Yellow, seeing them born, and then seeing them a prey to the misery and suffering of aimlessness in their work, of being misplaced in their work and of seeing them falling prey to the terror of numbers. I ask that in view of the vast inflow that is being experienced as a result of the population explosion, we feel called upon to give urgent attention to the implementation of a realistic population policy. In no syllabus in our schools do I find provision being made for children to be orientated towards labour awareness. We often discuss language, status and sport, but there is no such thing as a syllabus which includes a course to impress upon the child and the young person at an early age what it means to be a worker and to perform a labour task in connection with one&#x2019;s home, one&#x2019;s nation and one&#x2019;s country. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give me an opportunity to compile such a course. I shall take ten men from this House of Assembly and we shall compile a syllabus from Std. 1 which will ensure that when they matriculate our children will be able to evaluate work and will believe in work as they believe in the Christian religion which is instilled into them from the cradle. When labour awareness blurs, when it is not cultivated, or when it is ousted by other evaluations, then this constitutes a warning to a people. As a result, we are maintaining a totally unrealistic standard of living. The burden of debt is increasing and the number of summonses has reached record proportions. We are based entirely on the evaluation of Black labour. And this is based on the presence of the Black man within our economy. A spending fever has broken out among the workers, the producers and the youth. An extravagant community spirit, like an evil spirit, has begun to move our people. When workers resist work, and spend more than they earn, when a people relies on mineral wealth, when a people constantly and vociferously maintains that South Africa should be kept White and that they will fight for their White identity and will demand equal language rights; if we are not prepared to perform physical labour; if we measure our fitness by what is achieved on the sports field; when we seek our release in ever-increasing consumption of liquor; when we want to conceal our guilty conscience behind an unprecedented holiday fever; when a voter uses his vote to hold a pistol to my head when I warn him against laziness, unproductivity, love of ease, spending fever and status seeking, and when we omit to introduce new dimensions into our evaluation of labour, then it is late in the day.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Carletonville is always an interesting speaker and I always enjoy listening to him. However, I think he surpassed himself today and made one of the best speeches I have ever heard him make. It really was an excellent speech. I agree with much of what he said, particularly with what he said at the end of his speech. I think far too much is said, inside as well as outside the House, on matters such as political rights and housing, while not enough emphasis is placed on a sense of responsibility and self-control among the various population groups of South Africa.</p>

<p>However, I want to deal with another speech I found interesting and with a statement made by the hon. member for Boksburg.</p>

<p>&#x2020; The hon. member for Boksburg referred to the fact that there were 70 000 people who were qualified artisans in South Africa. He felt that the figure was too high and that White artisans who were qualified were the first to be in danger in times of unemployment or of industrial recession. I take the opposite view. I believe that not enough White people are being trained as artisans in South Africa at the moment. I think there are far too many untrained Whites in South Africa and therefore a very great need for artisan training for White people.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to the apprenticeship system. As I understand the qualifications prescribed for becoming an artisan, one can enter into an apprenticeship for a period of five years, one does 10 weeks of study at a technical college, without having to write any examinations. One then becomes an artisan by effluxion of time. In other words, one can get one&#x2019;s trade after a period of five years. I think that this system, if I see it correctly, should be looked at once again, because I do not believe that a person who, by effluxion of time gets a trade, is necessarily an efficient artisan or someone who is able to do the work that an artisan should do. The other method is by qualification through a trade school. There is only one trade school for Whites in South Africa and that is the National Trade School at <span class="col_9177-9178" refersTo="page_0499"/>Westlake. Last year there were 180 admissions; only 180 Whites were able to get into the Westlake Trade School, the only school of its kind for Whites in South Africa, but there were over 400 applications. The way by which they qualify for partisanship at Westlake is to do one year of theory and practice and then a year of apprenticeship in the commercial market. The allowances at Westlake have always been a cause for complaint, but these have improved in the last year or two. I think the hon. the Minister can consider, in the light of the increased cost of living, improving them still more. I would say to him, however, that there is a further irritant at the moment and that is the fact that the people who are at Westlake for training are only issued with two uniforms a year. This is wholly inadequate for a full year&#x2019;s training at Westlake. He could perhaps also look into that matter.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one or two problems arising from the school. First of all the admission age is 21, whereas for Coloured training schools the admission age is 16. The difficulty is that a young man is able to do his national service only at the age of 18 and then does either a year, 18 months or two years. Many of them spend a couple of years doing nothing after their national service before being able to enlist at the age of 21 as a trainee at the Westlake school. On the other hand, there are those people who leave school at the age of 16 as a result of broken homes or as a result of having to go out&#x2014;perhaps being forced by parents to do so&#x2014;and work. They do nothing for two years until they can do their national service at the age of 18 and after they had done their period of service in the army, they have to find something to do until they can get into the trade school at Westlake. What a waste of time and labour.</p>

<p>Another point I want to make is that it appears that there are no new trades created. I would have thought that in the age of television and of the computer, there would be a necessity to create new trades and Westlake, I know, feels that new trades should be created and that they should be given instructions along those lines.</p>

<p>Then we also have the position of a dual system in terms of which the Westlake trade school is under the joint control of the Department of Labour and of the Department of National Education. There is an overlapping of the functions of the two departments, and that will have to be looked at as well. One of the greatest evils, I think, is the growing number of unqualified, untrained White youths in the Republic. Not enough attention is being given to the training of young Whites, and I prove my point merely by saying that Westlake is the only trade school for Whites in South Africa. To an increasing extent there is going to be competition from non-Whites, and according to the programme of this Government there is going to be greater training for non-Whites. I consequently feel that there is a tremendous potential drain on the State arising from the existence of many unqualified, untrained White people. I also believe that this is harmful to White security as a whole. It also leads to the possibility of racialism amongst Whites who are resentful of the training opportunities now being given to the non-White people. I therefore say that the Government has to give further consideration to training as many White people for the highest possible positions for which they can qualify.</p>

<p>Another point I want to make is that too many Whites retire early. I think greater use could be made of the services of elderly Whites after they have retired, and I believe that one way in which they can be kept in the labour market, acting productively, is by way of taxation incentives. I believe that we need every single White in South Africa to work productively and to continue to work until he cannot work any longer. There is far too much inducement for people to retire too young and then to be utterly unproductive. When this hon. Minister was Minister of Forestry, he launched with success a programme known as &#x201C;Our Green Heritage&#x201D;. I think the time has come for him to give consideration to the launching of a similar campaign in his capacity as Minister of Labour, something like &#x201C;Work for your own Survival&#x201D;. I think this is particularly applicable to the White man because there is a tendency amongst Whites in South Africa today, at all levels and in all spheres, to take things too easily and not to realize that they have to work to survive. Something he must also be aware of is the fact that there are a growing number of first-class matriculants who do not go on to university and that there are a great number of young Whites who leave school in Std. 8 or Std. 9 and who obviously can not go on to university but are unable to receive any technical training. I think that this matter must be given <span class="col_9179-9180" refersTo="page_0500"/>very careful consideration because it is endangering the position of the Whites in general.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by making a few remarks about Coloureds. I am looking forward to receiving the Theron Report. I hope it will be tabled soon. I also hope that one of the most important aspects of that report will be the proper utilization of the Coloured work force because there are far too many don&#x2019;t-works and won&#x2019;t-works amongst the Coloured people. They are creating all sorts of social problems for us. Many of them are work-shy. As has been said this afternoon, they work shorter hours, they change jobs too frequently, they are disinclined to take on overtime and many of them drift into crime. I would be surprised if that report does not bear out what I have been saying, namely that the crime figures amongst young Coloured people, particularly the don&#x2019;t-works and the won&#x2019;t-works, are probably higher than amongst any other population group in South Africa. I hope that as a result of that report there will be some form of compulsory upliftment programme launched by the Government for the Coloured people. As I have already said, just as the fact that there are far too many untrained and badly trained White people constitutes a danger for the White people themselves, so there is an enormous number of don&#x2019;t-works and won&#x2019;t works&#x2014;In fact generally work-shy people&#x2014;amongst the Coloured people who are endangering not only the position of the Coloureds but also the security of the population as a whole as a result of the fact that they take to crime.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Simonstown made a very constructive contribution to this debate and I am sure the hon. the Minister will reply to it more fully. I just want to point out that I wholeheartedly associate myself with what he said with regard to the fact that we should perhaps retire at a more advanced age. What he said in connection with the fact that we should give more attention to labour reminded me of the Latin saying which we could really take to heart, and that is: &#x201C;Laborare est orare&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, &#x201C;to work is to pray&#x201D;. I think this could be very meaningful for all our people.</p>

<p>I now just want to deal with something which the hon. member for Pinelands said earlier today and which was also raised by the hon. member for Pinetown. It concerns the issue of migrant labour. The issue as to whether serious sociological and social problems are bound up with migrant labour is not a matter concerning which one would argue with those hon. members. As the hon. member for Carletonville said, the solution to the problem of migrant labour is to be found in this very policy of the NP. The hon. member for Pinelands suggested that a commission be appointed to investigate the entire matter. I do not know whether there are any industrialists in his constituency, nor do I know whether he realizes what benefits are being offered to industrialists with a specific aim of persuading them to decentralize. In South Africa it is not sufficiently stressed that industrialists should not remain in the cosmopolitan areas, but should decentralize to those places where the labour is available. One would really have thought that it would be advantageous to everyone to take his industry to a place where the labour is available. If, then the Decentralization Board asks that the White/Black ratio in labour be one to two and a half or three, then it is none but the kindred spirits of the hon. member for Pinelands who oppose this and advance the ingenious argument that a specific industry must be locality-bound. After all, surely one has to think along the lines of decentralization if one wants to reduce migrant labour. However, the hon. members cannot proclaim anything of the kind too loudly, because that would amount to support for our homeland policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands also referred to the system of trade unions and said that we should not necessarily look at the trade union system of Britain; we should look at the trade union system of Germany. Why can we not further develop a South African system of our own? I should like to refer the hon. member to an interview which Mr. Van Zyl, managing director of a well-known clothing factory held recently with a press representative and in which he adopted a particularly favourable approach to the issue of liaison committees. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons bedryf se uitgangspunt is dat bestuur en werker &#x2019;n eenheid vorm waarin voortdurende skakeling moet plaasvind. Daarom sien ons dat hierdie eenheid die beste verwesenlik word deur wedersydse <span class="col_9181-9182" refersTo="page_0501"/>skakeling binne &#x2019;n skakelkomitee waar die werkers en die bestuur saam om &#x2019;n tafel sit.</block>

<p>He concluded the interview by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Solank die Regering die arbeidklimaat deur middle van goeie wetgewing reg hou, rus die verantwoordelikheid op die nyweraar self om die inisiatief te neem om &#x2019;n gesonde, eg Suid-Afrikaanse skakelkomitee-stelsel uit te bou.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands can leave it to the new hon. Minister of Labour further to cause the liaison committee system to develop further into a truly South African system which will be satisfactory to everyone, employer and employee.</p>

<p>As far as job reservation is concerned, the hon. the Minister said in his message in the Swamsa bulletin&#x2014;the mouthpiece of the South West African Municipal Staff Association&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Een van die vernaamste funksies van &#x2019;n Minister van Arbeid en sy department is die handhawing van arbeidsrus en -vrede. Om hierdie funksie te vervul, moet die Minister en sy departement voortdurend trag om die samewerking en welwillendheid van sowel die vakvereniging as die werkgewerorganisasie te bekom en te behou.</block>

<p>That is a clear statement. The reason for labour peace and order having prevailed in South Africa over the past few decades is the fact that the Government has correctly perceived and evaluated its most important task in the field of labour.</p>

<p>One of the cornerstones on which sound relations with our employer organizations is undoubtedly based, is specifically the aspect of job reservation. On 31 December 1974, only 26 job reservation determinations were in force, and, calculated on the basis of the manpower situation in 1975, this represents 2,3% of the labour force. The hon. member for South Coast said that there were no statistics of prosecutions under section 77. He is probably unaware of the fact that in 1975 there were only 65 prosecutions in terms of section 77. These prosecutions were only in respect of the building industry. Only 88 employers were involved. Without enforcing section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act there is always the understanding that in this delicate sphere there will be no infringements. There are still calls, even from influential people, for job reservation to disappear. I just want to say that the people concerned are playing with fire. The issue here is not productivity, but a state of mind. This is something which the hon. members of the Opposition cannot understand. The issue here is a state of mind and the matter of security. The issue is social security. This, in turn, is something which gives rise to greater productivity. It is not the issue that, as was advanced here, people who are too lazy to work are being protected, or that this is an insult to the White man. The issue is one of social security. If one does not have social security, one cannot be productive.</p>

<p>They represent a mere 2%.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>The point at issue is not the 2%, but the understanding that section 77 is there to preserve the social security of all the nations. If any of them does not do their work properly, the employer knows what to do. Even in these times of a slack economy we note that among employers there is far too much seeking for loopholes by which to evade the provisions relating to job reservation, and this is being done solely for motives of profit. The conclusion to which I want to come in connection with this matter is that the NP is not going to interfere with the social security of our people. This constitutes the primary guarantee for industrial peace and ultimately for productivity. If the social security of the people is interfered with, this influences the attitude of the worker, and then one can forget about higher productivity. That is why our policy will remain one of controlled employment of non-Whites in the White area, viz. non-Whites will only be employed after full consultation with the trade unions and the staff associations.</p>

<p>In the time that still remains I just want to point out that there are still certain anomalies in the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act in spite of the fact that an amendment to the Act in question is at present before the House. In this connection I associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Rosettenville. We welcome the improvements contained in the Bill. For example, the Bill provides that the maximum earnings which exclude any person <span class="col_9183-9184" refersTo="page_0502"/>from the scope of the Act has been increased from R 260 per annum to R9 600 per annum.

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on an occasion such as this you can understand that it is certainly not easy for a new Minister, in an important Vote such as that of labour, to rise to reply to the hon. members&#x2019; speeches after the person who has been in charge of this portfolio for so many years, no longer occupies this position. I cannot blame hon. members if they find it a little strange, for I, too, find it a little strange. Nevertheless I hope that we will grow accustomed to one another as time goes by, and that the same sound relations will develop between hon. members of this House and I as existed between the hon. members and my predecessor. On this occasion I also want to say that I should like to associate myself with those hon. members who referred earlier today to the excellent way in which my predecessor, the present President of the Senate, discussed matters with the hon. members here in a debate such as this for many years. I want to associate myself with the good wishes that were conveyed to him, and I want to say that I am deeply impressed by the particularly excellent way in which former Minister Marais Viljoen led the department, dealt with the Vote and also played his part in the Cabinet. Of course he had the advantage, for which one is grateful, that he had a personal interest in this technical field. He devoted himself to it ever since he came to Parliament. We are grateful that he was able to act as Minister of Labour in the Cabinet and in this House with so much distinction for so many years.</p>

<p>In addition I want to say that the knowledge that I have the good wishes of hon. members in this connection is making it easy for me on this occasion. I want to convey my sincere thanks for the good wishes which were expressed by the opposite side of this House and by my own side. I appreciate this, and I hope that those good wishes will, in the years which lie ahead, provide me with the support which I almost certainly need. It is also pleasant to know that one has a department such as the one I now have the privilege of having behind me. The Department of Labour is an old department with a long tradition. It is served by experienced officials who do their work with great dedication and expertise, and who enjoy the confidence not only of this House, but also of the employees of South Africa. Since I became Minister I have been deeply impressed by the fact that there is a sound relationship between the Department of Labour and everyone associated with the department. It is not only employees who are associated with the department, employers are also associated with it. Therefore I want to tell the department and its officials that in the years which lie ahead I look forward to availing myself of their knowledge, their experience and their good services.</p>

<p>This subject was discussed for 5&#x00BD; hours today. It was a very interesting experience for me. Many matters of fundamental importance were raised. I hope that in the years which lie ahead the stage will be reached when I will know more about them than I know today. I am very grateful for the discussion which took place and for the positive contributions which were made on both sides of the House. Occasionally I differed with the opinions which were made on the opposite side of this House, but that is the way things are in a debate. The hon. members on my side of the House replied effectively to many of the matters which were raised. I shall now, in the time at my disposal, try to refer to all the matters which were raised, not in a fragmented way, but instead by telling hon. members how I feel about many of the points which were raised, and how I see the road ahead, for hon. members are entitled to know this.</p>

<p>I want to begin by saying that in my opinion we have reached the stage at which labour and labour relations in this country are going to become more and more important. I think that they are going to be of decisive importance, particularly in the next few years which lie ahead, because we are dealing with a country which, in the pressure of its development, is drawing many people from outside into its great labour machine. Apart from that we are dealing with a country which is not exempted from criticism from outside. Unfortunately we are living in a world in which, as hon. members know, what is said in this House is known within seconds. These relations are of the utmost importance in a country with such a unique composition as that of South Africa, where there are so many population groups, where we could so easily go astray, where it is so easy to hurl reproaches, and where it is so <span class="col_9185-9186" refersTo="page_0503"/>easy to give advice when it comes to millions of people who have to live side by side in this country every day. It is not very easy, Sir; the fact that this is the case, is a matter of great seriousness. At the outset I want to say that in this House there is so much goodwill and so much good on both sides, that I believe the day will come when, in regard to these matters, we will first ask what is in South Africa&#x2019;s interest, before asking what is in the interests of a specific party. It could be that we are entering an era in which we shall have to discuss labour matters with as much piety and circumspection in this House as defence matters. In spite of differences we have seen goodwill on both sides of this House, and I hope that that goodwill will continue to be shown in the future.</p>

<p>To eliminate any misunderstanding I want to react at once to a remark which an hon. member on that side of the House made here this morning, i.e. that new Ministers can make no difference to such fundamental matters as labour policy but can only make extensions to what already exists. Apparently the hon. member&#x2019;s intentions were good. Perhaps he was just feeling me out to see which way I would jump. He spoke of a new Minister who is a new broom, and hoped that the new Minister would sound a new note. The hon. member must not doubt that not only hon. members on that side of the House and we, but also the entire South Africa must look for a solution within this old and well-tried framework. In the case of a matter such as labour, one cannot pull in different directions. If this was done in the past, I hope it will not be the case in future. I see several smiles, but I can assure hon. members that I shall try to bring my argument back to what I have just said. We in South Africa are in an exceptionally fortunate position, and when we proceed from this situation, I think that when we discuss this matter here and outside we must always bear in mind that a person&#x2019;s point of departure and the public image he presents can be one of two kinds: Either an image of confidence in and optimism at the future of our fine country, or an image which does not reflect that. I make so bold as to say that our labour situation in South Africa is so fortunate, excellent and without fault that we should be grateful to everyone in the country, and that we should continue to present this image. It is an image not for only a section of our people; it is an image which is essential for the Republic of South Africa and its future.</p>

<p>When one assesses South Africa and its labour situation, this can be done by observing what is happening here and trying&#x2014;as was done today&#x2014;to do so by means of figures. However, one can gain a perspective very easily in several ways, and one can do so very easily by assessing South Africa and measuring it against the outside world. Do hon. members really know if any other country since 1933&#x2014;economically the worst period the world went through&#x2014;in which there has been over-employment as we have in our country today? It is wonderful to be able to speak of an unemployment figure of 0,6%. It is wonderful to be able to know, in these times, not only that we in South Africa have over-employment, but also that interested and envious eyes are looking at this country because so much labour security and labour stability is being offered here. One need not look at how many people are working and how many are not working; one need only ask the bankers of the world where they want to risk their money in these times. This country, in this regard, has an image in these times of depression which compares favourably and is sometimes even better than that of most countries in the world, including the United States of America. In other words, if we were to measure it by these standards we could tell one another that as far as the labour situation, too, is concerned our people occupy a satisfactory position. But what is more: If we consider the frustration in the outside world, then I want to tell hon. members that they need only look at South Africa&#x2019;s drawing board for the next 10 years to note that so much is going into South Africa&#x2019;s pipeline that the question of whether people could possibly be unemployed would not even arise. The question will rather be one of where we will find people to get what is going into the pipeline out at the other end.</p>

<p>If we have to assess South Africa in a situation such as this, we are in the fortunate position of knowing that in the Republic of South Africa there is so much labour peace that, quite apart from the little unrest which occurred here and there and which will occur from time to time, apart from its duration, apart from its intensity, apart from the numbers involved, we are and still remain the most peaceful country in the world. We need not say this to one another and we need not <span class="col_9187-9188" refersTo="page_0504"/>consider only the figures. I ask once again: How does it happen that so many in the world are prepared to invest in South Africa? Of course they like investing here for various reasons. They are investing in South Africa because they believe that there are great possibilities for profits in South Africa. In these hyper-sensitive times capital is invested in a country in which the possibility of peace and quiet in future is the greatest. It is a barometer, an absolutely sensitive barometer. If we consider the indications and the future possibilities, then we in the Republic of South Africa are very fortunate to be able to have this labour peace today, as we are experiencing it at present.</p>

<p>For how long?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Longer than in many other countries, and if the hon. member opposite co-operates, for always. The fact is that we in South Africa find ourselves in a situation in which we must discuss the issues and ask one another how matters will stand in future, for labour peace is one of the most important factors, which can bring about total peace in a country. Labour rest is one of the prerequisites for future safety. We need not argue about it; we know it is true. Not only is there a flow of money, but of people as well. New opportunities are created for countries in which there is labour peace.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to say that South Africa&#x2019;s strong economic position is in fact based on its labour peace, and that we should treasure it. What we do in this country must be aimed at maintaining relations and the peace which must exist in South Africa at all times. As a matter of interest, there are so many examples of what could happen if we were to disturb the peace in any way. I should like to mention two examples of which we are very much aware in this House. Hon. members know how hypersensitive the world was to Sharpeville in the early &#x2019;sixties. Hon. members know how long we suffered as a result of it. Hon. members know what happened afterwards when we saw not long ago, how South Africa experienced a ripple, which really caused problems at that stage. It was nothing serious in comparison with what happened in other countries, but it was, after all, in South Africa that it happened, and where it was allegedly so serious. I am referring to the strikes we had in Durban and which we had to struggle to bring under control. Therefore I want to tell hon. members that it is imperative that we preserve the peace for as long as we can.</p>

<p>If we are to have labour peace in future, then we must understand that South Africa is on the eve of tremendous development. We must project this against what has to come, what is awaiting us. The fact of the matter is that what is awaiting South Africa is an economic development which, by the turn of the century, is going to harness all the various sectors into what I could almost call overcapacity. The gross national product will have to more than treble in volume in South Africa. We know that the development of the entire infrastructure has to be enormous. We know that these things have to happen in order to achieve a few things, <i>inter alia,</i> to make South Africa so strong economically that it can afford a high standard of living and that this high standard of living can be afforded not only for the White people but also for the Brown, Yellow and Black people. We do not want to create prosperity for one sector of the population; we want to create prosperity for all. We realize that we must be able to do this in this country because we must be able to buy and pay our own way through the world. It is South Africa&#x2019;s difficulty&#x2014;perhaps it is also its strength&#x2014;that it is a cash country today. In the past South Africa did not have friends that wanted to help it. Sir, we are the country that pays in cash and if it is necessary, in gold as well. So far South Africa has developed without outside assistance, and it will only be able to continue to develop if it can do so without outside assistance. But we have a very great responsibility because it is not only the Republic of South Africa we want to make strong; we are also making nine different countries strong, and helping to build various future states. We have an enormous task awaiting us. That is why we will in fact have to have an economic development which will be strong enough to bear this great weight, otherwise South Africa cannot achieve its ultimate goal. And on the way to that ultimate goal, it is of course necessary that the people who work for it and who have to occupy that position in future, feel that they are also building for themselves and building for their future security.</p>

<p>We come now to the question of relations. We could approach this matter from various <span class="col_9189-9190" refersTo="page_0505"/>angles. I want to say that sound labour relations are based in the first place on the fact that we have a labour force which is unique. On this occasion, while I am discussing this, I want to say that this country, this House and our people are all greatly indebted to one thing among our labour force, and that is a factor which has disappeared in other countries but which we still have, i.e. the factor of responsibility. I want to tell you, Sir, that our people have something which has become a rarity in other parts of the world, viz. the responsibility of people who work. We have responsible people. I have not yet had a great deal of contact with them, but in the few cases in which I spoke to them, I got the feeling that there was no secret element of conflict between us, a conflict which has already brought other countries to their knees, but that our workers give me the feeling that above all they are still good South Africans and are always responsible people, and for that reason I think we should pay tribute to them. It is the responsibility of these people which has also made it possible for us to have had this peace and tranquility in these past years. Now, I know it is being said that in the years which lie ahead we must have a revaluation of our labour situation, and of the people who are involved in it.</p>

<p>We have also had evidence in this debate today of what is in the process of happening here. We had figures before us today, and the insistence that we should absorb as many Black and Brown people as possible into employment. A short while ago I attended a congress at which I addressed the Confederation of Labour. Subsequently I also received documents from them and in those documents I read a question, a question which our people have on their minds, and I am referring now to the White workers who have provided the stability in the past. And this question is: What reliance can we place on security in future? I want to say at once that labour peace and tranquility in South Africa was possible because the White worker felt that labour security, and he shall have to continue to feel it if we want to continue to maintain labour peace and tranquility in future. Having said this, it seems as though it might be only one side of the coin, for the fact remains that it is impossible for us to get this enormous quantity of work done, the work which has to be done on all levels of development, unless more people are doing it. There are Black people and there are Brown people and they will have to participate within South Africa in ensuring this future development. This is something which will have to be done together as one great team. By that I do not mean that I want it to be felt in future that my department and I are drafting a law for the planning of labour or for the orientation of various people and their positions within the labour context in South Africa, and are doing so without taking all of industry and the employees of this country with us. I want to state at once what my policy will be.</p>

<p>In the years which lie ahead my policy will be to do what I am doing so fairly and to be so just that what has to be done&#x2014;and I think that a great deal still has to be done within the framework of the NP policy&#x2014;will be done cheerfully and with the support and active co-operation of the workers and employers in South Africa. From the outset I adopted the standpoint that my office is open to all employers&#x2019; organizations. The employers&#x2019; organizations that have been to see me conducted very fruitful talks with me, and I also kept the door of my office open to all employees&#x2019; organizations. Not all of them have availed themselves of this opportunity, and what we have been able to say to one another so far has been that if we have to develop a formula in South Africa it will have to be a formula of co-operation of everyone involved in labour in South Africa.</p>

<p>If this is accepted as the basis for future development, I at once want to react further to a component of it. When we speak of employees and employers, the first question which emerges is this: To what extent will it be possible to yield to the pressure, or will this have to be done, pressure that we should make use of a system which has succeeded in other countries of the world but which is no longer necessarily a proven system today? Such a system may have served those countries over the years and over a period of many decades, e.g. the trade union movement in Britain. The question is to what extent we should follow that course and regard it as a course which can also be followed successfully in South Africa by Black workers? I want to tell hon. members at once&#x2014;and I am saying this deliberately&#x2014;that I do not believe that the trade union system which is peculiar to Britain and which has achieved success there, although I do not <span class="col_9191-9192" refersTo="page_0506"/>know whether they are satisfied with it at present, but which has nevertheless served that country for many years, can prove successful to the mind, knowledge and insight as well as the needs of Black Africa, just as little as Africa has any liking and feeling for the Westminster system of democracy. What these two aspects have in common with one another is that Africa has no strong feeling for either.</p>

<p>Up to now it has been the policy of the NP not to approve of Black trade unions. This is still the policy, and I also believe that this is not the course we should adopt, namely by approving of Black trade unions in South Africa, for I believe that we in South Africa should have the ingenuity to be able, in fact, to meet the need, and that is to provide something which people want, i.e. consultation and the satisfaction of their own minds in the labour world. However, I do not think that is not part of that course. If hon. members ask me why this is not part of that course, I shall tell them that if one considers Africa and the attempts which have been made, it is very clear&#x2014;and there may be hon. members who are students in this field and have already gone to see what happens&#x2014;that the trade union movement has so far produced nothing of benefit to Africa, other than to have been abused by Governments for their own purposes, and that may not happen. On the other hand, trade unions have also been misused against Governments in order to bring about their downfall, and to be employed in this way for political purposes, and that may not happen either. Nowhere on the Continent of Africa do we have any indication that a basic need for trade unionism has existed in a single country and that it has succeeded. What is interesting of South Africa itself is that there was a time when Black trade unions were encouraged. However, that era is passed. And it is interesting to note that many of the people who were involved eventually either fled the country or found themselves in other difficulties because with the formation of trade unionism they were in fact the ringleaders of another kind of evil. Hon. members know the names of these people who were the precursors, and of what became of them. But what was very interesting was that when the ringleaders disappeared, the entire movement collapsed.</p>

<p>I want to mention an example of this, and having dealt with it, I shall not refer to it again when I return to the hon. member. I think it was the hon. member for Pinelands who referred to it. He referred to Heinemann Electric, a company on the East Rand. What has happened in this case? I want to say at once that there is a court case pending, and I do not want to anticipate this. I believe the court case will indicate what actually happened. What I want to say here is that there was a company here that was carrying on peacefully with its business. Suddenly, one fine day, it broke out like measles and the workers did not want to come to work. When they were asked why they did not want to work, their reply was that they wanted a trade union, and that if they did not get a trade union, they would go on strike. Because the case is <i>sub judice</i> I have to choose my words carefully. All that I can say is that there was trouble, but that it was of short duration. There was a White man involved, a person who had nothing to do with their daily task, and we shall still see how the case ends. The Police took this man away and after they did so, strangely enough, peace was restored and there is peace to this day. No one there ever spoke of a Black trade union again.</p>

<p>Another reason is that I believe that we should realize that trade unions, as they have developed and unfolded over the years, have made certain demands on those countries in which they were a success. There was a requirement and a need which had to be met, namely of affording the worker of that time&#x2014;the era of the beginning of the industrial revolution and afterwards; when there were only White workers&#x2014;the opportunity of being able to negotiate better in an era of capitalism.</p>

<p>It may have served its time well, but in Europe it is a fact that the trade unions have become entirely socialistic and today there are voices which are being strongly raised in opposition to it. That is why I said a moment ago with so much satisfaction, and I want to repeat it because I do not want any misunderstanding, that our people have been so responsible up to now and that we are very grateful for that. However, I believe that if there is no significant need and demand among the Black people for a Black trade union, other people must not come and tell us that they think there is a need for it. The people who are asking for it are in my opinion the wrong people. The right people are not asking for it; always it is only the wrong people. I shall only <span class="col_9193-9194" refersTo="page_0507"/>begin to believe it when the right people ask for it. So far it has only been the wrong people. However, I do not want to remain negative only; I also want to be positive as far as this matter is concerned. My predecessor laid the foundation here with the Bantu Labour Relations Regulation Act, the Act of 1953, which was amended a short while ago, and provided that a start could now be made within a factory to meet a need. What is that need? The first need is communication and the second is the opportunity to discuss and communicate one another&#x2019;s problems. What has happened during the past year? Recently, since the Act was changed, over 2 000 of these committees have been established&#x2014;I am speaking collectively of the works committees and the liaison committees; I do not want to go into too much detail&#x2014;which have to meet this need. What has happened here? At first there was an attempt to meet the first requirement, the need for communication. Now, on a basis of a study carried out by the Free State University some time ago to try to evaluate whether there had been improved communication&#x2014;this has been done scientifically and I have to accept it&#x2014;it appeared that in 97,4% of the cases where those committees existed, there was better communication.</p>

<p>There is of course the second objective, and that is to try to improve productivity once there is better communication. Scientists who carried out the research tell us that in 39,7% of the cases there was increased productivity. What is very interesting, however, is the fact that labour unrest diminished dramatically in cases where such liaison or works committees existed. I know it is being said&#x2014;as was said here today&#x2014;that this scheme does not go far enough because no provision is made within the scope of this scheme for other needs.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to go into detail here today, but I believe that we must follow this course and make a success of this scheme. We must look at what we have and see whether we have gone far enough with it or whether we must change it, but we cannot throw out the baby with the bath water and try something new. We must give attention to this scheme which is already half way to being a success and is on its way to becoming a complete success. We must recreate this scheme and make something of it, for it has potential because there are two fundamental elements inherent in it. The first element is that of liaison and co-operation between employer and employee, and the second is the opportunity to sit down around the conference table and make mutual needs known.</p>

<p>These 650 000 Black people in South Africa may subsequently become a million Black people, and eventually even 2 million Black people, and can hon. members imagine how satisfactory it would be if the representatives of those people throughout South Africa could sit down around conference tables in the knowledge that their needs were really being looked after. And what are those needs? There is a need for money, better working conditions and all the other needs which they discuss with their employers. If we can achieve success with this scheme, we would really have made a breakthrough. Then we will never again hear about Black trade unions, for then it would not be the case that such organizations were being established from ulterior motives. Then groups will be established to maintain true labour peace in South Africa.</p>

<p>I have already discussed these matters and told the employers&#x2019; organizations that it is my intention to take this point further during the next recess. I believe it is going to be necessary to have a round table conference so that all employers can consider and discuss various possibilities to see whether they cannot perhaps bring something in existence for South Africa. I am convinced that this will happen. Many of these people have already begun to think in this direction. Therefore I believe that what we are doing through joint consideration must be done, and that employer and employee must sit down together with the Government around a conference table so that we can create labour peace in South Africa, and do not need to look elsewhere and try to make something of a trade union system which has failed elsewhere on the continent and also in South Africa. There is no indication that Black trade unions were ever a success here or outside South Africa, and everything indicates that the methods which we are employing in terms of the new Act will ensure a breakthrough. I am inviting hon. members opposite to embark on this course with us and not to try to condemn this system.</p>

<p>In future we will probably have to take a very close look at the position of labour itself. Of course we have been discussing the matter of figures all day, and perhaps it would therefore be a good thing if we were, just for a <span class="col_9195-9196" refersTo="page_0508"/>moment, to glance at the latest figures in regard to manpower in general. The Department of Labour, of course, conducts a proper manpower survey every second year. I have studied this manpower survey and made an abstract which gives us an indication of precisely what the labour situation is at present, according to the very latest figures. I am now going to quote from it because it may perhaps serve as a basis for further arguments. The last survey was made in 19.75. According to that survey there were 1 487 498&#x2014;i.e. 29,67%&#x2014;Whites. To make it interesting perhaps I should round off the figures to the nearest 1 000. There were also 530 000 Coloureds, 181 000 Asiatics and 2,8 million Bantu. These figures refer only to labour-active people within South Africa. In contrast to what was implied today, I want to point out that a comparison with the previous survey disclosed that the Coloureds showed the greatest increase&#x2014;an increase of 9,7%. Following on the increase among the Coloureds, there were increases of 6,5% among the Asiatics, 5,8% among the Bantu and 5,5% among the Whites. In aggregate there was an increase of 285 000, that is to say, a growth rate of approximately 6%&#x2014;over two years. This differs from the figures which were quoted today as supposedly indicating the current figures in regard to our labour situation. As far as the professional, semi-professional and technical occupations are concerned, the population groups show considerable growth. Hon. members would do well to take cognizance of the following interesting figures. The number of Whites increased by 29 000, which represents a growth of 13,28%. The growth among the Blacks, however, was 28%. As far as the clerical professions are concerned&#x2014;this is in fact the most important livelihood of the Whites&#x2014;the Whites increased by 7,6%, the Asiatics by 30% and Bantu by 29%.</p>

<p>My object in quoting these statistics is not that hon. members should remember the figures, but to indicate the contrast. Hon. members should take cognizance of the difference: Among Whites it was 7%, among Coloureds 37%, among Asiatics 30% and among Bantu 29%. The survey pertaining to the various groups is therefore more or less in proportion to their numbers. Therefore it cannot be alleged that provision is not being made for the entry of White, Brown and Yellow people to the extent to which they become available to the market. In the case of male technicians there was an increase in growth of 25%, and in the case of female technicians growth represented an increase of 16%. The percentages which I have now furnished therefore indicate the increase in the rate and not the total intake.</p>

<p>I can therefore allege on the basis of these figures that the impression that we in South Africa are in fact building up a backlog because the Black and Brown people are not being absorbed into the labour situation is not entirely correct.</p>

<p>If one wanted to discuss Black workers, one could think of what is happening at present in South Africa. What I find so very interesting is that on the one hand, South Africa is reproached for not being able to find Black people to do its work, but on the other hand it is also reproached for not wanting to employ Black people. Although we hear these reproaches, South Africa at present finds itself in the situation that it has a mining industry which has been cut off from certain components of its sources of labour, or is in the process of being cut off from those sources. It is only with the utmost difficulty and at the greatest expense that this industry can find people within South Africa to enter the industry despite the fact that the circumstances within the industry are exceptionally favourable. I think it has already been mentioned today that the mining industry in fact offers working conditions which compare very, very favourably with working conditions in other industries anywhere in the world. The mining industry cares for its people in the field of medicine, and offers excellent recreational facilities. In addition feeding services are provided. Although this industry provides working conditions which are extremely good, the industry is only with difficulty succeeding in persuading Black people to enter the industry.</p>

<p>At present it is true that only approximately 43,6% of our Black mineworkers are from South African territory. We therefore experience the contrast that on the one hand we are reproached for not wanting to employ the people and at the same time when we do want to employ them there are still various posts which are vacant. In reality there are still a large number of Black people in South Africa who can pick and choose where they wish to <span class="col_9197-9198" refersTo="page_0509"/>work. The Department of Bantu Administration and all hon. members who deal with this will know that they are so selective about where they want to work that there is a surplus available, not in industry, but in the other sectors. Agriculture and certain services have indicated that they want more workers, but they cannot find them. Consequently it is very difficult to evaluate precisely what the position really is in South Africa. However, I think that we can safely say that in spite of the fact that at first glance there are many Black people who want work and allegedly are unable to find it, we have a good rate of employment, in fact full employment, for in the sphere of industry there is at present a shortage of Black labour in the country and as a result of which there are quite a few posts which cannot be filled.</p>

<p>Having said this about labour, and having initially said that White workers are receiving the necessary protection, I want to add that I believe that the White worker in South Africa ought to be protected and that the work reservation provision ought to remain on the Statute Book. I am saying this for various reasons, some of which have already been pointed out by hon. members. One important reason is that the people have every right to be protected in an industry in which they were trained and in which they have been engaged for years. They have every right to demand that they should, in their own country, enjoy that protection which other countries afford their people when similar circumstances arise. Let me say at once that, when we discuss this matter, we should not only discuss what is happening today, but should in reality speak with enthusiasm and optimism about the future. What is awaiting the Black man?</p>

<p>Today the homelands have not yet been developed. They still have a very long way to go, but they have enormous potential. The citizens of the homelands must make something of those homelands, because the homelands belong to them. In other words, they have every opportunity to build up something there, to enjoy full protection there and to enjoy primary rights there. In addition they may be absorbed into the industries in South Africa, in what I want to call the intermediate areas or border areas. In those areas vast opportunities are being created for them, and they are able to rise further than in the rest of the White area. In addition, in the rest of the White South Africa, they have the opportunity to be employed, as they have in fact been employed, with the possibility of all being absorbed into the work situation in South Africa in the years which lie ahead. Therefore it would be wrong to want to create the impression that we in South Africa do not care or do not have a place for the Black man in this country, for if everyone, Brown, White and Black believe in this country&#x2019;s great future, if we knew what was on its drawing board, I want to say that there will be work in South Africa for everyone, regardless of his colour. The important thing is: Who will be protected, who will work where? Therefore, I want to associate myself with what has already on various occasions been said to the workers in South Africa, <i>inter alia,</i> too, by the hon. the Prime Minister, namely that there is a link between the South African ethnic situation and its internal labour situation. Within the context I think we can achieve that goal. In my opinion, therefore, there is an opportunity for everyone in South Africa to co-operate in the situation. There is also the assurance to the White man that he will be protected in that part of the work which he has to do. But, what is also important, is that we are entering a situation&#x2014;in fact, we are already in it&#x2014;where work opportunities also have to be created. Therefore it is of the utmost importance to this country of ours that the people on whose training so much has been spent, who have become so skilled in the practice of their professions, and who are already in short supply in South Africa, should thrash out the situation among one another by way of a readjustment so that routine work is shifted from their shoulders. In the interest of South Africa, and in their own interest, they will then be able to render the services which constitute the maximum potential for South Africa.</p>

<p>The second step is that a round table conference will have to be held to determine who should work where, for in a readjustment of types of employment it is not only the Government which is involved, nor is it only the employer who is involved. The employee is also involved, and I have told the employees&#x2014;and I want to repeat it now&#x2014;that I hope and believe that relations will be of such a nature that all parties will sit down around that conference table and accept the joint responsibility of ensuring that all the work is done. In addition they must also themselves determine who will do what. <span class="col_9199-9200" refersTo="page_0510"/>Inherent in that is also protection for the White man himself, for then it will not be possible to force anything upon him. He knows that there is going to be a great deal of work, and that he cannot do everything himself. He also knows that he will have to help ensure that these things happen. In other words, Sir, he must also accept co-responsibility for ensuring that that sorting out of the work process in South Africa will be done with his co-operation. I have invited them to co-operate in this way in future, and I have every reason to believe that the White workers of this country will play their part in ensuring that that part of the work which they are going to retain, will be done well, and also to plan who is going to do the remainder of the work. Therefore I believe that the way in which our industrial councils work is of such a nature that these matters will be thrashed out there. The result of the fact that we have industrial councils which are functioning so well and which have, over the past few years, acquitted themselves of their task in such an excellent manner, is that I need not doubt that we will be able to find this formula within the framework of our Conciliation Act. Therefore I do not think that we in South Africa need be afraid that there will not be people to do the work in future. I believe that there will be people to do the work. What is important, however, is that the decisions which will have to be taken on who works where, should be joint decisions of a joint labour government in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I have now indicated what my views are in respect of future developments. I want to leave it at that now, and come to the various hon. members who participated in this debate today. In the first place I want to express my cordial thanks to them for their contributions. Hon. members on this side of the House replied well to the points raised by hon. members opposite, and there is not much which remains for me to say, now that I have given an indication of what my views are in respect of the road ahead.</p>

<p>I think that what I have just said covers most of the points raised by the hon. member for Hillbrow. The hon. member used an example when he spoke of a work situation which is going to develop near Cape Town. He referred to the fact that Koreans will be imported to do certain work here. I want to tell the hon. member that his example was incorrect. He compared this situation to the importing of Indians and Chinese years ago. I want to tell him that this is an entirely different situation. The fact of the matter is that people come to work in South Africa under contract. After they have completed their contract work, they return. As Minister of Water Affairs, I was personally involved in the construction of the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam. A French firm was working on the project, and we brought in quite a number of people from abroad. They have all returned; we did not keep them here. There are other examples as well. There is the case of Natref, where people came from abroad to work here. In other words, this is a controlled situation, where people come to this country to complete a contract, and then return. Therefore there need be no fears that such a situation will subsequently arise. What is very important, however, is to realize that these people come to work here for no other reason but that the work has to be done, work which is of a highly technical nature. There are simply no people in this country, whether they are White, Brown, Black or Yellow, who can do that work. We simply do not have the numbers to make that possible. We must get these people from somewhere, otherwise the work is simply not done. Therefore I think it was a very uncalled-for remark which the hon. member made, and he should be grateful, in the years which lie ahead, that South Africa is going to have such a high growth rate that we have to ask other people to come to this country and help us do the work. The hon. member can be pleased it is not the other way round.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark that I am very grateful for the contribution he made to this debate today. The hon. member and I have come a long way together, and I want to thank him for the support which I received from him as chairman of the labour group on this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands referred to several matters, but the two main statements he made were the question of &#x201C;labour representation&#x201D;, with which I have already dealt, and the migrant labour system. However, I am afraid that the hon. member should not discuss this system under this Vote, but should do so during the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Affairs. It would be inappropriate of me to discuss a matter with <span class="col_9201-9202" refersTo="page_0511"/>him, which by rights falls under the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs expressed the idea that all bodies should institute a collective investigation into the position and functions of trade unions. The hon. member also referred to the Institute for Labour Relations at Unisa. I just want to say in passing that one has many of these institutes, for everyone under the sun wants to establish institutes. The more inquiries I make, the more institutes emerge in South Africa. However, the work which is being done at this institute, Unisa, is good work. I ascertained this personally. I am very grateful for the way in which the leader of this institute, Prof. Wiehahn, has engaged in his task in the past. Because I am not mentioning other names does not necessarily mean that we are unwilling to co-operate with other institutes. I believe that in this sphere one should co-operate with those who want to co-operate. I want to add that I am also aware of the fact that other institutes are emerging, people who want to provide the Black labourers with so-called guidance, but who in essence want to advise them on nothing else but how to establish Black trade unions in this country. I want to state in advance that such institutes will have no friend in me in the years which lie ahead.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Overvaal made a fine contribution to the debate, and I want to thank him for it. The hon. member also referred to labour relations and, <i>inter alia,</i> made an observation with which I want to agree, i.e. that the Black workers have great responsibilities in the days which lie ahead. The hon. member&#x2019;s statement is correct, for in the years which lie ahead each one of us, White, Black and Brown, will have to bear his responsibilities, i.e. of acting and working in a responsible way, as far as the labour situation is concerned. None of us will escape those responsibilities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland requested that we have the same organizations for White and Black people. My reply to the hon. member is &#x201C;no&#x201D;, because I do not think we should make this applicable.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Welkom dealt thoroughly with the arguments raised by the hon. member for Hillbrow and confirmed that the policy of the NP will remain unchanged. Hon. members must not begin to tamper with our policy, for within the framework of this policy all things are possible for South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Meyerton made an appeal for an attitude of mutual trust between employer and employee in order to bring about increased productivity in that way. All I can say to that, is &#x201C;sela!&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast made several observations. He referred to those industries which White persons are leaving. I think the hon. member referred to the building industry. I just want to tell the hon. member in passing that he is perhaps seeking the reasons in the wrong place. I have been told that many people who are leaving the building industry are people who do not want to work in a &#x201C;wet&#x201D; industry. But I would not want to try to be too clever in this regard in my reply to the hon. member. I shall look into the situation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hercules issued a warning and said that we should all reflect on what he called the 4&#x00BD;-day working week. The hon. member said that everyone in South Africa should take stock of the situation in which we find ourselves. I want to agree with the hon. member. I want to tell the hon. member that when it comes to two, three, four or five days, or however many working days there may be, it is a question of what people themselves feel they owe their country. If there is a right frame of mind, then this frame of mind will bum in the hearts of everyone, viz. a realization of the situation in which South Africa finds itself. I want to tell the hon. member that his was a timely statement.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppe referred to the narrowing of the wage gap and also to the fact that he would like to see us training Black labourers. The hon. member also referred to Black trade unions. I think that enough has already been said in this regard. If he had listened to everything I said he would have heard enough to give him wisdom.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the hon. member for Rustenburg. He made an appeal to the Opposition by implication rather to lend their support to existing works and liaison committees, and I agree with the hon. member. He was entirely correct. In this regard I just want to furnish the hon. member with the following figures: At present there are 291 works committees and 2 187 liaison <span class="col_9203-9204" refersTo="page_0512"/>committees. The total number of workers involved is 654 000.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville made observations on medical services and asked that it be possible for medical examinations to take place before employment is accepted, and that it should be done throughout the entire country. I want to tell the hon. member that, I am not a doctor as he is, but that this seems to me to be impossible. I do not think that it is practical to give every worker in the South African labour market a head-to-foot examination before he accepts employment. That is a little far-fetched. I also want to tell the hon. member that to me it sounds too much like a further step along the road to a welfare State. He and I should both be afraid of one thing, and that is a welfare state. In any case, I think that our people are healthy. If the hon. member were to look at those of us sitting here and at what is happening outside, I can honestly say that the general state of health and conditions of work are of such a nature that, except in the case of risk work, we should refrain from saying to the people that they should all first be examined to establish to what extent they are able to work. If the hon. member does not mind, I should prefer to furnish him with a written reply in respect of certain matters which he raised and which are of a rather technical nature. There are observations which he made which are important, and I should like to furnish the hon. member with a written reply to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethal advocated the retention of work reservation and he did so in a knowledgeable way. I want to thank the hon. member very sincerely for his contribution. What he said, is true.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sasolburg made a contribution in respect of labour training. I need not make a further contribution in this regard. I am of the opinion that the hon. member&#x2019;s appeal for co-operation and reflection by White workers in respect of the position of the Black worker can be endorsed. That is precisely why I associated myself a moment ago with what the hon. member said, i.e. that it behoves all of us, employers and employees to reflect in the years which lie ahead on the overall labour situation in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove made an appeal and requested that the procedure in regard to wage determination should be revised. However, I do not think that the procedure need be revised. It is a complicated procedure and in any case I cannot simply tell the hon. member off the cuff, in regard to such technical matters, that he did perhaps have a valid argument. But I do think that this matter can be looked into. I want to tell the hon. member, however, that the procedure, as it exists, has been tested in the past and I do not know whether other hon. members on my side of the House would agree with me or would differ with me. I shall look into the matter, and if I think that the hon. member&#x2019;s argument is a valid one, I shall let him know.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Stilfontein, who is an old war horse, for his contribution and representations in regard to labourers on a family basis. He also replied on my behalf in a knowledgeable way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Amanzimtoti referred to the say which Black workers ought to have in industrial council meetings. However, I want to point out to the hon. member that these people are not members of the industrial councils, yet they are able to have a say in the meetings. There is a difference, and the hon. member should consult the Act again. The hon. member can request the department to explain to him how the matter functions. But it would seem to me as though there is a misunderstanding about what he meant and what the position really is. However, this matter can be cleared up for him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Etosha referred to the misuse of Black trade unions, and I think that the hon. member will be able to infer from what I said earlier this afternoon, that he and I are in agreement on this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo asked very technical questions, to which I have to reply. However, it would be a long reply, for he asked many questions, and I do not think he expects me to reply to him across the floor of this House, but he will receive a reply.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene made a very important observation, and I want to thank him for his contribution. He made an interesting contribution in regard to the position of our Coloureds, and discussed the composition of a labour force in future and the position of Coloureds in it. He also pointed out that the Coloureds have no other place in which to offer their labour, and the future must therefore be spelt out for the Coloureds so that it will be clear to them. I agree with the hon. <span class="col_9205-9206" refersTo="page_0513"/>member that this ought to be done, but I believe that the National Party, in its policy as it is unfolding at the moment&#x2014;I do not now wish to venture into the domain of the hon. Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations&#x2014;has already indicated such a course. But it will probably be feasible to raise this question during the discussion of the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg pointed out that if people were correctly trained, there ought to be no shortage of artisans. He referred to the 70 000 White operators and requested that these White operators be afforded the opportunity of receiving better training. I agree with the hon. member and I think that it is a matter in respect of which everyone should co-operate, for 70 000 people are a great number of people to afford a better position in life. At a subsequent stage the hon. member and I can discuss the ways and wherefores of this matter further with one another. In the meantime I thank the hon. member for raising the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Alberton made a very good contribution on dispositions, and I hope that the disposition which radiated from him today will also be a disposition which will in future be discernible in everyone. Before I resume my seat, I want to thank the hon. member for Carletonville for his contribution on labour policy and labour awareness. He would do well to make his speech at other places as well. It was a very good speech.</p>

<p>I am also pleased at the contribution made by the hon. member for Simonstown. He made a sound and important contribution and raised quite a number of matters in regard to Westlake. It is important that these matters be looked into first, and he shall receive a reply from me at a later stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg asked for the establishment of an institution such as Westlake on the Witwatersrand. Such an institution is being planned, and I shall subsequently furnish the hon. member with all the particulars.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to avail myself this opportunity of welcoming the hon. the Minister to this portfolio. We know that his achievements in his previous departments were remarkable and we wish him luck in this portfolio as well. As far as we are concerned, he can depend on our goodwill while he is still new to the portfolio, but also in future, particularly if he will take notice of the advice he will receive from this side of the House.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, may I claim the privilege of the half-hour? I think this is an appropriate moment to refer to the retirement of the Government Mining Engineer, Mr. Tommy Gibbs. Mr. Tommy Gibbs has been one of the great mining engineers, one who was enormously respected throughout the industry and enjoyed, I believe, the confidence not only of the Government which he represented, but also of the whole broad private enterprise sector in the mining world. I think it is with a universal feeling of regret that we see Mr. Gibbs relinquish his post. I would have liked to say a great deal more about him, as I believe his career deserves special emphasis and praise, but in the short time available to me this evening I thought it was right to pay a short tribute to the work he has done.</p>

<p>I should also at this stage like to express the condolences of this side of the House about the recent disaster at the Western Deep Levels and the casualties suffered by workers of that mine and of the other mines which came to their assistance.</p>

<p>The mining industry is one which claims a heavy toll of life. In 1975, 765 miners were killed and 24 612 injured. Having said this, and having taken stock of this very alarming and tragic situation, it is also right, I believe, to pay tribute to the Chamber of Mines for the unremitting work it does in seeking to improve the safety on our mines through new approaches to the techniques of mining and by improved training, etc. Sir, the Chamber of Mines are going to spend R150 million in the next 10 years on research into new mechanical methods and new techniques of mining which, hopefully, will also have some effect on the <span class="col_9207-9208" refersTo="page_0514"/>casualty rate in that the resort to more mechanical means of mining will also reduce to some extent the physical exposure to which miners are subjected. The Mines Rescue Brigade has once again played a noteworthy part in the operations which took place after the events at the Western Deep Levels, and it is appropriate to remember that in 1975, the year which we are now reviewing, this Mines Rescue Brigade, which is a voluntary organization, was prepared to go into all kinds of hazardous situations and to accept great risks in saving their comrades from disaster or danger. It has already celebrated its 50th anniversary. I believe it is appropriate to pay tribute to the Mines Rescue Brigade and to the proto teams which are prepared to undertake such grave risks in defence of their comrades and for the protection of their fellow miners.</p>

<p>In reviewing the year I think it is right also to express satisfaction at the success of the new recruiting policy in the mining industry. It has come to realize that foreign labour is in fact not something on which the mining industry can count for ever. It is subject to political risks and to all kinds of interventions, some of which are really unpredictable for the future. To this end the mining industry has undertaken a major recruiting campaign. It has reviewed the conditions of labour and of employment, and the effect has been that the number of indigenous Blacks employed in South African mines, who numbered some 99 000 in 1974, had risen to 180 000 in 1975. These Black miners have been recruited from within South Africa itself and now constitute the major component of labour on the South African mines, a situation which was not the case before. I believe a very important change has taken place here. It has taken a great deal of organization and it has placed our mining industry in a position of greater safety so far as the employment of labour is concerned.</p>

<p>In reviewing the year, our attention has also been drawn, in the report of the Secretary for Mines, to the first report of the Minerals Bureau. This was a new innovation and the report is in fact the very first report of the Minerals Bureau which it has ever published. Its Energy Minerals Division will be very largely responsible for the Minerals Bureau&#x2019;s contribution to the formulation of national energy policy. It will participate in the work of the Energy Policy Committee, and, therefore, in its initial stages one hopes that its main field of work will be to pay great attention to the recommendations of the Petrick report on the coal resources of South Africa. However, as the bureau itself states in its report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It does not yet have sufficient resources for the study of coal technology and coal economics on a world-wide basis.</block>

<p>This, Sir, is obviously a gap which needs to be filled, because as the Petrick Commission points out, the time has come for South Africa to take a new and hard look at the availability of coal, the extent of the resources and the utilization of coal within the South African economy. There is a most urgent need for more research into our most important energy source. The fact that South Africa of all countries in Africa has become easily the most highly developed industrial nation on this continent, is very largely, if not wholly, due to the fact that we have been blessed with enormous reserves of cheap coal, and this has played a very important part in the economic development of South Africa. It has up to the present been South Africa&#x2019;s only important source of energy and has, as I said, made us into a major industrial country. The energy field has moreover become so dynamic that continuous study is necessary and will continue to be necessary to maintain this energy source and to adapt it to the circumstances which will develop from now onwards. It is rather striking and alarming that we spend 14 times as much on atomic energy research and twice as much on water research as we do on coal research. I think the time has certainly come to think very seriously about it. It has become a truism, a platitude, to say that coal, or energy, is vital to the future of South Africa. It is so obvious that it is vital to our future, especially with the great economic demands that are going to be placed on this country, that it is only right to accept that the recommendations made in the Petrick Commission report, which I believe are most important recommendations and a most important report, should be given great attention by the Government.</p>

<p>In this regard I would like to mention briefly&#x2014;without raising the argument again&#x2014;that the report of the Petrick Commission contains recommendations which affect a number of Government departments. So far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we <span class="col_9209-9210" refersTo="page_0515"/>believe we have to some extent set an example by reconstituting our parliamentary study group which deals with mining matters, into a mines and energy group. I believe that the Government would do well to consider some such similar formation in order that this kind of work could be co-ordinated within a single department under a single control. I would like to mention to the hon. the Minister yet another example. I have given many in this House. I was looking last night at the report of the Fuel Research Institute, which has an important part to play in connection with the recommendations made by the Petrick Commission report. It then occurred to me that the Fuel Research Institute does not fall under this hon. Minister and therefore it would be inappropriate for me to talk to him about it. These are the sort of difficulties we have. This hon. Minister is responsible for atomic energy, but he is not responsible for the Koeberg power station. He is also not responsible for Sasol. So one could go on enumerating anomalies that arise in trying to deal with energy problems within the present divisions which exist in the Government structure. I believe that the time has come to give very serious thought to this.</p>

<p>So far as the Petrick Commission report is concerned, one is tempted to go into greater detail, and I would very much like to do so, but time does not allow me. I would therefore ask the hon. the Minister whether he would be so good, when he rises to reply to this debate, to tell us what the Government&#x2019;s response is to the Petrick Commission report.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure the hon. the Minister will, but I believe also, for reasons that I have already stated, that the hon. the Minister will not be in a position to deal fully with the recommendations of the Petrick Commission report. So many of the recommendations affect other Ministers and other departments. We look forward with great interest to hear what the hon. the Minister will have to say. We hope he will cover it as fully as he can this evening and that he will deal as widely as he can with the various issues which are, after all, interdependent and interlocked issues. If the hon. the Minister is not able, by the nature of his portfolio, to deal fully with these interlocking issues, I would very strongly urge that the Government should give consideration to publishing a White Paper in which the views of the various departments and the various Ministries can be co-ordinated in order that there can be a coherent reply to the most important recommendations of the Petrick Commission report.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister also about the progress of the Soekor oil programme. The latest information available to us is contained in the 1975 report of the Department of Mines, in which some reference is made to the programme carried out in 1975. We are aware, of course, that a further programme was launched in 1976, that the Sedco rig has been brought to South Africa, that it has started a drilling programme and that, no doubt, some of the results are being evaluated. This programme is a very expensive one, and a bit of a gamble obviously, but is nevertheless of such enormous importance and of such very great interest to the country that I believe that the hon. the Minister would be satisfying a real need and great interest in this country by informing this House and the public of the progress that is made and the further development of plans for oil exploration.</p>

<p>There are many other things with which I would like to have dealt this evening. Unfortunately my time is very limited; so, some of my colleagues will deal with these other matters. I would like to conclude very briefly by thanking the hon. the Minister and his department for allowing us to have up-to-date reports this year from the Department of Mines and its associated bodies. I had occasion last year to complain about being presented with Africana; reports which were rather old and not up to date. This year his department has done well, and I would like to express my appreciation to it for having made available to us, for this debate, reports which are reasonably up to date in covering the work and progress of the department.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rossouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to react to what the hon. member for Von Brandis had to say. He made a few points with which I agree entirely, especially in connection with the coal mines. But I shall come back to that.</p>

<p>As far as I know, this is the first time that a Minister of Mines is also a Minister of Labour. It can of course be asked why these two posts <span class="col_9211-9212" refersTo="page_0516"/>should fall under one Minister, and the answer is that these two portfolios&#x2014;Labour and Mines&#x2014;are so closely interwoven that it is a very good thing that they should be under the jurisdiction of one Minister. I should like to congratulate him heartily and also extend a hearty welcome to him as Minister of Mines.</p>

<p>It is with mixed feelings that I rise here tonight because I am thinking of those five families who have gone through a sorry, trying time this past week. I am referring here to the five members of a proto team who lost their lives in Western Deep Levels Mine. The accident did not take place in my constituency&#x2014;but the men were residents in my constituency and I knew some of them very well. It is with compassion that I pay tribute to those men tonight and I should also like to express my deepest sympathy with their families&#x2014;their wives and children who remain behind. I think I do so on behalf of both sides of this House. Those men perform very dangerous work. In order to belong to a proto team, one has to be subjected to very strongest tests. Those men do this work of their own free will, of course, although they are highly paid for it. They are specially trained to perform dangerous work, and they have to be very fit, both medically and physically.</p>

<p>These men can actually be compared to the soldiers who fight the terrorists on our borders today. They are fighting in the interests of our country&#x2019;s economy. If a fire breaks out in a mine, these men do not flinch from any danger. They do their work for their country, South Africa, and for its economy. They combat any fires or floods which may arise. I know what this means and I realize the dangers involved. I therefore want to pay tribute to those five men. Perhaps we shall not even have the privilege of attending the funerals of four of them, because as hon. members know, their bodies are still underground. We do not know whether those bodies will ever be found. I am sorry that that tragedy affected people in my constituency, but I am also grateful to be able to say that in the past I did what I could for those people in connection with complaints and appeals they addressed to me. I am also pleased that the hon. the Minister of Finance met those people halfway and made it possible for them to pay a reasonable income tax, and not the vast amounts they had to pay in the past. I conclude this part of my speech by once again paying tribute to those families. I want to tell them what we in this House are thinking of them in their sorrow. We know that the wounds inflicted can and will be healed by the Creator, our Lord and Master, alone.</p>

<p>I now return to the speech of the hon. member for Von Brandis. There is one point with respect to which I agree with him. I am referring to the coal-mining industry. Coal is probably our country&#x2019;s largest source of energy. We are grateful that we are not as dependent upon oil as are many other countries in the world. If I have the correct percentage, we need oil to provide only 30% of our energy requirements. Coal therefore accomplishes a very great task in this country. What worries me, is that it seems&#x2014;I say &#x201C;seems&#x201D;, because I do not have much experience of coal mines&#x2014;from the reports I read that our coal mines only mine coal which is easily available. It seems to me that once a coal mine has been demarcated and the production has been calculated at 100%, the mining companies only mine between about 30% and 50% of the available coal. I wonder whether the Government should not take drastic steps, through the hon. the Minister and his department in collaboration with the Chamber of Mines, in order to ensure that the maximum amount of coal available in a mine is mined, because we in South Africa need coal very badly. We do not know what is going to happen in the distant future.</p>

<p>Fortunately our country possesses large coal fields. At the moment it is mainly our coalfields in the Eastern Transvaal that are being exploited. A little mining is done on the Witwatersrand and in the Orange Free State. Apart from this, our major coal complex is situated in Natal. According to report, good coal fields have also been discovered in the far north-west of our country and in the Bushveld complex. Time will have to tell whether we shall ever be able to utilize those coalfields, as does seem to be necessary at the moment.</p>

<p>In the atomic age every nation is striving to become independent of oil. We are aware of the awkward situation with which the whole world is faced today due to the pressure being exerted by the oil producing countries. I know that we are doing everything in our power to prospect for oil in South Africa. We know that oil drilling takes place every day. Perhaps we shall succeed in discovering oil in South <span class="col_9213-9214" refersTo="page_0517"/>Africa. If we succeed, it will afford South Africa major relief, no matter where the oil is found.</p>

<p>However, I say once again that coal is the source of energy in regard to which we must do everything in our power to exploit to the maximum. The existing mines must do everything in their power to ensure that the maximum amount of coal available in the mines, is exploited. It is also a major source of income for us. There is an immense shortage of coal in the world. We know that with our new harbours, with the rapid rail traffic &#x2026;</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the further time which has been granted me. Sir, with our rapid rail traffic and our new harbour at Richards Bay, we can export millions of tons of coal. All this is to the advantage of South Africa.</p>

<p>Before I come to my last point, I also just want to pay tribute to Mr. Tommy Gibbs, who is now leaving our service after many years. I know him personally and I want to thank him for the many years he gave the mining industry as Chief Mining Engineer. He was a great asset to the Ministers in the past. He provided us with a great deal of advice. We want to thank him for his service and, now that he is retiring on pension, we want to wish him a very happy period of rest.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another point which I want to raise, a point about which there is a great deal of doubt. I am now referring to the mines situated in the homelands. Many of the miners, and the mineworkers&#x2019; union in particular, are concerned about the people who work on those mines. They ask themselves what will become of those people when the homelands become completely independent, as the Transkei is to become independent on 26 October. I want to put it very clearly&#x2014;I know that the hon. the Minister will probably also reply to this in detail&#x2014;that it is Government policy that as long as a homeland does not yet have independence, they will see to it that every White man working in those territories will be looked after and will enjoy the same protection he would in the Republic itself. I want to put it very clearly, especially to the trade unions, that when such a homeland becomes totally independent, as the Transkei will on 26 October, those people will also be looked after.</p>

<p>Agreements and contracts will be concluded between those countries and the Republic in order to protect the Whites there. However, I would be telling untruths here if I were to tell those White mineworkers that we would guarantee that for the rest of their lives they would enjoy the privileges which they enjoy in the Republic of South Africa while working in those independent states. If I were to say so, then as I understand our policy, I should be lying. I think that the time has arrived for us to furnish these people with full and detailed information. I know that there are people who are concerned about this. Unfortunately, these are responsibilities which this party must take upon its shoulders. We must accept that, since those mines are situated in the homelands, the future leaders of the independent States will be able to do what they wish with them in the distant future. However, I want to repeat that as long as those States have not yet obtained their independence, the Whites there will enjoy the full protection of the Government.</p>

<p>Because unfortunately I am human, Sir. I cannot therefore see even one minute into the future. If I could see one minute into the future, I would perhaps not have been here today. But, Sir, that is how it goes.</p>

<p>Today I want to thank the whole mining industry in general for the fine efforts they are making. For example, every year we hear that a certain mine has had 3 million shifts without any fatal accidents. I want to tell the Chamber of Mines this evening that this is highly <span class="col_9215-9216" refersTo="page_0518"/>appreciated. One is grateful when one sees how the people are being taught, and how much money is being spent, to ensure the safety of every underground worker. We are very grateful for this. Tonight in this House I can say that more miners have accidents on the roads in South Africa than in the mines themselves. Hon. members who are not aware of the circumstances, will tell me that this cannot be the case. However, I want to tell hon. members that with the co-operation of every miner, of whatever seniority, and with the co-operation of the Chamber of Mines, the accidents underground are very few. If one is acquainted with the circumstances there, and realizes how many thousands of people work there, one can only praise those persons who work underground.</p>

<p>It is often said that the gold-mining industry is a disappearing and dwindling industry. It is said that although this is not the case at the moment, the industry will disappear at some time or other in the future, and that it will be necessary to look for other minerals. However, I can say the following to this House this evening&#x2014;and there is a hon. member on the other side who knows a great deal about this&#x2014;that I still see a very rosy future for the gold-mining industry. I trust that the gold price will rise once again and that it will not remain where it is at the moment. I therefore think that a rosy future awaits the gold-mining industry, and that the gold-mining industry will continue to be the goose which lays the golden egg in the South African economy.</p>

<p>With that I want to conclude, Sir. I just want to express my sincere thanks once again towards everyone&#x2014;Black, Coloured, White and Yellow, whatever their rank who work in the mining industry, for what they do for South Africa. We know that they are the only ones who still work six days a week, and even seven days a week. We only hope that the other government departments, industries, factories and businesses will also follow the example of the miners.</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Stilfontein has paid a striking tribute to those miners in his constituency who lost their lives in such a tragic way. I must identify myself with what he said. Our miners, as we know them, because we have represented them for many years, are naturally people who work under difficult circumstances, as the hon. member put it so strikingly. Because it has happened on occasion in my constituency that people have died in the service of their fatherland&#x2014;I sometimes call them the economic soldiers who fight in the interests of the economic struggle in South Africa&#x2014;I should also like to identify myself with what he said and to express my deepest sympathy.</p>

<p>Tonight, in the short time at my disposal, I should like to bring a certain aspect to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Before I do so, however, I want to say that I am grateful that the hon. members on this side of the House, as well as hon. members on the other side, are discussing the Mines Vote in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. Earlier this afternoon we crossed swords with one another for 5&#x00BD;<i></i> hours during the discussion of the Labour Vote. However, I believe that when we are discussing the activities of a large department like this&#x2014;one can spend hours discussing them&#x2014;it is in the interests of the people of the department concerned, and also in the interests of the industry as a whole, that we should do so in a calm, peaceful manner, as I know the hon. member for Rosettenville usually does.</p>

<p>I should like to bring a matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister, but I want to underline the fact that the hon. the Minister must not think for a moment that I have the answer to all the questions and to all the complications which are involved in it. The matter I want to discuss is something which disturbs our gold miners in particular. I am referring to the certification of our gold miners, and in particular to those who die as a result of heart diseases. I just want to say once again that I do not want to give out that I have all the answers, but I believe it is in the interests of our miners for me to put this matter to the hon. the Minister tonight. Statistics from the provident fund and the pension fund indicate that the vast majority of pensioners die as a result of some or other heart disease. Although heart diseases as such are not compensable, the miner is nevertheless compensated, if it can be proved that the disease is a direct result of inhaling poisonous substances. It is therefore obvious that the miner who suffers from a heart disease may indeed ascribe it to the nature of his work, but hon. members may realize&#x2014;the hon. member for Rosettenville as a medical man in particular&#x2014;that it is practically impossible to <span class="col_9217-9218" refersTo="page_0519"/>prove it. In this connection I should like to provide the following statistics: The lives of 46 out of every 100 miners are certified, and 25 out of every 100 of these certifications take place posthumously, while 29 out of every 100 miners are not certified at all. When it is accepted that the bureau may have made a mistake in the case of 50% of the 29 who were not certified, we find that 85 out of every 100 miners with 25 years&#x2019; service are indeed certifiable. As a result it would be justified, in cases where the medical bureau cannot establish whether a person is suffering from a compensable disease, for all persons who run a certain risk in their employment to be paid a compensation. The principle that a miner performs risk work has already been proved, accepted and laid down in the Act. Compensation to workers who have contracted a disease, where their condition is such that it can be proved that they are entitled to compensation, has also been established in the Act.</p>

<p>However, the problem which I want to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention on this occasion is that those workers who have many years&#x2019; service, but who are not in such a condition as to be entitled to compensation, receive no compensation for their service. Therefore&#x2014;I say this with respect&#x2014;I am convinced that a worker like this is quite entitled to special compensation, seen in the light of his many years&#x2019; service. As a result of the present lack of compensation of this kind, it is obvious that excessive pressure may be brought to bear for the certification of cases which do not qualify for certification. Therefore there is a strong feeling that miners should receive compensation after many years of risk work; not by means of a disease certification, but by means of a gratuity.</p>

<p>I know the matter is a prickly one, and that it is a matter which must be investigated in detail. However, I am simply mentioning the principles and I hope and trust that the hon. the Minister will give his attention to this. As I have already said, answers must be found to the following questions: What is the definition of a miner who performs risk work? Does it include all those who work underground, or does it include only those who work in a specified dusty atmosphere, those who work underground for a specific number of hours per day, those who work underground for a specific number of shifts, etc.? Another question which arises is the term of service to be laid down to serve as qualification for compensation. Should it be after 30 years? Should it be after 25 years? Should it be after 35 years? And then there is the question of the amount of compensation. Should it be R20 000? Should it be R15 000? I know that the financing of the fund is a matter which must receive serious consideration. Because it is a matter which affects every miner in South Africa, and because it is a matter which results in the greatest dissatisfaction amongst the miners, I should like to recommend to the hon. the Minister on this occasion that there should be a compensation or gratuity of R15 000 for miners who have served for many years, whether 25 years or 30 years. As I have said, all those miners who worked underground for many years should be paid from the compensation fund for mines and works. This can be made possible by amending the Act and the contributions towards the fund in such a way that it will be possible to do so.</p>

<p>I can advance many reasons for having raised this matter. The hon. member for Stilfontein also referred to them. The miners in South Africa cannot be placed in the same category as the majority of other workers in the country. I believe that certification will be simplified in this way. It will serve as an incentive for miners to go on working as long as possible. It will quite rightly make the concept of risk work a broader and less involved one. It will definitely attract people to the mines as underground workers; it will give the underground workers a higher status, and it will be no more than fair in all cases. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister today because we on this side of the House, whose privilege it is to represent mining constituencies, are aware of the fact that the matter is a source of great concern amongst the miners. In the first instance it is a source of concern for a worker who has been working underground for 25 or 30 years and who is repeatedly sent to the Medical Bureau without ever being certified. A man like this cannot understand why another man, someone who has only been working underground for 20 or 25 years, is in fact certifiable.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that I believe that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s office will be open to our miners and trade unions at all times. I believe that he will have the greatest sympathy with respect to the matter which I have raised. The <span class="col_9219-9220" refersTo="page_0520"/>miners of South Africa, the miners in my constituency, have the greatest confidence in the NP Government&#x2014;and now I am not talking politics&#x2014;rather let me put it in this way: The miners had the greatest confidence in our former Minister of Mines in the past. I am convinced that the miners in my area will have the fullest confidence that the doors of the present hon. Minister of Mines will also be open at all times to our trade unions and to our individual miners. I also know that the matter which I have mentioned, a serious matter amongst the miners, will be approached with the greatest sympathy.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member think so? No, I shall leave that vexed question to the hon. the Minister. He may handle it; not I. It is his responsibility. The hon. member to whom I have referred is a member of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s party.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We of the Opposition actually call our mining group the mining and energy group. I should like to congratulate the Government on the following, as is not unusual, the example of the Opposition. We can see it in the very interesting Petrick Report which we have had and which the chairman of our group has dealt with, as well as in the report of the Minerals Bureau. I believe that an important feature of the Petrick report is that is has not simply dealt with the whole matter of coal, but of energy in general. I think it has raised a number of most important factors and considerations for South Africa as a whole. Any intelligent and well-educated South African, who does not seek to know what is in the Petrick report, ought to make sure that he fills that gap in his knowledge. The annual report of the department makes fascinating reading for those who take the time to do so. What interested me particularly on page 31 of the Geological Survey Report was that a senior geologist of the South West Africa regional office of the department attended a congress of an apparently geological organization known as Sabra. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would kindly tell us what a senior geologist from Windhoek was doing at this congress, whether he went to this congress at the expense of the department and also what kind of geological society Sabra is.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister noticed in the report of the Minerals Bureau that the bureau is in need of better computer facilities, and I trust he will prevail upon the Minister of Finance to meet this need. It is pleasing to note that the data bank is being established effectively. The data bank was established as a result of the Petrick Commission report, and I gather that one of the reasons why the report took so long to appear was because this important computer technology was being applied in the geological field. I trust that the hon. the Minister will do his very best to twist the arm of the hon. the Minister of Finance to ensure that the Minerals Bureau, which will play an increasingly important part in our mining industry, has this very important tool of our modem day and age at its disposal.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could not perhaps apply his mind to doing something about the copper-mining industry. When one looks through the report it is quite clear that there are redundancies at Messina and at the Murchison mine as a result of the fall in the price of copper. The Eersterivier refinery in the Cape has had to be put on ice. I am very pleased to note that we have appointed a mining counsellor in Santiago as well as in four other new countries, and could the hon. the Minister and his department not come to some arrangement in regard to the copper price fluctuation with Zambia and Chile? I was also interested to see that four large open-cast or strip-mining projects are being planned, are being undertaken or are about to be undertaken&#x2014;at Aggeneys, for example, where Phelps Dodge is developing Hill complex; the Kriel Colliery is being developed by Anglo American, Iscor is developing the Grootgeluk Mine and at Richards Bay heavy metal-mining is being undertaken for titanium, zircon, ilmenite and rutile. I was very interested to see that the Secretary of the department mentioned on page 22 of the report of the Government Mining Engineer that the whole aspect of environmental control and the effect of open-cast mining was receiving his attention.</p>

<p><span class="col_9221-9222" refersTo="page_0521"/>I especially want to ask the hon. the Minister to bear in mind the needs of the Mapelane Forest&#x2014;adjoining St. Lucia&#x2014;which I gather the capitalist mining house has its eyes on. This forest is a tremendous asset, and as an ex-Minister of Forestry I think the hon. the Minister will appreciate this perhaps better than anybody else. I wonder if the hon. the Minister is prepared to give hon. members an assurance that this forest will not be touched and will, in fact, be protected. At the moment the forest is not in danger but it may be if the hon. the Minister does not move to protect it. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give us an assurance that he will introduce legislation in the House to control the effects of open-cast mining. We are aware that it is easy to give undertakings when one is in business but such undertakings only really count when they are in writing. Therefore I believe that a need exists for an Act of Parliament because the restoration of opencast mining areas can be done extremely creatively as we have seen in some parts of the world where this has been undertaken successfully. In this regard let me congratulate the Premier Diamond Mine which is undertaking a considerable amount of work on the environmental side. I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister what he intends to do to encourage the extraction of sulphur from flue gases arising from the processing of metal sulphides which is referred to on page 60 of the report of the department. The price of sulphur has more than doubled and the utilization of these gases will help to pay for the combatting of pollution and in that sense will be a victory over pollution. I would be glad if the hon. the Minister could tell us how the various sections of his department, which is growing increasingly, are going to relate and co-ordinate. The chairman of our group mentioned something in this regard. We now have a Geological Survey, a Minerals Bureau, the Government Mining Engineer, and the National Institute for Metallurgy. In addition there is an Energy Policy Committee which is apparently connected with the Department of Planning but also to the department of the hon. the Minister. The Petrick Commission has also recommended that there be an Energy Planning and Co-ordinating Board.</p>

<p>There are, of course, also the free enterprise sector represented by the Chamber of Mines, and in addition the Fuel Research Institute. I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will give us some idea of his plans to handle all these groups which are very important and which, I believe, need to have the attention of extremely competent and careful thinking in an administrative sense. In fact, I would say that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department is growing like Topsy, and I trust that he is going to see that Topsy does not become Turvy. I wonder if the hon. the Minister will tell us more about the training programme at the Atok Platinum Mine in a Bantustan, as briefly referred to on page 5 of the report. On that page reference is also made to a new training system using four Black mining assistants under White supervision, a system which has increased the efficiency of the mine tremendously. I would also like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the fact that he has extended our overseas links, and it appears that the department has had extremely useful contacts. The work the department did in assisting South American countries in establishing seismic centres, which are monitoring the amount of seismic activity in South America, is very important. It is also pleasing to note that the technical staff of the Geological Survey is increasing all the time.</p>

<p>Finally I would be glad if the hon. the Minister would be prepared to deal with mining labour since he has not yet done so. We would like to hear what has happened to the report on the mine labour situation and also whether the hon. the Minister agrees that the fact that the South African Black labour content on our mines has been nearly doubled with the creation of 90 000 new jobs has exploded the myth that South African Blacks will not work on the mines.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to add my good wishes to those which have been addressed to the hon. the Minister in his new capacity as Minister of Mines. I also want to wish him every success in dealing with this extremely important department. In my opinion it is the most important department in the economy of the Republic of South Africa. People do not always realize this. During the discussion of another Vote the hon. the Minister made mention of the world recession in contrast to the full employment prevailing in South Africa. I want to ascribe this to the fact that we have an immense supply of natural resources <span class="col_9223-9224" refersTo="page_0522"/>in South Africa. If we did not have these, we would, in my opinion, have been subject to that world recession too.</p>

<p>I should also like to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Stilfontein in connection with the fire in the Western Deep Levels mine. I also want to express my sympathy to the relatives of the victims of that terrible accident in the mine. Things like this do happen in mines sometimes.</p>

<p>Now I should like to refer to certain international affairs. On a previous occasion I referred to the future sources of oil in the world, sources which are under the control of Russia and China at the moment. I also referred to the fact that the future oil reserves would be under the control of the communist countries in approximately 15 years&#x2019; time. This, of course, is a very serious matter for us. As far as other natural resources are concerned, one has interesting moves and manipulation by Russia on the international chessboard, not only as far as the world&#x2019;s energy resources are concerned, but also as far as other mineral resources are concerned. If Southern Africa were to land within Russia&#x2019;s sphere of interest&#x2014;I am not saying that South Africa is there already; however, I want to allege that the Russians are in our vicinity, that they are on our borders; I do not think that we have to debate this matter&#x2014;the Soviet Union would be in control of 80% of the world&#x2019;s gold. This figure may be debatable. It may be 78%, but it is undeniably true that the figure will increase along with the expansion of this sphere of interest.</p>

<p>Then there are the other sources too. Russia is also a large source of chrome. Hon. members are aware of what recently occurred on the international front in connection with Rhodesia&#x2019;s chrome. It was a question of Russia&#x2019;s chrome as against that of Rhodesia for use in the USA. Eighty per cent of the world&#x2019;s chrome will be under Russian control. Ninety per cent of the platinum in the world will be under Russian control. Seventy-five per cent of the manganese, 80% of the vanadium, 50% of copper and 60% of the diamonds will be under their control. This figure of 60% may rise to 80% due to certain unknown factors. We do not know what the production is of the fields recently discovered by Russia in Siberia. I can continue in this way to mention a long list of metal elements. I have in mind future scientific development and the immense role of trace elements which are found along with the types of metal I have just mentioned here. I have in mind, for example, the association of uranium and gold. Gold deposits also contain trace elements such as osmiridium and others, the importance of which are increasing more and more in certain industries. Platinum contains other trace elements which are also extremely important. I know that in many of the copper deposits of Zambia, for example, as well as those of South Africa, one finds certain trace elements. I have in mind, for example, selenium, a very much sought after element in the electronic industries. This is the future pattern of international politics, if we fall within the sphere of interest of communism. Therefore hon. members will realize how important it is for the Western world to safeguard the above mentioned natural resources in the interests of our own national self-preservation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, it is this compelling interest, this self-interest of nations, that makes nations come together. For that reason I say that the Western world will have to wake up to the situation.</p>

<p>*In referring to certain matters of a domestic nature, I want to agree with the hon. member for Von Brandis as regards his reference to certain matters, including the situation in which the Department of Mines finds itself, a situation which lends itself to duplication and to a mighty overlapping in State activities. Mr. Chairman, I now want to ask you to look up in Hansard the recent discussions on the Fuel Research Institute and Coal Amendment Bill. Similar discussions are cropping up, and if this is not duplication, I do not know what is. I ask you, Sir, with your knowledge of the matter, to check on this and to determine where discussions on the Fuel Research Institute are to end and where discussions on mining are to begin. I simply do not know where to draw the line. The hon. member for Von Brandis raised certain points under that head, but we could have raised those points under the Economic Affairs Vote as well, because the Fuel Research Institute falls under that Vote. In my opinion there is an enormous waste of time because nobody knows where the line is to be drawn.</p>

<p>For instance, let us look at the activities of <span class="col_9225-9226" refersTo="page_0523"/>the Fuel Research Institute. At one stage the institute also did research in connection with the mining of coal. At a later stage the institute dropped this work and it was then transferred to the laboratory of the Chamber of Mines. The Chamber of Mines has an excellent laboratory. However, this type of work is also done by certain private bodies, and I wonder whether similar work is not being done by the Institute for Metallurgy as well. There may therefore be a degree of overlapping.</p>

<p>I understand that a new installation is being constructed at the Fuel Research Institute to the value of R2 million, but the exact nature of this installation is unknown to me. Consequently one sometimes finds the Department of Planning entering the sphere of mining. Therefore it is essential to my mind for the various governmental and private bodies to be co-ordinated&#x2014;as the hon. member for Von Brandis said&#x2014;so as to eliminate this kind of overlapping.

<p>This evening I, too, want to express my sincere appreciation to the people attached to the mines. There is no profession like that of the miner. The fact that those people have to go underground under dangerous circumstances every day must have a certain effect on them. However, they are people who can work hard and who are particularly loyal and proud of the work they do. They are also loyal towards and proud of the people who work with them. The miner always looks after his fellow miners no matter what dangerous circumstances he may be in. As we also heard this evening, he is even prepared to sacrifice his life for him. This does not only apply in the case of White towards White, but also in the case of White towards Black, and in the case of Black towards White. The miner not only gives up his life for his fellow miner, he is also prepared to sacrifice his life for the mine itself and for the continued existence of the mine. We are proud of these people who make exceptional sacrifices and play a major role in the economy of South Africa.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Etosha said, it is a mighty industry. In spite of the poor condition of the overall economy of the world last year, the total sale of minerals amounted to R4 134,2 million. This represents an increase of more than R200 million in comparison with the previous year&#x2019;s amount.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to certain problems experienced by the people in the mines. I want to mention certain aspects in connection with the question of certification&#x2014;and here I associate myself with the hon. member for Welkom. After years of work in the mines it is not easy for these people to find work elsewhere. They do dangerous work for years and often do not come out of it physically unscathed. If we look at the position in respect of long service, we note from statistics that after 25 years&#x2019; service underground, 45 out of every 100 people are certified during their lifetime. Of the remaining 55, 26 are certified posthumously. This means that after 25 years of service underground, 71 out of every 100 are certified. After 30 years&#x2019; service, 48 out of every 100 people are certified during their lifetime. Of the remaining 52, 25 are certified posthumously. This means, therefore, that 73 out of every 100 are certified. Those who are not certified, but who are nevertheless found to be disabled due to diseases other than those for which compensation is paid, receive no compensation, nor do they have a red ticket. These people have great difficulty finding work elsewhere. In my experience, most of these people still desire to work. Indeed, I believe that they can be profitably utilized in the labour market.</p>

<p>In this connection I should like to refer to <span class="col_9227-9228" refersTo="page_0524"/>the report of the Medical Bureau for Occupational Diseases in which is stated that the certificates of between 40 and 50 people who work underground, are withdrawn every year. If a certificate is withdrawn and the former holder of the certificate applies for another job, he may find that in view of his health, employers are not too keen to employ him.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Mines has excellent rehabilitation facilities for people who are injured, but in contrast to this, very little is done by the mines or by the Bureau to support people who have become partially disabled as a result of a non-compensable disease. My request is therefore that the recommendation referred to in the report to the effect that a rehabilitation scheme for such people should be established so that they may be saved for the labour market&#x2014;be accepted and that we provide such persons with assistance.</p>

<p>Since I am referring to the question of certification, I should like to refer to another aspect. According to information put at my disposal, over the five-year period from 1 April 1970 to 31 March 1975, a total of 2 381 post-mortems were carried out by the bureau. Only 14% of the persons who died, visited the bureau in the six years before their death. It is my opinion that if more people visited the bureau, more certifications would take place. Of the 2 381 persons who died, only 323 visited the bureau with a view to certification in the six years before their death. After all, it is a service which is available and if the miners make use of it it may be of aid in the diagnosis of other diseases. I really feel that this service should be made use of to a greater extent.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis referred to the question of accidents on the mines. I too should like to associate myself with the sympathy expressed towards the relatives of those people who lost their lives. The brigade which does the rescue work, operates on a voluntary basis. Consequently the slogan of the brigade is &#x201C;vrywillig dien ek&#x201D;. This is the spirit in which the mineworker works. I also want to say that as far as the regulations with respect to mines and industries are concerned, they are more comprehensive than the mine safety regulations drawn up by the international labour organization for the guidance of its members. Last year, more than a million consecutive underground man shifts were worked at eight gold mines, one diamond mine, one coal mine, a copper mine and two platinum mines. I think that this is an exceptional achievement. The accident rate on the mines is disturbing. If one looks at the trend in connection with accidents on the mines and if one compares the deaths and inclusive accident and injury rates per 1 000 persons in service per annum for the years 1964 and 1975, one finds a downward trend. In 1964 the death rate on all mines was 1,23 per thousand people in service per annum and in 1975 it was 1,22. The accident rate for those years was 48,46 and 39,31 respectively. There was therefore a decrease of 9,15. On the gold mines the death rate was 1,26 in 1964 and 1,32 in 1975. The accident rate for the two years was 59,92 and 50,94 respectively&#x2014;a decrease of 8,98. On the coal mines the death rate in 1964 was 1,36 per thousand people in service per annum, whereas in 1975 it was 1,30. The accident rate was 33,20 and 21,47 respectively&#x2014;a decrease of 11,73. In this connection one also has to take into consideration the fact that in view of the rising gold price there is also a tendency to mine deeper. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall start off much the same as did the hon. member for Stilfontein, viz. by wishing the hon. the Minister well with his new responsibilities. I also wish the Government mining engineer a long and happy retirement and I also share the sentiments of the hon. member for Stilfontein in regard to those who were affected by the tragedy at Western Deep Level.</p>

<p>Up to the present stage in the development of our economy it has always been difficult to exaggerate the importance of mining to the economy. This fact was touched upon by the hon. member for Etosha and, indeed, by the hon. member for Klerksdorp. I think one statistic serves to underline that fact. In 1974 exports from this country, including gold, amounted to no less than 30% of our gross national product. Since I have two opportunities to speak in this debate, I want to come back to gold and, when I do so, I want to do it in the light of three aspects: the future price of gold; the price in relation to the Mozambique Convention, which affects that price; and the labour situation in the gold-mining industry.</p>

<p>It is also, I think, pertinent at this point in time to realize that the recovery of our economy, after two years of what we would <span class="col_9229-9230" refersTo="page_0525"/>call growth below the safety margin, will come from a resurgence in demand from overseas, particularly for our metals and minerals, though naturally our other exports, such as agricultural produce will, it is hoped, play a part. The hon. the Minister will be as well aware as I am that traditionally&#x2014;and there is no reason at present to think that what is about to happen in the immediate future will be any different&#x2014;there has been a lag in time between the entry into an expansionary phase of our overseas trading partners and the increase in volume and price of our exports. I think it is therefore fair to a say to the hon. the Minister and to the Government that substantially our recovery, which will be based on our metals and minerals, lies outside the control of this Government, even though they may have caused the disease by their expenditure excesses. I say &#x201C;substantially&#x201D;, because the Government does of course create the framework within which the mining industry operates. Indeed, it is the policies of this Government which directly create the environment and climate in which foreign investors decide whether to invest here in the mining industry or not. This serves to emphasize the other special characteristic of South Africa, namely our dependence on the importation of capital from overseas. I think it is important to put it on record that the recent track record of this Government has been very bad. The devaluation in September 1975, and what is in effect an increase in tax through an additional surcharge on income tax and a loan levy, have all acted to the detriment of foreign investment.</p>

<p>The severity of what has happened to a foreign investor since September last year can be gauged from the fact that if you were a foreigner and bought a gold-mining share, for example, at the end of August last year, you would now receive only 60% to 75% of the dividends which you originally anticipated. That represents a decrease in the anticipated dividends of somewhere between 25% and 40%. That in itself is bad enough when you consider the amount of capital which is required for the development of our mining industry, but overseas investors also evaluate the political risk in any country before investing in it. You need look no further for the proof of the distaste of Government policies than the credit rating given overseas to South African bond issues. The public of this country will want to see confirmation that this Government will take appropriate action to ensure that our mining industry is in, and will continue to enjoy, the best possible health, and is indeed in the best possible shape to take advantage of the resurgence in demand for our metals, which will inevitably come.</p>

<p>The economic recovery overseas is already under way. The evidence of that can be seen in the increased demand for diamonds and in the price of copper, which has already risen substantially, even taking into account the devaluation of the pound sterling. But, Mr. Chairman, we have to look in particular at the present and future health of platinum, coal and, above all, gold, without in any way trying to denigrate the contributions made by other metals such as chrome and vanadium or the future potential of iron-ore exports through Saldanha Bay. The fact of the matter is that the price of gold is of overriding importance to our country at this point in time. In this connection there are both external and internal factors which have to be taken into consideration. Firstly, in so far as the former is concerned, we have now seen the first of the auctions by the International Monetary Fund, which has a programme to dispose of something like 17&#x00BD; million to 25 million ounces from its holding of gold over the next 4 years. Of course, one swallow does not make a summer, but it is encouraging that 780 000 ounces were absorbed at $126, and that the price now stands at $126,65 or at least it did according to the closing price on Friday compared with a price of $125,65 on the day before the auction.</p>

<p>That there will be oscillations for us in the future, cannot be doubted, and it is important to remember that a change in the price per ounce of gold of only $10 over a year makes a difference to the foreign exchange earnings of this country of no less than 225 million dollars. However, while that might be viewed either as a threat or as a potential, we can be cautiously optimistic since the market&#x2019;s ability to absorb this additional supply reflects a number of factors. The first is the resurgence in the demand over the past six to nine months for jewellery and other industrial purposes. This increase in demand has been occasioned principally by the need to build up inventories, which had been run down as the major western economies had gone into recession. In addition, there can be little doubt that the significant fall in the price of gold from the <span class="col_9231-9232" refersTo="page_0526"/>previous high levels has contributed to this recovery in demand.</p>

<p>The second factor is that the objective of the IMF itself is to make profits which are to be used to assist the countries which are classified by it as &#x201C;developing nations&#x201D;. There are approximately 106 of them. However, it is not in the interests of either the developing countries or the IMF to disrupt the market, nor to cause a substantial fall in the price.</p>

<p>The third factor is the likely participation of various countries, such as France, who, in one way or another, has an interest in the maintenance of the price of gold or a belief in the desirability of its continuing role. It is impossible to be certain, in view of the security which surrounded the first auction, but it has been announced by the Government of France that the Bank of France was amongst the successful bidders.</p>

<p>If you rule me out of order on those grounds, Sir, I shall not place the last two reasons on record, but I have no doubt that somebody else will. Therefore we can reasonably anticipate&#x2014;to close off the question of the price of gold&#x2014;that a floor will be consolidated from which, hopefully within a short time, a new upward trend will commence.</p>

<p>Internally, the picture of the gold-mining industry is mixed. On the positive side, as the hon. the Minister will know, the wages of Black workers have risen by 44%, in real terms, to continue the substantial progress of recent years. Admittedly, the hon. the Minister will be aware of the fact that they had started from a low base. It must be pointed out that we have still some way to go before we can thoroughly equate these wages with the wages paid in the manufacturing industry. That is not a static figure, but a moving one. Nevertheless, it is encouraging that the gap has been closed to a considerable degree. A fact that has been mentioned by the hon. member for Von Brandis and by the hon. member for Pinetown is that during the last two to three years, in fact since 30 April 1974, the proportion of South Africans working on the mines has risen from 20% to 43%.

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, must pardon me if I do not follow up on the purport of his argument, because I should like to participate in this debate from a completely different point of view. I have here in my hand a map which indicates the geography of a particular region of South Africa, which in my opinion, was a latent geography of our country in the past, but a region of the country which, with a view to future mining development, may today be called a future small Witwatersrand, a region which, in my opinion, is on the threshold of a completely new future. I am referring in particular to the area in which prospecting is being undertaken for uranium. This region extends through the Karoo between Colesberg, Victoria West, Fraserburg, Laingsburg, Calitzdorp, Middelburg and Beaufort West. Prospecting is also taking place along our West Coast, in the vicinity of places such as Good house, Agenesis, Pella, Pofadder, Okiep, Springbok and then also in the direction of Prieska, Copperton, as well as in the direction of Kuruman and Sishen. I repeat: A completely new geography is developing here in our country. I want to point out that the Government showed great imagination in constructing a railway line through this area from Sishen to Saldanha. In my opinion this is a very imaginative project, a meaningful and dynamic project for the future. There is one fact to which I should like to draw attention. It is generally estimated that in the North-western Cape alone approximately R30 million has been spent in the past three years on prospecting, and that the total value of minerals, in this region alone, is calculated at approximately R20 000 million. It is a fact, and the former Minister of Mines pointed this out on various occasions, that the future mining development in our country is very definitely the key to practically the basic form of future growth and prosperity of our country <span class="col_9233-9234" refersTo="page_0527"/>in the future. Indeed, everything indicates that the availability of metals and minerals will be of decisive importance for our country in the future, especially with respect to two facets. The first is the maintenance of South Africa&#x2019;s balance of payments, which I do not want to discuss any further now. The question can already be posed: Has South Africa not been clinging to gold for too long? Should we not have entered a broader sphere at an earlier stage with respect to the exploration of our mineral wealth in South Africa? I do not want to go into this in detail.</p>

<p>Secondly: Future mining development can play a major, mighty role in South Africa&#x2019;s attempt at decentralization. Since our Government has committed itself to a policy of decentralization, this particular region, the region which I have recently described, is a region where the State can deliberately make a more positive investment in the future. What is the effect of this going to be? The effect of it will be that we will strike a major, momentous blow for the geography of South Africa from the viewpoint of decentralization.</p>

<p>In my plea I want to point out a few aspects and make a plea for certain things. The first is greater investment on the part of the Government in exploration itself, especially within this particular geographical area. I want to mention a few examples in this respect. Over the past two or three years South Africa has experienced a major revival as far as exploration in the mining industry is concerned. I think that this is a general statement which can be made today. If we analyse the situation in greater detail, however, we come to other conclusions. In 1969, for example, the exploration budget of a country such as Canada amounted to R57 million, equal to 4,63% of the gross mining income of that country. As against this, in 1967, South Africa spent only R6 million, or 0,46% of the total value of its mineral production, on exploration. In my opinion this is a situation which compares very unfavourably with the situation in a country such as Canada. I can take it further. In 1972 South Africa&#x2019;s exploration expenditure was calculated at R15 million, or 0,77% of the total value of our mineral production. If my personal calculations do not let me down, we have the situation today that little more than 1% of the total value of our mineral production is being spent on exploration in this country. The question is whether a larger investment should not be made with respect to this particular facet on the part of the State, an investment, the impetus of which would be twofold, as I have indicated.</p>

<p>In drawing up a guide plan for mining which I advocate for the particular area to which I referred, for this latent geography of our country, there are three aspects I want to mention in passing. In the first instance there is the utilization of the waters of the lower Orange for future mining development. I think we have to plan ahead for a situation such as this. While the hon. the Minister was Minister of Water Affairs, he set the fine example of bringing water from the Lower Orange to the vicinity of Springbok, Nababeep and Okiep for the mining of copper. This is an example of where water was taken out of the Lower Orange by pipeline, and today this serves as a fine example of what can be done. In drawing up the guide-plan which I request, the utilization of the water of the Lower Orange is of great mining importance and must be worked out in greater detail.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the question of the choice of labour in the new region which is going to be developed. It is a fact that South Africa has built its entire mining Industry on the Witwatersrand on foreign Black labour. I do not want to elaborate on this, but this is a situation which I think we should bear in mind since the mining industry is faced with new challenges. In the new situation White and Coloured must complement one another. This is a part of the world which previously belonged to the White and the Coloured people, and since this area is going to develop and evolve as far as mining is concerned, we must take the standpoint that, as far as providing labour for the mines is concerned, White and Coloured will for the most part have to complement one another. In the past, the hon. member for Kuruman has repeatedly pointed out the situation in which his area has landed itself because it was situated near the borders of a homeland and Black labour was brought into the Sishen area while the Black labour of the homeland could have been directly involved in the mining activities. I agree with the hon. member, and if one considers the overall picture of development, these are all aspects for which a guide-plan such as this has to be considered just as the Minister concerned, when he was Minister of Water Affairs, considered the <span class="col_9235-9236" refersTo="page_0528"/>water situation in South Africa with a view to the future.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in his typical, eloquent manner the hon. member for Moorreesburg once again sketched a fine picture of the future of the west coast area and of that area&#x2019;s potential mineral wealth. It is no wonder the hon. member is known as &#x201C;Piet Weskus&#x201D; (West Coast). The hon. member will pardon me if I do not follow his train of thought since I want to discuss another matter. It has been calculated that the world&#x2019;s mineral requirements by the year 2000 will be twice as much as they are at present. According to present monetary value this will amount to the astronomical figure of R350 000 million. South Africa has immense reserves at its disposal. The hon. member for Etosha furnished statistics in this connection. It is therefore essential to point out that these enormous extensions will mean that people will have to be encouraged to enter the mining industry, and its sister industry, the metallurgical industry in larger numbers. Experts calculate that the mining industry needs approximately 80 university-trained engineers per year. However, the present figure is only approximately 10 per year. This also applies with respect to metallurgists and geologists. This is as far as the professional side of the matter is concerned. The White miner&#x2019;s ingenuity, intelligence and ability to organize in every branch of the mining activities remain indispensable for maintaining continuous high production. I trust that the hon. the Minister and his department and everyone who deals with mining, will proceed with campaigns and programmes, such as the Phoenix project, to draw attention, through mathematics, science and vocational guidance teachers, to the attractive careers awaiting promising students in mining, metallurgy and geology. It is nevertheless gratifying to read in the report of the Government Mining Engineer for the year ending 31 December 1975 that during this period no shortage of White miners was experienced. The approximately 450 miners who qualify at the Government Training College annually, are taken up in the industry.</p>

<p>As far as the report of the Director of the Medical Bureau for Industrial Diseases is concerned, I am delighted to find that it supports a matter which I raised during my maiden speech in this House in April 1972. This concerns the problem which a miner experiences when his certificate of ability is withdrawn as a result of a disease which has not been caused through mining and for which no compensation can therefore be paid. At that time I asked that miners who are forced by circumstances to leave the mines, should receive special attention, not only in regard to the learning trades by means of which former miners will be able to remain fully productive above ground at a later stage, but also for the psychological preparation for the change-over. The director emphasized the fact that the position of miners is unique especially until the industries were controlled in 1973 in the sense that miners must be in possession of a certificate of ability. This certificate is issued by the State. It must be borne in mind that one&#x2019;s work may depend on this certificate. Every year the certificates of between 40 and 50 people who are still working underground, are withdrawn. This may take place because a person develops epilepsy, diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure. Just think of the case of a person who is only trained for mining, who has a family to support and lives in a house belonging to the mine. In the first instance, the solution for this problem lies in the creation of a form of gratuity, to which the hon. member for Welkom referred, so that after a certain number of years of service he may receive a gratuity&#x2014;whether or not the miner was occupied with hazardous work and whether or not he suffers from a compensatory disease. If pilots attached to the Airways receive full honourable discharge at a reasonable early age together with a gratuity, why not our miners who, even when the crops fail, or inflation threatens to cripple us, continue to produce valuable currency for South Africa in seriously hazardous circumstances? Since these miners are subject to stricter conditions of service, they should be compensated even more by a programme for the retraining of workers. For instance, take the case of a person whose certificate of ability has been withdrawn by the Gold Mine Workers&#x2019; Provision Fund. He simply cannot understand why this takes place without his being certified as subject to a compensatory disease. The astonished man does not even receive advice about how to start a new career. I associate myself completely with the suggestion of the director of the Medical Bureau that a rehabilitation scheme be established for those who are <span class="col_9237-9238" refersTo="page_0529"/>disabled as a result of non-compensatory diseases, and even for those who have contracted a compensatory disease. The purpose is to motivate a person like this psychologically to remain productive for his own satisfaction and in this way to retain the assurance that he can fully comply with his responsibility as breadwinner of the family. I ask the hon. the Minister to give special attention to this recommendation.</p>

<p>With further reference to this report, I just want to mention the statistics in respect of those cases referred to the review authorities. It is said that a good lawyer wins at least 50% of his cases. The review authority reviewed 1 118 cases of Whites and Coloureds and three of Bantu over the past year. Of the 1 118 cases with respect to Whites and Coloureds 1 018 decisions of the certification committee were ratified and 100 were referred to the joint committee. Of these 100 cases 24 were nevertheless ratified and in only 66 cases the appeals to the review authorities succeeded, in other words 66 out of 1 118 cases, approximately 6%. My contention is, and I say this with great respect, that the review authority actually ought to be an appeal body in the full sense of the word. If this is not the case, it is doubtful whether it is really serving its purpose.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to refer to certain remarks which were made in connection with obtaining university entrance certificates by Std. X pupils, the idea that should they take mathematics and science, they need only present five subjects for matriculation exemption. Since there is indeed such an immense shortage of mathematicians and scientists, and since there is such an attractive future in the mining industry, the metallurgical industry and the geological industry for scientists, serious attention must be given to this idea, knowing full well that in certain circumstances the educationalists are not very happy about this suggestion. However, I think that at this important time it is very essential that more scholars should come forward and offer mathematics and science as subjects with a view to university training.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member for Brakpan and the hon. member for Morreesburg will excuse me if I do not react to their arguments as I have very little time at my disposal. When I came to the end of my last speech I was pointing out that the South African content of labour had doubled since 30 April 1974. The percentage of labour that is now drawn from South Africa, from within our own borders, is 43% and there is still 20% drawn from Mozambique, 31% from Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho and 6% from others, particularly Rhodesia. If one takes into account the risk we run in not being able to rely on the supply of foreign labour in the future on anything like the scale that we have in the past &#x2026; I am thinking here particularly of Mozambique and Malawi. The hon. the Minister will of course be aware that Malawi has now been closed to recruitment for the mines for some time and that the supply from Mozambique has dwindled to a trickle. The reason why the supply of labour from Mozambique has dwindled to a trickle appears to be the difficulty in obtaining travel documents and for other reasons. This is despite the very large benefits enjoyed by Mozambique under the Convention with us through the provisions of substantial quantities of gold at the official price. Let us be clear in this respect. The windfall which was given in the past through this medium to Portugal and now to Mozambique has been borne solely by the gold-mining industry. There are others in South Africa, and indeed others in other sectors of the mining industry, who have also benefited from it. If it is considered to be in the national interest to perpetuate this state of affairs, then it should clearly be borne by the Government itself out of its general revenues.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that this clause of the Convention entered into between the two Governments, presently costs us in excess of $5 per ounce for each ounce of gold which is produced in our country. Obviously with the drying up or dwindling of the labour this figure should now be declining as the labour from Mozambique is now down to about 80 000 whereas in the past it was just in excess of 100 000. It is continuing to fall by some 6 000 per month. In view of the very substantial wage increases in recent years, if the 5 dollars per ounce could be given back to the gold-mining industry, in the sense that this amount would be available to the mines, they would no longer be as dependent on labour from Mozambique as they were in the past. Indeed, it would seem that labour on the required scale would be forthcoming from within our own country, and in the absence of <span class="col_9239-9240" refersTo="page_0530"/>a prohibition by the Mozambique Government, labour would probably still continue to be forthcoming from there in significant numbers. That is important, as the hon. the Minister will be aware, because labourers from Mozambique have held a much higher proportion of the skilled jobs in the gold-mining industry than their proportions in the total labour force would lead one to suspect. In the present circumstances it is therefore clearly no longer equitable for the gold-mining industry to pick up the whole tab for the subsidy to Mozambique. It is true, of course, that this is only one part of the Mozambique Convention, and if changes were to be made, such changes would have significant implications for the coal-mining industry, the platinum-mining industry and indeed for some of the gold mines that have benefited from the method of allocation which is at present in force but which is hardly sufficient justification for the present system.</p>

<p>If we are to succeed in attracting more South Africans to provide labour on our mines&#x2014;an objective I would have thought is highly desirable and in the national interest&#x2014;in order to eliminate the risk involved in relying on foreign labour, for example from Mozambique, our success or failure is going to hinge upon the terms and conditions of employment offered by the gold mines in comparison with other industries. The terms and conditions of employment are no longer simply a question of pay. That is, of course, exceedingly important, but wages have, in fact, increased more than fourfold over the last four years, or by 165% in real terms. At some point, however, there clearly comes a stage where, at any particular price for gold, further increases cannot be granted unless the viability of the mines is increased, particularly those mining a lower grade ore, or unless the productivity of the workers is increased.</p>

<p>Here I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister two things that will have to be done, and I am not trying to be political; I am simply being objective. We must remove the restrictions which operate at present by custom or law in regard to the use of workers in the mines on the basis of colour. This need not and will not be to the detriment of the Whites. The hon. the Minister, wearing his other hat, is the Minister of Labour, and he will know that when the recovery or resurgence in our economy comes, one of our more particular difficulties is going to be a shortage of labour.</p>

<p>A second matter I should like to urge upon the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention in this connection is the provision of an environment which would encourage people to stay longer at a particular mine, resulting in the establishment of a more permanent work force. Here I am not speaking particularly about the gold-mining industry. I am referring to the mining industry in general. The matter is of increasing importance in view, as I have said, of the fact that quite recently workers have been staying on the mines for considerably shorter periods. This may be the result, as the hon. the Minister is no doubt aware, of a combination of the higher wages and the absence of workers&#x2019; families on the mines. In the first instance, there is one thing I would like the hon. the Minister to consider. What would his attitude be if the mines were prepared to construct housing at their own expense? I hope the hon. the Minister will tell us what his attitude and that of the Government will be towards a situation where a mining company is prepared to do that. The position at present is that, in circumstances where there is a Black township within a reasonable distance from the mine, houses may be erected within such a township. I hope the hon. the Minister will tell us, if necessary after consultations with his colleagues the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, that the provision of such housing is not tied to any restriction or to any necessity to qualify in terms of section 10. He should also tell us that there is no limitation on the number of people who can be housed in such a township.</p>

<p>If there is no township within a reasonable distance from the mines, the present position is that permission to erect houses on the mine may be granted, but only to the extent that 3% of the total complement can be housed and on condition that the people so housed occupy key positions in the mine. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that that simply is not enough. If he wants to have a permanently and continuously successful mining industry within our country in so far as all mining operations are concerned&#x2014;not only in respect of the gold-mining industry but also in regard to the mining of other minerals&#x2014;we must be in a position to provide for a much higher percentage of the people working on a mine to be housed&#x2014;and let me add, happily housed&#x2014;on the mine. They must at the very <span class="col_9241-9242" refersTo="page_0531"/>least be content to stay on the mine. We must therefore provide for greater permanence for them on the mine than there is at the moment. I make this plea not to deny that all over the world there is an element of migratory labour, but our element of migratory labour is very directly related to the fact that people cannot live with their families in an contented fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not react to the speech made by the hon. member for Johannesburg North because I should like to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Brakpan. I should like to elaborate a little further on the mine worker, the person who has to work below the surface of the earth. We have had a great deal to say about people who fly through the air and people who work on the bottom of the ocean. A great deal of research has been done on aspects relating to them. A great deal of research has also been done on aspects relating to the miner who works under the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>Since the earliest times people have worked in and below the earth trying to dig for minerals. Mineworkers underground find themselves in a foreign environment, and frequently this has detrimental effects on their health and general well-being. We must remember that on the Witwatersrand there are mineshafts which penetrate the earth to greater depths than anywhere else. There are shafts which extend even to a depth of 4 000 metres into the earth&#x2019;s crust. At such a depth there are factors which have a detrimental effect on a person&#x2019;s body as well as on his mental state. I should like to give a brief summary of such a detrimental effect.</p>

<p>The first factor is the rise in temperature. It is found that there is a linear increase in the temperature of the rock surface as one penetrates deeper into the earth&#x2019;s crust. At a depth of 4 000 metres the rock face reaches a temperature of approximately 52 &#x00B0;C. At such a temperature no one can be productive not even for a short period. By cooling the air and by means of ventilation this factor is minimized to a certain extent. To be able to do so it is necessary to pump even as much as eight tons of air into a shaft for the removal of one ton of ore. If air is blown into the shafts too rapidly dust is blown up, but I do not want to discuss dust now, except to point out that our legislation relating to dust has been placed on a level unequalled anywhere in the world. Our research in regard to the detrimental effect of dust has produced results achieved nowhere in the world. Another method of cooling is to spray with water, but unfortunately this results in an increase in humidity. The humidity which arises as a result is equal to that of the tropical Amazon valley. The Chamber of Mines has already done valuable research in the form of liquid in plastic holders to keep the body temperature of miners as close as possible to normal for a period of two hours. Even if the persons body temperature is kept normal in this way, he is still unable, under those circumstances, to maintain his normal productivity. The Chamber of Mines is also trying, by way of acclimatization, to adapt the human body to that high temperature environment. For specific periods beforehand they have people live in areas with high temperatures. Heat stroke, if it should occur, is treated by means of saturation, and the patient is admitted to a hospital for observation.</p>

<p>A second factor is pneumoconiosis, which I do not want to discuss for a great deal has already been said about it.</p>

<p>The third factor, a factor which in my opinion is still receiving little attention is that of barotrauma, i.e. a sudden change in attitude. In this way it happens that one&#x2019;s eardrums suddenly close up when an aircraft suddenly loses or gains altitude. The cause of this is that air pressure on the inside and on the outside of the eardrums is unequal as a result of which the eardrums become very sensitive. This may lead to a discharge and to middle ear infection.</p>

<p>We have already heard a great deal of the number of cases of physical trauma which occur. I believe that the mining industry has done a great deal of research in this regard and that the incidence of this condition is already being limited to the minimum. One kind of physical trauma about which we do not know enough, is that which is caused by excessive noise. It is found that the rock face below the earth reflects sound waves and that, when a person is working at great depths below the surface of the earth in that heat, the constant noise of the drills may very easily have a detrimental effect on sensitive eardrums.</p>

<p>The fifth factor is the exposure of the eyes. One thing is very certain and that is that the sun does not shine below the earth. The lengthy exposure of the eyes to artificial light <span class="col_9243-9244" refersTo="page_0532"/>can also affect mineworkers to a great extent.</p>

<p>A last factor to which I want to refer, a factor of which we still do not know very much, is the psychological factor. The hon. member for Stilfontein expressed his regret at the fact that we still know so little about it. What is the mental state of the mineworker 4 000 metres below the surface of the earth? What is the effect of this upon him as a person? What tension does being isolated from his family cause in him? What effect does his being in the mines have on his fellow-workers? How does he cope with it? In turn, what is the effect of his domestic problems on him when he is deep below the surface of the earth? For eight hours every day he finds himself 4 000 metres below the earth. He cannot be reached if a problem should occur at home. He has virtually no contact with life on the surface. It is not simply a question of certification. We must admit that the person working below the earth is working in an abnormal environment. Therefore we must also take other aspects into consideration, and not only recognized diseases which he can contract below the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>If one considers that the Republic is placing minerals to the value of more than R4 000 million per annum on the market, I should also like to refer to the work of the Minerals Bureau. With that I shall also reply to a certain extent to the hon. member for Morreesburg and also to the hon. member for Etosha who both referred to the effect of Russian Communism and its penetration in Africa. In two weeks&#x2019; time the Minerals bureau will be a year old. The objectives of the bureau are exceptionally valuable. The bureau engages in the compiling of statistics, in research and all the appurtenances on the basis of which we draw up a pattern for the future of what we can expect from the various minerals. It is very important, in view of the fact that according to the report only 44 posts have been filled, that the matter receive attention as quickly as possible so that the Minerals Bureau can be expanded to its full extent in order to assemble the necessary data and let us know precisely what we have, what can be mined, and what must be left to our children to mine in future. If the data processing of the Minerals Bureau can be made fully available to us and also the outside world, it will give us a powerful weapon, particularly in respect of the Western world, whose strategic minerals are diminishing in quantity. It will also be our task to show the world that not only do we support the Western world politically, but that we can also form a strategic bloc against the threat of communism.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to bring to the notice of the House and the Minister what I said a matter of 17 years ago in this House, when the Minister of Mines, who at that stage was also the Minister of Labour, was Mr. Jan de Klerk. I said this (Hansard, 1959, col. 6447)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lastly, I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a matter which I mentioned last session, and that is the rehabilitation of the mineworker as soon as he is found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis. Last session I suggested that when a mineworker is found to be suffering from this disease he should be given an opportunity of learning some other trade, so that if he does want to leave the mine, he can do so in the full knowledge that he will be able to find employment elsewhere. The tragedy of the pneumoconiosis mineworker today is that if he gets the disease in the first stage or in the second stage, he is obliged to keep on working in the mines, because there is no other work that he can undertake. I say that it is for this country of ours to make sure that such facilities are given to these people.</block>

<p>I now find, 17 years later, that I am getting support. I am getting support from the chairman of the Medical Bureau for Occupational Diseases, who had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I suggest therefore that the rehabilitation scheme for men who are disabled by non-compensable diseases should be started. Some men could be made fit for the less strenuous jobs underground. Others might be retained for surface jobs at the mines. If no suitable position could be found at a mine, the disabled man should undergo aptitude testing and be trained for work outside the mining industry. Such a scheme would restore to a disheartened man his pride in being able to do a useful and rewarding job.</block>

<p>I feel very strongly about this, and I think the hon. the Minister should investigate ways and <span class="col_9245-9246" refersTo="page_0533"/>means of introducing such a scheme for all those mineworkers who feel that they would like to pull out of the mine. Those who have worked for more than 25 years on the mines should be able, if possible, to get other employment. This can be achieved by providing such a scheme at each and every mine so that a mineworker, if he so wishes, can learn a trade while he is working as a mineworker.</p>

<p>The whole of the occupational disease structure in our country must be reviewed. At the moment there is the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, which applies to some people and falls under the Minister of Labour. In addition, we have the Bureau for Occupational Diseases for those working in mines and works, which falls under this Minister. Over and above that, I find that the Minister of Health recently appointed a commission of inquiry into occupational diseases. In other words, we now have three different Ministries dealing with the same thing. It is my contention that the time has come for all these matters relating to these diseases to be brought under one Ministry. Whether this is brought together under Health or Labour really makes no difference, but we cannot have the sort of disruption which we have at the moment. There are dozens of anomalies which occur from day to day in respect of the various diseases.</p>

<p>A man with asbestosis on a mine receives one set of compensation benefits. A man with asbestosis working in a factory which does not fall under the provisions of the Mines and Works Act, however, gets another set of compensation regulations thrust at him. This cannot be allowed to continue because there is gross dissatisfaction amongst the workers. It is my feeling that if the hon. the Minister is able to do this, the department, i.e. that division of Ministry which is going to do the work, could concentrate on the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases in mines and in all other industries. There can be regular examination of the workers at the Compensation House, which, I understand, is to be built. There should be compensation for all occupational diseases based on the same level. There should be no wage ceiling for those people who seek benefits in respect of occupational diseases, and compensation should not be stopped if a man reaches a certain wage level ceiling. I want the hon. the Minister to realize this very important point, viz. that the man is contracting the disease gradually while his wage structure was far lower than at such time as he eventually makes his application for some recognition of what he has developed in the past. These are important points but nobody is dealing with them. Not a single hon. Minister who has dealt with occupational diseases has done anything about it. I think the time has come for us to save every man we possibly can in our labour force, and the only way to do this is to look after the worker. The only way to do this is to have one division looking after the workers&#x2019; health if their health is impaired in any way whatsoever due to their work in a factory, a mine or any other place of work.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. HOON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not react to the speech made by the hon. member for Rosettenville, because I should like to address a few words to the Minister this evening in regard to the tiger&#x2019;s eye industry in South Africa. Just as Japan has the pearl, Burma the ruby and Australia the opal, so South Africa has the tiger&#x2019;s eye. This much sought after semi-precious stone is, as far as is known found only in South Africa and then only in the Northern Cape. In 1967 the Government appointed an interdepartmental committee to investigate and report on matters relating to the tiger&#x2019;s eye industry. With reference to this report it was decided on a policy which would have the effect that it would not be possible to export any raw or semi-processed tiger&#x2019;s eye from the Republic of South Africa or South West Africa after 31 May 1971. Positive steps were accordingly taken by our Government to put a stop to the exporting of crude and semi-processed tiger&#x2019;s eye. The reasons which led to this step by the Government are obvious. I want to tell the hon. the Minister this evening that we are grateful that the Government made this drastic attempt to reserve the processing of this much sought after semi-precious stone for the South African entrepreneur. In addition we should like to see all South Africa&#x2019;s minerals being processed and finished locally before they are exported. I have here a few clippings from several newspapers. I should like to quote from <i>The Cape Times</i> of 12 March 1976. The following was alleged&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa losing millions to gemstone smugglers. Smugglers ship tiger&#x2019;s eye gemstones worth millions of rand out of the country last year and the South African <span class="col_9247-9248" refersTo="page_0534"/>semi-precious stone industry was as a result on the verge of disaster without the prime raw material, city lapidaries said yesterday. As much as 200 tons of tiger&#x2019;s eye was successfully smuggled abroad every year.</block>

<p>Then too I want to quote what the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 2 April 1976 had to say on page 52&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The second reason for tiger&#x2019;s eye shortage is that vast quantities are being illegally exported. In 1971 an embargo was placed on the export of unprocessed tiger&#x2019;s eye. Demand for this rare stone is high and the price outside the country is 500% to 700% higher. &#x201C;People get around the law,&#x201D; the cutters say. It is alleged that the crude tiger&#x2019;s eye is disguised as processed artefact. For example, rough slabs are varnished and exported as book-ends and paper-weights.</block>

<p>I had personal experience of this. A short while ago the Department of Customs and Excise held an auction in the harbour, and we attended the proceedings. There we found quite a few crates of crude tiger&#x2019;s eye which had been confiscated. The person who wanted to export the tiger&#x2019;s eye glued a piece of green felt beneath an absolutely crude piece of tiger&#x2019;s eye, smeared varnish over the tiger&#x2019;s eye, with the idea of exporting the tiger&#x2019;s eye in this way as so-called paper weights or book-ends.</p>

<p>At the congress of the Handelsinstituut in May 1976 as well, a draft resolution was adopted requesting stricter control in order to combat the export of tiger&#x2019;s eye in its unprocessed form as effectively as possible. I want to quote from the motivation of this draft resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Behalwe die omseiling van die oogmerk van die regulasies het die Mynkamer en die Handelsinstituut uit verskillende oorde van verskillende instansies berigte ontvang dat die uitvoer van ru-tieroog steeds op groot skaal plaasvind en in &#x2019;n groot mate die effektiwiteit van die gemelde regulasies neutraliser. Die vermoede bestaan dat tieroog in sy onverwerkte vorm in uitvoerbesendings ingesluit word en dat dit onmoontlik is om alle beheadings te inspekteer ten einde oortreders aan die man te bring. Oorspronklik was die gedagte dat die beperking op die uitvoer van onbewerkte tieroog buitelandse valuta ter waarde van moontlik R10 miljoen per jaar vir SuidAfrika kan beteken. Indien sake op die huidige basis voortgaan, sal die valutaverdienstes waarskynlik gering wees.</block>

<p>I have already pointed out that according to <i>The Cape Times</i> report approximately 200 tons of crude tiger&#x2019;s eye are being exported every year. It is very clearly apparent from the quotations that there are still people who are illegally smuggling unprocessed tiger&#x2019;s eye out of the country and in that way trying to defeat the object of the Government to reserve the processing industry for South Africa. South Africa is annually losing millions of rands in foreign exchange.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to make a very serious appeal to the hon. the Minister this evening that this matter should be investigated&#x2014;if the hon. the Minister has not already done so&#x2014;and that, if necessary, far stricter measures should be adopted to prevent these precious gem-stones of which South Africa is the only producer, being smuggled out of the country illegally.</p>

<p>I want to suggest a few possibilities in regard to how we can combat this smuggling. Under the present regulations the fine for smuggling tiger&#x2019;s eye is altogether inadequate. It is an economic proposition to smuggle tiger&#x2019;s eye. I want to mention an example. A smuggler buys ten tons of tiger&#x2019;s eye at R1 000 per ton, i.e. for R10 000, in the vicinity of Prieska and Niekerkshoop. If the person who wants to export ten tons of crude tiger&#x2019;s eye is caught, he receives a maximum fine of R2 000. In other words, his total expense is R12 000 for the ten tons of tiger&#x2019;s eye which he bought. In America the wholesale price of crude tiger&#x2019;s eye varies between R7 000 and R5 000 per ton, and it retails at approximately R20 000 per ton. As soon as the illegal tiger&#x2019;s eye is loaded on to a ship, or transferred across the South African border, the ten tons of tiger&#x2019;s eye are worth approximately R70 000 to the smuggler. This is an easy way of making money. I hope the hon. the Minister will help us to eradicate this evil entirely.</p>

<p>I want to suggest that the maximum fine be increased to approximately R4 000 per ton, and that illegal consignments of tiger&#x2019;s eye will be confiscated. I also want to pose this <span class="col_9249-9250" refersTo="page_0535"/>question: Has the time not arrived for the producer of tiger&#x2019;s eye, the dealer and the cutter, to be registered and for the legitimate handlers of crude tiger&#x2019;s eye to report to some body or other or to a department as to what they have done with either their mined or purchased crude tiger&#x2019;s eye? I also think the time has arrived for the producer and South African cutters of semi-precious stones to come to an agreement and in this way utilize this unique product of South Africa in the best interests of South Africa. In Germany there is the city of Ider Oberstein which is also known as &#x201C;gem city&#x201D;. In this city of precious stones we find that 30 000 people are involved in the processing of precious and semi-precious stones. In a number of Eastern countries we find the same phenomenon. These centres for the cutting and processing of gem stones are concentrated in a few cities. Thousands of people are employed in each city in the cutting industry. The only difference is that the Eastern countries have to import all their precious stones. Nevertheless we find here a flourishing industry which means a tremendous amount to these countries.</p>

<p>I think South Africa also has a tremendous potential in the way of semi-precious and precious stones, of which tiger&#x2019;s eye is the most unique. South Africa does not need to cast its pearls before swine, I want to make an appeal to producers and cutters of semiprecious stones to get together and decide upon the creation of a South African gem city of our own. The people of Kuruman have asked me to invite these people to establish a gem city there. There is water, border industry benefits and sufficient labour available, labour from the bordering Bophuthatswana, and here producers and cutters are within a stone&#x2019;s throw of one another.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to talk to the new Minister of Mines, and I am talking to him because I consider him to be a competent person, otherwise I would not talk to him. Now I have said enough in this regard.</p>

<p>In the first place, I want to talk about our coal. We do not know the extent of our uranium reserves, but at present our uranium reserves, in terms of energy content, are less than our coal reserves. Secondly: So far we have not made any petroleum discoveries. Thirdly: We do not know how the experiments, the investigations into and the development of fast-breeder reactors is going to develop to be able to produce energy for us in future. Two weeks ago I addressed the Rapportryers in Empangeni. They took me to Richards Bay and there I saw the trains coming in, loaded with coal. This coal is exported to Japan. There were a few of us there and someone said: But should we export coal? Are we not exporting our potential source of energy? A question then occurred to me, and that is what I want to discuss this evening. I do not know what the extent of our uranium reserves are. We have no petroleum. In regard to the creation of energy sources we do not know very much, for it is still in an experimental stage. In view of this I have a question to put to the hon. the Minister. I am asking this because our people want to know. Why are we exporting our coal while there is still uncertainty in regard to our energy sources in all spheres. That is the first question I want to ask. However, I want to ask a second question. Sasol and Escom each has its own mine, and uses only a certain kind of coal. There are commercial mines which produce coal for the market. Is it right that certain coal resources are available only for certain companies or utility companies? In 1969 the Coal Advisory Council brought out a report in regard to the coal reserves of this country. This council recommended that a policy of conservation be applied. The council put the country&#x2019;s coal reserves at 24 000 million tons. All the companies that testified before the council were unanimously in favour of conservation. All of them said that the demand would not diminish, but would rather increase. All of them said that the available reserves necessitated placing restrictions on mining, unless improved mining techniques could be applied. So far a cheap energy policy has been adopted. In view of the entire price structure of energy, a matter which has been dragged into the political arena, I want to ask whether it is still desirable to apply a cheap energy policy. The question which arises from this is whether State control over our energy resources has not become an urgent necessity. A further question is this: If State control is applied in respect of iron and coal oil, should State control not also be applied in respect of all the country&#x2019;s other energy resources, since these resources have become of vital importance to us? Should control not be applied in view of the uncertainty <span class="col_9251-9252" refersTo="page_0536"/>which prevails in the country&#x2019;s uranium resources, the experiments in regard to power generation and since, in addition there is as yet no certainty in regard to the discovery of petroleum sources?</p>

<p>Next I want to raise the question of the country&#x2019;s mineworkers. Tonight I want to say something different to what one usually says about the subject. Tonight I want to state frankly to the mineworkers, and to everyone, that labour alone does not make a nation free, nor remuneration, nor salaries nor threats. I want to say candidly that if a person holds a pistol to my head in the form of his vote by telling me that he will not vote for me if I do not ensure that a pension or an improved pension is paid to him, then his heart is not in the right place, and money will not change his mental attitude. I am saying this candidly, and I am perfectly frank about it. No work reservation will save the miners; it will not save any labourer in South Africa. Our children, as I said earlier this afternoon, should know this. We are compelled to entrench our children with the knowledge of what labour awareness means. One cannot entrench one&#x2019;s child, unless one begins to tell this to the child during his initial years, during Std. 1 or Grade 1. I invite the Ministry to give me and other members of this House, or experts instructions to draw up a curriculum which will bring home to our children&#x2014;and to every individual, the value of labour to our country; to his household, his environment and his country. I want to tell the mineworkers and other labourers that the standards of White housing in South Africa are the highest in the world. In France, Italy and Portugal the average house is 4 000 square feet; in Australia 7 000 square feet, and in South Africa between 10 000 and 30 000 square feet. In Eastern Europe one finds university professors living in houses with an average area of 7 000 square feet. If we look at the houses in which professors are living in Stellenbosch, Pretoria and Potchefstroom we find that they are living in castles. Is this an example to set? The average area of houses in our Bantu residential areas is 7 000 square feet. In the Republic of South Africa this has become a status symbol, for the mineworkers as well; well, not so much among them, but among businessmen and other people we have to set an example: The intelligentsia, the spiritual &#x00E9;lite. Two bathrooms, and double garages. What did the President of the Reserve Bank say in his annual report in 1971? He referred to an unheard-of increase of 30% in expenditure on private dwellings. In South Africa young married couples last year paid 10% more of their income on housing than in the rest of the world: 35% of their income, as against 25% in the rest of the world. In our country we are not yet subject to that population pressure which is being experienced overseas. But the Republic of South Africa has enormous projects on the drawing board, and requires R34 000 million for them during the next seven years.</p>
