<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is evident from the definition of the word &#x201C;industry&#x201D; that mining undertakings are excluded from the provisions of the Bill. It is a known fact that in the case of the gold-mining industry, a highly organized industry, the industry itself has made the necessary arrangements for the training of its Bantu labourers. However, it is quite conceivable to me that there may be other mining undertakings of fairly limited scope which may find it necessary to be included in the provision which is being made by means of the Bill. Under the circumstances I should like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister whether it is justified to exclude mining undertakings in general from the provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, according to my information, this arrangement resulted from a Cabinet decision.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides for the establishment of a council to advise the Minister, but I should like to refer in passing to the provisions of clause 3(2)(a) since the Minister is to consult the council on matters specified in that clause. The question therefore arises whether other bodies should not also have representation on the council. Normally one would not have any objection to the fact that the Minister has to consult the council with regard to the matters specified, but we know that certain bodies do compete with one another to some extent and that they&#x2014;I think the hon. the Deputy Minister knows this too&#x2014;sometimes exhibit a certain degree of pettiness. Therefore, my question is whether the Minister&#x2019;s hands should be tied. Normally my attitude is that the Minister should have as few powers as possible, but in this case I should like to know whether it would not be better for the Minister to have a free hand in connection with the decision as to whether he will give representation on the council to other bodies or persons.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is a sound arrangement that there is to be consultation with the council. In this case the Minister retains his discretion in any event. The final decision, after consultation, still rests with him. Consequently I am of the opinion that the position is covered to all sides.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question? In cases where there are two population groups present, such as in the Eastern Province where there are a large number of Coloured artisans and employees, would the council in certain circumstances be empowered to make certain facilities which are to be established for Bantu employees in terms of this Bill, available for Coloured employees as well?</p>

<li>(5) on page 5, in line 58, after &#x201C;industry&#x201D; to insert:

<p>, or any group or association of persons whose activities relate to industry, commerce or agriculture;</p></li>

<li>(6) on page 5, in lines 64 to 66, to omit paragraph (b) and to substitute:

<ol>

<li>(b) In respect of each of the persons nominated in accordance with subsection (1), an alternate member may be nominated or appointed by the Minister or body concerned, as the case may be.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(7) on page 7, in lines 1 to 4, to omit paragraph (c).</li>

</ol>

<p>To start with my first amendment, I want to say that it contains two basic changes. The first is that we should like to involve the Department of National Education in the composition of the council. Therefore I propose in my amendment that the Department of Bantu Education should have three representatives in the council instead of four, so as to have the Department of National Education represented in the council as well. We consider this to be desirable for the simple reason that the Department of National Education is very intimately involved in higher technical education in general and indeed, has a wealth of experience and knowledge in this regard at its disposal. I shall have no objection if the hon. the Deputy Minister wishes to keep the representation of the Department of Bantu Education at four members. That is not my point. I only wanted to limit the number of officials of the Public Service to six, as provided in the Bill. The important point is that we think it will be advisable to involve the Department of National Education, too, in the composition of the council. I believe it would be a very good thing to have that co-ordination with another department which is also concerned with the question of the training of employees.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make in regard to my first amendment, is that we believe that the nomination of representatives should be left to the Ministers concerned. In other words, although the hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out that it is normal procedure for the Ministers concerned to make nominations and submit their nominations to the Minister of Bantu Education, I do believe that it is nothing less than a recognition of the equal status of the departments that the nomination by one Minister should not be made subject to approval by another Minister. It seems obvious to me that the Minister in question must have the discretion to appoint those persons in his department whom he sees fit to appoint.</p>

<p>As far as my second amendment is concerned, I have already referred in my Second Reading speech to the fact that, because this council has been comprised of people appointed from responsible bodies, we are of the opinion that they themselves should nominate their representatives in the council without first submitting the names to the hon. the Minister for approval. The question arises as to why the Minister wishes to retain this right in this regard, which amounts to a right of veto. There may be good reasons for it, but if that is so, we should like to learn from the Minister what those reasons are. It seems to me, however, that in view of the nature of the bodies which will be represented on the council, they should have the discretion to appoint their own representative on the council without the Minister&#x2019;s right of veto.</p>

<p>As far as my third amendment is concerned, you will see that by this means we are extending the number of members of the council by giving representation on the council to two other bodies which, once again, could <span class="col_7255-7256" refersTo="page_0958"/>make an exceptional contribution in this regard to the proper functioning of the training scheme since both these bodies do in fact have specialized knowledge which can be used to the advantage of the council and the training scheme for Bantu employees. Those two bodies are the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research&#x2014;especially in view of the excellent work they have done in respect of personnel selection, etc.&#x2014;and the National Development and Management Foundation, also because of the fact that Foundation has for many years been intimately concerned with the in-service training of employees. It seems to me that it could only strengthen the council if representation on the council were granted to these two bodies.</p>

<p>The fourth amendment I have moved is merely consequential, if my third amendment is indeed accepted.</p>

<p>As far as my fifth proposed amendment is concerned, I should like to point out that the position at present is such that the Minister can only involve a group or association of employers in constituting the council in its extended capacity as vested in it under this clause. What I request therefore, is that the Minister should be afforded a greater discretion, in other words, that he may also involve other persons. For argument&#x2019;s sake, let me put it like this: If the National Development and Management Foundation is not brought into the picture in terms of my other amendment, the Minister should be able to consider granting representation on the council at a later stage to a body which is not an employer. I wish, therefore, that provision be also made for the fact that other bodies besides employers with a direct interest in and a first-hand knowledge of the training of Bantu, may be appointed to the council by the Minister. I did not put it like that in my amendment, but I nevertheless want to make an appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider the possibility of also making provision in this clause for vesting him with the power to appoint people in their personal capacity. As the clause reads at the moment&#x2014; including my amendment&#x2014;only people who are representatives of a group of employees, or of a group or association of other persons whose activities concern industry, commerce or agriculture, may be appointed to the council. No provision is made in the Bill for appointing people to the council in their personal or individual capacities. It would seem that circumstances could indeed arise in which it could be considered desirable to appoint somebody in his personal capacity. In terms of the clause, as it reads at present, it is possible that the hon. the Deputy Minister could appoint a member of the Black Chamber of Commerce to the council. In view of the fact that, in my honest opinion, it could be necessary to involve Blacks in this council as well it is possible that there might be an individual Black authority in the field of staff training and selection, who might have a special knowledge of this matter. I know a few such people, people who could indeed make an exceptional contribution in respect of the activities of the council.</p>

<p>Although I have not put it like that in my amendment, my appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister is nevertheless that he should make provision for acquiring the power, if possible, to appoint people to the council in their personal capacities&#x2014;not as representatives of a group of employers or other bodies.</p>

<p>In respect of the sixth amendment I moved, I just want to say that it, too, is merely consequential. If there is a feeling that these bodies wish to appoint their representatives to the council themselves, and that the Minister may not exercise a right of veto in this regard, it seems obvious to me that these bodies should also have the right to nominate their own substitutes. Hence my proposal that the Ministers concerned, namely the Ministers of Bantu Education, National Education, <i>et al.,</i> and the bodies in question which have representation on the council, should have the powers to appoint their own substitutes without referring the matter to the Minister concerned. My seventh amendment arises from my sixth amendment.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we will support the amendments moved by the hon. member for Edenvale. I should like to say one or two things quite briefly. Firstly, in my Second Reading speech I made reference to some of the points that have already been touched upon this morning. The first is in regard to the composition of the council itself. Six persons are to be appointed. At the time I mentioned that it seemed to me that four coming from the Department of Bantu Education and only one from the Department of Labour was somewhat lopsided. I wonder <span class="col_7257-7258" refersTo="page_0959"/>whether the hon. the Deputy Minister has any comments to make on that.</p>

<p>If I understood the hon. member for Edenvale correctly, one of the major reasons for including a representative of the Department of National Education is to ensure that people with high technical qualifications will be amongst the six, or seven should it be changed. That certainly is also a concern of my own. If the hon. the Deputy Minister does not wish to accept the amendment, I hope he will give the House the assurance that amongst the others there will be people with specific technical qualifications from among officers of the Public Service.</p>

<p>The last point I want to make is that I mentioned, by way of a suggestion or recommendation, that one of the things that would strengthen clause 3(2)(b), would be somebody specifically from the African Chamber of Commerce, for example, or&#x2014;and I certainly identify myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Edenvale&#x2014;if not organizations, then specific individuals who would have an intimate knowledge and experience of and links with Black in-service training. There is a growing number of personnel in South Africa who have specific qualifications in this regard, and I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will regard the amendments, the recommendations and suggestions we have with great sympathy.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to express my appreciation for the attention hon. members have given this clause. I hope to be more accommodating a little further on. However, I have a few problems as far as these amendments are concerned.</p>

<p>As far as the representation of the Department of Bantu Education is concerned, I want to point out that it was a proposal on the part of the department that we reduce the representation of the department in question to two. When all the implications of this were considered, however, the standing committee felt that the four representatives originally recommended by the department should remain. The reason is that a great deal of work has to be done by the department concerned. That is why we should like to retain the four in this regard.</p>

<p>As far as the representation of the Department of National Education is concerned, as suggested, we feel that the legislation has regard to employers and employees who are directly concerned with Bantu who are employed and that the CSIR, therefore, stands apart to some extent and is not directly involved in in-service training. As far as the representation of other departments is concerned, in my opinion it is normal practice for submissions to be made by those departments in any case. They are certainly consulted in the designating of representatives, although the final appointment is made by the Minister concerned. It is a council which has to advise him and provide guidance in this regard. We could say, therefore, that formally, it is in fact an appointment by the Minister, but that it does not take place without there being consultation with the other bodies concerned. This is also applicable to the second amendment. It is not true that the Minister regulates the legislation to the finest details. But this council is the Minister&#x2019;s council in the final analysis, and therefore he must be sure that the council consists of people who will be able to give him the correct advice. In fact, therefore, the Minister accepts responsibility for this council. In practice, this dispensation should not cause problems. I have considered the proposals of hon. members on the other side of the House. I have already spoken about the relation of the CSIR to this body. They are not so directly concerned with the in-service training of people in industry and therefore we would rather not involve them here. As far as the National Development and Management Foundation is concerned, there are two things I want to mention. In the first place this foundation, according to my information, is already indirectly involved in this representation, because they are affiliated with the Federated Chamber of Industries. If they should prefer to become involved more directly, then I think we shall have to have consultation with the bodies which have gone through the whole process, employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organizations. Consultation is not impossible. The clause also provides that if a case for representation of another organization can be made, the Minister may consider it and discuss the matter with the advisory council. Clause 3(2)(a) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister is of the opinion that any group or association of employers which is <span class="col_7259-7260" refersTo="page_0960"/>engaged in any industry and whose members are not associated with any body &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is only applicable to the employers.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The most important two parties here are the employers and the employees who are directly involved in in-service training of Bantu workers. We feel that if they are able to make a case that they are involved in this, it may be considered. The opening is there. Because I am unable to accept this amendment, the hon. member&#x2019;s fourth amendment falls away.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member&#x2019;s fifth amendment is concerned, I believe that this idea is already covered in the definitions. Clause l(vii) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Industry&#x201D; means any industrial, commercial or agricultural undertaking or any undertaking with which the Minister from time to time declares to be an industry for the purposes of this Act but does not include any mining undertaking.</block>

<p>As far as the hon. member&#x2019;s sixth amendment is concerned, I think that his argument has already been invalidated by the fact that, in our opinion, the nominations are made by the Minister and that the submissions of the other bodies also have to be approved by the Minister. Therefore we are unable to accept that either.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Committee Stage of the Bill the hon. the Minister adopted the tactic of dangling a carrot in front of us and saying that he might perhaps accept the amendments of this side, if we did not oppose the measure at this stage. I should like to come back, however, to the first two amendments moved by the hon. member for Edenvale. As far as the question of the appointment of a representative of the Department of National Education to the council is concerned, the hon. the Minister said that we are now dealing with legislation which has regard to employers and employees. During the Second Reading of the Bill the hon. the Minister adopted the point of view that one was dealing here with training of a different kind and that the measure did not concern formal education. I accept the viewpoint of the hon. the Minister and I agree that no department of education today has any knowledge of in-service training. What we are dealing with here, however, is industrial in-service training, and the Department of National Education is the only department which has experience of industrial training, because the department controls no fewer than 17 industrial schools. I am convinced, therefore, that the department is indeed a source of knowledge, not only the knowledge of the persons who are highly qualified in the technical field, but also knowledge relating to industrial training although not so much in-service training. Surely, therefore, it will be in the interests of the Minister&#x2019;s legislation in the light of the purpose it has to serve, that he agree to this request.</p>

<p>In his second amendment the hon. member asked that clause 3(1)(b) of the Bill be amended so that the appointment of persons to the council could take place without the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s approval. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that it was the Minister&#x2019;s council in the final analysis, and that he believed for that reason that he should retain the right to approve the persons who had to be appointed to the council. I believe, however, in the final analysis, the legislation will only serve the purpose for which it is being introduced if the hon. the Minister has the full co-operation and trust of the various bodies mentioned in clause 3(1)(b) of the Bill.</p>

<p>If one takes a look at the bodies mentioned in the clause, <i>inter alia,</i> the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut and the South African Federated Chamber of Industries, one comes to the conclusion that all of them are responsible bodies. Therefore I believe that in the final analysis it is of vital importance that that council should have the full confidence and the full co-operation of these bodies at all times. As the legislation reads at present, it could perhaps happen that a responsible body, such as those mentioned in the Bill, might submit a name to the hon. the Minister which the hon. the Minister would not be prepared to agree to. It could cause a person being appointed who would be the second or third choice of the particular body. If that stage were reached, one would create a climate in which a body might say that the council did not have its full confidence. It is with that purpose in mind that the proposal is made. I hope that these two amendments will therefore enjoy further consideration.</p>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from><span class="col_7261-7262" refersTo="page_0961"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should also like to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to reconsider his attitude in regard to the proposed subsection (1)(a)(iv), which makes provision for the inclusion of a representative from the Department of National Education. The employers themselves are really not the best judges of the best ways in which to train labour. We are dealing here with unskilled labour in most cases, people who have not had education in technical colleges or any type of technical education. There are methods which have been perfected by the Department of National Education, from the days of the old Cott scheme after the last war, to deal with this type of person who has had very little education, very little schooling and who has very little technical knowledge, and to teach them in the quickest and the most efficient way to acquire the skills of the different trades. I feel that only this department has the necessary knowledge which can be drawn upon. The employers themselves do not have that knowledge. They do not have a set system of syllabi in terms of which to train these people. They do not know the right methods to use in order to train them. They often do not even know what materials to use to train them properly.</p>

<p>That brings me to the hon. member&#x2019;s third amendment, viz. the insertion of a further subparagraph to make provision for the inclusion of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Later on in the Bill reference is made to the premises, equipment, facilities and materials which are to be used in the training of these people. There is no one who can give better advice on this particular point than the CSIR. There are buildings, methods and equipment which are peculiar to the training of people which are unknown to employers and employers&#x2019; organizations, and the CSIR has the ability and the people to do research into the materials, the places and the methods with which people can be trained. I think it is very important that the CSIR be given a say in this body. In the technical college training schemes in which I was involved we often had to consult the CSIR in Pretoria with regard to methods and materials which we were using, and I think the Minister would be very wrong to leave this body out of this advisory council.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to react to what the hon. the Deputy Minister has said. I have already indicated that to me, the issue is not whether the Department of Bantu Education has three or four or more representatives on the council. However I should like to associate myself with what has been said by other hon. members on this side of the House, namely that we feel that the Department of National Education should indeed be represented on this council. In a certain sense, what the Deputy Minister said is true, namely that the council is in fact his body, but the council will also act in many respects as an independent kind of body. This is the case particularly when one thinks of the powers vested in the council in terms of clause 5. It seems to me that the council therefore has a wider function than merely to act in an advisory capacity to the Minister. The council has, as it were, certain independent functions with regard to certain activities for which provision is made in the Bill. In view of this it would be as well, in my opinion, to strengthen the council by appointing people who can really make a contribution towards the proper implementation and development of this measure. Therefore I should like to appeal to the Deputy Minister once more to consider this matter. Consequently the same applies in respect of my second and third amendments, for the reasons already mentioned. I have already pointed out by way of an interjection that as the Bill reads at the moment the Minister is unable to involve these two bodies, namely the CSIR and the National Development and Management Foundation, in this regard, because they are not employers involved in the training of these people. Subsection (2) only refers to &#x201C;a group or association of employers&#x201D; which may be involved. The Minister is therefore unable, under that subsection, to involve these bodies in this council. And then, as far as the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reaction to amendment (5) is concerned, I have to point out that the issue here is not the definition of &#x201C;industry&#x201D;. Therefore the hon. the Deputy Minister is correct in that respect. But provision is being made here for a group of persons who are not employers, as I have pointed out. If, therefore, the amendment were to be accepted, the hon. the Minister would be able to involve representatives of other groups like the CSIR and others, which are not employers and cannot therefore automatically be included in this Bill.</p>

<p><span class="col_7263-7264" refersTo="page_0962"/>The emphasis in my fifth amendment is not, therefore on the definition of &#x201C;industry&#x201D;, but on the distinction I draw between employers and other persons. It does seem as if the hon. the Minister may find it necessary to involve such people, and I shall therefore be obliged if the hon. the Minister will reconsider this amendment, in spite of his initial reaction. Sir, the hon. the Minister has not yet reacted to my question&#x2014;it is not covered by my amendments&#x2014;as to whether he will not make provision&#x2014;even though it may be in the Other Place&#x2014;for power to nominate persons to the council in their personal capacities as well, and not necessarily just as a representative of a body. May I also, then, just ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, setting aside the amendments, for an explanation in regard to sub-clause (3)(a), the question of the period of three years for which they are appointed, subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine at the time of his appointment. The hon. the Deputy Minister must furnish us with replies to three questions: In the first place, why the period of three years; secondly, what the nature of the conditions are which may be determined under this subsection; and, thirdly, what provision is made for when a representative of one of these bodies is no longer attached to the body which has elected him? Say, for instance, the Confederation of Labour or the Chamber of Commerce appoints one of their directors to this council <i>ex officio,</i> but the person later leaves the employ of that body and his substitute is no longer available either. Should provision not be made in the Bill for the membership of the body which has appointed him also to be terminated? I am just asking what the ideas of the Deputy Minister are with regard to the implementation of this suggestion.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to react to a few things, Sir. We shall have to take a look at the last point the hon. member raised. As far as the Department of National Education is concerned, we do not think that this department is directly involved here. If education is, in fact to be involved, then we have the representation of our own Department of Bantu Education, by four persons in the council. National Education is, in any case, responsible for the education of Whites and therefore I do not think it is necessary to involve that department in this as well. I do not know whether I should say more about this, but I believe that the approval of the Minister should not be such an obstacle. We cannot do away with it, in spite of what the hon. member for Durban Central has said. I think this cuts both ways. If the Minister should recommend somebody who is unacceptable to those people, it could create problems, but the same is applicable if they should come up with someone unacceptable to the Minister. It is a situation which could indeed arise, and there has to be somebody who can make a final decision, in this case, the responsible person namely the Minister. I do not wish to deny that awkward situations could arise, but I do not believe it need necessarily be so. I do not believe the possibilities are so many that we shall have a position of checkmate. I just want to point out that the bodies which served on the standing committee, have agreed to this set-up. In other words, these bodies&#x2014;employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organizations&#x2014;were satisfied that the decision should be the Minister&#x2019;s in the final analysis. It is not, however, the intention that he should simply make one-sided decisions from the outset. The intention is that decisions should be made after consultation. Hon. members will bear in mind that we have had legislation previously where the words &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D; or &#x201C;after consultation of&#x201D; have been at issue. &#x201C;In consultation with&#x201D; means a combined decision, and in this case the decision of one person can invalidate the decision of another and a position of checkmate could arise. &#x201C;After consultation&#x201D;, however, means that one specific person still has the power, after consultation, to make the final decision.</p>

<p>I do not really have any further remarks to make. We shall have to think a little more deeply about the last matter the hon. member for Edenvale mentioned, as I have already said.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 7, in lines 22 to 24, to omit subsection (1) and to substitute:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) The council shall from among its members elect a chairman and a vice-chairman.</li>

</ol>

<p>I have already pointed out that this council consists of representatives of important and responsible bodies. We feel the council is certainly competent, and should therefore also be given the right, to appoint its own chairman and vice-chairman. It is quite customary, in bodies with a semi-autonomous capacity&#x2014;and I have already indicated that this council will not only function as an advisory body, in my opinion, but also as a kind of semi-autonomous body&#x2014;that the body in question should have the power to appoint its own chairman and vice-chairman. Therefore it is unnecessary, in my opinion, for the hon. the Minister to have the power to appoint a chairman or vice-chairman. I shall therefore let my motivation suffice. I think the matter has been stated quite clearly enough.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I understand the idea of the hon. member for Eden vale. However, I should like to mention two reasons why I am unable to accept his proposal. There was a proposal before the standing committee, which considered this problem for a long time, that the matter should be left open. When it was explained how the council would function and what the duties of the chairman and his direct link with the secretariat would be, the standing committee felt that in view of practical circumstances the matter should be left in the hands of the Minister. At first glance, therefore, and on paper, the suggestion of the hon. member has merit, but in view of practical circumstances it is desirable that it should rather remain as it is, viz. that the Minister designates the chairman and the vice-chairman at the request of the standing committee, the standing committee which has experienced the practical problems. Because of the large amount of work there will be virtually continuous liaison between the chairman and the secretariat.</p>

<p>Amendment negatived.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the two amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) In the Afrikaans text, on page 6, in line 61, to omit &#x201C;opvoeding&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;onderwys&#x201D;;</block>

<block name="quote">(2) on page 9, in lines 5 to 7, to omit subsection (3).</block>

<p>The first amendment is in fact, a minor one since it merely seeks to substitute the word &#x201C;onderwys&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;opvoeding&#x201D; in the Afrikaans text. I think the inclusion, in the first place, of the word &#x201C;opvoeding&#x201D; in the Bill is to be ascribed to a grammatical error. Consequently there is no need for me to elaborate on this. Indeed, it is clear to all that there is a difference between the two terms.</p>

<p>The effect of the second amendment is the omission of subsection (3) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may for the purpose of subsection (1) fix areas and may fix different areas in respect of different categories of work determined by him for this purpose.</block>

<p>Apart from the confusion which may be created by this subsection, the problems to which it may give rise and the possibility that differentiation may take place between areas to the detriment of the training given, it does seem to me as though all the powers which the Minister may exercise, are adequately covered by the provisions of subsections (1) and (2). Indeed, subsection (1) already contains a provision&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_7267-7268" refersTo="page_0964"/>&#x2026; and subject to such conditions as he may deem fit to impose &#x2026;</p>

<p>This amounts to the Minister having a wide power to impose any conditions which he may deem fit. It seems undesirable to me to specify in subsection (3) what kind of condition the Minister may impose. We must also look at subsection (2) which provides that in addition to the general conditions which may be imposed by the Minister in terms of subsection (1), he may also impose conditions relating to, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the courses of training which may be provided;</li>

<li>(b) the nature, duration and standard of such courses;</li>

<li>(c) the premises, equipment, facilities and materials to be used or provided for the purposes of such training &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>As far as I am concerned, subsection (3) is tautological not only because subsections (1) and (2) confer on the Minister all the powers he needs, but also because it may open the door to confusion, a lack of confidence in the council as well as a lack of confidence in the implementation of the Bill. Therefore, to my mind there seems to be no reason for retaining the subsection in the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the first amendment. It simply amounts to a choice of words.</p>

<p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, we must have regard to the possibility of different areas possibly being fixed for different forms of training. One may have a very extensive area which covers one kind of training and within that same area one may also have another form of training. In view of this I think that differentiation within the area fixed is necessary. There is also the question of levies. One must make provision for not having an umbrella levy covering a large area, while it would be better to make a particular levy applicable to a smaller area. It seems to me that it would be better, because of the practical circumstances, to retain in the clause the provision concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister did not really tell us why he needs subsection (3) specifically. The hon. member for Edenvale has made it clear that two or more employers may not provide training to workers without their having regard to the conditions which the Minister may impose in terms of subsection (2). Although provision is being made specifically for that in subsection (2), the Minister still wants to add the provision contained in subsection (3). I just want to tell the hon. the Minister that this provision, as it reads at present, and especially the part which reads &#x201C;the Minister may &#x2026; fix different areas in respect of different categories of work&#x201D;, may unfortunately be interpreted by certain people as rendering possible a situation of a form of reservation being applied in that it may be said that people may not be trained in certain categories of work. I believe, subsection (3), as it stands, will do the Bill, or actually the object the hon. the Minister seeks to achieve by means of the Bill, more harm than good. In his reply the hon. the Minister indicated what he wished to achieve by means of this provision, and I believe that he can achieve those objects without his retaining subsection (3) of clause 7.</p>

<block name="quote">(1) On page 11, in lines 18 to 22, to omit subsection (1);</block>

<block name="quote">(2) on page 11, in lines 26 and 27, to omit &#x201C;the centre to which the application relates&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;a centre&#x201D;.</block>

<p>During the Second Reading we asked the hon. the Deputy Minister to explain to us the circumstances envisaged by him which would necessitate the type of prohibition provided for in clause 11. I want to say at once that although I listened attentively to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply in this regard, nothing that he said was a truly convincing reason to my mind for having this really serious restriction. I quoted concrete examples in this connection. For instance, I pointed out that if a farmer&#x2019;s scheme was not approved in terms of this provision, it would become impossible for him to train a Bantu labourer of another farmer in, say, the handling and repair of agricultural machinery. In fact, the farmer would be committing a very serious offence if he were to do so in spite of this. This is the logical implication of this prohibition. What is more, at the moment there are, in fact, a large number of cases of employers assisting the employees of other employers to improve their proficiency for the work they are performing. I can see no justification for this particular prohibition at all. This prohibition was not included in the draft Bill which was published and on which comments were invited. In other words, there was no indication whatsoever of the department considering this matter as being of such a serious nature at that stage as to want to include this prohibition. What is more, the prohibition makes provision for a very stiff fine and this is how it has been included in the Bill. I should like to know whether representations were made to the department and by whom they were made, representations which resulted in this prohibition being inserted into the legislation after the publication of the draft Bill. I should also like to know what the real motivation for this was. It seems to me as though a criminal offence is being created here unnecessarily. Something of this kind is without rhyme or reason. After all, the Bill is meant to be a positive contribution towards the in-service training of Bantu employees. Why should this totally negative aspect be included here? It seems to me to be quite unjustified and quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>For that reason I should feel very much happier if we were to confine ourselves to the positive aspects of this measure instead. In the light of the practical circumstances to which I referred, it is, in my opinion, preferable for us to remove this prohibition from the Bill entirely. I cannot see any sense in it. I cannot see what is to be gained by it. It seems to be totally negative to me. It seems undesirable to me and I should therefore like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to give serious consideration to removing this prohibition, in other words, to accepting my amendment.</p>

<p>My second amendment is consequential upon the first. If the first were to be omitted, the second would have to be formulated anew in order to provide for the recognition of these private centres by the Minister and by the department. If it would make the hon. the Deputy Minister happier&#x2014;in the event of my first amendment being accepted&#x2014;I should be satisfied to keep to the original wording relating to the recognition of the private centres, as published in the draft Bill. However, I do not see this prohibition serving any useful purpose. It can only cause unnecessary friction and seems to me to be highly undesirable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as regards the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Edenvale, I, too, should like to request the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to accepting it. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree with me that <span class="col_7271-7272" refersTo="page_0966"/>the basic aims of any legislation amount to certain things being allowed and encouraged on the one hand and certain things being prohibited on the other. Legislation also seeks to make any contravention as regards those things which are prohibited, a punishable offence. Consequently it is completely beyond my comprehension why a piece of legislation which is intended to be a positive measure in its entirety, and which has as its object the training of people, should include a provision such as the one we find in clause 11(1) of this Bill. The provision contained in this clause amounts to a prohibition on the training of people. Looking at clause 19&#x2014;clause 19 deals with offences and penalties&#x2014;we see that any person who contravenes clause 11(1), shall be liable to the heaviest penalty for which provision is being made in the Bill. Whereas, in the case of other offences, a fine not exceeding R50 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one month is laid down, a fine not exceeding R1 000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year is laid down in the case of a contravention of clause 11(1). Therefore, on close examination of this Bill, we see that what the hon. member for Edenvale said, is in fact true. This is a negative aspect of the Bill. An extremely negative aspect is embodied in clause 11(1). I know that the hon. the Deputy Minister said that they could register as private centres. However, the fact remains that there may be many reasons why it may be easier for a person to make use of the services of someone else, a person who has the necessary facilities at his disposal for giving specific training, training which does not take a long time but which can be given over a short period, or on a part-time basis, for example, one day a week or a few hours a week. By having this provision in the Bill, one is actually thwarting instead of encouraging training. Consequently I ask the Minister to accept this specific amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_klerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the two hon. members who moved and supported the amendment, respectively, have no reason for concern. They are mistaken as regards a basic point of departure. They take a much too wide a view of the concept of &#x201C;training&#x201D;. Training is defined in the Bill as &#x201C;any training which has as its special aim the improvement of the proficiency of any employee for any work performed in or in connection with any industry&#x201D;. If we read this definition in conjunction with, for example, clause 7 as well as clause 11(2)(b), we see that training is dealt with within the context of the legislation as a course which is offered. Training, therefore, relates to the actual provision of instruction on an orderly basis to people who present themselves as &#x201C;trainees&#x201D; at a centre, be it a private centre or a public centre. Therefore the examples mentioned by the hon. member for Edenvale do not enter into the picture. If a farmer shows an employee of a fellow farmer how a particular implement works, that is not training. If a manufacturer demonstrates the working of implements supplied by him, that constitutes orientation as regards the implement and its use. Somewhere, however, one crosses over the dividing line, the line between showing a person how something works, giving information as to the use of a particular article, and offering an actual course. As soon as this line has been overstepped, it is in the interests of the employee not to be exposed to training which is not properly ordered or which does not comply with proper standards.</p>

<p>On the other hand I should like to say that training in industry is often dangled like a carrot in front of people who are persuaded in this way to purchase expensive machinery. People are advised to purchase complicated machinery; if they do, the suppliers will train the workers. After an enormous price has been paid for the machinery, the promised training is so superficial that one has in fact not purchased any training. In that case one may experience endless problems in using the article. Consequently this provision will also protect the purchasers of expensive implements, machinery and instruments. It will ensure that when training is promised, training as defined in the Bill will be provided, orderly training, training which complies with the conditions laid down by a council or on the advice of a council.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, everything which the hon. member for Ver-eeniging said, actually supports my standpoint. If this involved other things such as general evening classes or other training, I could have understood some measure of control having to be exercised. What is involved here, however, is training. The hon. member for Vereeniging rightly indicated that <span class="col_7273-7274" refersTo="page_0967"/>this training is defined as training which has as its aim the improvement of the proficiency of a person for work performed by him. In doing so the hon. member for Vereeniging endorsed my point, on the very grounds of that definition of training. He excluded all possible theoretical dangers. Under what circumstances is it conceivable that a person is going to provide training to an employee in order to improve that employee&#x2019;s proficiency for the work which he performs for a particular employer? The hon. member for Vereeniging also referred to people who purchased expensive machinery or who were persuaded to purchase expensive machinery, subsequent to which the promised service was not provided as a result of which their capital had actually been wasted. If this is the consideration, the matter must be left to the free market economy. It is not a matter to be dealt with in terms of this serious prohibition. What employer, in theory, will send his employees to such an organization under those circumstances? In my honest opinion, this argument has no validity. In the third place, it is evident that the hon. member for Vereeniging misunderstood me, because I did not say that one farmer should demonstrate to the employee of another farmer how a tractor works. I spoke of mechanical repairs to tractors, work for which training is essential. However, this is not demonstration. I made this very clear, so I think the hon. member for Vereeniging was being somewhat malicious in suggesting that I was not aware of the difference between training and demonstration.</p>

I cannot find any justification in what the hon. member for Vereeniging or the hon. the Deputy Minister said for including this prohibition in the Bill. I want to ask once again why this prohibition was not included in the original draft Bill. I would also like to know who made representations and what the problems are which are actually foreseen. Why, if this is so important, was that point not presented for public comment when this Bill was published?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the matter is not as simple as the hon. members for Edenvale and Durban Central made it out to be. In the first place it was published in the <i>Gazette</i> and comments were received only afterwards. The comments came from the very body which dealt with this legislation all along and which is a responsible body, viz. the permanent committee. Bodies such as the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organizations, as well as the South African Agricultural Union, serve on this permanent committee. Reference was made to the training of tractor drivers. Now, it is interesting to note that the South African Agricultural Union serves on this permanent committee, so it, too, requested that the specific wording read as it does. Moreover, the South African Agricultural Union is the very body which requested in anticipation, in terms of this legislation, a public centre such as this at which employers can be trained in agriculture.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It does affect it. According to the hon. member a public centre such as this would consequently have to fall away, because then any person could give another person&#x2019;s employee some rudimentary training over a period of a few weeks. In any event, this provision is a perpetuation of a prohibition which exists in terms of the Bantu Education Act, viz. that one may not simply go ahead and provide training. One cannot simply go ahead and establish some little school for training people. A training centre must be registered and controlled. I wonder whether the difference is not to be found in the fact that members on that side of the House have a different approach to these things to members on this side of the House. Hon. members on that side of the House are more afraid of the idea of control than members on this side of the House are. Surely hon. members know the old slogan of Jeremy Bentlam: &#x201C;Law and government are necessary evils&#x2014;the lesser thereof the better.&#x201D; Perhaps hon. members on the opposite side of the <span class="col_7275-7276" refersTo="page_0968"/>House have retained something of that approach. If all that is involved, however, is giving a worker some rudimentary training, for example, by showing him how a washing machine works or how he has to work with a refrigerator or freezer, one cannot regard that as training. This is mere orientation.</p>

<p>This legislation, however, seeks to eliminate an evil which may arise, and this is something which was spotted by the permanent committee consisting of employers and employees. It may happen that a person establishes his own centre in order to train the employees of others and charge those persons higher tuition fees. Cases of people charging high fees for training and offering all sorts of courses in order to train people, in the sphere of in-service training as well, have come to the attention of the committee and the department. In many cases the fees amounted to R50 per pupil. This means that if such a person is fined an amount of R100, he pays this fine from the fees which he receives from only one pupil in his school. These are all matters which have come to our attention, and in the light of this I think it is necessary to have this provision. This measure, however, does not impose restrictions on the training which an employer&#x2019;s organization wants to give its own employees. But it must have the training recognized if it wants to qualify for increased tax concessions. However, if the organization wants to train other peoples&#x2019; employees, control must be exercised because, in the light of representations made to the department, it is aware of the dangers, abuses and exploitation which may be experienced in connection with such training. Consequently I regret being unable to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Durban Central. The whole problem is solved if the words &#x201C;for a consideration&#x201D; are inserted. The Deputy Minister said that we are afraid of the law; that in our approach towards that side of the House we are always afraid of the law. Sir, we are afraid of the law, because in terms of this provision, if I help one of my fellow-farmers I am breaking the law. Let me just explain the position as it relates to the farming industry. I must say that I cannot understand how the Agricultural Union did not see this. If I want to train some of my labourers for instance in the grading or pruning of bananas, I send them to the best farm in the area and ask the farmer to take them for a week or so when he is grading or pruning, so that they can work with him and then return to my farm. He does this as a favour. He has the use of those labourers to help his own labourers during that time, and that is his reward. If he were to charge me for doing that, I could see the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s point, but in such a case there is no charge. That farmer does this for all his friends who require his help. Why prevent that? I really feel that this amendment should be accepted, unless the Deputy Minister is prepared to revise the definition of &#x201C;training&#x201D;. As I see it, however, he can overcome his problem simply by including the words &#x201C;for a consideration&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, as hon. members have indicated, this amendment will actually eliminate to a large extent the problems expounded by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I indicated in the course of my Second Reading speech that I definitely did not agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s interpretation, i.e. that this training was illegal in terms of the Bantu Education Act. There is nothing in the Bantu Education Act, according to my own interpretation of the Act, rendering this type of training a criminal offence. During the Second Reading the hon. the Deputy Minister himself referred to the large number of schemes being conducted in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act. Therefore, does this imply that all those schemes, unless they are registered under this Bill, contravene the provisions not only of this Bill but also of the Bantu Education Act? I should very much like to have an answer to these points from the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>On amendment (1) moved by Mr. N. J. J. Olivier,</p>

<p>Question put: That the words &#x201C;(1) No person shall provide training for the employees of any other person&#x201D; stand part of the clause,</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 13:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Before calling on an hon. member to speak, I must point out that I have to rule the amendment in the name of the hon. member for Edenvale on the Order Paper, out of order since it involves increased State expenditure and, as such, requires the State President&#x2019;s recommendation. Nevertheless I shall allow him a turn to speak so that he may try to convince the hon. the Deputy Minister to take over the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 13, in lines 32 and 33, to omit &#x201C;in any economic development area determined by the Minister&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, two matters are involved here. The clause provides for grants-in-aid being provided to employers who have an industry in the economic development area. The first problem is that an economic development area is not defined in the Bill. Therefore there is no indication in the Bill of in which region this kind of financial aid will be granted. However, I assume that this will apply for border areas and even for development in the Bantu homelands, but I do not know whether there are any further areas which the hon. the Minister wants to include in the economic development.</p>

<p>I now come to the second problem. The work has to continue no matter where it is done, because the Black workers are there. They ought to be utilized as effectively as possible wherever they work. This is, after all, the train of thought as the hon. the Deputy Minister expounded it during his Second Reading speech when he connected the training with, <i>inter alia</i>, two factors. The one is the increase of productivity of the Black employees and on the second factor, he said that this may indeed lead towards a possible reduction in the number of the Black workers employed in industries in the so-called White areas. Under these circumstances and according to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s own motivation it still seems to me as if a case can be made out as to why grants-in-aid should also be given in certain cases to employers who have industries outside the economic development area.</p>

<p>Furthermore I want to indicate that the provision is merely permissive and therefore places no obligation upon the Minister to provide financial aid. He still has a discretion. Since this is the case, I ask why it is necessary for the hon. the Minister to restrict his own <span class="col_7281-7282" refersTo="page_0971"/>discretion so that he can only provide aid within economic development areas. I therefore ask whether the hon. the Deputy Minister will not consider changing this position.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. member will know, it is the policy of this side of the House to stimulate development in the border areas. This is important in various respects. Therefore it is in the interests of our broader economy and also of social interest. Everyone will admit that an excessive concentration of industries, employment opportunities, etc. within a particular area creates all kinds of social and other problems. For this reason we have this very practical and, in my opinion, very sensible policy. It is in the interests of both the Whites in South Africa and the homelands to create employment opportunities within the reach of those people we want to prevent from flocking to the White areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I have no objection to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Good, then you agree with me. The purpose here is the additional stimulation of that development because employers in the other areas already receive such a substantial tax concession that it is very beneficial to them. This additional encouragement to industrialists in the border industry areas make employment opportunities available and to provide in-service training there, is in the interests of the homelands. Everyone is blaming us for the fact that the homelands are not developing fast enough and that we do not create sufficient employment opportunities there. It costs R8 000 to create a single employment opportunity, and if we have to create employment opportunities for 160 000 people per year in our area, it will cost us almost R1,5 milliard per year. It is in order to intercept that position that one makes it possible for those people to receive in-service training in an area where people can be accommodated more cheaply and perhaps also offer cheaper labour. Further it agrees with our broad policy of decentralization and rendering those communities self-sufficient. We promote this through this additional provision.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 19:</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as clause 19 is concerned &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I just want to point out that the hon. member&#x2019;s two amendments are out of order, but if he wants to move new amendments, he is free to do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you very much, Sir. The hon. member for Durban Central will presently move an amendment which amount to the fact that, while we accept that the offence remains and that penalties consequently have to be laid down in the Bill, we want to object to the extent of the fine for which the Bill provides. I shall leave it to my colleague to move the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the following two amendments&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 19, in lines 26 to 29, to omit subparagraph (i);</li>

<li>(2) On page 19, after &#x201C;paragraph&#x201D; in lines 30 and 31, to insert &#x201C;(a),&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>The effect of this will be that there will be one uniform fine for all offences whereas, at the present moment, provision is made for a maximum fine of R1 000 or 12 months&#x2019; imprisonment for the contravention of clause 11(1). Following the acceptance of these two amendments the same penalties applicable in the case of a contravention of any other clause of the Bill, will also apply in the case of a contravention of clause 11(1), which is a fine of R50 or imprisonment not exceeding a period of one month.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, the standpoint has already been stated that clause 11(1) should not be subject to a penalty. However, this is the case and in terms of the provision of the clause it may even be an offence when someone provides free training to a friend. Our feeling is that, if the penalty with respect to clause 11(1) is compared with the penalties are mentioned elsewhere in the Bill, it seems to be quite unfair. For instance somebody who fails to pay a levy, may only be fined R50. Somebody who fails to produce inspection books or keep certain records in connection <span class="col_7283-7284" refersTo="page_0972"/>with his training centre, can only be fined R50. These and other offences, which in my opinion are extremely serious, are subject to a penalty of only R50 or imprisonment not exceeding one month, while a so-called offence which is committed by a person who is actually providing training, is punishable with a fine of R1 000 or with imprisonment not exceeding one year. Since the hon. the Deputy Minister has now decided that the latter person should be punished for the good work he is doing, we believe that the relevant penalty should be limited to a fine of R50 or imprisonment not exceeding one month.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in my opinion it is necessary for me once again to emphasize that this matter enjoyed the attention of a whole number of organizations, not only employers&#x2019; organizations, but also employees&#x2019; organizations. Those people made this suggestion themselves. In view of practical dangers they are dealing with<i>&#x2014;inter alia,</i> exploitation they are experiencing&#x2014;they asked for very strict action to be taken. They asked for this themselves. They said a fine of R100 was no deterrent for somebody wanting to train other employers&#x2019; employees, especially taking into consideration all the malpractices which might flow from it. They also pointed out that it is possible for someone to provide training to people who are not employed at all. This is a matter which should be controlled. If one trains a great many people who are not even employed and after that tries to distribute them amongst employers in a haphazard way, what is going to happen? Very well, the Department of Labour will supervise the employment of people, but the purpose is to nip that sort of unholy practice in the bud.</p>

<p>It is not the Department of Bantu Education which noticed this danger or warned against these abuses; it is the experience of people who deal actively with the practical problems, the employers&#x2019; and the employees&#x2019; organizations. They are the ones who asked for protection and who requested that a far higher fine be laid down to serve as a deterrent. As I said previously, there are certain employers who simply provide additional training, a course here and another there. For every one of those courses the employers charge between R10 and R50. In that way he can earn about R250 from the training of one single employee. The employer can easily pay his fine from the class fees paid by one single employee because he perhaps has 100 other employees to whom he is providing training. It is to present this kind of malpractice that it was decided to impose heavy penalties on those who contravene this provision. I am sorry, I have already held out two carrots to the hon. members. They have already eaten them and do not know it. However, we shall content ourselves with this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, every time the hon. the Deputy Minister rejects an amendment, he advances an argument which actually frustrates his own point. The hon. the Deputy Minister has already referred to the fact that those Bantu may not even be employed. But then they are not covered by clause 11. Clause 11 only refers to people who provide training to employees of other employers, and the word &#x201C;employee&#x201D; is defined in the Bill as people who are employed. Therefore the whole point which the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned has no bearing on the matter whatsoever.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the second point is concerned, the hon. the Deputy Minister referred to possibilities which exist and not to things which actually exist, because if there are offences, I want to say that in terms of the definitions of &#x201C;industry&#x201D;, &#x201C;employer&#x201D;, &#x201C;employee&#x201D;, that kind of problem is a theoretical one in my opinion. If it should arise in practice, then, as I requested previously, he must furnish us with precise examples for the kind of problems which are expected to arise. I cannot imagine that anyone would be prepared <span class="col_7285-7286" refersTo="page_0973"/>to incur the capital expenditure without State subsidies, especially in view of this Bill. This Bill, makes special provision for State aid in one form or another for the training of employees in terms of the procedure which is created here. Now someone has to incur capital expenditure for buildings, facilities, machinery and all this kind of thing in order to establish some kind of private training centre for training employees, as defined, of employers, as defined. I can really not see who would make such a fool of himself under these circumstances. After all, he knows now that these facilities are available to other employers to use. Under these circumstances it seems to me that I have to say once again that I fully support the amendment of my colleague. The answer which the hon. the Deputy Minister provides is not at all convincing.</p>

<heading>LAND BANK AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the hon. the Minister of Finance, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members will recall that in his Budget speech this year the hon. the Minister of Finance mentioned the Government&#x2019;s decision, in regard to the purchase of land for the Bantu homelands by the S.A. Bantu Trust, to allow the Trust to take over existing mortgage bonds on property which is being purchased, in order to augment in this way the financial resources available for the purchase of land. The Land Bank was approached for cooperation in this respect. Arising out of that the Land Bank Board decided to consider applications of the S.A. Bantu Trust for the purpose of repaying money owed to the Land Bank by persons whose land was acquired by the Bantu Trust. The consideration of applications by the Land Bank Board will take place on the conditions determined by the Board in consultation with the Government, and are subject to the necessary amendments to the Land Bank Act, since the existing Act does not contain authorization for the furnishing of advances for the contemplated purpose. The principle objective of this amending Bill is therefore to grant the Land Bank Board statutory power for the furnishing of such advances to the S.A. Bantu Trust.</p>

<p>The personal conditions which the Land Bank Act imposes in regard to mortgage bonds to farmers cannot be made applicable to the S.A. Bantu Trust, and consequently the Land Bank mortgage bonds on properties purchased by the Bantu Trust will have to be cancelled when transfer is registered. In order, therefore, to make provision for an alternative form of security for the repayment of the money advanced by the Bank to the Trust, as well as for the interest on it, the Bill contains a provision in terms of which the debt which the <span class="col_7287-7288" refersTo="page_0974"/>Trust incurs at the Bank is considered to be guaranteed by the Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this measure has become necessary to augment the funds made available to the Trust for purchasing farms under the Government&#x2019;s consolidation plans, and also in the pursuance of its policy to carry out the obligations, as it sees it, under the 1936 Land Act.</p>

<p>When the consolidation plans were discussed last year, we pointed out that the plans were too grandiose and that the Government did not have any hope of being able to purchase all the land within a reasonable time. Our forecast proved to be correct. The Government now finds itself in an embarrassing position in not being able to buy the farms within a reasonable period. The farmers have been embarrassed because they were given to understand that they would be able to sell their farms within a reasonable period. Some have already made provision to leave their farms. We know that the programme is in a complete mess. There has been ineptitude and bungling by the department and by the Ministers concerned. The previous Deputy Minister will admit that he received deputations from angry farmers who called upon him to carry out the promises. We know that there was gross favouritism in some instances. Because of what has happened and because of the state in which farmers find themselves, especially in the Ciskei, the Government has had to come to light with some measure to augment the funds available.</p>

<p>It may be said that it is not truly the function of the Land Bank to finance the Trust in buying land for Bantu occupation in independent homelands. It is so that this is not the function of the Land Bank. That is why this Bill is necessary to create the powers necessary to carry out the undertakings as outlined by the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>However, the position of the farmers concerned is such an urgent one that we are prepared in this instance to agree to the Bill and to allow the Land Bank to undertake the further obligations. It is also true that the Land Bank in these circumstances will not be called upon to pay out funds which could be used to assist farmers elsewhere, because here is really merely a substitution of the Trust as the debtor under existing bonds. The hon. the Deputy Minister made it clear in his speech as to why it is necessary. It will not be a substitution in the deeds registry in the ordinary course, because fresh bonds will in fact have to be passed. Unfortunately the hon. the Deputy Minister has not told us under what conditions these bonds will be granted to the Trust. Will the same conditions with regard to repayment and rates of interest apply as in the case of the bonds to be cancelled? This may affect the Land Bank in that if the conditions of repayment are not the same as those imposed on the farmers concerned, the sellers, the bank may find itself prejudiced in its income. The funds may fall off with the result that sufficient funds may not be available to farmers elsewhere. I am sorry that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not been able to give us more information in his introductory speech as to the conditions on which the Trust will be getting the money.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before the House adjourned for lunch I had mentioned that this Bill was necessary to assist those farmers who found themselves seriously embarrassed, not through any fault of their own, but solely as the result of the Government&#x2019;s attempts to carry out is its impractical ideology in this regard. I pointed out that it was not the function of the Land Bank to make money available to buy land for occupation by Bantu in the independent homelands. However, our concern for the fanners in their tragic circumstances is so great that we are prepared to support this measure. Moreover it does not mean that any funds are going to be taken from the pool which is normally available for assisting the farmers. This is merely substituting one debtor for another.</p>

<p>Before the adjournment I was dealing with the question of the conditions in regard to the repayment of the bonds. I mentioned that the hon. the Minister, in his introduction of the Bill, had not given us any information as to how repayment of the bonds advanced to the Trust, were to be repaid. What we want to know is whether the conditions for the Trust will be the same as for the farmers concerned. In other words, will the Land Bank be in no worse a position than it would be if the bonds <span class="col_7289-7290" refersTo="page_0975"/>remained &#x2026; I see the hon. the Deputy Minister is shaking his head, which leads me to believe that the Trust is going to receive more favourable conditions from the Land Bank. We want information on this and I shall be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister will give it to us. I also want an assurance from the hon. the Minister that if this Bill goes through, and we are prepared to give it a speedy passage because of the seriousness of the position of these farmers, the farmers who have offered their farms for sale, will receive the immediate attention of his department. Will the offers be renewed to those farmers who had their offers withdrawn? The hon. the Deputy Minister must bear in mind that the valuations of most of those farms were made some time during last year, before devaluation. Therefore the value of these farms must have been affected.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Griqualand East, in giving his support to this legislation, made a wide detour. In this year&#x2019;s Budget approximately R30 million is provided for the purchase of land. Here we have a measure to assist the Bantu Trust to spend more money on the purchase of land than just the R30 million. According to the priority list, this means that it will be possible to finance from other funds these farms which can be purchased and in respect of which Land Bank mortgage bonds exist, in other words, they can be financed by funds the Land Bank is able to make available. I believe the Land Bank will have the right to issue special securities at a higher rate of interest than the present rate of interest to be able to make these additional funds available. The funds are made available at a rate of interest which differs from that applicable to farmers. In other words, it will not be necessary to utilize the funds which can be made available to farmers from normal sources for agricultural purposes. Therefore, the usual funds will still be available to the farmers. This ought to allay the fears of the hon. member for Griqualand East This is merely one of the additional measures. Other measures are being envisaged. We welcome this measure. The hon. member for Griqualand East suggested that a great deal of inconvenience was caused through the fact that the future boundaries of land which has to be purchased, has been made public. However, this was not the only thing which caused inconvenience. In the past the complaint has always been that the boundaries have not been made public. The fact that the boundaries have not been made public also caused inconvenience and uncertainty. It is therefore necessary for the proposed boundaries to be determined and now that this has been done, it can be accepted that problems will flow from this. It is not our fault that international financial problems and a shortage of funds are being experienced. However, in this way it is being made possible for funds to be made available to the Land Bank from the private sector in order to enable the Land Bank in turn to assist the farmers in that purchases will be expedited. Therefore, this is a positive measure in all respects. However, should it also be realized that, as I have said, this is not the only measure which is being considered. There are other measures as well, and the Deputy Minister will introduce a Bill in that regard in the near future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on these benches will support the Second Reading of this Bill. At the same time, however, I believe that there are a number of things that need to be said and a number of questions that need to be asked. It is quite clear that this Bill does not offer an instant solution to the problems of the farmers in the Transkei or in other homelands. Far from it. It deals with only one small aspect of the whole problem. The hon. member for Klip River has just said that as far as he is concerned, this measure will not affect the position of the Land Bank in so far as its normal loans to farmers are concerned. The hon. the Deputy Minister nods his head and I am pleased to hear it. But the House has not been told what is actually going to happen. Where is the money coming from? Are additional funds going to be provided for the Land Bank? What is the quantity of the funds which is going to be made available in order to implement the measure? We have been told nothing in regard to these aspects, <span class="col_7291-7292" refersTo="page_0976"/>but are being asked to pass this legislation almost in a blank cheque form because an emergency situation exists. I think the hon. member for Griqualand East is understandably concerned about the people in the area and their farms. One thing however is clear and that is that the Land Bank has not been created for this purpose. This is a new approach because of a problem which the Government has encountered. I think hon. members are entitled to know what the amount is which is likely to be involved. Is this only an emergency procedure or is it going to be applied to all sorts of land which is going to be taken over by the Bantu Trust, not only in the Transkei, but also elsewhere? Is it a long-term proposition or is it only an emergency measure? We are entitled to know these things when we are asked to deal with this type of legislation.</p>

<p>It is clear that what is happening now is the Republic, because of its future relationship with the Transkei, is now going to be forced, even after independence, to purchase land and to pay for it, even although it will then be situated in a foreign country. Because of these circumstances this legislation is being introduced as the first of a series. But it is not the end of the problems which will arise in regard to this matter. The tragedy is the Republic is in the process of getting itself into long-term hock, if I may use that word, into a long-term debt because of purely ideological reasons. We are finding ourselves in these circumstances due to the incompetence of the Government in handling a matter in which human beings are involved and in regard to which commitments have to be met.</p>

<p>There is another issue which I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to deal with. Why is it that the S.A. Bantu Trust, which is now, in legislation that is pending, to be given the power to borrow money, to issue promisory notes and to do things of that nature, cannot itself raise the finance? I am sorry that the hon. the Minister of Finance is not dealing with this piece of legislation himself. I would like to know, for example, and maybe the hon. the Deputy Minister can tell us, why it is now going to be permissible for insurance companies to hold the securities which are issued by the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards in the urban areas and why can they not be securities which the S.A. Bantu Trust issues and which could then be held by insurance companies and banks in exactly the same way as we are now going to find Bantu Administration Boards being able to have their securities held and money being raised in that fashion. We should have legislation which would give whatever power the Bantu Trust needs in order to do this, and I think it needs an explanation in greater depth than has been given by the hon. the Deputy Minister as to why the Land Bank in these circumstances, created for a particular purpose, is now being used for a different purpose.</p>

<p>Sir, while we support this legislation because of an emergency situation and because we believe that there are certain obligations that have to be honoured, at the same time we do it with considerable misgivings, because we are virtually forced to help people who are in difficulty because of the ideological adventure on which this Government has embarked.</p>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to be as negative as the hon. member for Yeoville was. I am very pleased about the legislation which is before this House this afternoon, and I am particularly pleased that the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development introduced it. I want to tell you why, Sir. This is a demonstration to me not only of the confidence which is placed in the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, but of the co-ordination which exists between the Departments concerned, the Department of Finance and the Department of Bantu Administration in this regard. I say that I am very pleased that this Bill is before this House this afternoon. The Government has, over the years, adopted a standpoint in respect of this land which has to be added to the homelands, and in respect of which it has a debt of honour to pay. Under the difficult economic circumstances which have existed recently, we might not be able to purchase the amount of land we should like to purchase for the Bantu homelands with the R30 million. Therefore we are coming forward with this positive measure to make it possible for the S.A. Bantu Trust to purchase this land. The hon. member for Griqualand East as well as the hon. member for Yeoville expressed misgivings to the effect that this could possibly reduce the amount of money available for the farmers now. The hon. member for Klip River has already replied to this. If one looks at the Bill, one sees that the proposed section 45<i>ter</i> will determine that the <span class="col_7293-7294" refersTo="page_0977"/>Bank may advance money to the S.A. Bantu Trust on conditions determined by the board. Since we are dealing with a very responsible board, the Land Bank board, I do not think that it will be necessary, particularly since this board will be able to determine the conditions, to do anything that will be detrimental to the money which is available to the farmers. I want to make this very clear, because it is a matter which might perhaps be very sensitive, and we should not allow any misunderstanding to exist in regard to this matter. The interest may be determined by the Land Bank board, as well as the other conditions, conditions which have to differ for the S.A. Bantu Trust from those for an ordinary farmer. The board has plenary powers in this regard. They will therefore be able to take up money on the open market, and in various other ways, to finance the mortgage bonds which are being taken over for the Bantu Trust. In other words, this will in no way affect the amount of money which is available for our farmers. The hon. member for Yeoville asked why the S.A. Bantu Trust could not generate this money itself. The hon. member for Klip River said that there is R30 million available for this year. It is a fact that land is expensive, and also that as far as this matter is concerned we should like to progress as rapidly as we are able to. With this additional assistance from the Land Bank we can enable the S.A. Bantu Trust to purchase this land more rapidly.</p>

<p>At this stage I should very much like to make an appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister. Is it not possible to allocate the land which is going to be released to the South African Bantu Trust for resale as well? As a businessman I think the hon. member for Yeoville would agree with me. I am not proposing that the land be resold for a lesser amount. I should like the land to be resold at market value, so that we can obtain the maximum amount of money from it. This could even entail that one could pay redemption and interest from the income obtained from the sale of the land.</p>

<p>This brings me to another very important matter, a matter to which we ought perhaps to give a little thought. If one is going to buy land from farmers in large quantities, one is inevitably creating a major demand for land, unless one purchases the released land as quickly as possible. I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us a very clear reply this afternoon to this point, for I know the necessary co-ordination has in fact taken place. I should not like to see an artificial need for land being created, and this could happen if a large quantity of land were to be bought in from White farmers without other land being offered in return. This would mean that one would be creating an artificially high demand for land which would then further increase the price of agricultural land, and I do not think it is in the interests of agriculture in the long term for the price of land to be artificially increased, nor to the advantage of the South African Bantu Trust that wants to purchase land. I think it would be a very good thing if the hon. the Deputy Minister could reassure us on this point.</p>

<p>In addition I want to associate myself whole-heartedly with this legislation. I think it is good, well-considered legislation, and I am pleased that the necessary co-ordination is there. I am also pleased that the hon. the Deputy Minister was able to introduce this legislation himself this afternoon.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I should like to avail myself of this opportunity of thanking the Land Bank and the hon. the Minister of Finance for being prepared to accept this proposal so that this legislation could be introduced.</p>

<p>I want to point out that a Bantu Trust and Bantu Land Amendment Bill is going to follow this Bill. There are hon. members who raised certain matters here which ought really to be discussed under that Bill. However, I shall reply now to the questions relating to this piece of legislation. The other questions I shall reply to when we deal with that piece of legislation.</p>

<p>What is of fundamental importance here is the question which the hon. members asked as to how the Land Bank is going to be affected. I just want to mention the decisions which the Government took again. In the first place the Government decided that the South African Bantu Trust should be enabled to take over mortgage bonds from owners from whom it was going to purchase land. This does not only apply to the Land Bank. This also applies to all other financial institutions, and that is what the hon. member for Yeoville referred to. The hon. member for Yeoville asked why the Bantu Trust was not acquiring loan powers. <span class="col_7295-7296" refersTo="page_0978"/>The Bantu Trust will acquire loan powers in another piece of legislation. The Government also decided that the Bantu Trust need not pay only in cash; it could also purchase by means of deferred payments. I come to the hon. member for Heilbron when I mention the next decision of the Government. The Government also decided that the proceeds from the sale of the land which had to be included in the Bantu areas in terms of a decision taken last year by Parliament, and comprising approximately 2,3 million ha as well as the proceeds of the sale of the other land which has to be excised and which comprises just over one million ha should go to the Bantu Trust for the purpose of enabling it to purchase land. Thus there will be just over one million ha of land available for sale. That ought to eliminate the concern of the hon. member for Heilbron for he said that there should not only be a demand for land on the part of the Bantu Trust, but that there should also be a supply of land to the farmers. Furthermore, the Government decided that the land could be sold at the market price. This is a very important decision which ought to have a favourable effect on the purchasing programme.</p>

<p>I was asked what the conditions were. As will be observed in clause 2 of the Bill the Land Bank Board may determine the conditions. The Land Bank Board will determine the conditions with regard to the interest rate which has to be paid, and also with regard to the term over which repayment has to take place. On our part we will not be able to pay more than a statutory interest rate. It is entirely out of the question that we will be able to pay more. The result is that, in my opinion, a solution will have to and can be found between those two limits. The Land Bank has a few sources of income, of which the first is the people to whom money is lent by the Land Bank. The Land Bank receives repayments and interest from those people annually. Another source of income is the appropriations which are approved from time to time by Parliament and on which interest is payable at a subsidized interest rate. Those appropriations, and the flow-back of loan capital enable the Land Bank to borrow money on the open market at a higher interest rate than the one at which it lends money to farmers. Depending on the extent of the flow-back of capital, and the parliamentary appropriations, the Land Bank is able to determine in advance how much it is able to lend at a certain interest rate so that it is nevertheless able to lend money to farmers at its current interest rate of 7&#x0025; per annum.</p>

<p>Therefore it is by no means the idea that the Bantu Trust should influence the normal activities of the Land Bank. We made a calculation which was based on the findings of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture to the effect that the mortgage debts of the farmers on an average comprised 20&#x0025; of the valuation of their farms. In addition our calculation was also based on our own purchase of last year, which we analysed carefully. We found that the mortgages and the debt the farmers had, also amounted to 20&#x0025; of the valuations. According to our analyses of our own purchases last year, and in accordance with the findings of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture, we estimated that the Land Bank will not be involved in an amount of more than approximately R2 million as far as the Bantu Trust is concerned. We shall not take over so many mortgage bonds from farmers that more than R2 million per annum is involved for the Land Bank. Our point of departure is that we have to pay an interest rate to the Land Bank which enables it to borrow that additional amount which we take over from the farmers when it enters the money market. Therefore there will be no encroachment on the normal activities of the Land Bank. The Land Bank will be able to determine what its normal requirements are, and then it will be able to borrow an additional R2 million, or whatever it requires. That is what we are envisaging.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville said that we were in a dilemma, but that remark should rather be discussed when the Second Reading debate on the Bantu Trust and Bantu Land Amendment Bill takes place. Consequently I shall return to the remarks made by that hon. member on that occasion.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Griqualand East, however, made a statement which I feel cannot be left unanswered. He said that there had been large scale favouring of certain individuals. The hon. the Minister, as well as the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, have already replied adequately on various occasions last year to the hon. member&#x2019;s accusations, and I want to content myself with saying that the accusation is not true. Consequently I reject it. There was no preferential treatment. This <span class="col_7297-7298" refersTo="page_0979"/>matter is dealt with according to merit.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should react to one other point which the hon. member for Yeoville raised, viz. the position of the farmers in the Transkei. In the first place I want to say that there are perhaps one or two farmers in the Transkei who still have to be bought out. Within the jurisdiction of the Transkei, i.e. the area which will belong to the Transkei when it is declared independent, there is no appreciable number of farmers who still have to be bought out. The only land which still has to be purchased and in respect of which the Land Bank&#x2019;s takeover of loans may be involved, falls outside the borders of the Transkei.</p>

Within the existing Transkei almost all the farmers have been bought out since as long ago as 1936. Therefore, there are very few farmers who still have to be bought out.</p>

<p>There are not many of them and in any case the pieces of land involved are all small.

Those who are involved in the consolidation of the Transkei will initially not fall within the area of jurisdiction of the Transkei. I am referring now to the farmers who border on the Transkei, in the constituencies of the hon. member for Aliwal and of Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville asked whether this was a long-term policy. Our point of departure is that this measure will be implemented as long as we are engaged in purchases, in other words, until the programme has been finalized.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I merely want to deal with one aspect of this matter. It is quite clear that the bank is now given powers to raise money far beyond what is said will be advanced annually. Therefore it is important that one should have a degree of control in respect of this matter. The mere release of the Land Bank annual report does not constitute control. The tragedy is that this is to be a method of financing the Bantu Trust without the sanction of Parliament, because nothing needs to be done by this Parliament in respect of any advances by the Land Bank once this Bill has been passed. As we have indicated, we support the Bill, but we do it with grave misgivings and only because of an emergency situation which exists and in order to allow justice to be done to people. However, we lose control over the question of voting funds here in Parliament, because money can now be given to the Bantu Trust by the Land Bank without any control by Parliament. Therefore these are matters which will have to be carefully watched in the years that lie ahead.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as I am concerned, the hon. member is wresting things out of context a little. In the first place, the Land Bank is being restricted by this legislation and it cannot lend an unlimited amount of money to the S.A. Bantu Trust. It can only lend money to the Bantu Trust if it has a mortgage bond on land to be purchased by the Trust. This is stated in clause 2 of the Bill. From the condition which is laid down there, it is quite clear that the Land Bank can only transfer existing mortgage bonds to the Trust. The Land Bank is unable to operate outside those limits. This has been laid down as a condition in the Bill that the Land Bank is not allowed to exceed these limits, because the mortgage bonds which are now taken over by the Trust are mortgage bonds which are already in existence.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the hon. member to the fact that it is clear that what is at issue here, is not money the Land Bank has to find somewhere in order to lend it to the Trust It concerns money which the Land Bank has lent farmers in the past. All that is happening now, is that the farmer is not going to be the future debtor any longer, but the S.A. Bantu Trust. The Land Bank is not allowed to exceed those limits. If the hon. member really wants to do me a favour he should&#x2014;in the absence of the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;move an amendment in terms of which the Land Bank is allowed to go beyond its present limit and lend even more money to the Bantu Trust. I would have considered such an amendment favourably &#x2026; [Interjections.] Apparently the hon. member does not want to do something of this nature.</p>

<p>The Land Bank is being curtailed and may only transfer existing mortgage bonds to the Bantu Trust To my mind the whole system provides that the Land Bank is not allowed to go beyond the limits which have been laid down.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Trust may, in terms of section 10 of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, acquire land, and up to the present such land has been acquired for cash. Hon. members will recall that the hon. the Minister of Finance announced in his Budget Speech that it had been decided that the Trust may take over existing mortgage bonds on property purchased, and that the Trust may negotiate with the owners of property for payment to be made by instalments over a period of time.</p>

<p>A scheme is being devised in terms of which land may be purchased by deferred payment, and an attempt is being made, on the one hand, to make the scheme more attractive for the purchaser, and, on the other, acceptable to the mortgagee of the land concerned, in such a way that the Trust will still be able to carry out the obligations under the scheme.</p>

<p>One of the obstacles in the application of such a scheme is that the Trust has to be authorised to acquire land by methods other than by cash purchase, and to make the necessary arrangements in respect of such <span class="col_7301-7302" refersTo="page_0981"/>other methods of acquisition. In this way it is now being arranged, through clause 1 of this Bill, that the Trust may furnish a promissory note in respect of that portion of the purchase price which is not paid immediately. The Trust will also, in terms of the amendment, be able to take over the liabilities of owners, for example, liabilities under mortgage bonds, which virtually means that the Trust is raising a loan from the mortgagee to the amount of the mortgage bond so that the land may be transferred free of hypothecation to the Trust, and so that the Trust may furnish a promissory note in respect of the loan.</p>

<p>Some of the properties which will be purchased by the Trust have been mortgaged in favour of Government bodies, of which the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is an example. The funds which the latter department collects in respect of such mortgage bonds, accrue to the Exchequer, and if it has to be paid by the Trust, the money for such payment has to be obtained from the Exchequer and to avoid unnecessary cumbrousness, it is being arranged that the interests of the State in such land become the interests of the Trust upon purchase by the Trust.</p>

<p>Clause 2 contains the short title.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, like its predecessor, this Bill comes as a direct result of the embarrassing position in which the Government finds itself in attempting to carry out its impractical policies. The Government also finds itself in difficulty because of its failure to assess correctly the funds which would be available to it in carrying out this policy. They set out to buy large tracts of land for inclusion in the Bantustans. When the proposal was discussed in this House last year, we pointed out that the Government could not hope to carry out that policy within a reasonable time, not even in 25 years. Because we knew that there would be hardships caused to the farmers who would be affected by the proposals, and knowing that the Government would not have the wherewithal to buy the farms, we suggested that the Government should make available negotiable instruments to the sellers to enable the Government to buy on the instalment plan and to give instruments which are redeemable over a period of time. We also insisted that in those negotiable instruments provision should be made for depreciation of currency, because with the dismal record of this Government, we could expect devaluation at any time. Any instrument which was redeemable over a period of years should provide for that occurrence. Also we wanted to make quite certain that a satisfactory rate of interest would be applied to the instrument. The hon. the Deputy Minister has given us no information at all in his introductory speech as to what is actually envisaged by this Bill. We know that the trust will be authorized to buy and to pay by giving promissory notes, to incur a debt and to borrow money to pay such debts. When the hon. the Minister of Finance introduced his budget we were relieved to see that he had made provision, or had himself foreseen, that there would be difficulties and had appointed an interdepartmental committee to advise him on how to meet the situation. He said that he had accepted two recommendations. The one was to take over bonds, as is provided for in the Bill which we have just passed, viz. the Land Bank Bill, and also to buy on the instalment plan. We would like to know something about this instalment plan. What is envisaged? Over what period will the instalments be paid? Will it be over a long period, and will the interest payable on the promissory notes mentioned in this Bill be capitalized? Will the seller then receive a promissory note with the interest capitalized so that he can negotiate for the payment of the promissory note? We want much more detail than the hon. the Deputy Minister has given us. He has left us up in the air. We do not know what is envisaged.</p>

<p>In the previous Bill authorizing the Land Bank to take bonds from the trust there is a provision that the repayment of money advanced and the payment of interest thereon shall be deemed to be guaranteed by the Government. In dealing with the Land Bank it was found necessary to hold the Government responsible. The Government itself took on the responsibility to the Land Bank for the repayment of these loans. There is no similar provision in the Bill we are dealing with at the moment. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister why it was thought necessary to do it in the case of the Land Bank and why it is not necessary now to make the Government liable <span class="col_7303-7304" refersTo="page_0982"/>on behalf of the trust should the trust not be able to fulfil any of the obligations which it is now authorized to undertake.</p>

<p>When the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was discussed in this House I asked him if the instalment plan in respect of acquisition of property would apply to the Transkei. He replied in the negative. He said it would not apply.</p>

<p>I am referring to the debate on the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and not to the discussion of the last Bill. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s answer was that this would not apply to the Transkei. That is very serious position for the Transkei, because only R3&#x00BD;<i></i> million have been set aside for the acquisition of property.</p>

<p>In a letter which the hon. the Prime Minister wrote to the White Citizens&#x2019; Association of the Transkei, a copy of which I received from the hon. the Prime Minister yesterday, there is an indication that other methods will be considered of augmenting this R3&#x00BD; million which has been set aside for the Transkei. Now I wonder whether this scheme, provided for in the Bill, will apply to the Transkei as well. Will the trust be able to buy trading stations and properties in the towns of the Transkei and to issue the promissory notes which are provided for in the Bill? I ask this question especially because of the position of the Whites in the Transkei, especially the people down at Port St. Johns. Incidentally, I should like to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that there are many more farms in the Transkei than the two he spoke of. Which two farms was he speaking of? Down at Port St. Johns there are many more than two farms; there must be at least 20, even more. These farmers will also have to be bought out. If they are bonded to the Land Bank, they will be covered by the previous Bill. However, if they are not bonded to the Land Bank, I want the assurance that they will fall under the provisions of this Bill we are dealing with now and that the Transkei will be assisted.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us some details in his reply as to what is envisaged, how the scheme is to work, what the instalment plan is and, as I have said, in what way the persons who accept negotiable instruments from the trust will be protected by the Government. We will support the measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with this legislation a new financing method is being created, i.e. the creation of promissory notes. Naturally the matter has been discussed in full with the Treasury. However, there is one matter I want to raise, a matter which I think ought to receive attention, if this is not already being done. The farmers who are affected by this are not voluntary sellers in all cases. They are selling their farms in terms of the provisions of the consolidation plan for the Bantu homelands. I want to refer to the fact that estates may be affected by this in certain cases. In a case in which a farmer dies, his farm is assessed for estate purposes at the Land Bank valuation. Such Land Bank valuations are in many cases less than the normal market value. It is farmers who are frequently very hard hit by estate duty. If farmers hold Land Bank securities they may cause R70 000 of those securities to be exempted from estate duty. Cannot the Bantu Trust negotiate with the Treasury for R70 000 of these promissory notes to be exempted from estate duty as well? I am asking this precisely because the farms were not sold voluntarily and because the purchase price, or the agreed price, is closer to the market value than the normal Land Bank valuations. This could certainly affect the farmers&#x2019; estate duty, and could cause them to have to pay considerably more than they would have done under normal circumstances. Since these are promissory notes or Government securities or instruments of debt which are being lent by the farmer to the State, I want to know whether similar conditions cannot be applied, for example, a normal loan regardless of whether it is Government securities or Land Bank securities, and that R70 000 exempted from estate duty. It will also entail that older farmers who no longer want to farm will not insist on rapid repayment of the promissory <span class="col_7305-7306" refersTo="page_0983"/>notes. They will rather be prepared to give the Bantu Trust a longer term loan if there are other conditions attached to it. I am addressing this request to the hon. the Deputy Minister for something which, in the nature of things, can only receive attention in the Budget next year. The actual practical implementation of this measure will only take place next year. This is one of the aspects in regard to which there could be further negotiations.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we shall support the Second Reading of this piece of legislation, but here too we do so with some degree of misgiving. There are a number of questions that I should immediately like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, and I hope he will be able to deal with them. In the first place, I want to know why the Bill is limited to promissory notes. Why has the medium of a promissory note been chosen? I have some grave difficulty with that, because a promissory note is&#x2014;as the hon. the Deputy Minister will know&#x2014;only one example of negotiable instruments and now, for some reason, we are limiting ourselves to this. Secondly, I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;I have raised this matter in the debate about the Land Bank Amendment Bill, but the hon. the Minister did not reply then&#x2014;why we have not created a Government security which could rank as a prescribed asset for financial institutions. If one does that, one will enable the farmer to have an instrument which he can far more readily sell at a reasonable market price. In any case, if it were in the form of a Government security which could be dealt with on the market, which could be dealt with in the ordinary course, then it would be easier for the farmer to obtain his cash, to take very much longer terms which would be less of an embarrassment to the Government and yet he can negotiate it and can get his money as and when he wants it. You have a situation here that when you issue promissory notes, you presumably issue those promissory notes for what are relatively short periods of time. You are not going to have the sort of period of time that you would have in the case of Government stock. I really cannot understand why we are limiting ourselves to this. The difficulty is that this is like the short-term loans of last year. I cannot understand why one gets oneself into a short-term situation like this. One only uses promissory notes in the ordinary course of events for short-term situations. I think this does need explanation, because it does seem to be a very strange way in which to deal with this position.</p>

<p>I asked earlier why the Bantu Trust does not in fact issue loan stock and have it dealt with in the same way as in the case of the urban Bantu authorities. Why do we not change the law and let them do it in this form? If that is not acceptable, why does the Government then not make stock available to the Bantu Trust so that the Bantu Trust can issue Government stock in the ordinary course? While the whole concept of bringing promissory notes into this type of transaction solves a problem in so far as the farmer is concerned, it certainly also creates a problem in so far as the authorities are concerned.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether it is intended that this concept which is contained in this amending legislation should be used and made available for all actions by the Bantu Trust In other words, will this be applicable only in the case of the Transkei and the areas adjacent to it, or will this same principle be applied when we deal with any other homeland, whether it is close to independence or not? Is it going to apply to all purchases? If it is, the unfortunate situation that arises is that the Bantu Trust will not be able ro resist demands to have matters finalized, because every person who wants to have his farm bought out will say: &#x201C;You can give me a promissory note. &#x201D; It is then not an answer to say that there is no money in the estimates this year. There will therefore be increasing pressure put on the Government to buy farms out and to issue promissory notes, and what worries me is that a very substantial market is going to be created in promissory notes, because they are obviously going to be negotiable. I think that the government, in doing this, is creating a problem for itself. The logical way to deal with this is in fact through the medium of Government stock, which should be made available to the farmer. This is the very point to which the hon. member for Klip River referred, and I think it is a legitimate point. This would then be covered because the estate duty exemption would then apply in these circumstances in the case of Government stock. The hon. the Deputy Minister is obviously in some difficulty here because the hon. the Minister of Finance is not <span class="col_7307-7308" refersTo="page_0984"/>here, and these are really matters which have serious financial implications. I would therefore ask him, if he is not able to deal with these points, at least to give attention to them before this legislation goes to the Other Place so that he can discuss them with the Minister of Finance. If necessary, something more satisfactory can then be brought back to us.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must say that in spite of the fact that the support of the hon. member for Yeoville for this legislation was reluctant, he did, nevertheless, express a few good ideas. In the first place, the hon. member asked why the legislation only made provision for promissory notes. The reason for that is that the Act need not be amended in the case of Government securities. That is why this amending legislation only deals with the question of promissory notes. I also want to refer to something to which I perhaps did not refer earlier. Apart from the decisions the Government has taken to expedite the purchasing programme, it has also decided to establish a permanent interdepartmental committee to investigate measures such as these from time to time. Instructions have also been given to this committee to investigate the question of Government securities. The committee arrived at the conclusion that in the case of promissory notes an amendment of the Bantu Trust and Land Act was necessary, while in the case of Government securities no additional amendment was required. I can only say that the matter of Government securities is in fact being investigated.</p>

<p>Secondly, the hon. member asked why the Government did not create an instrument in regard to financial institutions, an instrument which could then be considered to be the compulsory investment which they have to make in the form of Government securities. This is one of the aspects which we have referred to the interdepartmental committee for investigation, for in our negotiations with several financial institutions on what their reaction would be if and whether we would be able to take over the mortgage bonds which they have over the farms of farmers, at the statutory rate of interest, those bodies indicated that if this promissory note could be considered to be a compulsory investment, they foresaw no problems. This is a matter which has been brought to the attention of this interdepartmental committee and which they are already investigating. I have already said that the question of Government securities is being investigated, and that Government securities are negotiable. This is the major advantage here, i.e. that if the farmer receives Government securities, he may negotiate them while the debentures will not be negotiable. But it will in fact be a form of security. A person will be able to use it to cede to a person from whom he purchases land. However, he will not be able to negotiate it.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether this would apply to all transactions of the S.A. Bantu Trust, and not only in the Transkei. As I have said in the case of the Land Bank, the idea is to implement these measures whenever and wherever they are necessary, until such time as the purchasing programme has been finalized, outside the Transkei as well. The hon. member said that it would cause tremendous pressure. The fact of the matter is that one cannot distribute debentures or Government securities, or whatever they may be, to an unlimited extent, for it places an obligation on the Exchequer at some time in the future, and for that reason a limitation has to be placed on the quantity of land which may be purchased by way of debentures or by way of any other instrument which is created in respect of the liability which it places upon the Exchequer in future. Therefore the Treasury and the Minister of Finance will have to give us an indication every year of how much land may be bought on credit in a specific year so that we do not in future commit the Treasury to such an extent that it is saddled with a liability which it cannot meet.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is in the final stage of investigation. We shall soon know.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Klip River. I think that what he suggested was a good idea. However, it is not for me to decide about it. As the hon. member said, it will first require an appropriation. But I undertake to bring that idea to the attention of the interdepartmental committee which is instituting an investigation into this matter, with the request that they investigate the possibility of exempting 70&#x0025; of these debentures, or up to an amount of R70 000, from estate duty. This <span class="col_7309-7310" refersTo="page_0985"/>would be an encouraging factor. I shall bring it to their attention.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Griqualand East is concerned, I want to begin with what he said, i.e. that we are in trouble, and that they said that we would not complete this programme in 25 years&#x2019; time, and that the fact that we are now coming forward with measures of this nature proves how correct they were. Sir, the hon. member initially said &#x201C;not within the foreseeable future&#x201D;. Then I wondered what &#x201C;within the foreseeable future&#x201D; meant, how many years it would be. When the hon. member came to this Bill, he said 25 years. If the impression has been created among the public, among those people who are involved, that this land will all have been purchased within a year or two, it was not this Government that created that impression. I would rather say that it was some members of the opposite side who did not understand these things correctly and then created that kind of impression among those people. The point of departure of the Government has, from the beginning, been that this programme should be disposed of within a period of not longer than 10 years.</p>

<p>The measures we are now adopting enable us, in view of the fact that the appropriation from the Exchequor for this year is less than we foresaw it would be last year, to purchase a larger amount of land by means of these additional measures than the appropriation provided. The hon. member asked me how long the terms were going to be, what the interest rates would be, and so on. All I can tell him is that the interest rates will be statutory interest rates. However, I cannot at this stage furnish him with a reply in regard to the terms, because the investigation by this inter-departmental committee to which I referred is in its final phases and because there are also future financial obligations attached to this. In addition the matter still has to be approved by the Treasury. Therefore I cannot give him an indication of what the terms will be.</p>

<p>If he were to read my Second Reading Speech again, he would see that I said that the terms should be such that they are acceptable to the seller. It is of no avail our going to the seller with an offer which is not acceptable to him. It has to be a fair offer which will be acceptable to him. In other words, a cash amount has to be paid. We can take over the person&#x2019;s mortgage bonds, and for the rest furnish him with debentures. If it is recommended that Government securities may be used, we may make use of them as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that the hon. the Minister stated during the Budget debate that this would not be applicable to the Transkei. The hon. member did in fact state at that stage that it would not be applicable to the Transkei. At that stage it was in reality not applicable yet to any area, because we had not yet implemented the system. I do not know whether the hon. member has convinced the hon. the Minister in the meantime, but the hon. the Minister decided that we could implement the system in the Transkei as well, where the adjustment committee is making purchases in the towns, because it can only have a favourable effect in the sense that the purchases will be expedited. Consequently it is being considered.</p>

<p>However, I repeat that an investigation has to be instituted. The procedure here differs from the procedure in the case of farms. In respect of farms one is dealing with relatively large amounts, but when it comes to a person who sells a house which is worth approximately R20 000, we have to establish whether the property may be purchased by means of deferred payments. It has to be decided whether a minimum amount should not be laid down. In other words, we are purchasing by means of deferred payment, on the understanding that the minimum amount which the seller receives is not less than R20 000, so that he may in turn establish himself elsewhere. If an amount of only R6 000 or R8 000 in cash is paid out to him, he might not be able to find his feet again. We are therefore considering laying down a minimum cash amount.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of the farms in the Transkei. The hon. member said there were many. However, Port St. Johns only covers an area of nine square miles. Those properties consist of smallholdings, not farms.</p>

<p>Surely every farmer who farms on a smallholding knows that he cannot obtain a loan from the Land Bank. [Interjections.] However, if the person has obtained a loan from a building society or a commercial bank we will also have to take it over, not so? There is no discrimination. The hon. member raised the matter when we were discussing the Land Bank legislation, and I stated there that there would be very few people in the Transkei with land in respect of which the Land Bank had granted loans. The people who live in the towns, the people who are not farmers, will not fall under the Land Bank. Smallholdings will not fall under the Land Bank either. Perhaps the few farmers who are still established in the Transkei might still have land which will be encumbered by the Land Bank. We shall take this over. We shall also take over the mortgage bonds or covering bonds of other bodies.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am being unfair now when I say that the hon. member is being unfair. The mortgage bond which the owner has at present will be cancelled. The Land Bank will not again register a mortgage bond on the land purchased by the Bantu Trust. We can furnish the Land Bank with a debenture, and then we do not require any further guarantees. However, the Land Bank informed us that it would cause a tremendous amount of administrative work and consequently it would prefer us to give it only one total guarantee. If we take over mortgage bonds to the amount of R2 million, we need not furnish a debenture in respect of each farmer from whom we have taken over land, we need only furnish a guarantee that the R2 million which has been taken over is guaranteed by the Government. Therefore no other guarantee is necessary. In the case of the farmer we furnish him with a debenture, and that is a guarantee from the Government. We shall not furnish the Land Bank with a debenture every time, it will only receive a guarantee for the total amount. In the case of the individual farmer, however, it is true that he will receive a debenture which is then the guarantee.</p>

<p>Well, that is what is worrying me. I think this is something about which the farmers are a little bit misled. If the promissory note referred to in the Bill is not negotiable, it is not a promissory note and then I think this piece of legislation is hoodwinking the farmers. One cannot say to a farmer that one is giving him a promissory note, because when he wants to buy another farm he can do nothing with that piece of paper as it is not negotiable. That is not a promissory note in terms of the bills of exchange legislation. If the hon. the Deputy Minister has in mind to hand to the farmer such a promissory note, then what he is really doing is to give a non-negotiable acknowledgment of debt to the farmer. I do not know whether the hon. member for Griqualand East understood it to be a non-negotiable instrument of debt, but I certainly did not. We have all learnt that a promissory note is a negotiable instrument.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think it is necessary to accept the amendment of the hon. member for the simple reason that, as I explained to him a little while ago, a negotiable instrument such as a Government security may be used, and that it is not necessary to amend the Bantu Trust and Land Act for that purpose. There are other methods by means of which this may be implemented. What is more, negotiable instruments such as Government securities are at present being investigated.</p>

<p>As far as the negotiability of debentures is concerned, I want to say that these are not, as in the case of Government securities, something which may, for example, be sold on the stock exchange. However, they serve as security. If the hon. member, after he has sold his farm and received a debenture, wants to buy my farm, he may make over the debenture to me and pay the outstanding cash amount. In other words, the debenture has the same effect.</p>

<p>That is the point. Both can be ceded, but only one is negotiable. The hon. member knows that. That is the essential difference. If, when this piece of legislation is eventually passed, the Afrikaans text is signed, it will mean that the instrument concerned is not a negotiable instrument, while if the English text is signed, it will be doubtful as to what is meant.</p>

<p>This is the whole point and I believe that the hon. member for Griqualand East is quite right: We have before us a slapdash piece of legislation which is not even drafted the same way in English and in Afrikaans and we are being asked to allow the farmers to be given a piece of paper which is going to turn out not to be a negotiable instrument &#x2026; [Interjections.] We have had no answer on this. If the hon. the Deputy Minister means that he wants to give the farmers promissory notes which can be negotiated &#x2026; and the term &#x201C;negotiated&#x201D; does not mean &#x201C;dealt with on the Stock Exchange&#x201D;, because that is a different thing altogether. It means that one can to go to any bank, any institution, to any other person, and negotiate it&#x2014;not cede it, but negotiate it&#x2014;so that he accepts it without any equities attaching to it. That is what is wanted. If that is so, there is can be no objection to the acceptance of the amendment. I do not believe that this piece of legislation can be passed with two different meanings attaching to the same word.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to inconvenience the Committee and I do not want to fall with the old adage of &#x201C;fools rush in where angels fear to tread&#x201D;. However, I would like to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister should be aware of the fact that there are very important technical differences between the two versions of the clause in the two official languages, as has been pointed out by various hon. members who have spoken on it. The hon. the Deputy Minister must also remember that this is one of the most technical aspects of our legal system, the question of negotiable instruments. One cannot lightly accept a mere viewpoint expressed by the hon. the Deputy Minister saying he is not sure whether the instrument is going to be a negotiable instrument or not. I believe the farmers are entitled to some sort of protection here, because in the previous Bill the Land Bank was given a guarantee. I fail to see why the Land Bank, because of its own technicalities, should be entitled to a guarantee whereas the farmer who is to be enabled by this bit of legislation to purchase another farm or to pursue some other occupation&#x2014;so that he does not need to wait five or ten or fifteen years before being able to make use of the moneys which are payable in terms of the expropriation&#x2014;should not at least have the opportunity of having the guarantee of some form of negotiable instrument. As has been correctly pointed out, there is a very big difference between an acknowledgment of debt and a negotiable instrument as represented by a promissory note.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister may not perhaps be aware of the important difference that is technically involved here. Under these circumstances I think that I could give him a precedent of a very much more eminent member of this House in the past who did move that progress be reported and that leave be requested to sit again on a very similar issue. The matter came to the House the next day and was cleared up. I think that the hon. the Deputy Minister should take into account the technical significance which is involved here and do something about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the Opposition is confusing &#x201C;negotiable&#x201D; and &#x201C;exchangeable&#x201D;. They are dragging a red herring across the floor of this House. The principle has already been laid down. We do not have the money at the moment, and now one is able to take this certificate and sell it. It is negotiable. You can sell it to a person and get your money in time. The difference between exchangeability and negotiability is what is important now. It is transferable.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I first want to tell the hon. member for Jeppe that, in regard the question which he mentioned, i.e. why the Land Bank is being guaranteed and not the farmer, he should consider clause 2. He will then see that no mention is made of a promissory note. It is simply stated that this amount is considered to have been guaranteed by the Government. In other words, no promissory note or anything is handed over to the Land Bank. It is considered to be guaranteed by the Government. The Land Bank Act requires a guarantee or security. In the case of the farmer, we are giving him a promissory note from the Government. What better guarantee does he want? If the Government gives a person a promissory note which states that the Government owes him X amount, surely it is a guarantee that the Government will pay the money. What more does he want than that? We are not going to give the Land Bank a document, a promissory note, as in the case of the farmer; we are only going to guarantee the total amount.</p>

<p>When we come to the question of terminology, <span class="col_7319-7320" refersTo="page_0990"/>I want to tell hon. members that I do not accept their amendment here. For our purposes the wording as it reads at present is the correct wording. But I undertake, nevertheless, to refer it to the law advisers again, although I have no doubt that it is in fact correct. The difference is that the hon. members want an instrument which is negotiable, in the sense that a person may go to a share broker, or may come back to us. This will not be the case. As the Bill reads there is nothing to prevent a person, if he wants to go to a commercial bank, or to the hon. member, from doing business with the document he has in his hand. With that I content myself. It is not necessary to delay the Committee any further in this regard.</p>

<heading>SOUTH AFRICAN TEACHERS&#x2019; COUNCIL FOR WHITES BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In the late forties the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations in South Africa, with which eight teachers&#x2019; associations were affiliated at that stage, decided to endeavour, by way of legislation, to have a registration council for teachers established.</p>

<p>However, the attempt on the part of the Federal Council miscarried, and it was only in 1963 that the council placed the matter on its agenda again. During that year the then National Advisory Education Council also communicated with the Federal Council in regard to this matter, and at the end of 1964 the Federal Council submitted a draft Bill to the said Education Council, after which <span class="col_7321-7322" refersTo="page_0991"/>interested bodies were consulted. After much deliberation and consideration of the comment passed on the idea of a teachers&#x2019; council, however, the then National Advisory Education Council decided in 1967 to suspend the consideration of the establishment of a teachers&#x2019; or registration council for the time being.</p>

<p>In 1969, during the Second Reading debate on the National Education Policy Amendment Bill, a former Minister expressed himself strongly in favour of a registration council for teachers, and stated that the first instruction to the new National Education Council would be to investigate the possibility of a registration council for teachers. Consequently the National Education Council set about this task early in 1970, and by the end of 1972, after consultation with the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, and the Committee of Heads of Education, a draft Bill was submitted to my predecessor. After that the necessary consultation with the Administrators took place. In the nature of things further consultation with the organized teaching profession had to take place with reference to the comment of the provinces, and it is a pleasure for me to be able to say that there was at all times the closest and most cordial co-operation between myself as the Minister, the department, the provincial education departments concerned and the organized teaching profession on the finalizing of the Bill after so many years. If the principle contained in the Bill is amended at this stage, it may perhaps not enjoy the full support of the teaching profession and/or the provincial education departments, and I am at this early stage, during the Second Reading, asking the hon. members for an understanding of this standpoint.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the establishment of the South African Teachers&#x2019; Council for Whites will be the realization of an ideal of the White teachers in the Republic to have a statutory body of their own in order to uphold and to promote esteem for education and the teaching profession and the prestige of those who are engaged in the teaching profession. With this principle in mind it is being provided in clause 4(1)(b) of the Bill that each Administrator shall appoint one teacher only as member of the council, while the Minister himself shall appoint one additional person to the council. The majority of the members of the council will therefore be elected by the twelve associations mentioned in the First Schedule to the Bill, on the numerical basis as set out in the Second schedule. According to the present numbers there will be 21 elected members on the council.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, it will be a function of the Teachers&#x2019; Council to register all teachers at present employed in a full-time permanent capacity at a school, as defined in the Bill, as well as to register all teachers who in future will be employed in such capacity. At this stage I must point out that the definition of a school does not include private schools which are not subsidized by my department or a provincial administration whereas educational institutions for non-Whites where full-time education, including pre-primary education, is given by Whites up to a standard not higher than Std. 10, are included in the definition. However, these matters will be dealt with in more detail later on.</p>

<p>Persons who do not possess the necessary professional teachers&#x2019; qualifications but who are appointed by a head of education in a full-time permanent capacity in a post approved by the Committee of Heads of Education, will be registered provisionally by the council. Provision is made in clause 20(1) that from a date determined by the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> no person, who is not registered or provisionally registered, may be appointed in a full-time permanent capacity at a school to teach or teach at school in such capacity. A contravention of this stipulation will be punishable and on conviction a person will be liable to a fine not exceeding R100 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months or to both such a fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>A further task of the Teachers&#x2019; Council will be to compile a professional code of conduct with the concurrence of the Committee of Heads of Education. It is expected that this code will mainly deal with ethical standards whereas discipline in administrative matters will remain a function of the educational authorities. An investigation into the functions of a similar body in Scotland revealed that such demarcation is possible and that it works well. The Teachers&#x2019; Council will have to watch over the interests of the teaching profession as far as this code of conduct is concerned and will be empowered to inquire or cause an inquiry to be instituted into a <span class="col_7323-7324" refersTo="page_0992"/>complaint, charge or allegation of a contravention of the professional code of conduct against a registered or provisionally registered person. If such a person is found guilty by the council it will have the power to impose any of the following penalties:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) a reprimand or caution or a reprimand and a caution;</li>

<li>(ii) a fine not exceeding R50; and</li>

<li>(iii) the striking off the register of the name of the guilty person&#x2014;should this person be employed at a school the striking off the register of his name will be done in consultation with the head of education concerned.</li>

</ol>

<p>The council will also be empowered to refuse to register or provisionally register any person if, in the opinion of the council, such person is, on the ground of the circumstances connected with his conviction of any offence or of any contravention of the professional code of conduct, unfit to teach. Another very important function of the council will be to advise the Committee of Heads of Education in connection with the requirements for the training of persons to teach at a school and the requirements for admission to a course for such training. It is of course the right of any person to appeal to a court of law should he feel aggrieved by an action of the council. Provision is therefore made in clause 24 that any person who feels aggrieved by the council&#x2019;s refusal to register him, or to enter in respect of him a professional teachers&#x2019; qualification in the register, or the striking off the register of his name or of any professional teacher&#x2019;s qualification entered in respect of him in the register, may appeal to the provincial division of the Supreme Court of South Africa having jurisdiction in the area in which the appellant usually resides. In such a case the court may, if in its opinion the council did not act in accordance with the provisions of the Act, order that the appellant&#x2019;s name or qualification be entered in the register, or the court may remit the matter to the council for further consideration and make such order as to costs as it may deem just.</p>

<p>*I must point out that the Bill, in accordance with the definition therein of &#x201C;school&#x201D;, does not provide that teachers employed at private schools which are not subsidized by my department or a provincial administration, are required to register with the Teachers&#x2019; Council. The teachers&#x2019; associations which exist at these private schools will not have representation on the Council either. The reason for this is that in certain cases non-subsidized private schools, which do not fall under the provisions of the National Education Policy Act, No. 39 of 1967, make use of the services of persons who are not in possession of professional teachers&#x2019; qualifications as defined in the Bill. In addition they recruit teachers abroad whose qualifications do not comply with the criteria approved by the Committee of Heads of Education. If teachers employed by non-subsidized private schools were therefore to be required to register with the Teachers&#x2019; Council, these schools would no longer be able to employ teachers with qualifications not approved by the aforesaid committee in a full-time permanent capacity. Those who do, however, possess the necessary qualifications, may register with the council on a voluntary basis and even become members of the associations mentioned in the First Schedule, in which case they will be able to participate in elections and in that way also obtain a say in the constitution of the council. I hope that this position is clearly understood. We have gone out of our way to quite a considerable extent to accommodate the private schools in this way. I can mention that an association of principals of private schools encourages their teachers to join the associations mentioned in the First Schedule.</p>

<p>The Bill does provide that White teachers who are employed in a full-time permanent capacity by the Department of Bantu Education, the Department of Indian Affairs, the Department of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations and the Administration of Coloured Affairs, shall register with the Council. These teachers, with the exception of those in the employ of the Department of Indian Affairs, will also be represented on the Teachers&#x2019; Council on an association basis. However, there is no separate association for White teachers who are employed by the Department of Indian Affairs. In any event, their numbers are so small that they will not be able to have representation on the Council in accordance with the numerical basis, as <span class="col_7325-7326" refersTo="page_0993"/>mentioned in the Second Schedule. Since this council will be for White teachers only, it is being provided in clause 18(g) that it will be able to co-operate with any other councils or institutions whose objects or purposes are similar to those of the council, that is, also with such bodies which may perhaps, at some time or other, be established for the non-White peoples. To eliminate any possible misunderstanding, I just want to say that this is a teachers&#x2019; council for Whites. Provision is, however, being made in this Bill in clause 18(g) for the fact that similar teachers&#x2019; councils for the other population groups may be established, and that this council may be able to co-operate with the other councils in an overall capacity.</p>

<p>As far as the financial implications of the Bill are concerned, it is the object that the council shall be financially self-supporting so that it will be able to carry out its functions without outside interference. Although it is being provided in clause 12(1)(c) that Parliament may appropriate moneys for achieving the objects of the Council, the indications are that the council will receive sufficient revenue out of its own resources to be able to function without such assistance. The main source of revenue will be the annual fees which registered or provisionally registered persons have to pay and which will be prescribed by regulation. However, the State will make a contribution by making available an amount of money to the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations in the Republic of South Africa and the Territory of South West Africa to finance the first election. In order to ensure the independence of the council, the council shall appoint a person of its choice as registrar as well as the other employees who are deemed necessary, in accordance with the conditions, scale of remuneration and other benefits of service which it approves.</p>

<p>When the first Teachers&#x2019; Council has been constituted, a considerable period of time will elapse before it receives funds from its own resources. In order to have funds available for the repayment of capital and current expenditure, the council, in terms of clause 12(1)(d) will be able to raise loans with the approval of the Minister, the repayment of which may be guaranteed by the Minister, after consultation with the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware there is a teachers&#x2019; council in Scotland. In general it may be accepted that this is pioneering legislation and the years will have to prove, as the council finds its own way, what adjustments will have to be made to the Act.</p>

<p>I wish to express the hope that this Bill will come up to expectations, viz. to help the teaching profession in the RSA to assume its rightful place in our national economy, and to confer the necessary status upon teachers and the teaching profession in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let me say at the outset that although we in the UP cannot give the hon. the Minister an &#x201C;A&#x201D; symbol for his Bill, we shall nevertheless be supporting the Second Reading. Without disclosing the exact mark the hon. the Minister obtained, I can reveal that he has at least obtained a pass mark. In school language this could mean anything from 33&#x2153;&#x0025; upwards. I shall, however, return to this matter later in my speech.</p>

<p>I made the above statement because this Bill falls short, in many respects, of the high expectations a large number of people had for it. This legislation confers statutory professional status on teachers, and I refer to &#x201C;statutory professional status&#x201D; because, as far as I am concerned, teachers have always had professional status as such. That status, however, was never given statutory status. Through the establishment of a teachers&#x2019; council, this legislation confers such status, and this is something that has, of course, been awaited for a very long time. I think the hon. the Minister also referred to the fact that teachers have been negotiating for this for decades. In Parliament we in the UP have made pleas for its introduction year after year. In all fairness to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessors, I must acknowledge the fact that our pleas were never dismissed outright. They were met by counter-pleas that we should be patient and also by promises. That we have finally reached the stage where the establishment of a teachers&#x2019; council is to become a reality, is naturally something which I personally welcome. I regard it as a step forward, a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>In discussing the Bill it is worthwhile for one to bear several factors in mind. Whether this Bill is adequate or not, the fact remains that it is the culmination of the efforts, over many years, of a large group of people ranging from teachers to politicians. The contents of <span class="col_7327-7328" refersTo="page_0994"/>this Bill have been the topic of discussion, heated argument and high-level negotiation even among teachers themselves, in their staffrooms, and in their conference halls, and, as the hon. the Minister has mentioned, between the organized teaching profession and the authorities; in other words, the various Ministers and the various provincial administrations who are the employers of the teachers.</p>

<p>The Bill has had many unsuccessful predecessors in the form of draft Bills. Those draft Bills were submitted by one federal council after another and the draft Bills went backwards and forwards from the Minister to the various Administrators, only to be referred back to federal council for adjustment. This resulted in the teachers having the idea that absolutely no progress was being made. I have in front of me two documents which have faded considerably. They are the 1964 draft Bill and a draft Bill which was submitted later during the 1960s by an individual teachers&#x2019; association. Both draft Bills bear the heading&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bill to provide for the registration of teachers and other incidental matters, to be introduced by the Minister of Education, Arts and Science.</block>

<p>I merely refer to these two draft Bills in order to indicate that it has taken us a long time to reach this stage. In spite of numerous setbacks the teaching profession persevered in its efforts.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate the good features of this Bill and to understand its shortcomings, it is important that we should know why the teaching profession fought so hard for the introduction of such a Bill. The teachers know that, despite the fact that through their training they are, in their field of study, professionally as competent as, say, the engineer, the lawyer or the doctor is in his field, they as professional men and women are being jeopardized not only by many outsiders, but&#x2014;and this is the worst&#x2014;also by many members of their own profession. The teacher also realizes that unlike the members of other professions, he is seen to be, and in fact is, a member of a profession where apart from General Conditions of Service laid down by his employers, there is no specific code of conduct by which he has to abide. This factor is only one of the reasons why the introduction of this Bill was deemed necessary. Another factor is that the teacher as a member of his profession has, unlike the members of other professions, no say as regards the requirements to be met by people who want to become members of his profession. What is even worse is the fact that the teacher is completely deprived of the opportunity or the privilege, I may say, of being subjected to professional discipline by his own colleagues or of exercising discipline over them. Under these circumstances the teachers realized that it was no wonder that the notion prevailed amongst members of the public and, unfortunately, amongst their own ranks, that every Tom, Dick and Harry could become a teacher and, what is more, could do as he liked. Such a state of affairs naturally has a detrimental effect on the recruitment of men and women of outstanding ability to the teaching profession. Apart from these rather general disadvantages, teachers also realize that there are rather peculiar disadvantages which they as professional men and women suffer but which other professions are spared. Let me give two rather crude but very true examples. While no member of the public can ever claim to have an intimate knowledge of the professional aspect of the work of a doctor, an engineer or an architect, every member of the public, including the proverbial Koos van der Merwe who spent his five best years at school in Std. 2, does claim that he knows what the job of a teacher is by virtue of the fact that he has attended school for some years. Thus every member of the public knows something about teaching. Secondly, another peculiar disadvantage teachers as professional people suffer from is that in many cases the teacher does not receive credit for his professional efficiency. There are psychological reasons why, when Johnny fails, the parent blames the teacher, whereas when he does well, the whole neighbourhood is told: &#x201C;Maggies, maar my Jannie is darem slim!&#x201D; Let me say at once that whether there is a Teachers&#x2019; Council or not, and irrespective of whether it is a good or a bad council, teachers will always be subjected to this type of criticism. However, I still believe that the establishment of the Teachers&#x2019; Council will undoubtedly enhance the status of the teacher. The State and the teacher will make a grave mistake if they think that the mere establishment of the council will be the magic wand which will rectify the numerous problems which are <span class="col_7329-7330" refersTo="page_0995"/>affecting the teaching profession in general and the status of the teacher as a professional man in particular. The establishment of this council should be seen and accepted as the commencement of an everlasting contract between the State and the teacher. Grave responsibilities will rest on both of them. Both will have to fulfil their part of the contract.</p>

<p>Let us look at the teacher. Whether as an individual, or whether as a group of individuals as represented through their council, the teacher must realize that the esteem society has for him as a professional man will largely depend on his own actions in and out of school. Public respect can never be conferred upon a person&#x2014;it has to be earned. If one leaves out of consideration the cynics and those unfortunate members of the public who, because of certain psychological reasons, have inferiority complexes about teachers and to whom teachers will always form part of some sort of untouchable caste, one can justifiably say that teachers have already earned a great deal of respect and do enjoy fairly high public esteem. The creation of this council must therefore be accepted by the teachers as yet another challenge. If the council functions successfully, as a result of the teachers fulfilling their part of the contract, the reward will be that teachers will earn even greater public respect and enjoy even higher esteem.</p>

<p>Let us look now at the State. The State must realize that, unless it is prepared to fulfil its part of the contract, the whole object of the council will be defeated. Allow me to indicate certain aspects where failure on behalf of the State would be disastrous to the urge and desire of teachers to act as professional men and women at all times. Firstly, their working conditions and conditions of service should be of such a nature that neither the teacher&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;nor the public can have any doubt about the fact that the teacher is performing a job as a professional man. That is the first point. Secondly, the State must at all times ensure that the salary scales and post structures are realistic. Professional people, especially in a South African context, should never suffer the humiliation of having to agitate in public in order to improve their financial position. In South Africa such action is regarded as completely unprofessional. Thirdly, an answer must be found for the inadequacy of the present pension situation, because the retired teacher, the retired head master and the retired inspector, in having to struggle to maintain the standard of living expected from him, and commensurate with his status, is doing the profession more harm than good. Fourthly, once the council comes into operation, the authorities must be seen to act on and fulfil the recommendations of the council regarding matters concerning the objects of the council. If that does not happen, the council will be considered by both the teachers and the public to be a meaningless body, and such a breach of contract will do the profession untold harm.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, let us know take a closer look at the Bill. In the first place I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the Bill before us is anything but ideal. However, I am fully aware of the problems with which the hon. the Minister and his predecessors have been faced. In the nature of the matter the Bill is a compromise between the claims of the teachers and what the various education departments, as employers, have been prepared to concede. We all realize that, unlike the case of doctors, engineers, pharmacists and so on, all teachers affected by this legislation are employed by the State or the provincial administrations. We can discuss the issue of private schools later. However, the various education departments have a responsibility towards the people in their provinces and it is their duty to ensure that there are adequately qualified teachers to meet the needs of the provinces. This is their task and their duty.</p>

<p>If this is not the case, then&#x2014;as occurs on a large scale today&#x2014;the second or the third best thing has to be done. It is therefore inevitable that in our present set-up teachers who are professionally unqualified should be employed. It is a pity that this should be the case, but it is a fact we have to take account of. It is simply a question of: Is there going to be someone to take a class or not? Consequently I was not at all surprised to note that clause 16 allows such people to be registered provisionally. I accept that. Even the teachers believed at one stage that only qualified people could claim registration. However, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that during the Committee Stage we shall propose certain amendments. We shall propose things which will not hamper the task of the heads of education, but which will nevertheless serve as a means whereby the teachers&#x2019; council will be consulted <span class="col_7331-7332" refersTo="page_0996"/>with regard to this important matter.</p>

<p>Clause 18, which concerns the powers of the council, is an entirely different matter. As far as the disciplinary powers of the council are concerned, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that we are satisfied. The council will definitely have disciplinary powers, powers which one expects of a professional council. However, when we come to clause 18(d), the clause relating to the powers of the council with regard to the requirements for the training of people to equip them for teaching at a school, I must tell the hon. the Minister frankly that their power is very limited. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister understands that all they can do is furnish the Committee of Heads of Education with advice. In this case, the power is definitely inadequate. One simply cannot have a council comprising a group of professional people for the objects stated here. Let us consider the object of the council as it is stated in clause 3. The clause in question reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object of the council shall be to uphold and promote esteem for education and the teaching profession and the prestige of those who are engaged in the teaching profession.</block>

<p>It is simply impossible to have a council with such an important purpose and then to say to that council that its only duty is the provision of advice. The members of that council will certainly have to be involved and consulted to a greater extent in regard to this matter. This concerns a matter of cardinal importance and I shall also move amendments in this connection which will not make the matter impossible for the provincial councils but will in fact assist in overcoming the problem. As I have already said, I accept the fact that a responsibility rests on the provincial councils because they have to ensure that there are sufficient people in their provinces to teach at any given moment. It seems as though we shall have to look at the National Education Policy Act, No. 39 of 1967, as a result of this legislation. I believe that as a result of this Bill certain amendments to that Act will have to be effected. Under that Act we had a National Education Council, viz. a body which was comprised exclusively of members appointed by the hon. the Minister. However, these people had the same power and objects as this council as part of their functions. The objects are stated in clause 3, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object of the council shall be to uphold and promote esteem for education and the teaching profession and the prestige of those who are engaged in the teaching profession.</block>

<p>However, let us look at section 4 of the Act relating to the National Education Council. We find that one of its functions is to furnish advice. I quote section 4(3)(c) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Shall also endeavour to uphold and promote respect of education as also for the teaching profession and the prestige of persons engaged in the teaching profession</block>

<p>The function of the National Education Council and the function and the object of this council are therefore exactly the same. Elsewhere we find that the National Education Council can also furnish advice in regard to the qualifications for admission or for training and in section 4(3)(a) of the National Education Policy Act, that the council may&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(a) advise the Minister in regard to the general policy that should be pursued in connection with education in schools and teacher training, in so far as the professional aspects and the guiding principles of education and such training are concerned.</block>

<p>Here again we have a council which performs precisely the same function, namely an advisory function in regard to education. It therefore appears to me that amendments to Act No. 39 of 1967 are essential.</p>

<p>&#x2020;One cannot have an elected body from among registered teachers and at the same time have its main functions being usurped by another body. This I believe will be terribly damaging to the prestige of the Teachers&#x2019; Council, and I am looking forward to hearing from the hon. the Minister whether he is contemplating amendments to Act No. 39 of 1967.</p>

<p>I must express my disappointment once again that we have to deal with a Bill here <span class="col_7333-7334" refersTo="page_0997"/>which, quite unnecessarily, perpetuates the system &#x201C;for Whites only&#x201D; and opens us up to unnecessary attacks. Let me say immediately that I know the practical difficulties if we at this stage should try to establish one council. The reason is simply that 90&#x0025; of the Black teachers of today have academic qualifications which are equivalent to Std. 10 or slightly higher. No educationist in his wildest dreams could justify such low qualifications as being adequate for professional recognition. This I accept immediately. If all these teachers had to be registered, we would have been faced with a situation where perhaps the provisionally registered people would have been in greater numbers on the roll than anybody else. But if the hon. the Minister is to call this the S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Council Bill, he can deal with the matter by means of amendments providing for the gradual admission of teachers of other races in schedule 1. The hon. the Minister should not come and use the argument that he as Minister of National Education only has jurisdiction over White education departments. In schedule 1 he is already legislating for teachers employed in Bantu education departments.</p>

<p>Having done this, I think that he has created a situation where one will find at one and the same school two people, one who happens to be Black and the other White, both having the same qualifications, but while the one can claim that he is a registered teacher in South Africa the other cannot. I believe that it would have been possible for the hon. the Minister to overcome this problem through the definition of &#x201C;teacher&#x201D; in clause 1, where it states that &#x201C;teacher&#x201D; means a White person who holds a professional teacher&#x2019;s qualification. If this can be made to read that &#x201C;teacher&#x201D; means a person who holds a professional teacher&#x2019;s qualification, he could have overcome this problem and we would have had the situation where at least at this stage they would have been able to register. The question of representation on the council is an entirely different one because it has to be through the associations. From a practical point of view, I do not think that would have been possible.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying to the hon. the Minister that we shall put amendments on the Order Paper. Most of these will be of an administrative nature. I know that he will perhaps adopt the attitude that this is an agreed measure and that he cannot therefore bring about changes. I realize this, but it is a compromise between the teachers on the one hand and himself and the provincial administrations on the other hand. To claim therefore that this has the 100&#x0025; support of everyone who is involved in this compromise, will not be correct. However, we are prepared to support the Second Reading.</p>

<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot congratulate the hon. member for Durban Central on his speech. It was not such a good speech that I can congratulate him on it. What I can say is that one usually hears very few positive sounds from those benches. In general, however, he did not advance so many negative arguments this afternoon. Therefore I want to congratulate him in this respect that he did try to be positive. I agree with some of the arguments which he advanced. However, I cannot agree with him when he alleges that there will be a conflict of interests between the National Education Council and the proposed professional council when they are both trying to promote the interests of the teachers. In my opinion there is no conflict. On the contrary. If two councils are striving to achieve the same objects, the work they are able to do is so much better. If the hon. member and his wife both undertake to look after the interests of their children together, and to educate their children well, it can only be to the benefit of the children. Therefore I cannot see how there can be a conflict of interests here. Incidentally, while the hon. member was speaking, I wondered whether he would be able to register as a teacher in terms of clause 15 of the Bill. I think perhaps he will, unless of course he is eliminated in terms of clause 17. Still, I do think the hon. member ought to have himself registered, particularly in view of the political climate we are now experiencing.</p>

<p>From this side of the House, it is a special privilege for me to give this Bill my full support. As a person who spent the best years of his life teaching, and who was also involved in this specific matter, it is a memorable event for me that this Bill is before this House today.</p>

<p>The first attempts were made in the early forties, I think it was in 1944, to have a professional council of teachers established, and a draft Bill was in fact drawn up in 1949. Unfortunately it miscarried owing to technical problems, and we have only now, after almost 30 years, reached the stage we have reached <span class="col_7335-7336" refersTo="page_0998"/>today. When the new Bill comes before this House, legislation which, according to the hon. the Minister is pioneering legislation because there are not many countries in which a professional council for teachers exist, one must ask oneself the following question: Is it really necessary? Does it meet a particular need? Is there a need for such a Bill? To be able to reply adequately to this question, one need only go through the minutes of teachers&#x2019; congresses over the past 30 to 40 years, for one will see that year after year resolutions were passed at all the various congresses in which the establishment of such a council was advocated. For the teaching corps of South Africa it is therefore a very serious matter. One may ask oneself why it is regarded as being essential.</p>

<p>Although the term teaching profession has been in colloquial use for many years, and perhaps even for centuries, it has nevertheless been apparent, when it came to official recognition, that many people strongly doubted whether the teaching profession was really a profession or whether it was not simply a career. The people who advance these arguments, then draw comparisons between recognized professions such as the legal profession and the medical profession which have received official recognition for their status by means of statutory councils, and the teaching profession which has no such statutory council, and therefore enjoys no such statutory recognition. Prominent people lay down basic requirements for an occupation to be called a profession. Even members of the public lay down such requirements, and one cannot doubt this. I am quoting from a court ruling by one of our judges&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I myself am disposed to attach some importance, in findings as to whether a profession is exercised or not, to the fact that a particular man is a member of an organized professional body with a recognized standard of ability enforced before he can enter it and a recognized standard of conduct enforced while he is practising it. I do not for a moment say this settles the matter, but if I were deciding a question of profession, I should attach some importance to that particular feature.</block>

<p>What the hon. judge was therefore saying was that when he has to decide that a man is a member of a profession, there have to be recognized standards of competence with which a person has to comply before he may enter the profession and there also have to be recognized standards of conduct which are applied. One can therefore deduce that these are the two requirements which are laid down for a profession, i.e. a recognized standard of competence or learning to which a person has to comply to be able to be admitted to a specific profession and a recognized standard of conduct which is in force and which is applicable to all the persons engaged in the profession.</p>

<p>In my opinion the teaching profession has always complied with those two requirements, firstly, to the requirement of an academic and professional qualification to be able to enter the profession and, secondly to the requirement of a high standard of conduct for the teachers. Although the teaching profession has complied with the requirements it has up to now been excluded from a recognized profession simply because there was no statutory recognition in the form of a body which had the power to enforce that standard. This Bill is now making provision for the establishment of such a professional council for teachers, a council which, <i>inter alia,</i> will have the power, firstly, to lay down a minimum qualification for teachers and, secondly, to draw up a professional code of conduct in terms of which the profession will be able to discipline its own members. This is a very important aspect. I acknowledge, in common with the hon. member for Durban Central, that there are shortcomings in the Bill, but as he also said, it is a compromise between various organs. These are, however, the two fundamental requirements for a profession, and provision is being made for this. It should now be made clear to everyone that when this Bill is passed, the teaching profession is being brought into line with the other recognized provisions in our country as we know them. Seen in this light there can therefore be no doubt that the passing of this legislation will in fact be a red letter day for the teaching profession, for the status of the teacher and of the teaching profession is being enhanced and the Bill in fact ushers in a new era in our country for our teachers in the sense that people will, it is hoped, have a greater esteem for the profession. The Bill will serve as a new incentive for education because it will encourage persons to <span class="col_7337-7338" refersTo="page_0999"/>enter the profession. We are hopeful that it will have such an effect.</p>

<p>Because the legislation, in the first place, is an agreed measure between the various teachers&#x2019; associations and the various education departments which act as employers and which have certain vested rights which have to be recognized, this Bill perhaps does not comply with the high requirements and the high ideals which the teaching profession has over the years set for such a Bill. For example if one considers the powers of the proposed council, one sees that it may institute an inquiry into a contravention of the professional code of conduct, and it may penalize any person who contravenes the code of conduct by reprimanding such person, imposing on him a penalty, or striking his name off the register. The council may also obtain certain information from the heads of education, and may advise the Committee of Heads of Education on the requirements for the training of persons to be able to teach at a school and on the requirements for admission to a course for such training. Therefore this is advice to the heads of education in respect of training and admission. It is the last point in particular&#x2014;in this regard I agree with the hon. member for Durban Central&#x2014;which one found a little disappointing because it has not been stated in stronger terms. I think, in the interests of the status of the teaching profession, it should really have been stated in slightly stronger terms, for if one considers the other professions, one sees that the medical practitioners, the accountants, the architects and so on, in fact have to approve of the training in and the training institutions for their professions. They even exercise control over the qualifications, curricula and examinations. The education departments could perhaps be of the opinion that the professional council for education would perhaps interfere with their rules and regulations and with the education being provided at the colleges and universities. But I know that the other professions cooperate very closely with the existing universities, and that there is the closest co-operation for example between the faculties of architecture of the various universities, and the Architects&#x2019; Association. It is solely in the interests of that profession that such close co-operation exists.</p>

<p>One would have liked to have seen provision being made for something similar as far as the teaching profession is concerned. In other words, I should have liked to have seen one of the powers of this council having to be the approval and recognition of the institutions for the training of teachers as well as the control of curricula, examinations and qualifications of teachers, or something of that nature. Moreover I should also have liked to have seen one of the powers of the council having to be the protection of the professional interests of registered teachers. I hope that this council will in the course of years in fact acquire this power, even though the Bill does not contain such provisions, for truly, we who were members of the teaching profession for years and who are still interested in it, know that a body which will endeavour to look after and protect the interests of the teacher is very necessary in this country.</p>

<p>I would be able to enumerate many examples of injustices which were perpetrated, not that this was done wilfully, but in terms of existing legislation and ordinances. Injustices which were perpetrated on teachers, which one could not condone. I want to refer to one example now. A man who was a teacher for 25 years, resigned to become a member of Parliament. During those 25 years he paid his money into the pension fund for this pension and at the same time the Education Department paid in an equal amount according to the pound-for-pound or rand-for-rand system. When he resigned after 25 years he received only as much money back as he had paid in, and not a cent in interest, to say nothing of the part the Education Department had paid in on his behalf. I think that is an injustice. However, there is simply nobody to which such a teacher may take his complaint. He comes up against the authorities who say that that is what the ordinance provides, and that is the end of the story! Such a body which protects the professional interests of the teachers, is really necessary.</p>

<p>I would be able to enumerate other weak points in the legislation, but that in is not of interest to me. Of decisive importance is that a professional council is being established here. Consequently, a start is being made and a foundation being laid on which it will be possible to build in future. It is also very important that, according to my information, all the various federated teachers&#x2019; associations agreed that they were satisfied, and that what stood in the Bill satisfied them. This is <span class="col_7339-7340" refersTo="page_1000"/>important to us, for what is involved here is the teacher. That is why I think today is an important day for the teaching profession. It is a pity that they did not know that this Bill was to be discussed here today, otherwise there would probably have been quite a number of them here.</p>

<p>As far as the exercise of discipline by the council over registered teachers is concerned, it is clear that there has to be a demarcation of territory between the proposed council and the employer concerned, which is one of the education departments. Every education department has a specific service contract with its teachers, and in terms of that service contract, so I think, the department will still be able to continue to exercise discipline over the teacher concerned when he contravenes his service contract. The professional council will then, in turn exercise discipline when the teacher contravenes the professional code or code of conduct which will be drawn up. Whether it will be possible to draw a clear dividing line between these two aspects I do not know, but with the passage of years and as experience is acquired, the various departments and this council will in fact find a solution&#x2014;will find a formula to solve this problem. I believe that it will be possible to leave the question of the exercise of discipline over the teacher to this council to an ever-greater extent.</p>

<p>Clause 20 provides that, as from the date determined by the Minister, no person who is not registered or provisionally registered shall be appointed in a full-time permanent capacity at a school to teach. The question which immediately crops up of course is this: What about those persons who are appointed in a part-time or temporary capacity and who do not register? That problem may be solved if all persons may be registered in terms of the provisions of clause 15. All persons who have teaching qualifications ought to register with this council. This applies to those of us sitting here in this House, as well as to married women who are not members of the teaching profession at the moment, for when a person wants to teach in a temporary capacity&#x2014;as the hon. member for Durban Central will have to do after the next election&#x2014;it will be possible to make use of their services. Temporary vacancies exist and school principals may be forced, for example, to approach a farmer with a B.Com. degree and to ask him to teach bookkeeping. Although such a person may not possess a teaching qualification, he will at least be able to ensure that the subject is kept going.</p>

<p>A person who is appointed temporarily and who is not registered will, in terms of his service contract with the department, fall under the discipline of the department, and not under the discipline of this council, and that is a pity. As the title indicates, this proposed council is a council for Whites. There are persons who allege that because the Medical and Dental Council includes all race groups, and because the council of the legal profession includes all race groups, this council should also include all race groups. For those who have no knowledge of the teaching profession it may indeed seem logical that all race groups should be included here as well. The position is that to qualify as a dentist, medical practitioner, advocate or attorney, one first has to undergo a certain examination, regardless of one&#x2019;s race or colour. As far as education is concerned, that is not yet the case. Ninety per cent of the Black teachers in Black schools would not be able to qualify if they have to undergo the same examination as Whites. The object of this council is, in the first place, to enhance the status of the teaching profession. To achieve this, a minimum qualification has to be laid down. Personally I think that this minimum qualification should be at least a senior certificate, plus three years&#x2019; professional training. Properly it ought to be four years, but the minimum is three years. If one were to set this as a requirement, then approximately 90&#x0025; of the Bantu teachers would not qualify, and approximately 50&#x0025; to 60&#x0025; of the Coloured teachers would not qualify either. In other words, it would not be to the benefit of the Bantu or Coloured education if these people were to be brought together, for only a small group of them would be able to register. The others will have to remain non-members, and this would definitely not be to their advantage.</p>

<p>There are in addition various other reasons why this cannot happen, but I do not want to go into them any further now. What is of importance, however, is that this council is now being established. This is pioneering legislation and may serve as a guide-line if the other teachers&#x2019; groups, <i>inter alia,</i> the Bantu teachers, Coloured teachers and Indian teachers want similar legislation. As soon as <span class="col_7341-7342" refersTo="page_1001"/>each group has then established a professional association, an overall body may be established, and then there can be very good co-operation which will be to the benefit of education in general. It is my sincere desire that this Bill will lead to the dawn of a new day for the teaching profession as such, that the status of the teaching profession will be further enhanced, and that it will serve as an incentive to attract good people to the profession.</p>

<speech by="#mills">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. W. MILLS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is one thing that we have accepted from the hon. member for Algoa, and that is that he can never appreciate a speech made by any hon. member on this side of the House. I am beginning to wonder if that is not an admission of his own ignorance. I would like him over the weekend to read the speech of the hon. member for Durban Central. Perhaps he will realize that there is indeed something in it that can be appreciated.</p>

<p>We see the Bill before us as one of great educational significance for South Africa. We feel that it marks a new direction in the educational development of South Africa. I say this because for some years we have seen education sitting on a divide trying to find a new direction. As the hon. the Minister has mentioned, teachers have been asking for this for 40 years and what they wanted was a council. I think we have found a new direction today and we in the UP welcome it. We welcome it for very good reasons, because in the past we have always urged this and we now see that it is reaching fruition. We have argued that to stimulate professional pride we need a professional council. However, this is not by any means the end of the road, as the hon. the Minister mentioned. It is only the start, and once a code of ethics has been established, teachers will also want to have their own separate salary structure outside the Public Service Commission. Therefore it is not a giant step, but merely a nudge. However it is a nudge in the direction in which we should like education to go.</p>

<p>In our view this Bill accomplishes very little apart from this register. However, the register is the seed of an idea and it is now up to those teachers who will be elected as members of the council to cultivate this seed, see that it matures and that from this Bill a great teaching profession will grow. We are proud for having educated the Government towards this step and we congratulate ourselves for our effective opposition and guidance. We also commend the new hon. Minister in getting the show on the run. However, we must not forget the hard work that has been put into this Bill by many other organizations. At this stage we should like to congratulate the previous hon. the Minister of National Education, directors of education, heads of educational committees, teachers&#x2019; associations and officials, but in particular members of the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, of which the hon. member for Durban Central was a member. They were the real power behind this. They prepared what we find before us today. They have had many discussions in order to reach this stage, and we congratulate them on the work they have done.</p>

<p>Why does the hon. member not thank the hon. the Minister?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mills">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. W. MILLS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte is very often a few sentences behind. But I shall forgive him that because I know it is late on a Friday. As has been said by a previous speaker on this side of the House, this Bill is not perfect and that there are some defects. The three stumbling blocks are: the code of conduct; the qualifications for registration; and the objects of the council. As regards the code of conduct, it is vital to the effectiveness of the Bill. It is a key, and we feel that it is a great pity that this code cannot be formulated entirely by the council who will be responsible for putting it into practice.</p>

<p>In clause 15(1)(d) it states that the code must be drawn up with the concurrence of the Committee of Educational Heads. We all agree that these are the employers and that they have the right&#x2014;nobody will deny that&#x2014; to lay down the conditions of service for teachers. When it comes to the standards of behaviour to which teachers must adhere, we feel the code must be laid down by the teachers themselves. If the public are to have any respect for teachers and if the teachers are to have any respect for their own code, they should be the people responsible for formulating the code and it should not be dictated to them. In other words, it should come from their own hearts, out of their own convictions and they must be responsible to it.</p>

<p>We are quite in agreement with the powers that are given to the council in terms of the <span class="col_7343-7344" refersTo="page_1002"/>Bill. These powers are quite considerable, but it is to be expected that a body such as this should have these powers. We see that it can caution, reprimand, fine up to R50 or strike a teacher&#x2019;s name off the register. They can refuse to register a teacher, so that a teacher&#x2019;s full-time permanent employment can be in jeopardy. He can also be dismissed on 24 hours&#x2019; notice. That is a considerable power for the council to have. They can issue sub-poenaes for the attendance of a witness with a penalty of R100 should the witness refuse to appear. Should a person attempt to falsify his registration he will be liable to a fine of R200 or to six months&#x2019; imprisonment. We think it is good that the council should have this power because they can establish prestige through it. However, we do not take it lightly that the code of conduct, under which these powers will be employed, has not been established. Therefore it is our intention to move an amendment to clause 15(1)(d) to make teachers entirely responsible to their code of conduct. It does follow that, once the code is established for the teaching profession, the question of colour does not arise. We feel that the code will become universal and will apply to all South African teachers of all race groups.</p>

<p>The second stumbling block I mentioned was the registration of teachers based on their qualifications. The difficulty here is that not all teachers are academically qualified. There is a considerable body of specialist teachers concerned mainly with commercial subjects, technical subjects, foreign languages, music or fine arts. For the most part these are, however, highly competent people. For instance, I know of a woodwork master who was originally a cabinet maker by trade. His pupils obtain excellent matriculation results and there is nothing one can tell him about his subject. In addition, his rapport with his pupils is quite tremendous. However, this man did not have an academic qualification, that very necessary piece of paper. Consequently he would be denied registration under certain circumstances. It is true that clauses 15(1) and 16 do make allowances for these people, but there seems to be a lack of clarity in respect of these two clauses. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to make a point of replying to this. As we interpret clause 15(1)(a)(i), all teachers, who in terms of the definition must be academically qualified, would be eligible to register, whether they were in private schools or not. However, clause 15(1)(a)(ii) refers to persons who, although they are seemingly unqualified teachers in Government schools, would be eligible to register, while it seems that unqualified teachers in private schools would be eliminated in terms of this provision. I should like clarification from the hon. the Minister in this regard because we would not like to think that any particular body of the teaching profession was being discriminated against. We shall also move an amendment to this clause in an endeavour to establish some norm.</p>

<p>In this Bill the third stumbling block, which the federal council is faced with, relates to its objectives. We feel that the council should be given more teeth through clauses 3 and 18(d). If one looks at clause 3 one sees that it is couched in widely ranging and, consequently vague terms. It would seem that the object of the council is to uphold the esteem of the profession. Naturally, one asks oneself what the esteem of the profession is and whether it is worth upholding. Our view is that the esteem, prestige or status of teachers is far from being ideal. There is a lot to be achieved in this field. We should like to see it as the object of the council not to uphold this limited level, but rather to investigate and recommend steps which will, in fact, promote prestige in the profession. Teachers have their own professional status by virtue of what they themselves have achieved, but any public status they have is usually based on what they are paid. It is really quite appalling if one compares the prestige and salaries that sportsmen in the Western world can command, or again the status and salaries of academics in Russia, for example, with the salaries of our teachers. They should have a similar reputation and salary but they do not. By means of amendments to clauses 3 and 18(d) we shall make recommendations to try to have these ideas incorporated.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to make some general comments on the Bill. Firstly, we think it does incorporate some very democratic principles, particularly when it comes to electing representatives to the council. This representation will be broadly based, unlike the Scottish council, to which the hon. the Minister referred, which is rather rigid and specific, prescribing as it does that certain <span class="col_7345-7346" refersTo="page_1003"/>categories of teachers must be represented. We do not do this in this Bill, but then of course this sort of democracy does give scope for a degree of apprehension. I should like to mention that the university people and the heads of the colleges do feel that the composition of this council could become unbalanced. They feel that they may be swamped. On the other hand, we have heard reports that there is apprehension amongst assistant teachers that they may not be represented and that senior staff will get preference. Then, of course, there is a feeling amongst males that, because of the preponderance of females in the profession, the females could, if they wanted to, launch some sort of take-over bid which could make the militant &#x201C;women&#x2019;s libbers&#x201D; green with envy. We are, however, confident that the teachers will grasp the democratic process with eagerness and that they will balance this council, of which South Africa can be proud.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that tentative steps in the right direction have been made in the Bill for the South African teaching profession, but that these steps will have to be reinforced in the future. They will have to be strengthened, and we in these benches will be taking the first steps in this direction with the amendments we intend proposing during the Committee Stage. We foresee that in time the Teachers&#x2019; Council will have to be given more specific powers to carry out its objectives and to see that they are carried out. We also foresee that the council will have to be given the power to make recommendations in respect of those matters which affect the esteem, or lack of esteem, for education and the prestige of teachers. I refer particularly to matters like salaries, recruitment, teachers&#x2019; duties, promotion, working conditions and teacher training.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support the Bill. We feel that it is unfair to condemn it at this stage. It must be given a chance to prove itself, and we hope that it will be the start of a new deal in South African education.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. HEFER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North advanced criticism of the fact that the professional code of conduct would be drafted for the most part by members of the council, but the people who will serve on this council will themselves be appointed by teachers from among their own ranks. It is specifically a professional body in the best sense of the word. It is these very people who will be best equipped to give effect to this legislation. If the hon. member had read the Bill in full, he would have seen that provision is made in clause 27 for amendments which may be dictated by experience, to be effected in the course of time. It is expressly stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council may with the approval of the Minister make regulations relating to &#x2026;</block>

<ol>

<li>(i) matters required or permitting to be prescribed in terms of this Act or necessary or expedient to carry out the provisions thereof.</li>

</ol>

<p>Provision is made, therefore, for further amendments. I therefore believe that the general statements and the general criticism he expressed, do not really apply. Once again the UP has lost an opportunity, in the case of this specific legislation, to convey a word of appreciation to this Government for work that has been done. As a result they have allowed an opportunity to slip through their hands to pay tribute to and thank the provinces and the heads of education who have devoted themselves to the field of education thus far, for what has been done. They champion the cause of the teachers, but they have not yet addressed a single word of thanks to the teachers who have done so much in the development of peoples in this country, and of the White people in particular. They would have done well to do so. The hon. member for Durban Central made a very crass statement a moment ago when he said that every Tom, Dick and Harry could be admitted to the teaching profession.</p>

<p>He himself does not know exactly what he said. The hon. member referred to the responsibility of two components, the State and the teacher. However this is an incomplete picture. He failed entirely to take the important element of the community, viz., the parents, into account. To complete the picture, we must take into account the partnership of the State and the parent. We must take into account the say of the parent together with his right in regard to the education of his child. It is the basic premise in education that one does not want to deprive the parent of his say and right. If the State has the sole right, then we are not a free people and country. On the other hand is the other pole, and this is the professional teacher and the material with which he works daily, namely the child. In all important decisions&#x2014;and this also applies to the drafting of legislation&#x2014;the place of the child, too, is important. The issue here is the status and satisfaction of the teacher. Let us be honest now. Surely we cannot pay a good teacher who weaves the concept of eternity into the character of the child, by way of a salary. However, we can give him the satisfaction of being appreciated and respected. This legislation concerns the fundamental being of those people.</p>

<p>To get an idea of this legislation and the needs underlying this matter, it is necessary to page through history a little. I am not going to waste the time of the House, but I just want to page briefly through the history of my province, the Transvaal. I want to refer to the School regalement which was passed in Potchefstroom on 15 March 1852 and was approved by the field-cornet of that ward. Section 4 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">De Gemeente verzekere den onderwijzer van zijn bestaan &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, the parent is responsible for the survival of the teacher, in the sense that he has to have food and clothing. In the same year Ds. Van der Hoff also drew up a &#x201C;reglement&#x201D;. Section 4 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dat als iemand als huisonderwyzer op die buitenplaatsen wenscht werkzaam te syn hy &#x2026; zich aan een behoorlyk onderzoek by den predikant zal moeten onderwerpen; die hem daarvoor een behoorlyk bewys geven zal &#x2026;</block>

<p>The poor teacher now goes from the public to the clergyman, who has to control him. In 1859 another &#x201C;reglement&#x201D; was adopted, which was signed, <i>inter alia,</i> by M. W. Pretorius. I quote from section 21&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">De leden der schoolcommissie hebben ten alle tijde het regt om de school te bezoeken, en wanneer zij eenige aanmer-kingen tegen den onderwijzer hebben te maken, zullen zij hem na afloop van de school daarover afzonderlik kunnen on-derhouden.</block>

<p>Here again we have the authority of the school committee. Now we come to the Onder-wijswet of 1866 and section 11 of the &#x201C;Reglement voor de Gouwernementsonder-wijzers&#x201D;, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Als het getal kinderen 75 en daarboven bedraagt, moeten zij zich voor eigen rekening van een ondermeester voorzien.</block>

<p>When a school grows and the number of pupils exceeds 75, the poor teacher has to appoint an assistant teacher for all additional teachers out of his own pocket. In that same Onderwyswet, passed by the Volksraad of the Suid-Afrikaanse Republiek on 22 February 1866, the following, among other things is provided with regard to teachers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Zij moeten voor den Veldkomet als klerken werkzaam zijn in schrijfwerk &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_7349-7350" refersTo="page_1005"/>The teacher therefore had to attend to the correspondence of the Field-cornet of the district.</p>

<p>Section 1 of the Transvaal Onderwyswet of 28 March 1882 provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">De Regeering der Z.A. Republiek, uit-gaande van het beginsel dat het de taak is der ouders te zorgen voor het onderwijs hunner kinderen &#x2026;</block>

<p>The State took the view that education was the task of the parents of children. Section 1 of the Transvaal Onderwyswet of 1892 similarly provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">De Regeering der Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, uitgaande van het beginsel, dat het de taak is der ouders te zorgen de opvoeding en het onderwijs der kinderen &#x2026;</block>

<p>Once again the parents are held responsible for the education of their children.</p>

<p>I wish to quote a very interesting sentence from Transvaal Ordinance No. 7 of 1903. One must bear in mind that the Transvaal had just lost its freedom and this is what the new r&#x00E9;gime prescribed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any scholar shall at the request of his parent or guardian receive instruction in the Dutch language for three hours a week.</block>

<block name="quote">Kennis van en vordering in de engelse taal een voorwaarde van overgaan in openbare scholen.</block>

<p>It is prescribed that if a child does not pass in English, he cannot be allowed to proceed to the next standard. Today the same principle applies; however, it applies not only in respect of English but in respect of Afrikaans as well.</p>

<p>In 1917, the Transvaal Director of Education, Mr. Scott, sent out a very interesting circular&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am directed to inform you that a resolution has been passed by the Executive Committee of the Province to the effect that in all primary schools in this Province where Afrikaans has been introduced as the medium of instruction Afrikaans shall be taught henceforth as a language.</block>

<li><span class="col_7351-7352" refersTo="page_1006"/>(2) The salaries of all teachers to be reduced by an amount of 5 per cent.</li>

</ol>

<p>From this heartsore past and the fine progress that was later made, we glean the story of the dedication of the teacher to his task and service. This heartrending story of how the teacher, in carrying out his important task, has been shunted from one extreme to the other, has left its mark or scar on the teacher.</p>

<p>Even though this Bill contains defects, it attests to the fact that the hon. the Minister and those who have assisted him in drafting it, have at least succeeded affording recognition to the teachers, in the form of legislation, for the sacrifices they have made and will make in the task that lies before them. Appreciation for the service of those people is shown in this Bill. In this Bill there is recognition of the indispensable partnership of those people in our task, and appreciation is displayed for the importance of their work; furthermore, an attempt is being made to weld the components of State and parent and teacher and child into a meaningful unit in the service of our country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down gave us a historical review of some of the aspects of the teaching profession in South Africa and that, of course, is a matter of some interest, but he started his address by saying that he thought that as far as the Opposition benches were concerned, they were somewhat ungracious in that they had not thanked the Minister, because that was apparently the appropriate thing that needed to be done. [Interjections.] There was, however, a time when the predecessor of the hon. the Minister came in for considerable criticism because of the state of the teaching profession and for the delay which has occurred with regard to the introduction of measures which were necessary for the teaching profession. I want to say to the hon. the Minister, who is new in these shoes, that I hope that he will not find himself in the shoes of his predecessor who, in <i>Die Vaderland</i> of 25 November, was attacked under headlines which read: &#x201C;Minister het nie gesag of wil nie&#x201D;. Sir, he had the authority, but he had an inability to act. The one thing which we hope to see from this Minister, if he is going to be in this post for any period of time, which we, of course, do not know, is that he will at least have the desire to act and the desire to do, because this is what the teaching profession needs in South Africa. The teaching profession has been in a position of near crisis in South Africa for many years. Meaningful action has been required literally for decades. Inquiries have been held, we have had commissions over the years, solutions have been suggested, and palliatives have been applied, but the problem has continued. The suggestion of a professional controlling body for teachers has actually been on the drawing board for a quarter of a century and more. It has taken that length of time before this legislation has been introduced here today. It is also necessary to say that this idea of a professional controlling body has been only one of the many ideas which have been put forward to raise the status of the profession, and I believe it is the status of the profession which is mainly at issue in this legislation. We on these benches support the creation of a teachers&#x2019; council, but it can only be one aspect of what is needed in order to raise the status of the teacher in South Africa. In its present form, we believe that the Teachers&#x2019; Council has inadequate functions.</p>

<p>In this regard this question needs to be asked, and perhaps needs to be rhetorically asked: What are the functions which a council such as this should perform? Firstly, it is clear that such a council should lay down a code of professional conduct. In the second instance it is clear that it should have a say in regard to the qualifications for the profession. Thirdly, it should have a say in regard to the type of training which is envisaged for the profession. Fourthly, it should deal with the discipline of the profession. In the fifth instance, it should have a say in regard to income levels as far as the profession is concerned. Sixthly, and perhaps most importantly, it should actively participate in the promotion of the profession. One has to examine this council in order to see whether it meets these criteria and whether it compares favourably with other professional councils of this nature. When this body is <span class="col_7353-7354" refersTo="page_1007"/>compared with other professional bodies, I believe that this council will be found wanting and will be found to have inadequate powers.</p>

<p>The other matter which I believe should be dealt with is that for a truly professional council to exist in South Africa, it must in fact cater for the whole of the profession and not be a racially exclusive body. This Teachers&#x2019; Council is not a teachers&#x2019; council, but a teacher&#x2019;s council for Whites. It is part of the apartheid structure of South Africa. There is no question about it, and the question I want to raise with the hon. the Minister is whether in viewing the situation both internally and internationally, looking at the international status of the council, is harm not being done to the status of this council, which is intended to be a professional body, because of the fact that it is intended for Whites exclusively? The medical council, the law society and the Bar councils are not exclusively White bodies. One recognizes the problems which exist in regard to the qualifications of the teachers of emergent peoples, but should registration of equal qualification not be open to all races and should the membership of equally qualified persons be dependent on race? It is clear that problems exist, but surely these problems can be overcome. Is the answer to the problem not that the Minister should in fact allow the registration of all people who have the requisite qualification? Secondly, should one not encourage the existence of associations in which qualified Black teachers can participate in the same manner as Whites presently do in existing associations? There are already such associations. There is no reason why there should not also in South Africa be a choice to those who want to belong to a multi-racial association, and there is no reason why such an association should not exist.</p>

<p>When it comes to the question of registration, it is quite clear that there should be no registration for those who do not achieve the minimum qualifications. If one applies this, one can apply it multi-racially, but it must be done on a non-discriminatory basis and the same principles must be applied to everybody. In so far as the application of the closed provisions is concerned, it is clear that until adequate numbers of qualified teachers who could qualify for registration exist, one can apply the closed provisions only to those groups of schools to which one wants to apply them. There is, therefore, an answer to this, if only the hon. the Minister wants to apply it. Instead of doing this he goes on and on applying measures in South Africa which are part of the apartheid structure of society and which in the long run will only have to be dismantled again.</p>

<p>However, I should like to say that one has to support the Second Reading of the Bill in the circumstances, because we are operating in an apartheid system, and we cannot seek to frustrate the aspirations of the White teachers because the hon. the Minister will not recognize the fact that professional people should not be divided on racial grounds.</p>

<p>I should now like to turn to other matters. The teaching of our children has been allowed by this Government&#x2014;and I make that indictment today&#x2014;to get into a most serious position. We find on the part of parents a dissatisfaction with the standard of teaching of many subjects and with the qualifications of many of the people who have to teach at schools. A study committee of certain East Rand governing bodies alleges that unqualified teachers, that is people who are not fully qualified for the job, make up as much as 65&#x0025; of the people holding posts in certain classes and in certain subjects. In this regard I wish to refer the hon. the Minister to the article in <i>Die Vaderland</i> of 25 November. That can only be a serious situation. There are posts which are physically filled in that there are bodies who fill them, but quite clearly they are inadequately filled at the present moment. That is the situation which parents are confronted with today.</p>

<p>It is all very well for the hon. member who spoke before me to speak about the part that parents, teachers and the pupils have to play together. Of course they have to do this, but the responsibility for this situation having been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent in South Africa lies full-square on this Government. Make no mistake, Sir, it is not only the parents who are dissatisfied; the teachers are <span class="col_7355-7356" refersTo="page_1008"/>dissatisfied as well. They are dissatisfied in respect of the question of status and in respect of the conditions of work. They are also dissatisfied in respect of earnings. As far as this piece of legislation is concerned, it is designed to deal with only one matter, and that is the status of the teacher. However, in reality the major problem, as the hon. the Minister knows, is that the pay cheque at the end of the month is still the crucial issue when it comes to the solution of the teacher problem. It is as relevant to the question of status as any piece of legislation one may seek to introduce. That is a problem that must be dealt with by the hon. the Minister. If the problems in the profession are to be solved, this piece of legislation alone will not be sufficient. Teachers&#x2019; pay, the provision of greater prospects of advancement and progress, the raising of the level of qualifications as well as the devising of means to attract more males with higher educational qualifications are additional matters that should receive the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>If I may, I should now like to turn specifically to the legislation itself. In the first place, as I have tried to indicate, the functions of the council are limited. They do not cover the full range of what a truly professional council or body should do. I want to indicate again that I believe that the council should have a part to play and a real say in respect of training, and that it should be involved in the establishment of conditions of employment, amongst other matters. I should now like to turn to the provisions of the Bill itself. In clause 1 one finds that even the definition of professional teachers&#x2019; qualifications is not left to the professional body. How could one expect the Law Society to allow somebody else to determine the qualifications to practise law? The Medical Council today determines the qualifications to practise medicine. However, in this case the professional teachers&#x2019; qualification is described as a degree, diploma or certificate recognized, not by the council, but in fact by the committee of heads of education established in terms of the National Education Act. One of the fundamental things one has to do is to accept that, in the case of a truly professional body, it has to have a say in regard to qualifications.</p>

<p>The same thing applies in the case of recognition. The same aspects can be argued here. We can refer to other clauses which make it clear that the functions of this council are in these respects of an advisory nature. They do not play the real part which a professional body should play.</p>

<p>The second point is that there is no doubt that we are creating and have in existence a multiplicity of other boards, councils and committees. If one is going to create a truly professional council, then one has to give consideration to the question as to whether we are not dividing power, whether we do not have duplication and whether there should not be a transfer of powers from some of the other bodies to this professional council. Overlapping should certainly be eliminated.</p>

<p>If one looks at these matters I believe one should ask the question whether in fact the Government itself does not keep a kind of veto right. I should like the hon. the Minister to deal in his reply with clause 16 before we move some of the amendments of which we have already given notice. In terms of clause 16 it is provided that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The name of a person who does not hold a professional teachers&#x2019; qualification but is appointed by a head of education in a full-time permanent capacity in a post at a school approved by the committee, shall <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> in the manner contemplated in section 15(1)(a), be entered provisionally in the register.</block>

<p>If one compares this with the provision the hon. the Minister referred to in clause 20, the question arises whether, after the Minister has in fact used his powers in terms of clause 20 to prevent the employment of people, it is still possible to appoint people in terms of clause 16, because on the face of it the two clauses seem to be contradictory. Once the powers in terms of clause 20 have been exercised the powers in terms of clause 16 should no longer be capable of being exercised.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill has become necessary because of the Government&#x2019;s difficulty in finding the ready cash with which to buy the farms, villages and towns which have been set aside for acquisition by the Bantu Trust in the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy of fulfilling the quota requirements provided for in the 1936 legislation. Provision is made for the Trust to borrow money or to issue promissory notes in order to pay for the land. In the Second Reading debate I indicated that the Bill would have our support because it would augment the funds available to the Government for the purchase of this land. I also asked that these provisions be applied to the Transkei, and I am grateful to the Deputy Minister for indicating that this would in fact be done. In addition, I asked for information on the details of the promissory notes, namely what interest rates would be applicable and over what period the promissory notes would run, but I was unable to get any reply on that issue. I also agreed, Sir, that all the stages of the Bill should be dealt with, as we considered it to be a matter of urgency.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in his reply to the Second Reading debate, the Deputy Minister said something which rather upset us. In discussing the measure I had made use of the English text of the Bill, which makes provision for &#x201C;promissory notes&#x201D; to be issued, and we understood that these promissory notes would be negotiable. Unfortunately, however, the Deputy Minister, in his reply to the debate, and in referring to &#x201C;Staatseffekte&#x201D; being available, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is die groot voordeel daarvan, dat indien die boer Staatseffekte kry, hy dit kan verhandel terwyl die skuldbriewe nie ver-handelbaar sal wees nie. Maar dit sal wel &#x2019;n vorm van sekuriteit wees, &#x2019;n Man sal dit kan gebruik om dit te sedeer aan iemand van wie hy grond koop. Hy sal dit egter nie kan verhandel nie.</block>

<p>In the Afrikaans text the word &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; is used and not &#x201C;promesse&#x201D;, which is the usual Afrikaans translation of &#x201C;promissory note&#x201D;. If one looks in a dictionary, one finds that this is in fact so, and that an acknowledgement of debt is usually referred to as a &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D;. The Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply to us, that such a promissory note would not be negotiable, supported the impression that it was going to be an acknowledgment of debt and not a promissory note. It does not really matter whether &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; includes &#x201C;promissory note&#x201D;, but it is unfortunate that the Government does not stick to one term.</p>

<p>Last year, when we amended the Land Bank Act, provision was made for a farmer to give the Land Bank promissory notes, and there the word &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; was not used in the Afrikaans text. The word used was in fact &#x201C;promesse&#x201D;. I submit that in the ordinary context &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; gives the impression merely of an acknowledgement of debt. The Deputy Minister has said that one could take a &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; to one&#x2019;s bank. I want to point out to him that if a farmer accepts a &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D;, or acknowledgment of debt, which he can use as security&#x2014;it is undoubtedly so that he can use it as security&#x2014;and he then wishes to borrow money from his bank on the security of that &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; which he tenders to the bank, he has to borrow money at the bank rate, which is invariably higher than the statutory rate of interest to which the Deputy Minister referred. Therefore the holder of the security will in fact be losing if he uses it in a bank in this way. But, Sir, the fact is that this Bill, in providing for a &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D;, or promissory note, does give the farmer some relief. If a farmer or an owner of land in a town or village negotiates with the Government for the sale of his property, and he is prepared to accept a &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; so that he can in fact dispose of his property&#x2014;because at the moment the only people to whom such a person can dispose of his property is the Trust&#x2014;he is at the mercy of tire Government. Notwithstanding this fact, we shall still support the Third Reading of this Bill in order to give relieve to these people.</p>

<p><span class="col_7359-7360" refersTo="page_1010"/>I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will make it clear to us here in the Third Reading what he means by &#x201C;verhandelbaar&#x201D;. Does he in fact mean that a promissory note&#x2014;the term used in the English text&#x2014;is what he means by a &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D;? When he said that it would not be &#x201C;verhandelbaar&#x201D;, he was not telling us what the true position would be. He was speaking under a misapprehension, because it makes a big difference whether the instrument, whatever it is, given to the farmer or the landowner in the village or the town can be negotiated. But, in any event, it will still be a relief even if he only gets a mere acknowledgment of debt, an IOU, which he can use as security. Therefore we shall support the Bill, although it does not quite satisfy what we want.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened attentively to the hon. member who has just spoken. I think we are dealing here with a very important Bill, especially to those people whose land is needed for the speedy consolidation of the homelands. As far as the argument concerning the terms &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; or &#x201C;promissory note&#x201D; is concerned, I want to suggest, with respect, that the arguments advanced by the hon. member who has just spoken, as well as the arguments advanced in the Committee Stage, are really of academic interest and would be more appropriate to a debate between third-year law students. The fact remains that the Bantu Trust does not expropriate farmers&#x2019; land. The land is acquired through negotiation. That is not expropriation. The nature of the promissory note to be provided by the Bantu Trust to the seller of that land will also be determined by way of negotiation. If the seller of the land wants a negotiable instrument, I do not think there can be any doubt about the fact that the Bantu Trust will in fact give a negotiable instrument to that seller. If it should happen&#x2014;I do not think it will&#x2014;that the Bantu Trust should refuse to give such promissory note to the seller, the seller would be free to refuse to accept it. But in my opinion, this is not even of academic interest. Common sense tells us that any seller will insist on such promissory note&#x2019;s being negotiable.</p>

<p>It will be made negotiable, and if the seller prefers the instrument not to be negotiable, that can be arranged, of course&#x2014;just as it suits him. There is a world of difference, of course, but I do not want to take up the time of the House by conducting an academic debate on the terms &#x201C;negotiable&#x201D; and &#x201C;transferable&#x201D;. Even if an instrument is not negotiable, it still remains transferable. My learned friend will understand the difference. With these few words I mean to say that this whole debate is very technical indeed. As regards the instruments which the State will give to that person, these are fully covered, by the Afrikaans text as well. If we look at any authoritative Afrikaans-English legal dictionary, we shall see that the Afrikaans translation of &#x201C;promissory note&#x201D; is &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall be very brief. In the first place I should like to indicate that this Bill has a serious implication, an implication which, with respect, should be attended to. Until now Parliament has on each occasion been required to vote money, to make money available in terms of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, and Parliament to some extent has a control over that situation. Admittedly, once the money has been voted, once the money is available to the Bantu Trust, it is in the discretion of the Trust as to how it deals with it. Now, however, we have a new situation and that is that by virtue of the right of the Bantu Trust to issue promissory notes, the Bantu Trust is committing the Government ahead as to what its expenditure is to be. A high degree of control will have to be exercised here, otherwise we may find ourselves in a situation where we are going to be faced with a <i>fait accompli:</i> that promissory notes have been issued, that they will have to be met on due date and that the money will have to be found. A factor which seems to have escaped the notice of those who dealt with the matter, is that to some extent this affects the Parliamentary control of funds.</p>

<p>The second point which is important is that by here agreeing to the issuing of promissory notes, we are entering upon a short-term debt situation. Short-term debt is, of course, an unsatisfactory situation from the State&#x2019;s point of view. However attractive it may be from the farmer&#x2019;s point of view, it is unattractive from the State&#x2019;s point of view. We have already had the example of what happened with borrowing on the part of the State and the Reserve Bank last year, and one only needs to look at the state of our reserves at the present moment in order to see the implications of short-term <span class="col_7361-7362" refersTo="page_1011"/>borrowing when one does not look at the consequences of what one is doing. This short-term aspect therefore has serious implications for any Government in these particular circumstances.</p>

<p>There is no question of the 1936 legislation having to be honoured. There is no question of farmers who are now in a predicament, as far as their land is concerned, having to be helped out of that predicament. We therefore support this legislation because there is a debacle which the Government has created, and we cannot allow innocent people to be adversely affected by this situation. [Interjections.] That is really what it is all about. The one warning that has to be issued here, and that must be spelled out loud and clear, is that the ideology of this Government is getting South Africa into economic trouble. There has been a lot of talk about others being dangerous, but let me say there is nothing more dangerous for South Africa at the moment than the ideology of this Government. That is what is causing the difficulty in South Africa; that is where our economic troubles emanate from.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville says that the Government has created a debacle in South Africa. Last year, when the Government submitted proposals to Parliament to the effect that certain land should be acquired, did his party not vote in favour of those proposals? The answer is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. Now, however, the hon. member says that the Government has created a debacle in the country. However, the Government has done nothing of the kind. When he and this side voted in favour of those proposals, no one was creating a debacle in the country. He had better go and look up what the word &#x201C;debacle&#x201D; means.</p>

<p>Effect is being given here to the undertaking which was given in 1936 by the then Government and which has been given by this side of the House as well, as we shall proceed with it, no matter what those hon. members say. And we shall do it within the period we originally planned for. We shall definitely carry out this programme successfully.</p>

<p>I think I should explain to hon. members what our intentions are in buying against deferred payment. Perhaps it will then be better understood why this amendment to the law is necessary. All we intend to do is to go to a farmer or a landowner and to offer him a certain amount of the purchase price in cash; we take over his bonds or other obligations and we offer to pay the rest of the money by a specific date, at the current statutory interest rate. However, we cannot say at this stage exactly what the duration of the term will be. We do not know whether it will be a short or a long term. We should prefer to have a fairly long term, because if we make it a short term&#x2014;say three years, for example&#x2014;we may find ourselves in the situation predicted by the hon. member for Yeoville. Then the State would soon have obligations before the purchasing programme has been concluded. In other words, it would be advantageous to the State if we could first conclude the purchasing programme and then start on the payments. For that reason we shall negotiate with the owners and tell them when and how we are going to pay them. In effect it means that we shall give them a firm guarantee or assurance as well as the interest rate and the date of payment.</p>

<p>I now come to the academic question of whether the Afrikaans translation of this Bill or its English text contains the correct wording. I have made enquiries to find out whether that which we intend to do can in fact be done in terms of either of the two texts. I have been assured by the law advisers as well as by other people concerned with financial matters that we shall in fact be able to do it in terms of either of the two texts. I want to point out to the hon. member for Griqualand East that I have consulted the English-Afrikaans legal dictionary written by V. G. Hiemstra, Judge of the Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa, and H. L. Gonin, Professor of Latin, University of Pretoria. In that dictionary it says that a &#x201C;promissory note&#x201D; is a &#x201C;promesse of skuldbewys&#x201D;. So there is no problem as to whether we shall in fact be able, in terms of the Bill, to do what we intend to do.</p>

<p>In actual fact, the Bill is nothing but enabling legislation to give borrowing powers to the S. A. Bantu Trust. We shall negotiate with the landowner and then the promissory note, the &#x201C;skuldbewys&#x201D; or &#x201C;promesse&#x201D;, or whatever the hon. members want to call it, can be made negotiable in terms of our agreement with the landowner. It is also possible that it may be decided not to make it negotiable. The decision as to whether or not it will be made <span class="col_7363-7364" refersTo="page_1012"/>negotiable will depend on our agreement with the landowner. The fact is just that we want to have as many instruments as possible available to us. If it has to be a non-negotiable instrument, we must be able to offer a non-negotiable instrument, and if it has to be a negotiable instrument, we must be able to offer that. It is true that if we were to borrow on the short term, this might hold advantages for the farmer, but it would impose certain obligations on the State. That is why I believe that the instruments provided for in the Bill will not be used on a large scale.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Since we debated this matter on Friday afternoon, the Minister of Finance has approved the use of long-term Government securities. The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has also approved the use of long-term Government securities. We would prefer this because its effect on the State would be different. I consequently foresee that we shall prefer to use long-term Government securities. I feel that long-term Government securities will even be more acceptable to the buying public as well. For that reason the offer we shall make, especially at this stage, where we shall be commencing within the next week or two, will firstly be an amount in cash. Secondly we shall offer long-term Government securities, and thirdly we shall offer to take over, by way of long-term Government securities, the bonds on the owners&#x2019; land held by other financial institutions. So the question which arose will largely be rendered academic. I foresee that we shall have no problems in practice and that we shall be able to expedite the programme by means of the measure which is before the House at the moment.</p>

<heading>SOUTH AFRICAN TEACHERS&#x2019; COUNCIL FOR WHITES BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was adjourned on Friday, I tried to deal with three specific issues and I should like to come briefly back to them. The first of them was that this is a Bill which is designed to deal with White teachers only. The question that has to be posed is whether, in fact, it is in the teachers&#x2019; interest to have a single-race council. Will it not be in the teachers&#x2019; interest to have a truly professional body in which all will find it possible to participate on an equal qualifications basis? Again I specifically want to draw to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention the fact that the single-race basis of this council will undoubtedly affect the international status of the council and will also affect the international professional status of teachers in South Africa. I do not wish to repeat what I said on Friday, but this is a most important issue from a broad educational point of view. It is an issue that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>The second issue was the question of the crisis in education, the fact that some posts are not filled at all while others are filled by unqualified or inadequately qualified people. On Friday afternoon, when I spoke of there being a crisis in education, howls went up in the House. Yet, at the same time, the figures I have, which reflect the position in the Transvaal, tell a story which is almost unbelievable as regards the present state of education. I want to quote from official figures related to the Transvaal. I have before me a report which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die getal onderwysers wat vakke op matriekvlak doseer en nie ten voile daarvoor opgelei is nie, is soos volg &#x2026;</block>

<p>The actual number of teachers involved and also the relevant percentages are given. I shall read out the percentages only.</p>

<block name="quote">In Engels is dit 33&#x0025;, in Afrikaans 25&#x0025;, in wiskunde 35&#x0025;, in natuuren skeikunde 50&#x0025;, in biologic 49&#x0025; en in aardrykskunde 25&#x0025;.</block>

<p>The figures in respect of other classes and especially Std. 6 reflect an even worse position. How anybody, in the face of those figures, can dare to say that there is no crisis in education, passes understanding. If the hon. the Minister dares say that there is no crisis in education, he cannot be aware of what is happening to education in South Africa.</p>

<p>The third point I wish to make concerns the real test of this Bill, i.e. what it will do for the teacher and what, therefore, it does for education as a whole. The teacher in South Africa has a choice and, in that regard, he is <span class="col_7365-7366" refersTo="page_1013"/>faced with a dilemma. That choice is a choice that has faced teachers in other parts of the world as well. The question is whether the teacher should be part of a profession or whether he should be part of a trade. The dilemma between the status and benefits on the one hand and the strength involved in being a trade on the other hand is a dilemma which has bedevilled the teaching profession on a world-wide basis. In the United Kingdom the teachers have chosen to be regarded as a trade. They have virtually chosen trade union status. The teachers&#x2019; associations in the United Kingdom are affiliated to the Trade Union Council. In the United Kingdom strikes and everything else revolve around the wage demands. One of the problems the hon. the Minister has to solve is whether in fact, by withholding reasonable remuneration from teachers, he is not forcing the teachers&#x2019; profession in South Africa into the trade union camp in terms of which they would rather be seen as trade unionists than professionals. This is the dilemma. I believe that the teaching profession in South Africa does not want to be regarded as a trade but specifically as a profession. The teachers have battled to achieve this status for themselves. This Bill, in fact, is designed to help teachers along the road of professionalism. However the difficulty is that this council is a council without the true ring of professionalism, and such a council does not solve the problem, as has, in fact, been demonstrated in Scotland. There they have a council and yet the profession there has not been put on the right road because the authorities were not prepared to give it the full powers which a professional council has to have. I submit that true professionalism requires more than this Bill offers. Can the teaching profession really be a profession and can a professional council give the status that is required when, firstly, the teachers are not free to determine their own code of conduct but in this respect require the approval of the Committee of Heads of Education? Secondly; can it be a profession when the council plays no greater part in training than serving in an advisory capacity? Thirdly; can it be a profession when not the council, but the Committee of Heads of Education decides on the qualifications required for membership? Fourthly; can it be a professional council when it cannot play a role in the remuneration and in the conditions of service of its members? The issue must be fairly and squarely raised whether teaching can also be a profession while control is exercised over it which makes it part of the Public Service. Should this not be a matter for urgent investigation by the hon. the Minister?</p>

<p>No one is going to be able to compare the status of this council favourably with the status of the councils that exist for other professions in South Africa, and this is the dilemma which we face. This is also why this Bill does not go far enough. Though we say it does not go far enough, the Bill is nevertheless a move in the direction of professionalism, but registration and disciplining alone do not create the status of a profession. Should not the hon. the Minister now apply his mind to the issue of actually promoting teaching as a profession? May I put two questions before him? Firstly, there is the question of administrative functions of teachers, their training in modern business practices and personnel management. Is that not a matter that needs attention, the question, not only of income, but also of the need to lead the reasonable life that a professional man wants to lead? Lastly: The practising of a profession also means the exercising within the limits of professional ethical rules, of a degree of individuality and initiative. How much of this freedom can be exercised by the principal of a school&#x2014;let alone the ordinary teacher&#x2014;within the mass of red tape and ideological limits that represent the education structure of South Africa?</p>

<p>The child needs education to equip him for learning, but he also needs to develop a sense of social responsibility, of loyalty and of confidence. The child also seeks to achieve status and independence. He looks to success in the future and he looks to self-fulfilment. The teacher needs to serve as an example of these things. The pupil asks whether he who teaches, has achieved these ambitions for himself, and if he does not always see this in his teacher, it is not the teacher who has failed. It is the Government who has failed to create a profession in the true sense. This is what I believe to be the challenge facing the hon. the Minister. His predecessors have failed to meet that challenge and we hope that he will be able to meet it.</p>

<speech by="#clase">

<from><span class="col_7367-7368" refersTo="page_1014"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. CLASE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in my opinion no one can be an expert in all fields. Last Friday, while I was listening to the hon. member for Yeoville, I wondered why he had to be the first speaker of the PRP. Then I noticed that the hon. member for Rondebosch was not present and from this I concluded that the hon. member for Yeoville was probably delivering the speech of the hon. member for Rondebosch. What struck me, however, was that there were several things which the hon. member for Yeoville said which I could not believe the hon. member for Rondebosch would have said, because in my opinion he knows more about education than the hon. member for Yeoville does.</p>

<p>Today, however, the hon. member for Yeoville continued and made another shameful statement by suggesting that the policy of the Government would be instrumental in causing the teaching profession to move in a trade union direction. Now I want to give the hon. member for Yeoville the assurance that as long as he lives, he will never be able to free himself from that statement, at least, not as far as the teaching profession is concerned. As far as I am concerned, it was a tremendous insult to any teacher. I want to tell the hon. member that if he wants to do the teaching profession a service, and if he wants to serve education as such, he must refrain from speaking about education. It is very clear that he does not have the necessary background knowledge. If he had, he would not have made some of the statements which he made today. [Interjections.] Furthermore, I want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville that I find it a pity that he proceeded to launch an attack last Friday on the predecessor of the hon. the Minister of National Education, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, he had the authority, but he had an inability to act.</block>

<p>I think, Sir, that it is not fair to make this type of statement about a person in his absence, especially in the light of the fact that the hon. member definitely does not know what it took to reach this point, a stage which makes this a red letter day for every teacher, for the teachers&#x2019; associations and for the Federal Council.</p>

<p>Now I should like to deal with a few of the matters which were raised by the hon. member. In the first place I want to tell him that it is very dangerous to try to compare the teaching profession as such to the legal profession or to the medical profession. It is dangerous in the sense that the legal profession and the medical profession are made up of a group of people who have certain professional and academic qualifications. Once they have gained these qualifications they are a group on their own; they are their own employers, if I may put it like this. In contradistinction to that, we have the teaching profession, people who also have academic and professional qualifications but whose biggest, and, to a large extent, sole employer remains the provincial education departments and the Department of National Education. When we overlook this fact, we are unable to understand this legislation fully. When we deal with teachers&#x2019; qualifications, the reason why the Committee of Heads of Education has to lay down such qualifications, is that they are the employers of the people who qualify.</p>

<p>I also want to deal with the point that the teachers&#x2019; council should be open to all races. The hon. member for Durban Central also raised this point. It amazes me that the chief spokesman of the United Party, of the Official Opposition, a person who is a teaching man himself, should also have walked into this trap. I see on the Order Paper amendments in the name of the hon. member for Durban Central dealing with the omission of the word &#x201C;Whites&#x201D;. Surely, Sir, it is very clear from the reference to a teachers&#x2019; council for Whites, that we are dealing with a council which has to meet the demands of the White section of our population. White education has problems which are peculiar to itself, as have Black education and Coloured education. Moreover, Black teachers are employees of various departments. As from October they will be employees also of the Transkei. Within the White area they are employees of various departments, and of individual farmers on farms, for example, in the small Bantu schools in the rural areas. Therefore it is inconceivable that all these people can <span class="col_7369-7370" refersTo="page_1015"/>be brought together in a White teachers&#x2019; council with the objectives envisaged by this Bill.</p>

<p>One of the principal objectives of the teachers&#x2019; council is the drawing up of a code of conduct. Surely it is clear, Sir, that one cannot have various races together in a single council when the content of a code of conduct has to be decided? Surely it is inconceivable that such a code of conduct would satisfy the Whites as well as the Blacks and Coloureds. The different races have their different cultures and traditions and their different customs, which must inevitably have an effect on the code of conduct which is drawn up. Therefore I cannot but reject that argument with the contempt which it deserves.</p>

<p>There is also another reason why we cannot have representation for the different races on the teachers&#x2019; council. Let us look at teachers&#x2019; qualifications. We find that there were 62 879 Bantu teachers in 1974. Only 8 581 of them had a qualification higher than senior certificate, that is, senior certificate as well as a primary education certificate, senior certificate plus a secondary education certificate, or perhaps a degree. Only 13,6&#x0025; of all Bantu teachers had such post-matric training. Now can hon. members understand that if we were to allow only this 13,6&#x0025; to register with the professional teachers&#x2019; council, it would be discrimination of the worst degree against the remaining 86,4&#x0025; who cannot register. Surely, it is inconceivable for something like this to happen. Now it may immediately be said that the Government is to blame for the inadequate numbers of qualified people. However, I want to point out at once that the number of Bantu teachers doubled itself in the period from 1962 to 1974. The number of Bantu students, including those at the University of South Africa, increased from 1 637 to 7 866 in the period from 1957 to 1975. In other words, active steps are being taken in this regard. At this juncture, however, it is not possible to establish a teachers&#x2019; council catering for all the different race groups. A fine thing though, is that the possibility of co-operation between the professional White teachers&#x2019; council and councils which may be established for the other groups, is implicit in this very same legislation. Therefore, at some later stage consideration may be given to making provision for an umbrella body, a council catering for the needs of all the different races.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central also said that anyone could become a teacher at present without their being subject to the disciplinary measures of the teachers&#x2019; council as everybody did not have to have themselves registered. However, this is a half-truth, and it seems to me as though the hon. member did not do his homework very well. After all, it is very clear that this only applies to teachers who cannot be appointed in a full-time capacity. They will be able to teach&#x2014;we are very grateful for this&#x2014;without registering but they are not free from disciplinary measures as they are subject to the conditions of employment of their employer, as has been the case over the years. Consequently it is untrue to advocate that any person may become a teacher without that person being subject to any disciplinary measures whatsoever. But that is not all. The hon. member for Durban Central, as well as the hon. member for Yeoville, objected to the professional teachers&#x2019; council to be established, having advisory powers only. It is very clear to me that this must be so, and I say this, once again on the basis of the argument that these people differ from medical and legal men in that these men are their own employers while teachers are not. For this reason teachers have been asking over the years to have a say in matters affecting the teachers. We find this in this legislation.</p>

<p>We must not lose sight of the fact that there is a difference between a professional teachers&#x2019; council and a teachers&#x2019; association. The same difference is also found between the Medical Council and the Medical Association. The professional teachers&#x2019; council can be compared to the Medical Council. The teachers&#x2019; associations&#x2014;at the moment there are 12 which are recognized&#x2014;can be compared to the Medical Association. After all, it is very clear that the professional teachers&#x2019; council has as its objective the improvement of the status of the teaching profession and teachers, just as the concern of the Medical Council is the status of doctors. The concern of teachers&#x2019; associations, however, is the personal interests of their members, matters such as conditions of service, salaries, leave, etc. In the same way the Medical Association concerns itself with these things affecting its members.</p>

<p>Now, the hon. member for Yeoville waxed lyrical about teachers earning too little and <span class="col_7371-7372" refersTo="page_1016"/>about including the conditions of service of teachers in the functions of the professional teachers&#x2019; council. With all respect, I think in this the hon. member for Yeoville revealed his ignorance as well as the fact that he does not understand the Bill. This Bill seeks to establish a professional teachers&#x2019; council, a council which may guard over the status of teachers as such. It has nothing to do with conditions of service. The teachers&#x2019; associations are there for that purpose.</p>

<p>Since I am dealing with this, I want to say at once that in the end the professional teachers&#x2019; council will not be able to exist without the teachers&#x2019; associations. However, I have heard that there are some people who wonder what purpose of the teachers&#x2019; associations will serve after the teachers&#x2019; council has been established. It would be an evil day if the professional teachers&#x2019; council were to replace teachers&#x2019; associations. I want to point out that the professional teachers&#x2019; council is being established for the teachers by the teachers. At the moment we have 12 teachers&#x2019; associations and the second schedule lays down the basis for the representation of teachers&#x2019; associations on the teachers&#x2019; council. At the present moment the 12 teachers&#x2019; associations may elect 21 teachers to the council. In addition the five administrators have to nominate five teachers to the professional teachers&#x2019; council. The Minister has the right to nominate another person. Therefore, it is very clear that to the extent of 99&#x0025; the teachers&#x2019; council will consist of teachers, practising teachers. This is what teachers have been asking for all these years and this is what they will now find in the teachers&#x2019; council. Therefore it is important for the teachers&#x2019; associations to realize that their representation on the teachers&#x2019; council will be in proportion to their membership.</p>

<p>It is very important for every teacher, whatever province he may be in, to realize that all of them should be members of the various teachers&#x2019; associations, as their representation on the teachers&#x2019; council will be determined in proportion to the membership of their associations. Another thing, there is a world of difference between the functions of the teachers&#x2019; associations, as I indicated a moment ago, and the objectives of the professional teachers&#x2019; council. The two are not in conflict with each other, but in fact complementary to each other. Today I want to address a serious appeal to teachers in the Republic of South Africa to each and every one of them, to become, if at all possible, a member of a teachers&#x2019; association. In fact, it will be a happy day for me when compulsory membership of teachers&#x2019; associations is introduced. I know what problems attach to this. If compulsory membership of teachers&#x2019; associations becomes reality the day when there is talk in South Africa of a central system of education, I shall be very happy.</p>

<p>Now I want to come back to the Bill itself. What have teachers been asking for all these years and what have they been looking forward to? They wanted the establishment of a statutory body of teachers so that they might have a mouth-piece to put their case. They want to use a statutory body such as this so as to give them the necessary status. We have this in this Bill. The council, a statutory body, is being established with the very object of guarding over the status of the teacher. For the rest, they want representation on the council themselves.</p>

<p>As I said a moment ago in connection with the constitution of the council, we also find this in the Bill as it is before this House at the moment I want to add that we also find in this Bill provision for a professional code of conduct to be drawn up. This has always been felt as a shortcoming in education, i.e. the lack of a code of conduct binding everyone. Now we find, in terms of clause 15(1)(d), that such a code of conduct may be drawn up in concurrence with the Committee of Heads of Education. It is a good thing that this is so, because there is close liaison between the Committee of Heads of Education and the teachers as the teachers actually have to go and work there. Therefore it is important that such a code is to be drawn up in concurrence with the Committee of Heads of Education.</p>

<p>You should have a little more confidence in the teachers.</p>

<speech by="#clase">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. CLASE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, that hon. member dares to tell me that we should have more confidence in the teachers. If there is anyone who should not walk into the trap, it is that hon. member, because he made statements in this debate which definitely were not indicative of confidence in the teachers. Therefore he should not make an interjection like that. The issue here is not confidence in the teachers; it is that we are at least being sensible because <span class="col_7373-7374" refersTo="page_1017"/>we realize that we must work in close collaboration with others. What is more, Mr. Speaker, we also find in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 18 that an inquiry may be instituted into alleged contraventions of this professional code of conduct, and that certain punitive measures may be applied on conviction.</p>

<p>I also want to say that one of the most important measures in this legislation is clause 18(d), which clearly provides that this professional teachers&#x2019; council may advise the Minister in connection with the requirements for training and also in connection with the requirements for admission to a course for such training. In other words, it refers to selection. I want to point out to the hon. member for Durban Central that here, too, it is not a question of our not having confidence in the teachers. When teachers have been brought together in a body and can talk to the Committee of Heads of Education and ultimately negotiate with the Minister in connection with the requirements laid down for the teaching profession, we are satisfied. With due respect, to want to compare the professional teachers&#x2019; council to the National Education Council, as the hon. member for Durban Central wants to do, is to take the wrong point of view. These are two different bodies with totally different approaches and functions. This council is a council of teachers while the National Education Council is constituted of various bodies, in which possibly only four teachers may serve. Therefore, these two bodies have nothing to do with each other. I think that people are now being offered the opportunity to have a say, from the side of practical teaching, in matters affecting them.</p>

<p>Sir, we are also grateful that provision is made in this Bill for the necessary professional teachers&#x2019; qualifications, of which we find a definition in clause 1. We are grateful to have these summarized there. Furthermore, I want to say that the fact that every person who wants to enter the teaching profession in a full-time permanent capacity, must be registered, is a step in the right direction. Here the emphasis falls on people in a full-time, permanent capacity who already have the necessary teachers&#x2019; qualifications. Such people must register.</p>

<p>Then there is also another group which may be registered provisionally in terms of another clause. However, there remains a group of people who are attached to schools in a temporary capacity. I have in mind, for example, a person who has a B.A. degree and a subject like German III. A person like this may perhaps be approached to teach German because of the shortage of teachers. Such a person does not have a professional teacher&#x2019;s qualification and cannot qualify to register with the professional teachers&#x2019; council. However, a person like this may still provide excellent service. Those temporary people are not registered, but the point is, as I said at the beginning, that these people provide valuable services and are subject to certain disciplinary measures. To allow these people simply to register with the professional teachers&#x2019; council, would necessarily mean lowering the status of the profession, which we are seeking to raise by means of this legislation, in that we would be allowing people to register with this council without their having the necessary professional qualifications. For this reason they must unfortunately be prevented from registering.</p>

<p>I conclude. I want to agree with the hon. member for Durban Central that the status of the teachers will not be ensured by this professional teachers&#x2019; council alone. The teachers themselves will have to work to ensure their own status, day by day, as in the past and in the future too, by means of the quality of their teaching, their conduct at school and outside school as far as cultural matters are concerned, etc. The teacher himself therefore, has a task in connection with establishing his own status. It is also true that the community, too, has a special duty in connection with the establishment of the status of the teaching profession. Even if the teacher goes out of his way to do everything possible, even if we have a professional teachers&#x2019; council, and even if the Government offers better conditions of service&#x2014;which are necessary&#x2014;teaching as a profession, will regain the status which it had seven, eight, nine decades ago, only when there is an reorientation in the community in connection with who and what this profession is. Therefore I want to ask that the community accepts that the teaching profession is the profession which produces the scientists, people whom we need desperately. The teaching profession is the profession which produces the doctors, also people whom we need desperately. It is the profession which produces the farmer too, because we are living in times today when we <span class="col_7375-7376" refersTo="page_1018"/>no longer want the illiterate as farmer, but the scientific farmer. Only when that approach is there, in the community and the nation as such, shall we raise teaching to the level on which we should like to have it and give it the status which we should like it to have in the Republic.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Virginia speaks as a member of the teaching profession and he spoke enthusiastically in so far as most aspects of the Bill were concerned. However, when he referred to the code of conduct, he seemed to be quite satisfied with the arrangements which applied in terms of this Bill, namely the formulation and compilation of the code of conduct. But I believe he should look very carefully at clause 15 of the Bill. If he does, he will notice that the body envisaged by the Bill is in rather a weak position. The wording in the relevant clause is &#x201C;in concurrence with the Committee&#x201D;, viz. the Committee of Heads of Education. It is a weak position for any statutory body to find itself in, and I believe that the hon. member will have no difficulty at all in supporting the amendment put forward by my colleague the hon. member for Durban Central, wherein he seeks to put this body in a stronger position by the insertion of the words &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D;. The hon. member for Virginia also sought to make comparisons between the Medical Association and the teachers&#x2019; associations. I believe that in that respect his remarks are valid, but when he comes to the question of trying to equate the statutory teachers&#x2019; association, being created by this Bill, with the Medical Council, there is just no comparison. I should like to refer him to some of the powers which the Medical Council have, which to me seem singularly absent from any suggestion in this Bill. The Medical Council can appoint examiners, they can approve of training schools and they can recognize or reject any qualifications. They have vast powers as a statutory body.</p>

<p>The hon. member clearly indicated that he did not regard the Medical Council as being comparable to this statutory body, and here I agree with him. I shall come back to that a little later. But even if he takes the powers of the Nursing Council&#x2014;and I believe that this is a profession which can compare more closely with that of the teaching profession&#x2014;he will see that they have powers to appoint examiners and moderators, to approve of training-schools, to undertake inspections of hospitals, etc. I see nothing in this Bill which gives this teachers&#x2019; statutory body that sort of authority or power.</p>

<p>My colleague, the hon. member for Durban Central, has given a very concise exposition of the UP attitude to this Bill. He indicated, as other speakers have, that approaches from the teaching profession have covered a number of years. He referred to the 1964 draft Bill, and he also indicated that he considered that the Bill at present before us was a compromise between the teachers and the Department of Education. In this respect I believe that he is absolutely right.</p>

<p>I now want to come to some of the remarks made by the hon. member for Algoa. Unfortunately he does not seem to be in the House at the moment. He said the Bill enjoyed his &#x201C;voile ondersteuning&#x201D;. Then he went on to say that it did not provide some of the requirements laid down, by the teaching profession I take it. He also drew attention to some &#x201C;onbillikhede teenoor onderwysers&#x201D; and referred particularly to existing legislation and ordinances. Then he indicated that there were some other weak points which he regarded as being of minor importance. The hon. member for Algoa led me to expect that he would join the UP in submitting amendments to the Bill during the Committee Stage in order to overcome some of the weaknesses which he believed existed in the present Bill and in order to strengthen the status of the teaching profession as a whole. I say this because, unless my memory serves me wrongly, during this session, almost for the first time during my 15 years in Parliament, members of the Government party have exercised their right to bring forward amendments. They did so in respect of some Bills during this session. I therefore wonder why the hon. member for Algoa did not seek to improve the Bill which he criticized, albeit very mildly. It was nevertheless criticism. I think the hon. member for Algoa and his colleagues have shown a reluctance to come out and fight for improvements for the teaching profession, thereby missing the first real opportunity they have had to assist in the formation of a statutory body over the last 40 years. This has left the initiative to the Official Opposition and, as the Order Paper reveals, we in the UP have not shirked our responsibility in <span class="col_7377-7378" refersTo="page_1019"/>seeking to make this Bill as effective and efficient as possible.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member for Algoa, in his absence, what he had in mind when he made his speech. Did he feel that this Bill did not provide the teaching profession with the autonomy of expression which it requested? I must confess that is the impression I gained from his speech. Does he feel that the National Education Policy Act, No. 39 of 1967, and the amending Act of 1969, should be re-examined and amended? He did not say so, but does he feel that they should be amended in order to bring the thinking in this Bill in line with the intentions of those Acts? Does he feel that this teachers&#x2019; council will not be meaningful until it has had a greater share, in scope and powers, in the control of standards in teacher training? Does he feel that the composition of the National Education Council should again be revised to provide for a more balanced council with less emphasis on teacher training? If that were done, this teachers&#x2019; council could become much more meaningful. He had the opportunity to raise these matters, but he did not do so. I trust he will assist us in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The delay in introducing this Bill is to be regretted. It has taken so many years to arrive at a conclusion and to decide to bring this Bill before the House of Assembly. It is a straightforward, uncomplicated and in many respects a non-contentious Bill, and yet it has been backwards and forwards, over the years, between the State and the teaching organizations. In my mind&#x2019;s eye I can go back to 1962 when I had the honour of serving on the Select Committee which dealt with the National Education Advisory Council Bill. Despite the glowing prediction made by the then Minister, Senator Jan de Klerk, it was found necessary, with almost monotonous regularity, to amend the Act. He spoke of the council and the work it would perform, and yet within five years, in 1967, he had to amend the Act and constitute a new council. We then had the teachers&#x2019; crisis.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>In 1967-&#x2019;68. The Government then appointed a Select Committee on the training of teachers. The Select Committee, on which I had the honour also to serve, was converted into a commission. The commission submitted a Bill. Obviously the intention of that particular Bill was to emphasize the training of teachers. However, a new national council was established. It is interesting to refer to the report of the commission of 1969. The short title of the Bill which was submitted by the commission read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To provide for the establishment of a national professional council for the training of teachers.</block>

<p>I believe the events which have taken place since then have led to the establishment of this council for Whites.</p>

<p>I want to refer to some of the clauses, because I believe it would be relevant to do so in the light of the amendments which we intend moving and which appear on the Order Paper. Firstly, I want to refer to the objects of the council. I believe the wording of this particular clause must surely be a disappointment to the teaching profession as a whole because the words which are used are so mild&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object of the council shall be to uphold and promote esteem for education and the teaching profession and the prestige of those who are engaged in the teaching profession.</block>

<speech by="#clase">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. CLASE</person>:</from>

<p>Which clause is that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 3. I realize this is a far cry from the consolidated report to the National Advisory Education Council because a survey of the attitude of teachers indicated that teachers in general felt that the authorities could raise the status of teachers by establishing a teaching council which would be vested with the same authority and functions as the S.A. Medical Council. It was felt that such a teaching council could improve the teachers&#x2019; position. Frankly, I believe that that was rather an ambitious thought. The hon. member for Virginia has already indicated that there are vast differences between the functions and purposes of the S.A. Medical Council and a teaching council. I agree that that is the position.</p>

<p>It has generally been agreed during this debate that the teachers themselves are in a unique position since the majority of them are either in the employ of the central Government <span class="col_7379-7380" refersTo="page_1020"/>or that of the provincial administrations. I suggest that if one wants to look for any equivalent form or comparison, one has to refer to the S.A. Nursing Council, because in my opinion the Nursing Council represents a profession which comprises many professional people who render service to the central Government or to the provincial administrations.</p>

<p>However, we cannot deal with clause 3 in isolation; we must consider it together with clause 15 which deals with &#x201C;registration, keeping of register, and payment of registration and annual fees and code of conduct&#x201D;. This is where I believe the autonomy of this council is strictly limited, because we have the provision that the code of conduct must be framed in concurrence with the Committee of Heads of Education.</p>

<p>Carrying on from clauses 3 and 15, I come to clause 18 which deals with the powers of the council. It provides that the council can institute inquiries, impose penalties and it can advise on training. It would therefore appear that, although after many years the teachers are now being granted a Bill that provides statutory recognition of their organization, as a council they will find themselves subservient to the Committee of Heads and to the National Education Council.</p>

<p>I now wish to refer briefly to clause 4, which deals with the constitution of the council. According to the Bill, one member, who will not necessarily be a teacher, will be appointed by the Minister, five teachers will be appointed members by the different Administrators and other persons will be appointed by the teachers&#x2019; associations from their own ranks, such persons having been elected on the basis specified in Schedule 2. I submit that it is of interest to compare this with the Nursing Act, which in effect limits the membership of the council established in terms of that Act. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he considers this limitation imposed in the Nursing Act, which lays down that members of the relevant council will be limited to South African citizens. There is no such provision in this Bill. South Africa has called upon the services of teachers from overseas and I believe that these teachers have rendered signal service to the profession in the work they have done. I believe, too, that some of these, having enjoyed the benefits of this country, have become South African citizens. However, I believe it is also true that some have retained their ties with their countries of origin and were not prepared to identify themselves fully with South Africa by becoming South African citizens. I suggest that, when we are dealing with the highest statutory body in the land as far as the teaching profession is concerned, we would do well to consider whether those people who have had ample opportunity to claim South African citizenship but have not done so, should be eligible for election to this council.</p>

<p>The composition of the council envisages a larger council than that provided for in previous legislation. In view of the fact that 12 teachers&#x2019; associations are already listed in Schedule 1, the minimum representation from that source will be 12. However, estimates show that the total membership of the council, including the five teachers appointed by the Administrators and the person appointed by the Minister, could well be as many as 30 members. The point I want to make as regards this particular aspect is that, whereas one person is appointed to represent the Minister and five to represent the provinces, I believe some provision should be made for the appointment of alternates in respect of the appointment by the Minister, the appointments by the Administrators and the members elected by the associations. I believe that, if the council is to be fully functional, it should at all times be fully represented. Therefore, if provision were made for alternates to attend when elected or appointed members are unable to attend, this goal could be achieved. In my humble opinion this is a deficiency in the Bill. I believe that there is a valid argument for the necessity of provision being made for alternates. The great majority of members of this council are teachers. After years of service such teachers elected by the associations are entitled to long leave. As a result of that, they may be unable to attend statutory or special meetings. Therefore I would ask the hon. the Minister to view the amendment we have put forward in this respect sympathetically. I should also like to point out to him that a number of very good precedents can be found in existing legislation where provision is made for either permissive permission, or obligatory permission for the appointment of alternates to act in the place of members appointed by virtue of their particular qualifications.</p>

<p>There are other amendments on the Order <span class="col_7381-7382" refersTo="page_1021"/>Paper which we on this side of the House will in due course place before the Minister for his consideration. However, I have dealt with those which I felt should be enlarged upon at this stage in order that the Minister would have an opportunity to consider the motive which prompted us to move those particular amendments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#swanepoel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">K. D. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Berea had a great deal to say about the amendments placed on the Order Paper by hon. members of the Official Opposition. Those amendments will be dealt with during the Committee Stage by the hon. the Minister. The hon. member will therefore excuse me if I do not react further to his speech, although in the course of my speech I shall in fact refer to certain matters which he mentioned.</p>

<p>Before confining myself to certain aspects of the Bill before us, I deem it necessary to consider a few elements which underline the urgency and the necessity for this Bill. Primarily this Bill concerns the teacher, his position and his place in the community. The teacher is the preceptor and educator and is central to this Bill. The Bill can therefore be seen as an instrument by which the teacher may take his rightful place in the community. However, a fact we must bear in mind is that in past years, teachers have been leaving the teaching profession in increasing numbers. This applies to both male and female teachers. They have taken up new employment, mainly in the private sector.</p>

<p>Now it is true, unfortunately, that the teaching profession lends itself to this. A teacher is an academically trained person who is particularly attractive to both the private and the public sectors. Both these sectors need people with an academic training with a view to the performance of certain duties. Furthermore the public and the private sectors offer substantially higher remuneration than that available in the teaching profession. They also concentrate in particular on the more experienced teacher; on those who have been teaching for some time. The offers are made so attractive that many teachers are unable&#x2014;from an economic point of view&#x2014;to refuse them. What is the result? A good and well-trained teacher who is already facing a matric class or is ready to take over that class, gives notice, and within three months the school in question is stranded without a mathematics, physics and chemistry, English or other teacher, and a widespread search for a replacement to fill that vacancy has to be instituted.</p>

<p>What happens in most cases is that such vacancies are filled by people with less training and less experience. This necessarily has a detrimental effect on pupils&#x2019; achievements. During 1974, 2 539 teachers left teaching in the Transvaal. 1 978 of these resigned. The balance of 561 left teaching owing to retirement, death or dismissal. What is of importance is that of the 1 978 teachers who left teaching, 1 545 were women and 433 were men. It may be accepted, in all reasonableness, that those men entered a different occupation, a different profession or a different business. The same undoubtedly applies to a large percentage of the women who resigned from the teaching profession.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1975 only 162 men entered teaching in the Transvaal&#x2014;that is to say, a drop of 271 in the number of trained male teachers whose services have to be done without. This causes teachers to find themselves in the situation where they face a class and have to teach a subject for which they are not, in fact, fully trained. I want to refer, too, to the statistics mentioned by the hon. member for Yeoville. The MEC in charge of education in the Transvaal, Mr. Van der Merwe Brink, said in the course of a reply in the Transvaal Provincial Council that the number of teachers teaching subjects for which they were not fully trained was as follows: Mathematics 35&#x0025;, physics and chemistry 50&#x0025; and biology 49&#x0025;, to mention only three subjects. What is still more important is that the position with regard to teachers teaching in Std. VI and VII is the following: Mathematics 55&#x0025;, general science 54&#x0025; and biology 65&#x0025;. A popular conclusion is that the salary structure is the primary cause of this trend. That is why we are grateful that something positive is being done about the salary structure of the teacher in order to place this profession, too, on a competitive basis. But, Sir, the solution is certainly not as obvious and simple as that. Teaching is a profession with a claim to professional recognition. That is why we have this legislation before us. Education is just as little a subdivision of the overall administration of the State as is the medical profession or the engineering profession, or any other profession. The medical profession and the legal <span class="col_7383-7384" refersTo="page_1022"/>profession, <i>inter alia,</i> are characterized and identified by their distinctiveness. Members of these professions are distinguished by a prefix to the name of the practitioner of the professions concerned. In medicine it is &#x201C;doctor&#x201D;, for lawyers &#x201C;advocate&#x201D;, for clergymen &#x201C;reverend&#x201D;, etc. The teachers do not seek such titles, or is this perhaps an idea which could be pondered? The teacher must be accepted by society and the community as that important figure in our community who sees to the training and education of the children. Sir, it is a matter of deep concern to the teacher that he knows that he or she has lost his or her true value as an educator in the eyes of the community.</p>

<p>The community, and the parents in particular, see the present-day teacher merely as an official of the State, as someone who is employed by the State and remunerated by the State to get his child through matric with the greatest possible success. Then when the child achieves good results and passes one standard after the other with flying colours, the good qualities and achievements of father and mother&#x2019;s dear child are bruited abroad. Then it is the child who has achieved such wonderful success. But when that same dear Johnnie&#x2014;let us call him Johnnie, like the hon. member for Durban Central&#x2014;does not make the desired progress, if his achievements deteriorate, then it is the fault of the teacher. All the blame is laid at his door, without reservation; he gets all the blame, and even in the presence of the child the teacher is disparaged and belittled. In the meantime, what is the result? The child is in a situation which he believes to be the fault of the teacher. But he forgets that it is he himself who has not done his homework properly and that it is he himself who did not prepare himself properly for the test or an examination. No, it is Sir&#x2019;s fault, because father and mother said so. Then, when this child grows up, when he has to choose a career, what is he going to choose? All the professions are put before him, medicine, law, engineering, the church, etc. However, teaching is not even considered as a possibility, because was it not the teacher who was the cause of his achieving such poor results? Nor is education considered as a possible choice of career by the good Johnnie, the Johnnie who has achieved good results, because he has never taken the role played by the teacher in his achievements, into account. I want to make a very urgent appeal to our parents today to be careful and judicious when discussing teachers, particularly when the children are present. It is they who are first and foremost in a position to afford status to the teaching profession. Criticism of the work of the teacher belongs in the office of the head of the school, and not at table where the children are present.</p>

<p>The same goes for achievements on the sportsfield. When the achievements are good, they are the child&#x2019;s achievements, but when they are poorer, then it is the responsibility of the school or the teacher. More and more people are saying that the teacher must be dissociated from extramural activities. It would be an evil day if the teacher, as an educator, no longer had the opportunity to meet his children outside the classroom. This applies to the sportsfield and camps where he is able to perform real work of education. No right-thinking and inspired teacher would want to give that up. There are two factors in particular which are giving rise to a growing antagonism with regard to extramural activities. In the first place it is due to a lack of sufficient men in education. This has resulted in the available male staff being overloaded with extramural activities. As a result he has to neglect almost all his activities or only attend to them in a haphazard fashion. Contact with pupils outside the classroom then becomes a burden for him, and the element of education outside the classroom is lost.</p>

<p>A second aspect responsible for the building up of antagonism towards extramural activities is the recent craze that has developed at certain schools, viz. so-called specialization in regard to sporting activities in particular. An athletic meeting or rugby league match has to be won at all costs. Specialization has become the watchword. If a school is going to specialize in athletics time is spent on coaching, month in and month out, day in and day out, almost day and night. If a headmaster should decide that certain athletic achievements would publicize the name of his school, then parents are dragged in, prestige meetings are presented and the teacher is the one who has to bend over backwards and ensure that the children are given the necessary coaching.</p>

<p>They become stale from too much coaching and are driven to provide the children with the necessary specialized coaching. At these schools &#x201C;win&#x201D; has become the watchword. As <span class="col_7385-7386" refersTo="page_1023"/>a result, the teacher, instead of enjoying athletics with the pupils and doing educational work, is steamrollered into producing achievements and yet more achievements. I want to voice my wholehearted agreement with the statement by Mr. H. C. Botha, chairman of the Federal Council, to the effect that the teacher does not mind working hard and working long hours, as long as he knows that what he is doing is professional work. To this I want to add &#x201C;and as long as it is also of an educational nature&#x201D;. I therefore take it amiss of the PRP for having disparaged teachers, through one of their floor-crossing colleagues in the Transvaal Provincial Council, the member for Edenvale, when he said the following in the provincial council at the beginning of the year (Vol. 160, p. 159)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that most teachers with whom I come into contact are among the worst advertisements for the teaching profession in the Transvaal.</block>

<p>I take it amiss of him that he disparages teachers in this way, because it is not true. I place a far higher premium on today&#x2019;s teachers than does the hon. member for Durban Central. We should just ensure that the teacher of today, like the teacher of the past, should be eager to carry out the task of training and educating the child. Circumstances outside the teacher&#x2019;s control to which I have already referred have, however, caused the task to become an almost impossible one, measured in terms of the available manpower. The legislation before us is the first tangible step to have education legally recognized as a profession. It brings education into line with other professions, for example the Medical Council. The primary aim is to allow education as a profession to take its place as an equal alongside the other professions and to assign to education its true value as an essential function. Consequently it is only right that the teacher should be obliged to register with the Teachers&#x2019; Council. The teacher will therefore stand before the class as a full-fledged professional person, bound to a certain code of conduct.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Virginia said, and appeal to teachers not to withdraw from the teachers&#x2019; associations in view of the compulsory registration with the Teachers&#x2019; Council. It would be an evil day if teachers were to follow the new and abandon the old. To retain a say in the Teachers&#x2019; Council, viz. the right to participate in the election of the members of the council, a teacher has to be a member of a teachers&#x2019; association. They must not deny themselves this right but must remain members of their various teachers&#x2019; associations.</p>

<p>It is with a sense of deep gratitude to the teaching profession that I wholeheartedly support the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, the hon. member for Gezina, made a sound and important speech this afternoon. I can associate myself wholeheartedly with what he said and consequently I want to congratulate him on his speech. To the figure mentioned by the hon. member in regard to the resignation of men from education in the Transvaal, I may add that the number of resignations rose from 125 in 1971 to 433 in 1975. This fact undoubtedly forces one to the realization that it is essential that a penetrating investigation of education and the teaching of our children in the Republic of South Africa be carried out, as the NP Government is doing.</p>

<p>By way of background I should like to say that it is accepted as axiomatic that &#x201C;the training and the instruction of the young for the business of life, is one of the most ancient concerns of mankind&#x201D;. When we look up this subject in history books, we find that among the ancient Israelites, education was characterized by a strong national pride which arose out of the knowledge that their God was the only true God, and this resulted in the demand for the education of every chosen child. The highest imaginable demands were set for teachers. They were carefully selected and well trained. If we look at an earlier period, we find the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Protagoras&#x2019; theory, the State appeared to be the spring of all educational energy, or, in fact, one huge educational organization.</block>

<p>In Pericles&#x2019;s <i>Conception of the State</i> one reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; culminates similarly in the declaration that the State is the great educative force.</block>

<p><span class="col_7387-7388" refersTo="page_1024"/>If we take a look at the Greeks, we see&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Hellenes were to build a mighty civilization whose cultural achievements still astound and amaze modern man. What is the secret of the greatness of the Hellenes?</block>

<p>The author who asks the question, states that the Hellenes&#x2019; secret of success was to be found in the special attention they gave to the education of their children. I want to mention a further fact. If, in the circumstances of this period of our history in which South Africa finds itself at present, one considers what has happened in other countries over the centuries, we find it striking that throughout history, when there have been periods of major reform, periods of major decisions which had to be taken, boom conditions in education played a decisive role in the decisive years in the life of each of those nations. That is why it is so essential that we must ensure, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves at present, that all is well with the education of our children and education in our country.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to digress too much at this point, but looking at the position in Russia, we find that for them, education is the most important instrument with which to achieve national aims. They therefore see to it that the necessary financial means are made available to that instrument with which they achieve their aims. Closer home, looking at the position against the background of the necessity for all to be well as regards the education of our children and for any faults there may be to be rectified, I say that there is one thing we must not fail to bear in mind, and that is that in the midst of the constant renewal which must take place in education, stability must be maintained. I have said that there must be constant renewal in education. We are jointly striving to achieve this very aim by way of all the bodies involved in education, because strength is only to be found in co-operation, there should be no doubt on that score. The world is experiencing a rapid increase in knowledge, and this applies to the Republic of South Africa, too, and that rapid increase in itself causes a lack of stability which leads to a lack of confidence. It would be an evil day for the Republic of South Africa&#x2014;bearing in mind that renewal in education must take place&#x2014;if we were not to succeed in bringing about and ensuring stability as well.</p>

<p>Looking at this Bill, it is encouraging to see that after so many years it has in fact been possible to progress up to this point.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think we are all agreed on one thing, and that is that this Bill is by no means perfect, but that it is a welcome measure which is certainly necessary.</p>

<p>*Hon. members opposite have tried to maintain that it is a simple matter to come to the House of Assembly with this legislation. Sir, that is far from being the case. It is not such a simple matter, and it is for that very reason that it has taken so long to bring it here. Why is this so? It is so because interest organizations in education, such as the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Association and the Committee of Heads of Education, have been built up over more than 100 years. Over the years, legal authority has been vested in the National Education Council. No sensible person could simply wipe off the map what has been built up over more than a century, and put something half-baked in its place. It therefore after a very difficult process that this legislation has been brought to this House. It had to be drafted in co-operation with all these interested organizations in education. If we had not been able to succeed in obtaining the co-operation of all these organizations, such as the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations&#x2014;which consists of teachers and has also been established by those people&#x2014; and also the Committee of Heads of Education, then surely we should surely have been unable to bring about progress and renewal in education. We should then simply have brought about chaos in education, and I should like to see the political party which could avoid that then.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. As the hon. member says, the principle of continuity had to be taken into account. What is actually very encouraging is that the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, the Committee of Heads of Education and my department and I all reached agreement on the Bill at present before the House. This is an extremely important point and must not be lost sight of.</p>

<p><span class="col_7389-7390" refersTo="page_1025"/></p>

<p>Various hon. members <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. members for Durban Central, Berea, Yeoville and Pietermaritzburg North, have said that this Bill does not vest sufficient powers in this Teachers&#x2019; Council. Sir, I could have agreed with the hon. members. The hon. member for Algoa, too, said that he would have liked to see the Teachers&#x2019; Council being given more extensive powers. Let us take a sober look at this matter for a moment. Hon. members must listen now, because if they understand what I say now, then it will assist us a great deal when we come to the amendments in the Committee Stage. I should very much like to accept as many of the amendments as I possibly can. I shall also try to do so. But there must be no mistake about certain things. If hon. members tell me that we must give this new council all the powers for which the hon. members are asking, and which we too would have liked to give this council, but in the process we flout the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations and cause difficulty with them or flout the Committee of Heads of Education and cause difficulty with them, then surely that would not be the sober and correct method of approach. We have the full cooperation of the Committee of Heads of Education and the Federal Council with regard to the Bill and we are very, very grateful for that. We are here engaged in a process of renewal, of evolution, of development in so far as this filters through to education. That is why I have not the slightest doubt that when the Bill becomes law and the council has been established, these three bodies, viz. the new teachers&#x2019; council, the Committee of Heads of Education and the Federal Council, will convene&#x2014;I shall assist them to do so&#x2014;and, with the necessary insight, determine jointly what additional powers and functions are to be entrusted to the Teachers&#x2019; Council. The council will therefore grow in status, achieve a position and will, in fact, be in a position to comply with the high expectations which are cherished for it. It will then be able to succeed in making the teaching profession more attractive and in inspiring respect for the teaching profession among the public. It will also be able to succeed in emphasizing this event, namely that this is the first time a statutory body is being established for the teachers, one with the necessary capacity and powers which are a natural outcome of the circumstances of our country, and have not been imposed from above with malice and unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Most hon. members raised certain points to which I should like to reply further. I want to point out that in 1969 and even later&#x2014;one can consult Hansard&#x2014;there were debates in this House, not about a teachers&#x2019; council, but about a registration council for teachers. That was the furthest we had allowed ourselves to think at that stage. At that time hon. members opposite asked for a registration council for teachers. That registration council&#x2014;hon. members can consult Hansard&#x2014;would have had such limited functions that the approach was that it would not be worthwhile to bring into being a statutory body of this kind. That was one of the reasons why this matter was delayed for so many years and why it was not attended to sooner. Hon. members must not, therefore, underestimate the importance of concluding the necessary agreement with the other bodies and with the Administrators of the four provinces. Up to the present&#x2014;and hon. members must take this into account when they move their amendments&#x2014;such good progress has been made that we have now been able to establish a Teachers&#x2019; Council&#x2014;not a registration council for teachers, but a council with important functions and powers. I repeat that perhaps they are not the best powers we could give the council&#x2014;that is still to come&#x2014;but nevertheless important powers and functions. A start has therefore been made with this process of evolution, and this process will be continued. I ask hon. members opposite not to want to cause this fruit to ripen prematurely. Give it a chance. If we do so we shall really make rapid and good progress. I know what I am talking about when I say this.</p>

<p>Now I want to point out something which the hon. members have apparently not perceived, and it seems to me that each of the Opposition speakers has fallen into this trap. To be specific, there is a big difference between a council and an association. The Teachers&#x2019; Council is the body which is concerned with the training and the ethical conduct of the teacher, viz. with the professional status of the teacher. Comparisons have been drawn here, and I do not mind comparisons being drawn just as long as an effort is not made, as some hon. members have tried to do, to disparage the Teachers&#x2019; Council in advance. I do not think that is fair. The <span class="col_7391-7392" refersTo="page_1026"/>Medical Council, too, has similar functions with regard to the people in the medical profession. On the other hand, the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, just like the Medical Association, is concerned with the conditions of service, salaries and associated interests of the teaching group. In my opinion hon. members have therefore made a mistake by drawing comparisons which do not hold water. They must compare the Medical Association with the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations and the Medical Council with this Teachers&#x2019; Council. The first two are concerned with the status of the various professions and the latter two with questions of salary, conditions of service and related matters.</p>

<p>Agreement has been reached with the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations in regard to the legislation as it reads at present. It is therefore a measure that has been agreed on. Consequently I cannot simply go ahead and make a large number of fundamental changes to this legislation without referring back to the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations and the Committee of Heads of Education to ask them whether they agree with the amendments. There will be amendments in any event, because we want to give the Teachers&#x2019; Council more powers. However, we cannot do so unilaterally, viz. without consulting the other bodies as well.</p>

<p>The third point raised here is the issue of teacher training. Section 1 of the National Education Policy Act of 1967 defines teacher training as a function of the Committee of Heads of Education. Hon. members fail entirely to take this into account. The Act states that the Committee of Heads of Education has that function. Consequently I cannot accept amendments here or adopt an attitude ignoring this and adopting a new course without that Act being amended. Thus far the Committee of Heads of Education has controlled and co-ordinated training and this function cannot, therefore, suddenly be taken away from it without further ado, and vested in another body. Clause 18(d) was formulated as it reads at present after negotiation. When the Teachers&#x2019; Council has been established, further consultation may take place. I can give the hon. members the assurance now that further consultation will in fact take place in order to give the Teachers&#x2019; Council greater responsibility and powers in regard to training, if it is possible to come to an agreement on that score.</p>

<p>Next I want to refer to the hon. member for Yeoville and other hon. members who raised certain points with regard to greater powers for the Teachers&#x2019; Council. I shall bring to the attention of that council, the Committee of Heads of Education and the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, all the points raised by this side of the House and by that side of the House in the course of this debate relating to greater powers for the Teachers&#x2019; Council. I shall bring it to their attention so that they, and we, may consider how to vest greater powers in this council as soon as possible. I agree that if this council has the right powers as a statutory body, its future will be assured.</p>

<p>We must also bear in mind that amendments to the Education Act of 1967 which, in my opinion, there will certainly be, will have to be carefully considered. Just recently, I conducted negotiations with regard to where teachers are to be trained, for example. Amendments to this legislation at this stage will seriously delay that process, which is of the utmost importance as regards allowing the teaching profession to take its rightful place in the administration of our country. This can only be to the detriment of teacher training.</p>

<p>There is a fourth point which virtually all hon. members opposite have raised. I refer to the issue of the protection of the interests of the teacher. The most important interests of the teacher lie in security of employment, and protection of this is largely the responsibility of the Federal Council. We must not fail to bear this in mind. If the employer were to take action against the teacher as a result of unethical conduct, viz. infringement of the code, this would not restrict the Council from intervening in the interests of the teacher, because that would be exceeding the functions of the council.</p>

<p>It has also been argued that the code of conduct must be drafted by the council only and without the approval of the Committee of Heads of Education. Clause 15(1)(d) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council shall with the concurrence of the committee, draw up a professional code of conduct&#x2026;</block>

<p>The Teachers&#x2019; Council therefore takes the initiative in drafting it. It is therefore unnecessary for hon. members to condemn the fact. <span class="col_7393-7394" refersTo="page_1027"/>Since a dividing line has to be found in the functions of the employer and those of the council, it is of cardinal importance that an agreement or concurrence be reached; if not, it will be to the detriment of the Teachers&#x2019; Council, as sure as we are sitting here. It was necessary for me to negotiate with the Administrators with regard to the Bill. The hon. members are apparently unaware that the South Africa Act of 1910 entrusted the whole issue of education to the provinces. In view of this, surely I cannot introduce a Bill such as this in the House without having consulted the Administrators on the matter. When I negotiated with the Administrators, it came to light that certain Administrators-in-Executive-Committee even felt that the code should be agreed to at Administrator level. Therefore the question may well be asked whether the provincial councils should not be consulted, since ordinances have to be accepted by those councils. The code of conduct could very easily affect the ordinances. This matter is therefore not nearly as simple as hon. members in those benches seem to think.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North referred to the issue of the registration of teachers or persons employed by private schools and the hon. member for Yeoville, too, made mention of this. I want to point out to hon. members that there are two kinds of private schools, viz. the State-supported private schools and private schools without any financial support from the State. The State-supported private schools are included in the definition of &#x201C;school&#x201D; and the provisions of the Bill therefore apply to the teachers at such schools. Since entirely private schools are in many cases jealous of their independence&#x2014; hon. members themselves know to what extent they are jealous of it&#x2014;their teaching staff is not obliged to register. They are not forced to register. However there is nothing in the legislation which prohibits voluntary registration. Nothing prevents the teachers of schools which do not receive a subsidy from registering; they can do so of their own free will. The Bill does not place a restriction on who or what the council may register. It merely provides who has to register in order to be appointed to a full-time permanent post in the employ of the central Government or the provincial administrations. I hope the position is now very clear to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North. Registration means that the person registered is qualified to be appointed to a full-time permanent capacity. Although registration does not bind the State to appoint a person on a permanent basis, there could be a clash between the employer and the council if the council were to register people in a manner not consistent with the provisions of the legislation. It has always been the intention to eliminate such cases by way of negotiation. I hope the position is clear to the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville raised certain points to which I should like to reply. He said that the council should lay down a certain code of conduct. I say that the Bill very clearly makes provision for this in clause 15(1)(d), but for reasons I have already explained, this must be done in co-operation with the Committee of Heads of Education. The council must have a say with regard to the qualifications of the profession and it must also have a say with regard to the type of training, as the hon. member stated. I say to the hon. member that clause 18(d) provides for this since the council may furnish advice or make recommendations. At this stage the approval of qualifications is another function of the Committee of Heads of Education and the Minister determines the policy with regard to teacher training. However, as soon as the Teachers&#x2019; Council has been set up, attention can be given to greater powers for the council and the resultant amendment of clause 1. For the reasons I have already explained, it will be a case of putting the cart before the horse if we were to consider amending the Bill at this stage with a view to vesting greater powers in the council. We must afford the council the opportunity to function and conduct the necessary discussions with interested bodies such as the Federal Council and the Committee of Heads of Education. I therefore want to tell the hon. member that certain disciplinary powers relating to the profession, and the vital code of conduct in particular, will undoubtedly be vested in this Teachers&#x2019; Council. The hon. member also asked that the council should have a say in respect of levels of income. Let me again say to the hon. member&#x2014;if we understand each other now, we shall not need to make long speeches about it in the Committee Stage&#x2014; that the fact of the matter is that this is not a function of the Medical Council, or the Nursing Council either. The issue of the income of teachers must be left to the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, just as <span class="col_7395-7396" refersTo="page_1028"/>similar matters are the task of the Medical Association and the Nursing Association and not of the Medical Council and the Nursing Council. Hon. members must please bear this distinction in mind because it is clear from some of the arguments that they have failed to do so. In this regard we cannot get past the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, because it is their task to negotiate for salary structures, salary conditions, conditions of service and so on. Surely we cannot have two bodies in education with similar functions, because this would cause clashes. I hope this is clear to the hon. members.</p>

<p>The hon. member went on to argue that the teachers&#x2019; council would have to take an active part in furthering the profession. I can tell the hon. member that that aim is included in the objects of the council as set out in clause 3. The council will play an active part with regard to the most important aspect of the profession, an aspect which has been extremely widely stated, viz. to promote the status of the teacher in South Africa. The Teachers&#x2019; Council therefore has a tremendous opportunity to concern itself directly with the profession.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred specifically to clauses 16 and 20. Let me tell the hon. member at once that these two clauses do not clash with each other in any way. Clause 16 provides that the Committee of Heads of Education first has to designate a post before there can be a permanent appointment of someone who does not possess a professional qualification. Clause 20, on the other hand, places a restriction on teaching, but it does not relate to provisional registration. The problems which the hon. member apparently foresees are not serious ones and will be solved by the various heads of education. For example, anyone could start by being appointed on a temporary basis and then, after provisional registration, could be appointed on a permanent basis. This could be retrospective. In cases which are not urgent, the person could first be asked to register provisionally. Therefore those two clauses do not clash in any way as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>I think I have now replied to all the general points raised. There is only one more to which I want to refer. Hon. members of both Opposition parties objected to the fact that this council had been established for Whites only. In point of fact, this matter amounts to a difference in policy. All I can say to hon. members is that we foresee that similar councils will be established for other population groups in South Africa. In clause 18(g) I saw to it that the necessary provision was made for the education council for Whites to co-operate with other councils or institutions in an umbrella or co-ordinating council in which members of the other population groups could serve. Hon. members opposite asked whether it would not have a harmful effect on the teaching profession if the Teachers&#x2019; Council were to be for Whites only.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Virginia, and other hon. members on this side, too, advanced outstanding arguments to indicate that in fact it would be to the detriment of the profession to ripen the fruit prematurely in this respect while the qualifications of the various population groups were still far from comparable. This would result in one acting as a brake on the other. That is why the correct approach is to establish a Teachers&#x2019; Council for Whites and to provide that similar councils may be established for other population groups, after which an umbrella or co-ordinating council could be established if there was a need for it. It is therefore very sensible of us at this early stage to make provision in law, in clause 18(g), for effecting co-operation in the event of such a situation arising. I therefore want to express the hope that this legislation will be an important milestone in the process whereby the teaching profession in South Africa is accorded its rightful place, and in the process by which the teacher is accorded the necessary status in our society, because it is of the utmost importance that the teacher should play that decisive role in our community. I want to conclude with a quotation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is easy to recognize good teaching. You see it when you meet pupils who are hardworking and happy. Inter-personal harmony and respect for individual differences, together with full academic development according to ability, are the cornerstones of a successful teaching profession.</block>

<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House are not satisfied with the amendment which the hon. the Minister moved in the Other Place in regard to clause 7. I therefore now formally move the amendment to this clause which stands in my name on page 392 of the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the proposed subsection (5) and to substitute:</block>

<ol>

<li>(5) Any inspector referred to in subsection (1) shall, before he exercises or performs any power or function under this Act, produce and exhibit to any person affected thereby, the inspection authority referred to in subsection (1).</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind this hon. House that, when this clause was discussed in the Committee Stage in this House, we moved an amendment to the effect that, when an inspector undertook an inspection in terms of this legislation, he should be required to produce his authority for making that inspection before actually undertaking such an inspection. We had very good reasons for moving that amendment. The inspectors, in terms of this legislation, will carry power to inspect very confidential information and records of people in business. In our opinion it is vitally necessary that those people in business should be adequately protected against imposters, that they should be adequately protected against industrial sabotage and industrial espionage, which do go on on quite a large scale.</p>

<p>In addition to that, we consider that if one is going to establish a good working relationship between an inspector, in terms of this legislation, and the person inspected, one must remove any cause for suspicion between those parties right at the start before the inspection is being undertaken. For that reason the inspector should produce his authority before inspecting and not put the person inspected in the invidious position of having to force a person coming to inspect him, to identify himself. I believe those were very valid reasons for us moving that amendment during the Committee Stage in the original place. I might say that this is nothing new to this House and it is nothing new as far as amendments from this side are concerned. Similar amendments have been moved to other legislation and have been accepted by the Government, I would think, in more cases than they have not been accepted. We have certainly accepted it in the Hazardous Substances Act, the Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act and, during this session, in the Plant Improvement Act When I moved this amendment during the Committee Stage, the hon. the Minister refused to accept it for what he described as practical difficulties in the way of carrying out this legislation if such amendment were embodied in it. But in refusing to accept the amendment he gave me two undertakings. The first was that he would consider an amendment in the Other Place to provide that inspectors be required to identify themselves, and secondly, that he would submit such an amendment to me before taking it to the Other Place. I should like to remind this House of the actual discussion that took place in the Committee Stage. In col. 3845 the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot accept the amendment in this form. However, allow me to design a method, and I shall submit it to the hon. member for Constantia before I take it to the Other Place, by means of which the identification may take place. From a practical point of view and for the reasons I have advanced here, I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia.</block>

<p>Then in col. 3854, on the undertaking of the hon. the Minister that he would not only show me the amendment before taking it to the Other Place but also that he would introduce it in the Other Place, I withdrew my amendment with these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would like to say that as far as my second amendment is concerned, in view of what the hon. the Minister has undertaken, viz. that he will consider an amendment whereby inspectors will identify themselves before making an inspection, I wish to withdraw this amendment.</block>

<p><span class="col_7399-7400" refersTo="page_1030"/>Well, it is a matter of regret to me, Sir, that the hon. the Minister did not show me this amendment before he introduced it in the Other Place although I was freely available for at least a full week before the discussion took place there. As far as the amendment which was accepted in the Other Place is concerned, this certainly does not satisfy the requirements of the situation. In fact, as I see it, the amendment which is now in front of us really serves no good purpose at all. It does not in any practical sense provide the owner of a business who is going to be inspected, with any rights that he does not already possess. If any person comes into my business and asks to inspect it and to exercise any of the powers which are given in this legislation, such as inspecting goods, books or other documents and seizing and retaining goods, books and other documents, I already have the right to ask him either to identify himself or to leave the premises. We do not need this clause to give the person to be inspected that right. The Minister may say that he wants this clause so that the inspectors may go into premises such as shops and wander around and see what is happening and observe things like advertisements, prices, etc., without identifying themselves. I cannot see, if the amendment which I have just moved were to be accepted, how inspectors will be prevented from doing that.</p>

<p>The public has the right to enter shops, to wander around and to see what is happening, and inspectors will have exactly the same right. I maintain, however, that this is not what the inspectors will be required to do in practice. What the inspectors will be required to do in practice, will be to deal with specific complaints against undesirable trade practices, complaints that have been made by members of the public. To investigate such complaints, they will have to exercise the powers that they are given in terms of clause 7. In other words, they will have to enter the premises, undertake a proper inspection and see the books, records, etc. If they are to do that, the parties that are to be inspected already have the right to require the identification that is provided for in the amendment that was accepted in the Other Place. What the person to be inspected needs, is protection against imposters and against industrial espionage. I maintain that the amendment which I have now moved&#x2014;which was rejected earlier by this House in the Committee Stage of the Bill&#x2014;is the amendment which is required to provide the protection which is very badly needed in terms of this legislation. I believe that if the hon. the Minister would accept the amendment I have moved, he would greatly improve this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to endorse everything the hon. member for Constantia has said this afternoon. I wish to refer to the Senate Hansard of this debate, but before I do so I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that when the hon. member for Constantia quoted from Hansard of this House, the date was 24 March 1976, while the Hansard I am going to quote from now covers the Committee Stage of the Trade Practices Bill of 4 May 1976. It is quite a long time and the hon. the Minister&#x2014;regretfully I believe&#x2014; did not honour his undertaking.</p>

<p>I still believe it is regretful that the hon. the Minister did not do it, because I believe that when he moved this amendment in the Other Place, he moved it as follows (Senate Debates No. 8, col. 1927)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any inspector who has been furnished with inspection authority in writing contemplated in subsection (1) and who exercises any power in terms of this section, shall, at the request of any person affected by such exercising, produce such inspection authority to such person.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister said the following when he explained the purpose of the amendment which he moved in the Other Place (Senate Debates No. 8, col. 1927)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to add that I undertook to move the amendment in this hon. House and I should now like to comply with my undertaking in this regard.</block>

<p>As I understood it, it was a fundamental aspect of the undertaking that the hon. the Minister would consult with the hon. member for Constantia. I find it regrettable that it did not take place. I do not wish to repeat the very lucid argument and the convincing reasoning <span class="col_7401-7402" refersTo="page_1031"/>the hon. member for Constantia has put forward, but I want to suggest that we seek to introduce a positive approach as against a negative approach. I believe the hon. the Minister still has an opportunity to reconsider his decision and his attitude in this regard. The hon. member for Constantia has referred to other legislation which incorporates the principle which we stand for in this particular type of clause. It is not new as far as the Ministers of Health, Agriculture and others are concerned, because they have accepted it. I ask the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment, because if he does not I have to conclude certain things. In the first instance, I will be forced to conclude that the hon. the Minister approves of the concept that the individual exists for the State and not the State for the individual and, furthermore, that he is of the opinion that the convenience of inspectors transcends the importance of the individual in so far as this particular Bill is concerned, because he is not prepared to protect the public against the possibilities which my hon. colleague has disclosed so convincingly. I also believe that we have to conclude that the hon. the Minister is not prepared to place inspectors above any form of suspicion in their identity in the powers they have under this legislation. These, I believe, are cogent and serious reasons why the hon. the Minister should accept our amendment. Even at this late stage I want to ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider his attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall be brief. We shall support the hon. member for Constantia in his amendment. On the other hand, we must be quite clear that we do not think the difference between the amendment introduced by the hon. the Minister and the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Constantia is earth-shaking. However, on balance, it is clearly better that inspectors should have to show their inspection authority before taking the steps as described in the legislation rather than be requested to do so. To be quite honest, we would have thought that if somebody were worried about the question of industrial espionage and sabotage, they could certainly ask the inspector to produce his authority. However, on balance we cannot see what problems it may cause an inspector to produce it rather than to be requested to do so. We shall, therefore, support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I find the statement just made by the hon. member for Johannesburg North a little incomprehensive. During the Committee Stage of the Plant Improvement Bill, the hon. member for Bryanston supported the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia. His words were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Chairman, I cannot understand why the Government is not prepared to accept unconditionally the amendments which have been moved by the hon. member for Berea. It is a reasonable amendment and it is an improvement on the legislation.</block>

<p>The hon. member ended up by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I really believe the Government should not reject this amendment out of hand, but that they should rather give attention to it.</block>

<p>I want to support those speakers who said that they would support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia this afternoon. On the other hand, I really cannot understand why the hon. the Minister is holding on to the last little bit of the concession he has made. Why must the person who is being investigated demand of the person who is doing the investigation the authority to do such an investigation? I am sure that hon. members are aware of the circumstances in this country at present. Not all traders are White people; many of them are non-White. They are used to having inspectors in their places of business all the time. However, they are either used to those inspectors who produce their authority as soon as they enter the places of business, or else those who are in uniform. Post Office inspectors wear uniforms. Members of the Police either wear uniforms or, in the case of plain-clothes policemen, produce their authority. It is something which is done as a matter of course. However, immediately the hon. the Minister introduces into this Bill the provision that an inspector shall only produce his authority at the request of the person affected by such exercise, immediately the hon. the Minister tells inspectors not to produce their authority unless they are asked to do so, one is going to lose the confidence of the people. I <span class="col_7403-7404" refersTo="page_1032"/>want to return for a moment to the question of the non-White traders I was talking about. These people are afraid of authority and are particularly afraid of the victimization which can result from the questioning of the authority of a person who is investigating any matters in their store. I do not believe that this House should today put those traders in the position where they can be victimized simply because they have to demand of a person his authority to carry out an investigation. What has an inspector got to hide? I do not believe that he has anything at all to hide. I believe that he should quite openly go there and say: &#x201C;I am Joe Soap and I am authorized by the Secretary to do this job. Here is my authority. Will you please produce your books.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Such a requirement does not mean that that inspector will be hampered in his work at all. I believe that that inspector can still do all the necessary investigation. If an inspector walks into a shop just to look around, I do not believe that it is necessary for the inspector, immediately he crosses the threshold of that shop, to produce his authority, and it is not the intention of the hon. member for Constantia&#x2019;s amendment that he should do so. However, immediately that inspector goes to the licensee and says, &#x201C;I want your books&#x201D;, or &#x201C;I want to see that and you must produce it&#x201D;, he must produce his authority. This is the whole point behind which the hon. the Minister has hidden both in the debates here and in the debates in the Other Place. He reads the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia as saying: &#x201C;When the inspector sets foot across the threshold he shall produce his authority&#x2019; &#x2019;. That is not what is written into the amendment. It is when the inspector takes action that he should produce his authority. The amendment reads as follows: &#x201C;Any inspector, before he exercises or performs any power &#x2026;&#x201D;. It is not merely when he goes into a shop to investigate that he should produce his authority, but when he goes to a trader and says, &#x201C;T want your books&#x201D;, or &#x201C;I want to look at those goods.&#x201D; That is when he must produce his authority. I believe that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia is a reasonable one and one which can only lead to the more effective carrying out of the intentions of this House when it passed the Bill. It is an amendment which can only lead to better co-operation between the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, through is inspectors, and the persons who are affected by this Bill. I would urge the hon. the Minister, in the name of justice and in the name of reasonableness to accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by conveying my apologies to the hon. member for Constantia for the misunderstanding which occurred in regard to this amendment. I do not want to take the matter further at this stage, and I shall therefore let that suffice. Let us consider the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia. He is quite right; it is the identical amendment he moved at the Committee Stage. The hon. member concedes that I had fundamental difficulties in accepting that amendment at that stage, for the reasons I gave him at that stage. I undertook to introduce an amendment in the Other Place which would comply with the requirements he set. I did not undertake to introduce the amendment he proposed then in the Other Place, because I was unable to accept that amendment. However, as I have just said, I undertook to try to introduce an amendment which would comply with the requirements he set. It is clear that no amount of discussion is going to help us, because my amendment is not acceptable to him. The amendment which is acceptable to him is the one he originally proposed.</p>

<p>Sir, let us now, in all fairness, take a look at the legislation itself. In terms of clause 5, the powers of the Secretary are transferred to the Inspector. When we look at the objects of the legislation we find that we are dealing with malpractices or undesirable trade practices. This is what the legislation seeks to prevent. In order to do this, the legislation contains certain enabling provisions and certain powers which are vested in the Secretary and which the Secretary, in turn, may delegate to the inspectors. The Secretary cannot delegate his powers in terms of clause 6 to an inspector, but only those in terms of clause 5. In other words, there is already a restriction with regard to the delegation of powers, and therefore this also applies to the powers an inspector may exercise under delegation.</p>

<p>What does the hon. member for Constantia want to prevent? In the first instance he wants to prevent industrial sabotage from taking place. I agree with him; one must try to prevent this if one can. He wants to prevent <span class="col_7405-7406" refersTo="page_1033"/>&#x201C;that people can be imposters, posing as inspectors&#x201D;. I agree with him on that score too. He wants there to be a sound attitude between the inspectors and the people who undergo inspections. I agree with him on that score as well. In all fairness, if it is expressly provided in the legislation that apart from the common law&#x2014;which in any event affords anyone who is inspected, the right to ask for this&#x2014;the inspector has to exhibit his authority on demand, and it is being inserted here merely to reconfirm that people subject to inspections have the right to ask the man for his authority. Many of the things which may be subject to inspection could be totally frustrated if the inspector were to walk in and effect the identification at once. Now we must consider the arguments of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South and we must also consider the amendment on the Order Paper, the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(5) Any inspector referred to in subsection (1) shall, before he exercises or performs any power or function under this Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>That power is a power of inspection, not necessarily the seizing of books, but the power of inspection. The inspector goes to a specific shop, and does so after we have acquired specific information that specific practices occur in the sale of certain goods. He walks in and makes a test purchase. It is no use the hon. member shaking his head. The inspector is then performing an action under the Act. When the inspector goes in there to make a test purchase, to go and identify a specific practice, then, in terms of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia, he is exercising a power under the Act. If I accept the amendment as printed, the inspector has to go in there and say: &#x201C;Here is my letter of appointment. I now want to make a test purchase from you. &#x2019; &#x2019;</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister if there is no difference between powers and activities on the one hand and investigation on the other?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>One of the powers of an inspector is that he must go and inspect whether a specific practice occurs or does not occur at a specific shop. When I say that it is a power, and I then say that before he exercises his power, he has to identify himself, I cannot argue that it is not the same action. I must now honestly say that hon. members are aware that what I have in mind, and what they have in mind, are the one and same thing. It is just that we find it so terribly difficult to satisfy everyone with regard to the wording. Let me just say to the hon. member for Berea that I am not elevating the State above the individual. I wonder whether he realizes that this legislation is specifically aimed at protecting individual rights, rights which are exploited by a few people. It is not the rights of the State which are at issue here; it is often ordinary, uneducated people whose rights are at issue. The State therefore has to act as guardian. It is pointless hon. members telling me that they support me with regard to the principle and then, when I have to create the mechanism to do the work, opposing me in this way. Surely that is not fair.</p>

<p>Let me make a suggestion to hon. members. We have difficulties in regard to this legislation. The amendment by the hon. member for Constantia means that inspections may not be carried out before identification. I maintain that the powers I am now vesting in the inspectors may be exercised without prejudice to the rights of the people whose affairs are being investigated. I maintain further that the amendment which I moved in the Other Place and which I ask that hon. members accept, provides that inspectors must always have their means identification on their person, because when an inspector enters a place, anyone may ask for it, and if he does not have the identification with him, he cannot continue with his work. He then has to go and fetch it first. In the second place, all the people in the business world, people who know their rights, fear sabotage or industrial sabotage, or people who pretend to be what they are not. No one is going to tell me that businessmen will not have this legislation at their fingertips. That is why I say that I have written enough into the legislation to give people the right to protect themselves, and I undertake to amend the legislation if any hon. member brings it to my attention that this power is not being exercised with the necessary discretion and that it is being abused by my inspectors.</p>

<heading>REGISTRATION OF COPYRIGHT IN CINEMATOGRAPH FILMS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In recent years a large number of unauthorized copies of foreign cinematograph films have been distributed or hired out by certain persons and organizations in the Republic. Although no copyright compensation was paid to the rightful holders of the copyright in such cinematograph films in respect of the exhibition thereof, such compensation was in fact payable, in accordance with the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1965, in respect of the exhibition of the said cinematograph films. However, it was not possible to recover the compensation.</p>

<p>In many cases the rightful holders of copyright in the said cinematograph films, as well as the distributors thereof, instituted legal proceedings against the contraveners in terms of the provisions of the Copyright Act in order to recover damages from them and, in many other cases, prosecutions were instituted against them for offences in terms of the Act. Under the existing legal rules, however, it is very difficult to prove the rights of holders of copyright in cinematograph films, as well as the distributors thereof, and furthermore the costs of litigation in such cases are frequently very high, since witnesses have to be brought from abroad to testify in regard to the facts in such a case.</p>

<p>In certain of these cases judgment was passed against the rightful owners and distributors of cinematograph films purely on technicalities, but in other instances the action was prosecuted to the point just prior to the case being heard in the Supreme Court, and then the unlawful distributors of the said cinematograph film agreed, at that late stage, <span class="col_7409-7410" refersTo="page_1035"/>to pay copyright compensation. Instances also occurred where damages, together with the costs of the litigation, were awarded against the unlawful distributors of cinematograph films, but in more instances than one, in both instances to which I referred, the plaintiffs were unable to recover anything from the defendants since the defendants in the cases concerned had no assets which could be attached. There are people who are making a business of the distribution of cinematograph films.</p>

<p>In order to afford the rightful holders of copyright in cinematograph films more effective protection, and to ease the burden of proof in civil as well as criminal cases, it is being proposed in the Bill which is now before this House that provision be made for a system of voluntary registration of the relevant copyright.</p>

<p>I want to proceed to discuss the main provisions which are embodied in the Bill.</p>

<p>In clause 1 of the Bill provision will be made, for the purposes of the proposed legislation, for a number of definitions, all of which are self-explanatory.</p>

<p>In clauses 2 up to and including 5 of the Bill it is being proposed that provision be made for the establishment of an office for the registration of copyright in cinematograph films, and for the appointment, for the purposes of the proposed legislation, of a Registrar of Copyright. According to the proposed legislation an agent will be able to undertake the registration of copyright in a cinematograph film on behalf of any person entitled, but it is expressly provided that no person other than an attorney or patent agent may accept the said commission, or, with a view to gain, furnish advice in relation to such a registration. The procedure which will be adopted with the registration of copyright in a cinematograph film will be prescribed by clauses 6, 7 and 8 of the Bill, and the registrar will be empowered to accept or refuse such an application for registration conditionally or unconditionally. When an application for registration of copyright in a film is refused by the registrar he will have to furnish in writing the reasons for his decision and the applicant will then be able to appeal to the Supreme Court against such a decision. Furthermore it will be required in terms of the proposed legislation that, if any application for registration is accepted conditionally or unconditionally, the acceptance of such application shall be advertised for general information in the manner prescribed by the legislation.</p>

<p>Since it is expected that, under certain circumstances, there may possibly be more than one person who will lay claim to copyright in a specific cinematograph film, provision is being made in clauses 9 up to and including 14 of the Bill for proceedings in accordance with which the registrar may, in a formal or, with the consent of the parties concerned, in an informal manner adjudicate upon any opposition to the registration of copyright in a specific cinematograph film. An appeal to the Supreme Court may be made against the decision of the registrar in formal proceedings in regard to the registration of copyright in a cinematograph film, but not in the case of the decision of the registrar in informal proceedings to which the parties concerned have consented. Provision is also being made in the proposed legislation for security for the costs which either party may incur in regard to opposition proceedings before the Registrar.</p>

<p>Clauses 15, 16 and 17 of the Bill contain provisions relating to the establishment of a register of copyright in cinematograph films and provision will also, <i>inter alia,</i> be made for the effecting of amendments or corrections to entries in the register. In order to place the reliability of any entry in the register beyond any doubt, it will also be provided in the proposed legislation that any person who is aggrieved by any entry which is wrongly omitted from the register or effected therein, may apply to the court or to the Registrar for a rectification in the register.</p>

<p>Copyright in the cinematograph film may be registered after all the formalities to which I have referred have been disposed of. Furthermore, provision is being made in clause 18 of the Bill for the consequences of the registration of copyright in a cinematograph film and for the empowering of the Registrar to issue a certificate of registration in respect of the cinematograph film. Such a certificate will then, in terms of clause 30 of the Bill, be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the said entry having been made in the register. Because the Copyright Act of 1965 prescribes the extent of copyright in a cinematograph film, it will also, furthermore, be provided in clause 19 of the Bill that the duration of the registration of copyright in a cinematograph film shall be <span class="col_7411-7412" refersTo="page_1036"/>determined in accordance with the provisions of that Act.</p>

<p>In practice it frequently happens that several copies of a specific cinematograph film are being distributed in various parts of the world, and that the distributors of cinematograph films issue licences to persons to exhibit the cinematograph film. Such licences may be granted to various people, or exclusively to one person. Provision is therefore being made in clause 20 of the Bill for the recording&#x2014;in the register of copyright in cinematograph films&#x2014;of particulars in respect of the legal relationships among owners of copyright in cinematograph films and the licensees in relation to such cinematograph films, as well as for the conditions or terms on which the licences were granted. Before the Registrar records the particulars in regard to such a licence holder in the register, he has to be satisfied that the licensee as such is recognized by the owner, and is being allowed by the owner to act as licensee. Provision will be made by regulation for the advertisement of the fact that a person has been registered as a licensee in respect of a cinematograph film.</p>

<p>Clauses 21, 22 and 23 of the Bill contain provisions in regard to the assignment and transmission of copyright in cinematograph films. The Registrar has to be satisfied that such an assignment or transmission has been made by the owner of the cinematograph film and that copyright in the film does in fact vest in the person to whom the assignment or transmission has been made. If he is satisfied, he issues a certificate to such effect. Provision is also being made for the recording of the particulars of an assignment or a transmission of copyright in a cinematograph film, pending an application for registration of copyright in that cinematograph film.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is being provided that, when any person is entitled by an assignment or a transmission, to copyright in a cinematograph film, he has to apply to the Registrar to register that assignment or transmission. If an assignment or transmission has not been registered in accordance with the provisions of the proposed legislation, a document or instrument in respect of such an assignment or transmission shall not be admitted in evidence in any court, unless the court otherwise directs.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The powers and duties of the registrar under the proposed legislation are set out in clauses 24 to 28 of the Bill. The registrar will be empowered to determine the venue of any proceedings before him, as well as the manner in which he will receive evidence in such proceedings. He may call for the personal appearance of witnesses; he may order the discovery or inspection of documents; he may deal with interlocutory matters and he may order costs against any party in such proceedings. Such costs are to be taxed by the taxing master of a Supreme Court. Generally speaking, the registrar will have the same powers and jurisdiction as a single judge in a civil action before a provincial division of the Supreme Court, and where no regulations are prescribed, he will have to follow the Supreme Court rules of procedure. The registrar will also be empowered to allow the amendment of documents relating to applications and in proceedings before him. In the exercise of these powers, or in the exercise of any other discretionary power, he must give the applicant, or any other party concerned in the proceedings, an opportunity of being heard.</p>

<p>I have already stated that the proposed system of registration of copyright in cinematograph films will afford protection to the owners of copyright in such films, because such registration will ease the provision of proof in civil and criminal proceedings under the Copyright Act. It therefore follows that the provisions of clauses 29 to 32 of the Bill relating to evidence, should be considered to be the most important portion of the Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 29 of the Bill provides that the proposed register shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of any matter which may, in accordance with the proposed legislation, be inserted in the register. Hon. members will no doubt agree that it will be difficult for litigants to produce the register in court so as to prove the contents thereof. However, proof of the contents of the register will be facilitated by the provisions of clause 30 of the Bill, which empowers the Registrar to issue a certificate in regard to the contents of the register.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is provided in clause 31 of the Bill that, in civil and criminal proceedings relating to copyright in cinematograph films, the fact that a person is registered as the owner or licensee of the copyright in any particular cinematograph film, shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the validity of the original registration of that copyright and any subsequent assignment and transmission thereof. <span class="col_7413-7414" refersTo="page_1037"/>It therefore follows that any litigant will be able to furnish evidence as to his title in any cinematograph film by the mere production of a certificate issued in terms of the proposed legislation. However, it has been brought to my attention that there is a difference between the English and the Afrikaans texts of clause 31 of the Bill, and I shall therefore in the Committee Stage move an amendment to that clause in order to rectify the omission of the reference to licensee in the Afrikaans text. Provision is also made for a certificate of validity to be given by the court where the validity of the registration of copyright in a cinematograph film is in issue and a decision is given in favour of the owner of the copyright.</p>

<p>Appeals to, and the powers of the court, are dealt with in clauses 33 to 39 of the Bill. Except in the case of informal proceedings before the registrar, every other decision of the registrar will be subject to appeal to the division of the Supreme Court within whose area of jurisdiction the decision was given, and thereafter to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. It is also provided that the parties to an appeal may appeal direct to the Appellate Division without first having appealed to a provincial division.</p>

<p>Apart from the powers of the court to vary or reverse a decision of the registrar, the court may substitute its own decision for the decision of the registrar, or it may remit the case to the registrar for the taking of further evidence, or it may itself call for further proof in the matter before it. Provision is also made for the registrar to be notified of a pending appeal, and for him to be a party to the appeal.</p>

<p>Clauses 40 and 41 of the Bill relate to offences. Penalties are prescribed for the making of false entries in the register and for making false statements for the purpose of deceiving or influencing the registrar with a view to obtaining such false entries to be made.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous matters are dealt with in clauses 42 to 46 of the Bill. Provision is made for the Minister to prescribe regulations, forms and fees, and for the prepayment of such fees before the Registrar performs an act or issues a document. It is also anticipated that many applicants will be resident outside of the Republic, and it is provided, therefore, that such applicants, or if an application is opposed, a non-resident opponent should have an address for service in the Republic where process can be served in all matters pertaining to copyright in cinematograph films. Provision is also made for acts to be done on behalf of any person under some form of disability which prevents him from acting of his own accord. And, finally, it is provided that the legislation will come into operation on a date to be determined by the State President.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this side of the House accepts the Bill. However, we do so with a certain amount of misgiving. The first thought I would like to put to the hon. the Minister is that one would have thought, after studying the Bill very carefully, that it could possibly have established the purpose of this legislation by appointing a Registrar of Copyright under the present Act. In that sense it would have enabled the whole of the question of copyright and registration to be contained in what is a very admirable piece of legislation on the Statute Book. I must say that this question was also discussed at one time in a Select Committee, I think, in 1964. On the other hand, one can well understand the problems facing the hon. the Minister in regard to the question of costs and the litigation that has ensued in both the civil and criminal courts. I would like to say that one of the problems facing us in regard to this Bill is the question of additional expenditure, which could possibly be quite heavy. When this matter was raised with one of the witnesses who gave evidence in the Select Committee at the time, it was pointed out that the system of registration was in existence in the United States. The witness said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not suggest South Africa should adopt the system of registration which is in vogue in the United States, for that would be very cumbersome and very expensive, but we do not ask for the inclusion.</block>

<p>For that reason the matter was left in abeyance at the time. The only problem that worries one, is the proliferation of additional departments, additional civil servants and additional structure in the total system of the administration for this particular legislation.</p>

<p>Something else which worries us very much indeed, is the fact&#x2014;I was given this on authority&#x2014;that this Bill was not submitted to any of the bodies that might have been very relevant indeed in giving some form of advice <span class="col_7415-7416" refersTo="page_1038"/>to the hon. the Minister. I believe that there is a standing committee on copyright to which the representatives were invited by the Registrar of Patents, Designs and Trademarks. The committee consists of representatives from the Institute of Patent Agents, the Bar Council, the recording industry, the film industry, the SABC and SAMRO. These are all very important bodies and vitally interested in the whole question of copyright. This committee was not advised of the details of the proposed Bill, and I believe it only received details of this Bill during March of this year. From information which I have at my disposal, it would appear that the committee is not very happy with the fact that the Bill may become an Act of Parliament without its having had an opportunity to consider the Bill in detail and by all these interested parties. It follows, naturally, that there was also no publication of the Bill in the <i>Government Gazette</i> before submitting it to Parliament, otherwise they might have been aware of it and they might have made some comment on it.</p>

<p>Another feature of the Bill which leaves us unhappy&#x2014;I do not know how the hon. the Minister can cure it, unless he does so either in the Other Place or after some further consideration&#x2014;is that the registrar who, according to this particular Bill, is going to be appointed the Registrar of Copyright, will have the powers of a quasi judicial officer. He is going to be invested with powers of jurisdiction possessed by a judge. There can, of course, be an appeal to the Supreme Court. In the Patents Act, the registrar merely carries out the administrative side of his duties. His decisions on the technical issues are then the subject of an appeal to the Commissioner of Patents who is a judge appointed by the Judge-President of the Transvaal Provincial Division. The appeal then goes to him and his particular decision can be taken on appeal to the Supreme Court. Likewise, in the Copyright Act, the question of dispute in respect of licensees, the holders of copyright, or any infringements, can be dealt with by a judicial tribunal consisting similarly, of a single judge who is, in fact, the Commissioner of Patents. His decision is subject to review by a full bench of the Supreme Court. Therefore, to me this seems to be an innovation namely to invest him not only with administrative duties as the registrar of the department, but also with these quasi judicial duties with the right to award costs for which provision is made for taxation by the Registrar of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>We do not find these features very attractive and we feel that possibly these could have been more clearly dealt with, if the experts had had an opportunity to investigate the Bill and to make their representations to the department. It is obvious that the object of this Bill&#x2014;for that reason we have to support it&#x2014;is to protect film organizations in this country, particularly the big companies who import and provide the main exhibitions of films in the Republic, and who are concerned with their involvement in costs regarding copyright. They have had difficulty with pirates in the use of their various films. One need only refer to events over the last 12 months. Particularly last year there has been quite an onslaught of home movie organizations who saturated the market. There were serious problems in regard to copyright. The problem arises when copyright is vested in foreign companies and ownership has to be proved. The hon. the Minister said witnesses have to be produced and that affidavits must be obtained from far-away countries. Considerable expense can thus be involved.</p>

<p>I understand further that the industry in this country has tried to persuade State departments to take criminal proceedings in infringements of the Copyright Act. However, the State is itself in the same position as the organizations which distribute films. They, too, must call witnesses from abroad in order to prove the infringement of the Copyright Act. The State and the industries therefore face the same difficulty. One can therefore understand that some method must be sought for alleviating the situation.</p>

<p>There is a very interesting innovation in the Bill, and that is to shift the onus of proof virtually on to the person who infringes &#x2026;</p>

<p>The defender.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; the defender who is accused of infringing copyright. As far as I can see, the copyright owner now has the advantage of either having a certificate from the registrar or the decision of the court, which in effect is in itself a further certificate. Further action, therefore, may be taken. The copyright owner can as a result of this produce the <span class="col_7417-7418" refersTo="page_1039"/>necessary evidence by certificates without having to go to the trouble he was subjected to previously in obtaining the necessary evidence. One other problem arises, and I think the hon. the Minister should take notice of this. The requirement for registration under the regulations in general have been left to the registrar. There is no clarity as to details that will be required for registration. A very important aspect that arises is whether the film will have to be filed in order to ensure that one has some form of security and that the registrar has some form of evidence of the particular article in respect of which copyright is sought. This could be a costly project. However, if it is not done, considerable disputes can arise as to the material, as I have suggested, which is sought to be protected. From the Bill it appears that the purpose is only the registration of copyright in regard to a cinematograph film, because the actual question of copyright still remains defined and settled by the Copyrights Act itself. The question of the duration of the copyright, for instance, is provided for in the Copyright Act. In the Bill reference is made to the Copyright Act in that respect. As I have said, the Bill makes no provision for the requirements of registration. This is left entirely to the registrar in terms of clause 1. However, I think some thought may be given to that when the department or the structure to administer this measure has been properly set up.</p>

<p>The other aspect I should like to raise is in regard to the question of acceptance or refusal of applications. No clear-cut guide-lines are set. There is no indication as to whether a film should be submitted with an application. If it is not submitted, then the scope of the subject matter to be registered could be vague. I think some thought should be given to that as well.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the question of opposition. No exact grounds are stated on which applications can be opposed. I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the Trademarks Act where although no grounds for opposition are set out, the requirements for registration are stipulated in detail in other parts of the Act. I feel that in this particular Bill some grounds of opposition should be stated. If this is not done an impossible situation could arise, where an application for registration can be opposed on any grounds at all, even with the object of holding up a situation. Considerable costs can be involved. The objection may be found to be completely invalid and frivolous although there may be some form of penalty provided for in regard to frivolous applications. Nevertheless, Sir, the time, trouble and expense involved both in connection with the courts and the registrar&#x2019;s office, are things which I think should be avoided.</p>

<p>A further question I should like to raise relates to an earlier point I made in regard to the actual establishment of the registrar&#x2019;s office. It seems to me that a large number of staff members may have to be employed if we are to expect what we have seen in the last few years in the case of piracy. On the other hand, under normal conditions, I would have imagined that all these activities could have been absorbed by, for instance, the Registrar of Copyright, or even the Registrar of Patents, Trade Marks and Designs, by virtue of the close alliance of the departments concerned. However, if it is found necessary to establish this registrar&#x2019;s office, I feel that some thought must be given to the question of keeping costs within circumspect limits.</p>

<p>The final point I should like to raise is the question of the advertising which may be required by the registrar prior to the application being made and subsequent to the application being granted. No details are given as to where the advertisements should be placed. It could be in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> but then it should be so stated. It could also be in the <i>Patents Journal</i> &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I just want to mention the possibilities. As I have said, it could also be in the <i>Patents Journal,</i> which I believe is the most appropriate publication for this purpose. It should certainly be included amongst the media for advertisements, because then it would receive the attention not only of local copyright holders, i.e. owners or licensees; it would also enable those from overseas who may be affected in some way not to be taken by surprise as a result of being unaware of what is taking place in a distant country like the Republic. With those few thoughts, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that we will support the Bill.</p>

<from><span class="col_7419-7420" refersTo="page_1040"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think there is no doubt that copyright is a property which one is entitled to have protected, and that the law should be of such a nature that property can be protected. I found it somewhat intriguing that the hon. the Minister started his Second Reading speech by referring to the problems which existed in respect of the infringement of copyright, and which had arisen in the last year or so. He drew attention to the difficulty of recovering damages and of recovering royalties, and seemed to motivate this Bill in relation to that. Sir, I thought that I had forgotten to read the Bill correctly, because there must have been something in it to remedy that. I checked again. I had read it correctly, and therefore the whole of that motivation was actually irrelevant to this Bill. There is nothing in this Bill which enables one to recover damages or royalties. The crux of the Bill, as the Minister a little later pointed out, lies in clauses 18 and 31, which relates to the ability to prove.</p>

<p>That is right.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>That is really the concept behind this. The real problem which exists in respect of damages and things of that sort we have not touched on at all, and here the existing Act will have to continue to apply.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the hon. member for Jeppe. If he had not stated at the beginning that he was going to support this Bill, I would have thought that he was going to oppose it, because in fact he gave very valid reasons for opposing this piece of legislation, some of which I obviously agree with. To pursue this point, I want to ask, if I may, a number of what I believe are relevant questions the hon. the Minister must answer. The first is: Why was this item of copyright selected, taken out and a whole machinery created for it while other aspects of copyright are completely ignored? It is not enough to say that there are infringements mainly of films. There is a very serious problem, for instance in regard to music.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall reply to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I hope so. I find it very difficult to understand why this particular item of copyright should be selected, that we should have a registrar who should just deal with films&#x2014;let us be frank about this&#x2014;while so far as books, records, or any other matter where copyright is as vital and as important as it is in this particular aspect, nothing is said at all. I have a very great difficulty here, because in so far as the film industry is concerned, the film industry is with limited exception&#x2014;and I asked the hon. the Minister a question the other day to highlight this&#x2014;substantially a foreign industry. The copyright position in South Africa in respect of films causes a tremendous drain of foreign exchange in respect of royalties. The film industry is a very powerful industry and it is a very influential industry. What worries me is that whether the pressure that has come from this powerful industry, where money leaves the country in very substantial quantities, is a pressure which has resulted in the creation of a State department virtually just for this particular industry. There are many aspects of this piece of legislation which one finds very difficult to understand, not difficult to understand in the sense of reading them, but difficult to understand why this should be done, why it should be done for this particular industry, and why it should be done under these particular circumstances.</p>

<p>Let me put this matter very simply. I think that one can regard the film industry, the cinema industry, in so far as the exhibition of it is concerned as something which gives pleasure to the poorer section of the community. In a large measure it is not the people of substantial means who receive a substantial portion of their entertainment from going to the cinema. Yet we have in South Africa a film industry with prices which I think are tremendously high, where you have an outflow of foreign exchange, where there were, in the last couple of years, a tremendous increase in cinema prices just before the advent of TV. Yet for this kind of situation we create a completely new State department. What I find even more remarkable is that it is this hon. Minister who introduces it, this Minister who is charged with fighting inflation in South Africa and who talks about all of us having to fight inflation. He comes here at this moment of time in order to create a complete governmental machinery, a completely new structure, a completely new bureaucratic machine in order to assist purely <span class="col_7421-7422" refersTo="page_1041"/>the people in the cinema industry. That is what the hon. the Minister is doing. And he is supposed to be the fighter against inflation. He has not even told us what this is going to cost us. What is this machinery going to cost South Africa? How many more offices are we going to have? How big is the thing going to be? The time has come in South Africa that we have got to call a halt to bureaucratic expansion and if this Government really believes that you have to cut down on State expenditure, you do not create new Government departments at a time when you should be fighting inflation. You cannot, as the hon. the Minister is so good at doing, tell the public to make sacrifices. They must cut back, they must do it all and in the meantime the bureaucratic empires keep on expanding in South Africa. That is what is wrong with this piece of legislation, and this is what one cannot understand. There are so many unanswered questions in regard to this matter. Why is it, for example, that there was apparently not the degree of consultation that there should be? Will the hon. the Minister tell us what consultation did take place? Why is this being rushed through?</p>

<p>There are other aspects concerning this matter. Registration also involves other people in expense. Those who are not concerned with this may be the small people, but being small is not a crime. They may be quite honest about copyright, but in terms of this legislation they will have to watch the <i>Gazette</i> or the <i>Patents Journal,</i> which the hon. member quite rightly suggested as a means of advertising, if this is going to be done. One would also have to keep an eye on all sorts of other things. When one wants to apply for copyright, one has also first to decide whether one is prepared to involve oneself in expense. On top of that, if one wanted to exercise what is a democratic right in South Africa, i.e. to protect one&#x2019;s own interests, one could be compelled to furnish security. This is a complete departure from the normal rules. Normally it is the plaintiff who is a foreigner or the impecunious plaintiff who has to furnish security. Now, when the big battalions are on the march, if the little guy has the temerity to oppose anything, he will be made to furnish security as well. Is this not rather strange? There must be some reason for this. Surely the hon. the Minister is not the person who is not going to protect the little guy who merely wants to protect his rights. That is one of the things that is so strange about this. People are being put to expense and will continually have to be watching the <i>Gazette</i> or the <i>Patents Journal.</i> I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would like to take us into his confidence and tell us who actually came forward with this idea. Who actually came forward with the first draft of this Bill? Where did it all originate? I think that we in this House are entitled to know what this is all about. When the hon. the Minister replies, I think he should tell us how much South Africa is paying in foreign exchange every year.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it has something to do with the Bill. I shall tell the hon. the Minister why it has something to do with the Bill. It has something to do with the Bill because the State is going to considerable expense to create a new Government department at a time when it should not be incurring such expenditure.</p>

<from><span class="col_7423-7424" refersTo="page_1042"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>This is being done in order to further protect the interests of people who are causing us a tremendous loss of foreign exchange. That is what it is all about. That is why the hon. the Minister must tell us what amounts of foreign exchange are leaving South Africa every year in this regard.</p>

<p>There are other things that also need to be said. How does one object to a film on the strength of an advertisement? How does one know whether it infringes a copyright or not? How does one know whether a man owns the copyright or does not? The only way to test this is to be able to see the film. This is something completely different to a trade mark application, since one can judge from a trade mark what the position is. It is quite different to a patent application, where one can look at the specifications. This is quite a different kettle of fish. The beginning of a film might be quite legitimate, the ending might be quite legitimate and the title completely different, while the middle portion may be a complete infringement of copyright. This Bill does not grant any protection in this regard. I have already referred to the issue of objections without the danger of being involved in heavy costs.</p>

<p>Then we have the normal rules in regard to evidence. Surely the normal rules in regard to leading evidence by affidavit or an commission should apply, not a special set of rules in terms of which affidavits can be presented at complete odds with the normal procedure in a Supreme Court. This all seems to be designed to help the big battalions. This is what worries me. This is what I am concerned about. There are many technical aspects of this Bill, for example the distinction between the administrative and judicial functions which are to be exercised by the registrar. That has been blurred. This is again a departure from tradition. The hon. member for Jeppe has said that he has misgivings. He is unhappy and has criticized the Bill. In fact, he has referred to it as &#x201C;cloak and dagger&#x201D; measure. We want to go a little further and express our views by moving an amendment. I consequently move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;whereas the principle of protecting copyright is already enshrined in our law, this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Registration of Copyright in Cinematograph Films Bill on the grounds that it creates unnecessary new administrative structures at a time when State expenditure should be cut down, and selects one particular aspect of copyright for preferential treatment.&#x201D;.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister in his introductory speech used, what I consider, a most telling phrase, particularly in the light of the argument used by the hon. member for Yeoville. He said that this was a system which was being instituted for voluntary registration of rights. I do not know whether I can go all the way with the hon. member for Yeoville in the arguments which he has advanced, but I do believe that he has a point. I think the point was covered by what the hon. member for Jeppe said earlier when he said that he wondered why this had been done by way of a new Bill with a separate structure which was being established instead of doing it within the ambit of the existing Copyright Act.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has moved that the House decline to pass the Second Reading on the grounds that the legislation creates unnecessary new administrative structures at a time when State expenditure should be cut down and that the Bill selects one particular aspect of copyright for preferential treatment. I believe that the grounds which the hon. member for Yeoville has advanced are perfectly valid but I do not believe that they are sufficient grounds to reject this Bill. I say that for the reason that there is an evil which exists and the hon. member for Yeoville concedes this. Whether it is the big boys who are eating the little ones or the little ones who are eating the big ones, I shall deal with a little later. Although this is only one aspect of copyright which is now being singled out for preferential treatment, in the words of the hon. member for Yeoville, I believe that this is at least a step in the right direction. As the hon. member for Jeppe said, we also would like to see this principle extended to the very spheres which the hon. member for Yeoville mentioned, the playing of music being the main or possibly the biggest offence in the country today as far as copyright is concerned. The hon. the Minister knows that we who have supermarkets and trading stores have been <span class="col_7425-7426" refersTo="page_1043"/>hounded by an organization recently because we are playing music or because they are afraid that we may be playing music in our supermarkets or stores. They say that they are entitled to their rights and I believe that they are.</p>

<p>Yes, the Performing Rights Society. I did not want to name them. The hon. the Minister mentioned them and we might as well mention them now. The Performing Rights Society is looking after the interests of the composers of music and those who perform the music. I believe that they are doing a good job of work, but I believe that the hon. the Minister must help them to achieve their object and he can help them with this sort of Bill. For that reason I believe that the scope of this Bill is too narrow. I am afraid that we cannot agree with the hon. member for Yeoville since we do not believe that his reasons are sufficient to reject the Bill. We will therefore support the hon. the Minister in the Second Reading, but I believe that we should try to make it as effective a measure as possible.</p>

<p>I want to talk about the whole question of copyright and what exactly is implied. The bit of research which I have done seems to imply that copyright means whatever the persons concerned want it to mean. If we look at the existing Copyright Act, we find that the rights as far as the owner of a copyright is concerned shall exist for a period of 50 years. I believe that in overseas countries this varies and that the generally accepted term is a term of only 25 years. That period of ownership of a copyright is now transferred into this Bill.</p>

<p>With respect, in clause 19 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The registration of the copyright in a cinematograph film shall be for such period of time as may be provided for the subsistence of the copyright by virtue of the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1965.</block>

<p>However, that concerns a period of 50 years, as is laid down in the Copyright Act. I am speaking specifically in respect of ownership of the copyright. I am not dealing now with licensees at all. Accepting that that ownership shall be 50 years in terms of the Act and in terms of the Bill before us, has the hon. the Minister or his department made any contact with any overseas organization which controls similar rights over there? I believe there should have been the very closest liaison with such organizations because the rights we are dealing with here spring mainly from overseas.</p>

<p>There is another aspect to this. It concerns the licensee who negotiates with organizations overseas for the rights in respect of a certain film. Such rights are sometimes very expensive. I think we must leave out for the moment the big boys who show 35 mm films. I think we must deal with the films that have created the problem, and that is the home movies, i.e. the 16 mm and 8 mm films and also the cassettes. The people who deal with these pay large amounts of money. I believe that a particular distributor in South Africa paid approximately R1 500 for the right to distribute a particular film in this country. What is more, he did not obtain a sole right or an exclusive right. The cost of an exclusive right to one of the so-called &#x201C;spectaculars&#x201D; is prohibitive. What provision is made in this Bill for any other licensee to have a similar right in respect of the same film?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I see, the hon. the Minister has made provision for that.</p>

<p>While we are dealing with that, I think we should look at another problem, and that is that certain films are remade. I am now not talking of the reissuing of a film. For instance, there was a film by the name of <i>Jigsaw</i>&#x2014;I do not recollect seeing it&#x2014;which was first made in 1961. The stars were Jack Warner and a fellow by the name of Lewis. The film was made by <span class="col_7427-7428" refersTo="page_1044"/>Universal (British). In 1968 the same film was remade by Universal in America. The stars in that case were fellows by the name of Jarden and Dilman. What is more, I believe the same film was remade a third time under a different title. I believe it was then called <i>Gun Moll.</i> How is the hon. the Minister going to cope with this? I hope he takes cognizance of this matter and that he will take note of it in his regulations and in the application of the copyright rights.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question of the licensee. When he obtains certain copyright rights, it is specified on the certificate he receives whether or not he has a sole or exclusive right. It is specified, too, whether those rights apply to theatrical distribution or to non-theatrical distribution, which means home movies, etc. It is also specified whether those rights apply for 35 mm films, 16 mm films, 8 mm films or for TV. Then, of course, in respect of television there is the further subdivision of cassettes and films. I believe there is an organization overseas which sells films on which the copyright has already lapsed. I believe that these are being sold on the open market. I hope the hon. the Minister will take cognizance of these facts when it comes to the registration of these copyrights.</p>

<p>There is another aspect I should like to mention. I refer to the fact that the licensees obtain their rights for a specific period. What is going to be the position with the registrar&#x2019;s register? Is it perpetually going to be brought up to date? How is the Minister going to control the expiration of the copyright, especially since on occasion such copyright is renewed and does therefore not always lapse? There is another type of copyright which applies mainly, I believe, to educational and religious films and which are sold for the lifetime of the print. There is no period specified. As long as such film is capable of being shown, it is shown. Another feature that I believe the hon. the Minister should reply to before we proceed to the next stage of this Bill, is the question of definition. The definition of a cinematograph film is contained in the Copyright Act. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Cinematograph film&#x201D; means any sequence of visual images recorded on material of any description (whether translucent or not) so as to be capable, by the use of that material&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) of being shown as a moving picture; or</li>

<li>(b) of being recorded on other material (whether translucent or not) by the use of which it can be so shown.</li>

</ol>

<p>The essential seems to be a moving picture. In other words, it does not apply to slides or film strips. I wonder whether there is any specific reason why these were left out. They are being used extensively, particularly in educational and religious films, and I believe that the hon. the Minister should comment on that.</p>

<p>There is one other point. I wonder if the hon. the Minister would tell us what the situation is going to be with regard to films which are being shown, and which will be shown, on SABC television. I am sure the hon. the Minister is aware that there was a move to exempt SABC Television from the necessity of acquiring copyright rights, and that there was also &#x2026;</p>

<p>It appears as if my time is running out. There are other matters I would like to discuss with the hon. the Minister, matters which will best be discussed during the Committee Stage when we deal with individual provisions. However, at this stage, I believe we can say that, because of the tremendous amount of money paid out by dealers in this particular industry, we believe the honest people in that industry should be protected. The hon. the Minister may not be aware of it, but during the sitting of the commission of inquiry into the Publications Act, we had a lot of evidence of piracy, of circumventing the Copyright Act, and of inability to enforce the Copyright Act. I hope this register that is going to be compiled, will help the present owners of copyrights. I hope it will also help those people in the industry who will be buying films in future, because they will now have the opportunity of going to one point in order to ascertain whether or not the rights to a particular film which has been offered to them, have been granted in South Africa or whether they will be able to obtain the sole and exclusive right to distribute such film in this country. We therefore support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, I am simply rising to say that I appreciate the support, even though it was given with reservations, of the Official Opposition. I want to react to the hon. member for Yeoville for just a moment. Mr. Speaker, in my opinion the hon. member, in his usual manner, unburdened himself of a number of arguments which had absolutely nothing to do with the essence of the legislation. He may be an authority on how a person makes money out of the country, but what bearing this has on this legislation, I really do now know. But I want to ask him a question. His party are the people who kick up such a fuss about the protection of human rights, and this afternoon he quarreled with me, when we in fact want to protect peoples&#x2019; rights, because I want to facilitate the mechanism for protecting peoples&#x2019; rights. He says I am making a mistake. Sir, I want to ask him this: Is the protective value of a right determined by the person to whom the right attaches, or do we have an absolute responsibility to protect rights? I find it astonishing that the hon. members on that side of the House, and in that specific comer, can find arguments for such circumstances just as it suits them. What is his second argument? He levelled an accusation at me and said that I was going to extend bureaucratic institutions further. But surely there is at present a department dealing with copyright and patents. Surely this does not require a new department to be established to do this work. Surely this is a special division of copyright which we wish to protect in a specific manner here. This is what is at issue here, and surely in a specific manner here. This is what is at issue here, and surely this does not in any way imply what the hon. member alleged it implies. But I want to ask him what evidence he has adduced to prove that we now want to use this legislation to protect the rights of the great battalions against the little people. I challenge him to produce his evidence for that. He can produce absolutely no evidence for that.</p>

<p>Sir, if I had not been interested in the little man, I would not have taken the trouble to protect the little man against big exploiters by means of the Trade Practices Act. [Interjections.] The hon. member must not tell that story here. His arguments this afternoon were nothing but a lot of political arguments. What is the legislation concerned with in essence? It is concerned with one thing only, and that is the effective protection, not of rights created by the legislation, but of existing rights, and to facilitate the procedure for protecting these rights. I said this in my Second Reading speech and I should like to repeat it to the hon. member because he sees something sinister in this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to afford the rightful holders of copyright in cinematograph films more effective protection, and to ease the burden of proof in civil as well as criminal cases, <span class="col_7431-7432" refersTo="page_1046"/>provision is now being made in the Bill for voluntary registration.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South was quite correct, viz. that we have here a system of voluntary registration of copyright. The question which is relevant, and I think this is a completely fair question which both Opposition groups actually put to me by implication, is why this legislation is necessary, why is it being done in a desperate law? Why could it not simply have been done merely as an amendment to the existing Copyright Act.</p>

<p>Allow me, for just a moment, to furnish a little background information. It is a fact, and hon. members are aware of it, that during the past few years there has been large-scale illegal distribution of unauthorized copies of foreign cinematograph films here in the Republic. This has caused a specific problem, and no compensation was paid to the lawful owners, be they large or small, of the copyright in these films. A person is entitled to payment if one&#x2019;s copyright is transferred or used. This practice, and its extent, has resulted in the provisions of the Berne Convention for the protection of literary, artistic and dramatic works, a convention of which South Africa is a member being violated in a deplorable manner to the detriment of South Africa. The interests of the legal owners and the legal rights of the legal importers of films who have in fact complied with the requirements of the convention have been seriously prejudiced. I now want to inform hon. members that South Africa has the unenviable international reputation, as regards this specific copyright, of being one of the greatest abusers of copyright in films in the world. I would be failing in my duty if I did not, under such circumstances, come to this House with this legislation. Next year I shall introduce legislation to revise the Copyright Act. However, I now have a specific responsibility which I have to fulfil, and I am doing so with the utmost readiness. The reason why I cannot amend the Copyright Act for this purpose is simply because the Copyright Act was drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works. The Republic of South Africa, is, as I have said, a member of this convention. The Copyright Act provides that no formalities may be prescribed for the acquisition of copyright protection in any work, including cinematograph films. The Berne Convention, however, provides that countries may pass legislation which is applicable to their own citizens.</p>

<p>The idea of a Registration of Copyright Bill in respect of films only is therefore to provide, outside the Copyright Act itself, that South African citizens comply with formalities. I hope the hon. member understand the subtle difference. The contemplated legislation is basically applicable to South African citizens. Persons who are not South African citizens are allowed to register voluntarily outside the Berne Convention. This is the technical reason for this legislation. I am not going to take this matter much further, except to say that this legislation is dealing with an abuse. It does not define copyright, does not determine the duration or extent thereof, but deals solely with a voluntary registration of existing rights so that the burden of proof in that regard may be easier. Everyone who has experience of this type of contravention, specifically as far as the cinematograph film industry is concerned, will know that it is virtually impossible to obtain a criminal conviction, because it takes years to collect the necessary evidence and that is of no avail from the civil law aspect, because the burden of proof entails such costs that it does not really in proportion to the damages which people are able to prove. Under the circumstances I want to suggest that this legislation is not perfect. There are various aspects to which hon. members referred, aspects for which we could make provision in the regulations. I shall consider the matter of notification. I concede at once that we are dealing here with a new mechanism of registration for existing rights. Naturally it would be far better if we governed this by way of regulation, than to include it in the legislation now and subsequently find that we cannot enforce the legislation.</p>

<p>I thank hon. members for their support of the Bill and I just want to repeat that the essence of this legislation is an easing of the burden of proof to enforce rights, and not to create rights.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members are aware, I announced in the Press on 22 March 1976 that because it was already clear that the merchant shipping activities would increase considerably within the foreseeable future, the Government had decided that the management and control of the harbour should be transferred from the Department of Industries&#x2014;the present harbour authority&#x2014;to the South African Railways Administration. At this stage I want to point out to hon. members that a further Bill is to be introduced and will appear later on the Order Paper, to empower the S.A. Railways Administration to take over the harbour. At present, the harbour is proclaimed as a harbour in terms of the provisions of the Saldanha Bay Harbour Construction Act, 1973, (Act No. 29 of 1973) and in order to make possible the proclamation and management thereof as a merchant harbour in terms of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act, 1957, certain amendments to the Saldanha Bay Harbour Construction Bill&#x2014;in fact those envisaged in the Bill we are now considering&#x2014;will have to be effected.</p>

<p>For the information of hon. members I might just mention that a part of the present proclaimed harbour was assigned by the State President to the South African Iron and Steel Industrial Corporation by proclamation in terms of the Saldanha Bay Harbour Construction Act of 1973 and that at the moment, Iscor is undertaking the construction of the harbour works required for the ore export project in this portion of the harbour which has been assigned to it.</p>

<p>The proposed transfer of control to the South African Railways Administration, as well as the proposed amendments, envisage the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> and the entrenchment of Iscor&#x2019;s position, to enable it to finalize this project and control and manage the works in so far as these are Iscor&#x2019;s concern.</p>

<p>I now want to refer briefly to the clauses. Clause 1 of the Bill envisages the adjustment of the present definition of &#x201C;Harbour&#x201D; which will result in the provisions of the Saldanha Bay Harbour Construction Act, after the amendment, being applicable only in that portion of the harbour assigned by the State President in terms of section 2(1)(b) of the Act.</p>

<p>Furthermore, clause 1 also inserts definitions in respect of the concepts &#x201C;administration&#x201D;, &#x201C;subsidiary company&#x201D; and &#x201C;Corporation&#x201D; which are now necessary.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<p>The harbour works that Iscor is building in that portion of the harbour assigned to Iscor in terms of section 2(1) of the Act, are being erected and will be maintained by the Corporation at its own expense. It is therefore deemed necessary to supplement the authority of the State President by including the terms &#x201C;position&#x201D; and &#x201C;maintenance&#x201D; in its assignment to the Corporation in terms of section 2.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is deemed necessary to add a proviso to section 2(1) of the existing Act to put it beyond all doubt that the repeal of the proclamation in terms of section 2 of the Act&#x2014;in order to enable the Railways Administration to make the necessary arrangements for the proclamation of the harbour as a merchant harbour&#x2014;will not detract from the assignment of a portion of the harbour to Iscor by the State President in terms of section 2 of the existing Act.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<p>Because the harbour works built by Iscor, as well as the dredging work within the protected section of the harbour undertaken by Iscor, will be to the benefit of any development of, for example, a merchant harbour or ship repair wharf within the protected section of the harbour, section 3 of the existing Act makes provision whereby the Minister may provide <span class="col_7435-7436" refersTo="page_1048"/>that any other person who may be benefited by such harbour works or maintenance work will make a proportional contribution towards the financing thereof.</p>

<p>Clause 3 envisages the amendment of section 3 of the Act to include also financing costs in regard to the concepts &#x201C;management, control, possession and maintenance&#x201D; in the section and, with a view to the take-over by the South African Railways Administration at a later stage of certain harbour works such as the breakwater between Hoedjiespunt and Marcus Island, also includes the State as a party in the scope of the provisions of section 3.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now want to refer to clause 4 and 5. Section 4 of the existing Act provides the powers of the corporation to construct, equip, manage, possess and maintain the part of the harbour assigned to it, while section 5 of the existing Act empowers the Minister of Economic Affairs to promulgate the regulations which may be required for the efficient management and control of the harbour or any specific part of the harbour, including control over the movement of ships within the harbour or any specific part of the harbour.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the South African Railways Administration will administer the port in terms of the harbour regulations promulgated in terms of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidated) Act, 1957, it is necessary that sections 4 and 5 of the Act be amended as proposed in clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill to avoid a duplication of statutory provisions. As hon. members will notice, these amendments concern matters of an administrative nature regarding the management of the port.</p>

<p>As regards the provisions contained in clauses 4(f) and (g), I wish to point out that in view of the establishment of a steel factory by Iscor at Saldanha and the export of the products of this factory through the Saldanha Bay harbour, provision must be made that a subsidiary company of the corporation be in a position to utilize the powers of the corporation within the part of the harbour assigned to the corporation for this purpose.</p>

<p>Furthermore and in accordance with the Government&#x2019;s decision that provision be made that the Sishen-Saldanha railway line in consultation with the South African Railways Administration be utilized for the conveyance of public traffic, section 4(3) of the existing Act is amended to provide that the Iscor harbour works may also be utilized for traffic other than Iscor traffic as may be agreed upon with the South African Railways Administration.</p>

<p>Clause 6 of the Bill contains a consequential amendment to the long title of the existing Act.</p>

<p>In conclusion I now refer to clause 7. The existing Act came into operation on 5 April 1973, but the harbour could only be proclaimed and a portion assigned to the corporation in terms of Act 29 of 1973, after extensive survey work which was not foreseen and which included the surveying of the highwater mark of the entire protected part of the harbour.</p>

<p>However, as Iscor and its contractors commenced with their operations within the harbour soon after the promulgation of the Act, it is not unreasonable that their interest in this regard should be protected and that provision be made as proposed in clause 7 of the Bill that the relevant proclamation be deemed to have come into operation on the date of the commencement of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Clause 8 contains the short title.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill which is now under consideration by the House is the second of a trinity of Bills in which Iscor has been involved. It is only right that we should recall the tremendous South African venture which is of such great economic importance to our country, the Sishen-Saldanha railway line to ship ore from Iscor&#x2019;s installation at Sishen to overseas countries, and which has resulted in the necessity for the construction of the development works in the Saldanha Bay harbour area. We should recognize very pertinently that Saldanha Bay is one of the great harbour bays of the world. In fact, it is possibly one of the largest natural harbours of the world. When the development of the Sishen-Saldanha railway line took place Iscor undertook the construction of the necessary harbour works in order to ensure the smooth shipment of the ore in major ore carriers. As a result it has now been foreseen that with the recognition of this fact, the Sishen-Saldanha railway line will either be a dual purpose or a multi-purpose railway line largely for the shipment of ore. <span class="col_7437-7438" refersTo="page_1049"/>The situation with regard to the harbour itself has come under review and there was an explanatory memorandum to the Saldanha Bay Harbour Acquisition and Equipment Bill, 1976, in which the comment is as follows and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Arising from a decision of the Cabinet, the railway line between Sishen and Saldanha will be used as a multi-purpose line. Accordingly it has become clear that the new harbour at Saldanha Bay will develop into a commercial harbour earlier than originally anticipated and that general working cargo as well as shipping will increase at that port. The Railway Administration will therefore be obliged to take over responsibility for control, and in due course the operation of the harbour and the jurisdiction over this area will have to be obtained.</block>

<p>If one could see a plan of the harbour, one would realize that the total harbour area is larger than the harbour of New York or larger than the harbour area of Rotterdam or Amsterdam. So, we are dealing with a very considerable area. This area is not necessarily to be controlled by Iscor as such. When one takes the details of the Bill under consideration into account, it will be seen, on consulting the chart, that the area of jurisdiction over which Iscor will now have possession and maintenance rights, is limited virtually to the quay walls and the quay service of the construction which they have undertaken, a very expensive construction, but of necessity a physical construction jutting out from the shore into the harbour area itself. As we see it, the Bill provides that the Department of Economic Affairs is going to assign various rights over the port area to the railways, to Iscor and possibly later on to further private enterprise in the event of private enterprise undertaking the construction of a dry-dock.</p>

<p>We believe, in view of the fact that Iscor has undertaken tremendous capital expenditure in the development of this major enterprise, that the building works have already been completed at the expense of Iscor, that we can go along with the Government in their concept that Iscor should be left in control and possession of the maintenance rights for the physical area from which they will be shipping ore. We do believe that with the development of the harbour as such, it is only logical that in the wider sense the control of the harbour as such will pass to the S.A. Railways and Harbours and that this Bill is giving implementation to this fact. At this stage we are a little concerned about the question: under whose authority will the old and historic fishing harbour come when the Bill goes through. This harbour has been in existence for over 100 years, and today, with the development of the fishing industry and the crayfish industry as such, it is quite a considerable fishing harbour. We are also concerned about the fact that the Bill makes no mention of the sea area just off-shore of the existing prescribed harbour limits, which usually have to be prescribed because one cannot have tankers or other heavy shipping anchoring in the entrance to the harbour thereby disturbing shipping as such.</p>

<p>We believe that the Bill is not the last word in the history of the development of Saldanha Bay, nor in the history of the development of the Iscor projects along the shores of Saldanha Bay. What we are seeing here at the moment is, in our belief, a necessary development which was foreseen by hon. members of this side of the House when the original Bill was passed. We believed, too, that this Bill foresees the development of the harbour as being of tremendous interest to the Northern Cape as a growth point. It is our belief that this Bill carries the goodwill of the Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Industries, and we are therefore going to support the Government in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately we cannot share in the support of this Bill by hon. members to the right of us. This is a question that has been coming up over a considerable period of time and has not finally been put to rest in the sense that there is still farther legislation to come. What this Bill is simply doing, however, as preceding Bills have done and as subsequent Bills will do, is to try to clear up the muddle in the division of responsibility between Iscor and the S.A. Railways and Harbours. On the one hand the S.A. Railways and Harbours, as we now know, has surrendered its right to the railway line, which has gone through various stages to become a multi-purpose line, and now the hon. the Minister introduces this piece of legislation which states, in effect, that the developments at Saldanha Bay have got to the stage where <span class="col_7439-7440" refersTo="page_1050"/>we should have a commercial harbour. He then goes part of the way and says that if that is so, clearly the harbour should be handed over to the S.A. Railways and Harbours. I was careful to say &#x201C;part of the way&#x201D; because if he had gone the whole way we would have had no trouble in supporting this Bill, just as we would have had no trouble if the S.A. Railways had been given the management of a multi-purpose railway line. This is clearly the best solution in the interests of the country, and indeed I would have thought in the interests of the taxpayer, for the S.A. Railways to be totally responsible both for the harbour and for the railway line. If one looks at this Bill one sees fairly clear areas, mentioned in the Bill, which are likely to introduce a degree of inefficiency which would not otherwise be present if the harbour were quite rightly run <i>in toto</i> by the S.A. Railways, or indeed if the harbour and the railway line were run by one other party&#x2014;i.e. Iscor&#x2014;which would, of course, be wrong. Having both run by the S.A. Railways would clearly result in a more efficient management of the situation.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the fact that there are going to be certain areas of potential conflict of interests, on occasion, between the S.A. Railways and Harbours representing other parties on the one hand, and Iscor representing itself and on occasion, as mentioned in this Bill, representing other people. Apart from that main principle as a reason why we cannot support this Bill, there are three particular areas where we have grave reservations. I want to refer to the proviso to the proposed new section 3, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that if anything financed by the Corporation as aforesaid, is for the common benefit of the Corporation and the State or any other person, the State and such other person shall be obliged to contribute, in accordance with a ratio determined by the Minister, to the costs financed by the Corporation as aforesaid.</block>

<p>In principle we have no objection to that, but we would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he is going to have considerable difficulties, in practice, in arriving at what is an equitable ratio between Iscor on the one hand and the other parties on the other. Clause 4(e) also states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the substitution for paragraph (j) of subsection (1) of the following paragraph:</block>

<ol>

<li>(j) to fix and from time to time to alter wharf dues, rates and other dues and charges at the harbour.</li>

</ol>

<p>As we understand this&#x2014;and I would appreciate confirmation from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;this refers to Iscor in relation to the part of the harbour assigned to it. There again we have some difficulties. Clearly there is a possibility that there might be a difference between what is charged in the other section of the harbour, run by the S.A. Railways, and what Iscor will want to charge in its so-called private reserve. I now wish to refer to clause 4(3), which only goes to reinforce our objections to this Bill. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The powers conferred by this section shall be exercised by the Corporation for its own purposes or for the purposes of any subsidiary company of the Corporation&#x2026;</block>

<p>That we have no problem with&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or for the handling of any other traffic agreed upon with the Administration only.</block>

<p>Not only has Iscor financed part of the harbour, therefore being entitled to retain the management, possession and control of it, but here we are again falling into the same old trap we fell into in respect of the railway line. We are saying that Iscor can handle other people&#x2019;s goods and services through its part of the harbour. We find this very difficult to take. The hon. the Minister quoted figures in the Other Place. I hope he will correct me if I am wrong, but he said that the total expenditure&#x2014;and that is on the whole Saldana Bay complex&#x2014;was made up as follows: The railway system R378 million&#x2014;a fact which is not a subject for debate here&#x2014;the harbour R129 million and the ore-handling installations at the harbour R35 million. That gives a total of R164 million.</p>

<p>Then he made mention of R48 million as interest up to 30 June 1976. If one roughly <i>pro rates</i> that, R16 million then relates to the harbour and ore-handling facilities, and one arrives at a total of R180 million. Our feeling about this piece of legislation is that because the hon. the Minister is moving money from <span class="col_7441-7442" refersTo="page_1051"/>one pocket to another, both pockets being filled by the taxpayer ultimately, why does he not simply move R180 million to the South African Railways from the Treasury, that is put that money up and take Iscor out of the harbour, which will also help Iscor in its financing difficulties, so that we will then have a completely cohesive unit run under one management? If the hon. the Minister would do that, we would have greater confidence in the management of this particular harbour in future. Naturally we would have liked him to do the same as far as the railway line is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Johannesburg North is taking up a very strange attitude towards this Bill. In fact, he has just about argued round a full circle and at the end of it, even though he said that he was opposed to the Bill, many of his arguments were actually in favour of the legislation. In this Bill the Government is assigning Iscor a portion of the Saldanha Bay harbour. In terms of clause 4 Iscor may assign the harbour to a subsidiary company which holds out prospects to foreign shareholders and to private shareholders, perhaps, to participate. I would have thought this is a matter which the hon. member for Johannesburg North would have welcomed. However, obviously he is against the prospect of foreign shareholding or perhaps private enterprise participating. If he were in favour of it, he should have stated his case.</p>

<p>The other fact is that obviously the S.A. Railways and Harbours has come to the conclusion at this stage that the scheme of Iscor is not viable enough to embark upon. Therefore it would not like to involve taxpayers&#x2019; money and it would not like to hold the taxpayers responsible for that particular scheme. I know that Iscor itself is to a large extent financed by the taxpayers, but at least it generates, if I may use such a term, some of the risk capital that is needed. It also has the opportunity of taking in partners, both foreign and local, and in addition to that, its partners and itself are aware of the risk factor. All new ventures have a risk factor and our Railways and Harbours Administration obviously cannot take the risks that Iscor is prepared to take. Iscor can act as entrepreneur to a far greater extent than the Railways and Harbours Administration can. If the Railways and Harbours Administration does not want to take the risk, then I want to know why the hon. member for Johannesburg North wants to compel it to take the risk. The hon. member for Johannesburg has only one possible leg to stand on and that is if he argued that the Railways and Harbours Administration in fact wants to undertake this particular expenditure which I believe may be in the vicinity of approximately R130 million. However, obviously the Railways and Harbours Administration does not want to embark upon this particular expenditure and as such I do not see why the hon. member for Johannesburg North wants to compel it to undertake this expenditure.</p>

<p>I am confident that the Railways would not want to undertake it, but the hon. member for Johannesburg North and the Progs are using this argument in their opposition to the Bill as a mere publicity stunt. Iscor is committed to mammoth projects and, indeed, needs very large finance for this particular project. There are many aspects of Iscor&#x2019;s operations of which we as an Opposition are most critical, but I feel that as at the moment there is a great shortage of funds, it is essential that we do everything possible, everything in our power to facilitate this particular scheme. For the Progs now to be a fly in the ointment, is typical of what we have come to expect of them.</p>

<p>I am told it is a Prog in the pickle!</p>

<p>This measure is yet another one which is designed to bring about greater certainty to the Saldanha Bay scheme. We hope that Iscor will operate its portion of the harbour most successfully and that it will become very viable. The totality of the entire scheme opens up a new world for that region and, indeed, for South Africa and we wish Iscor the greatest of success.</p>

<p>We should like to have more information and greater detail as to what is exactly planned by Iscor and what the total cost of the entire scheme will amount to. Under clause 4 <span class="col_7443-7444" refersTo="page_1052"/>provision is made for a subsidiary company and the corporation may form a subsidiary company for this purpose which may construct, equip, control, manage, possess and maintain the harbour. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has specific partners in mind for Iscor and whether he is prepared to make a statement in that regard. Will the hon. the Minister also give us the assurance that however the shares in the subsidiary company are allocated and whatever happens, the majority shareholding will be under South African control? We should also like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he would welcome private participation from South Africans in the subsidiary company. I should like also to ask the hon. the Minister how the Iscor portion of the harbour will affect the anticipated semis plant and possibly the dry dock facilities. What is the anticipated cost of all these schemes? Will Iscor be entitled to charge whatever tariffs it wants?</p>

<p>I should like to raise a few matters in regard to the tariffs because I consider them most important. Will the hon. the Minister give us the assurance that there will be no loss to Port Elizabeth in regard to ore presently going to that part? Will the hon. the Minister tell us precisely how the tariffs will differ when private enterprise uses Port Elizabeth as opposed to Saldanha? What will the difference be in the tariffs payable by Iscor to itself as opposed to the tarrifs applicable to private enterprise using Saldanha? We want an assurance from the hon. the Minister that at no time will he tolerate a situation where Iscor or Saldanha operates in a way which will affect Port Elizabeth adversely. We fully realize that Iscor has made an enormous investment in Saldanha. Obviously Iscor will expect a return on this tremendous investment. Therefore, whilst Iscor will, in terms of this Bill, be entitled to call upon others using its facilities to pay for those facilities, and whilst we wish Iscor every success, the hon. the Minister will realize that he has to perform in a dual capacity. The hon. the Minister is the boss, if I may say so, of Iscor&#x2014;Iscor falls under him and he is responsible, to a large extent, for the success of Iscor. We realize that he has to do his duty in so far as Iscor is concerned. On the other hand the hon. the Minister, in another capacity, is the guarantor of free enterprise and he is also responsible for ensuring that established areas are not penalized in circumstances such as we have at present. In conclusion I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to ensure that the vested interests of the Port Elizabeth area are not adversely affected.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to reply briefly to hon. members&#x2019; speeches on this Bill. An important question put to me by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens, was who would be in control of the fishing harbour at Saldanha. In this connection I should like to explain that this forms part of the harbour which will be transferred to the South African Railways in terms of the Act As soon as transfer has been taken, however, it will once again be proclaimed a fishing harbour in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1973, which will fall under the control of my department. In other words, there will ultimately be no change in the <i>de facto</i> situation.</p>

<p>I should like to thank hon. members for their support of the legislation. I shall come to the standpoint of the hon. member for Johannesburg North in a moment. I think it is important that, as the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens said, in accepting the legislation, we are actually giving our final endorsement to a very great development in our country, which, I believe, may make a special contribution towards the development of the geographical area which we call the West Coast, but also to the western part of the Northern Cape, the potential of which, I believe, will ultimately find an outlet through this harbour.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North naturally objected to the legislation. He could not do otherwise if he wanted to be consistent. He opposed the legislation in connection with the railway line and therefore he naturally had no other choice than to oppose this legislation too. I want to tell him at once that I understand his arguments, although I cannot agree with them. I want to tell him once again that I do not agree with him that the legislation before us and what he calls the divided control over the harbour, need result in a lack of efficiency. I think that when mature people&#x2014;I shall <span class="col_7445-7446" refersTo="page_1053"/>understand if the hon. members on the other side have difficulty in defining the concept of &#x201C;maturity&#x201D;&#x2014;co-operate, it need not lead to inefficiency. It is only in an atmosphere of that kind that this type of co-operation may naturally lead to inefficiency.</p>

<p>As far as the tariffs are concerned, I have already explained what the position with the railway line will be. The same principle also holds for the handling of ore. Let me make it very clear that the first principle of this Bill is that the harbour will also be made a general harbour. As far as the handling of general freight in the harbour is concerned, the idea is that this will be done by the South African Railways. Naturally Iscor will retain control over that section of the harbour, specifically the wharf, which is concerned with the export of ore. The tariffs to be paid by other exporters who make use of this harbour will be arranged in collaboration with the South African Railway Administration, as in the case of the railway line. The important point is that no other exporter of ore will be prejudiced by making use of the facilities concerned. I cannot take the matter any further than that with the hon. members of the PRP.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer asked me certain questions which I should like to answer as far as I can. I have already indicated&#x2014;the hon. member for Johannesburg North also quoted this&#x2014;that the total cost of the scheme, which includes the railway line from Sishen to Saldanha, is expected to be as follows, estimated on the basis of June 1976 price levels: The railway system, R378 million; the harbour itself, R129 million; the installation for handling ore at the harbour, R35 million; and the total interest, R48 million. The total estimated cost of the scheme therefore amounts to R590 million. Allow me to mention in passing that in my opinion it is an achievement that both the harbour and its connection to the island, as well as the railway line, were completed in time. As far as I am concerned, a word of congratulation and appreciation should be addressed to the bodies responsible for this. The hon. member asked me who the proposed partners of Iscor were. The hon. member has already asked me questions in this connection, both during this and during previous sittings. However, he will just have to accept that&#x2014;as I have indicated before&#x2014;I am not able to give these particulars at this stage.</p>

<p>So she does not want to sign?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am still coming to that. The hon. member is still very young. He will remember that she did not say yes straight away. I do not know whether she wants to sign or not. However, I want to indicate that these negotiations between the proposed partners and the scheme have reached a very delicate stage. The hon. member will also understand that various countries are concerned in this, various countries with various ideologies. He will understand what I mean. Therefore I do not believe it to be in the interests, firstly of the scheme&#x2014;something which we all want&#x2014;and secondly, of the country as a whole, for me to make any statement at this stage. However, I undertake towards the hon. member, as well as towards the hon. House, that as soon as I am in a position to make a statement on the matter, I shall make full particulars available to hon. members and to the country in general. The only thing which prevents me from speculating about the matter at this stage is the fact that I believe that the negotiations are at a sensitive, delicate stage and that for this reason I ought not to say anything about it now, here in the House or outside, which may cause the negotiations to fail. I hope that the hon. member will accept this explanation.</p>

<p>In general I just want to say that if this scheme comes to fruition&#x2014;and I have every confidence it will&#x2014;it will not only create opportunities for that particular part of our country, but will also create great opportunities in the Saldanha area. As a result it is expected that, should either we or Iscor be successful, this scheme will earn a net amount of R12 000 000 000 in foreign currency for us over a period of 20 years. This is entirely in line with the Government&#x2019;s declared intention of following a policy of processing minerals so that the country will not have to export raw material only, but will be able to export labour as well; just as we often import from other countries.</p>

<p>Furthermore the hon. member asked me&#x2014;I immediately want to add that he is a spokesman for the Eastern Cape; I also come from the Eastern Cape, from the George district&#x2014; what the position would be concerning tariffs between Sishen and Saldanha and between Sishen and Port Elizabeth. I have already said something about this before. However, I want <span class="col_7447-7448" refersTo="page_1054"/>to repeat it tonight. The tariffs for third-party traffic&#x2014;that is traffic apart from that of Iscor on the Sishen/Saldanha railway line&#x2014;will be determined in co-operation with the S.A. Railways and will be applied in consultation with these two authorities. I want to add that there are two principles which will be applied as far as this is concerned. The first principle is that Iscor will not transport goods on its railway line at a loss. What is worrying the hon. member, I believe, is that the tariffs for the Sishen/Saldanha section may be lower than those between Sishen and Port Elizabeth. The first point is that there is a cost factor involved. Iscor cannot subsidize tariffs &#x2026;</p>

<p>It cannot be lower. There ought to be an element of reassurance in this for the hon. member. I believe he knows what the present position is as far as transport of ore between Sishen and Port Elizabeth is concerned. The second principle is that we want to avoid favouring the one line above the other as far as possible. Allow me to say in this particular connection that we are concerned here not only with the tariffs for the line itself, we are also concerned with the tariffs for handling ore within the harbours, here and on the other side. We shall do everything in our power to ensure that the exporters of ore, whether to Port Elizabeth or from Sishen to Saldanha, will compete with one another on an equal footing. I do not think I can take that assurance any further at this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as hon. members know, gold mines classified as assisted gold mines in terms of section 2 of the Gold Mines Assistance Act, 1968, are assisted by the State. A company which carries on gold-mining operations can apply to the Minister to be classified as an assisted gold mine, and only under certain circumstances, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, and having regard to any recommendations made by the Mining Leases Board, is a mine classified as an assisted gold mine.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Section 3(1) of the Act provides that a company which has during any year of assessment carried on gold-mining operations on an assisted gold mine, shall in certain circumstances be paid a certain amount out of funds voted by Parliament, but in terms of the proviso to section 3(1), the amount paid to such company in respect of any year of assessment shall not exceed 25&#x0025; of the mining income derived by it during the year of assessment from sales of gold and uranium. The State is therefore obliged to pay a producing assisted gold mine, depending on its mining profit or mining loss, a certain amount calculated according to a formula prescribed by section 3(1), but the amount must not exceed 25&#x0025; of the mining income. It also follows that the maximum amount any assisted gold mine can receive from the State during any year of assessment, is 25&#x0025; of its gold or uranium sales during that year.</p>

<p>*Owing to the increase in the price of gold during the financial year of 1974-&#x2019;75, only five gold mines received a total amount of R1,187 million in State assistance in terms of the Act during that financial year. However, the price of gold dropped so sharply during the financial year of 1975-&#x2019;76 and there was such an increase in the production costs that an amount of almost R20 million had to be voted by way of assistance to 13 assisted gold mines. If the gold price does not improve substantially and the production costs continue to increase at the present rate, it is anticipated that approximately nine assisted gold mines will have to be paid a total amount of approximately R44,5 million in terms of the Act during the financial year of 1976-&#x2019;77. Hon. members will therefore agree with me that further drops in the gold price and increases in the production costs could push up the amount of the assistance <span class="col_7449-7450" refersTo="page_1055"/>considerably, and as I have said, the State is forced, in terms of the present provisions of the Act, to pay the assistance.</p>

<p>The position may arise, therefore, that the assistance rendered to assisted gold mines may impose a constantly increasing financial obligation on the State. There are no legal provisions in terms of which the assistance can be limited any further, for as I have said, it is anticipated that if the present circumstances continue, the State will have to pay an amount of R44,5 million in assistance during the financial year of 1976-&#x2019;77, and this in spite of the fact that the assistance is at present limited in terms of the Act to a maximum amount of 25&#x0025; of the mining income.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Hon. members may ask whether legislation enabling the Minister to limit the amount of assistance is necessary in view of the fact that an assisted mine may be declassified as such in terms of section 2(5) of the Act, as amended in 1975. May I point out that an assisted gold mine cannot be declassified by the Minister of Mines without regard being had to certain circumstances set out in the Act, such as the quantity of gold or uranium being won and the quantities and grades of ores being mined and milled by such mine. Since the date of promulgation of the amending Act of 1975, three assisted gold mines have been notified of their declassification.</p>

<p>*Consequently there is no legal machinery for keeping within reasonable bounds, when circumstances so require, the assistance to assisted gold mines which cannot be declassified. For this reason, the Bill which is now being submitted for consideration is intended to enable the Minister of Mines, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and having regard to any recommendation made by the Mining Leases Board, to limit further the maximum amount in assistance received from the State by an assisted gold mine in terms of the proviso to section 3(1) of the Act. The additional limitation which is now being proposed is not automatically applicable to all assisted gold mines, but the smaller percentage by means of which the lower maximum amount is calculated, will be determined in respect of each mine individually. It is also being provided in the Bill that the smaller percentage than the 25&#x0025;, as determined by the Minister, will apply only for a specific year of assessment, and that a mining company must be notified six months before the commencement of that specific year of assessment in respect of which such smaller percentage will be applicable.</p>

<p>As hon. members will notice, the amendment to section 6(2)(a) of the Act is necessary in consequence of the amendment to section 3(1).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I say at once that we on this side of the House support the Bill that has just been introduced by the hon. the Minister. Quite clearly the Gold Mining Assistance Act has been of enormous value to the gold-mining industry and to the country as a whole in that it has assisted the gold mines, at a time when the price of gold was insufficient to sustain a fully viable industry, to continue producing gold, to continue producing foreign exchange and to continue to produce the means which are needed by South Africa in order to sustain its economy. It has contributed a great deal to the conservation of those mines which were not running profitably enough, or which were running too marginally to produce the quantity of gold which they would have been able to produce had the gold price been an economic price, rising with demand and with production costs. It was during this period when the gold-mining industry laboured under a fixed gold price that the Gold Mines Assistance Act made this great contribution to the gold mining industry in South Africa. That legislation was passed and became an Act in 1968 and has been implemented for some considerable time with the results I have described.</p>

<p>Since then, as we all know, the gold-mining situation has changed in consequence of the change in the price of gold. A new set of economic circumstances arose but did not then have to be taken into account in connection with the assistance to gold mines. When that occurred, as the hon. the Minister pointed out, it was not in fact necessary to do anything much about it, because the sudden rise in the price of gold removed practically every gold mine out of the category where it needed assistance. In other words, the price of gold produced its own remedy. However, again things have changed. We are now in a third phase where, in fact, the price of gold has dropped quite considerably from the level it had reached. Inflation has taken a grip on the <span class="col_7451-7452" refersTo="page_1056"/>gold-mining industry, as it has on everything else, and the working costs of mines have increased very substantially.</p>

<p>Something like two months ago I asked for an inquiry to be made into the average working cost per fine ounce of gold in this country. Hon. members will recall that gold was sold by South Africa profitably at &#x0024;35 per fine ounce, subsequently at &#x0024;42&#x00BD; per fine ounce, until a few years ago. If one were to try to sell gold at that price today, I doubt whether a single gold mine in South Africa could do so profitably. In fact, the average working cost per fine ounce of gold is calculated to be something in excess of &#x0024;80. That is the working cost on average in South Africa today. This means that if the price of gold were to drop to the old official price of &#x0024;42&#x00BD; per fine ounce, our gold-mining industry, taken as a whole, would be running at a very considerable loss. The fact is that there are again mines which have become marginal in the present situation. There are many mines, fortunately a majority, which are still mining profitably and are producing gold and uranium at a profit. However, there are some which are again in a very vulnerable position. While maintaining the Gold Mines Assistance Act, the hon. the Minister has, I think rightly, come to this House with an amending Bill which takes account of the changed circumstances applying to the gold-mining industry. The ceiling of mining revenue, i.e. the income of the mine, set at 25&#x0025;, was in fact the maximum amount of aid which could be given to a mine which was in need of such assistance.</p>

<p>In terms of the new provision the Minister may, after due consultation, decide that that maximum should be reduced in the case of certain mines; and furthermore, in terms of clause 2, he may decide that in calculating the amount of assistance that is due, which is based on the profits, account should be taken of the capital expenditure of the mine in such a way as to produce a figure not exceeding the new ceiling that has been established by the Minister after due consultation. This, the Minister has assured us, will be done case by case, with due notice to the mines concerned and with due warning so that there will be no sudden dislocation of the mining industry. We have ourselves had consultations with the interests concerned, and in all the circumstances we feel that the measure which the hon. the Minister is now proposing is not an unreasonable one. It is in fact a necessary adjustment to the changing circumstances of the mining industry, the price of gold and the cost involved in producing gold. For that reason we shall not oppose this Bill. We shall in fact give it free passage through the Second Reading.</p>

<p>This Bill before us and its predecessor are simply a device which has been brought to this House, as I think the hon. the Minister will agree, to help particular categories of mines through a period of bad gold prices in the hope that the price will in time improve and that, once that interim period has passed, there will be benefits to South Africa. The hon. the Minister has asked for a wider discretion, to reduce the limit of 25&#x0025; to such lessor percentage as he may determine. We understand that to mean in effect that the Minister is aiming at the phasing out of assistance to some of the mines which receive assistance from the Government on the present basis. What the Minister is saying, to my mind, is that he wants to have the right to pay a smaller amount where he feels that the larger amount is no longer justified in the present circumstances. As I have said, we have no problem in supporting that, because as we understand it, the conditions which apply to the Minister still mean that he has to be satisfied that any mine which is being given assistance will cease underground mining operations within a period of eight years. In addition, the Minister has to be satisfied that the life of the mine will be appreciably prolonged if he gives it 25&#x0025; or some lesser percentage as he may determine.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not prepared to answer a question now.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Minister has to be satisfied that there will be a significant increase in the <span class="col_7453-7454" refersTo="page_1057"/>production of gold and uranium for the benefit of South Africa. If those three conditions still apply, we shall have no difficulty in supporting this Bill.</p>

<p>I want to say to the Minister, however, that these are very uncertain times when it comes to the question of the gold price, which is basically what this measure is about, and I hope he will treat his discretion, if I may put it that way, with caution. If he looks back at the results of assistance to the gold mines in the past I think he will find that it is something which has been very worthwhile and to the benefit of our country, and that it is something which for once, I am delighted to say, stands to the credit of the Government. I know there is the question of six months&#x2019; notification, etc., but of course one of the critical problems that we face today is the balance of payments situation. As far as the balance of payments is concerned, I want to say that the question of whether the renewal of our expansion is led by exports or whether it is not will depend very greatly at this point in time on the price of gold, because gold means foreign currency to South Africa. I hope that the hon. the Minister will make up his mind after listening to the advice in regard to the various mines so that, when he looks at the present gold price, he will be inclined to take an optimistic point of view in regard to what is going to happen and the likely movement of that price in the future. A delicate balance needs to be struck because we have at this point in time in our country a very low, if not negative, rate of growth.</p>

<p>We have always had two types of mines in this country, viz. the marginal mines and the rich mines. For the hon. the Minister to take too pessimistic a view in so far as the marginal mines are concerned, may throw on to the labour market a very large number of people of all colours in South Africa, principally White and Black, but also Brown. Therefore I hope that the hon. the Minister will have a sense of cautious optimism, because we are now in the run-down, in the lead period, for the first auction to be held by the IMF. I hope that the hon. the Minister will agree with me that when we look at the price of gold, which is of the order of &#x0024;125 to &#x0024;130&#x2014;leaving aside the question of devaluation as far as the rand is concerned&#x2014;that to a very great extent the present price has already discounted those auctions. Therefore, one could also go further and say that we hope that the hon. the Minister will wait before he makes any judgments with regard to this matter until a number of these auctions have been conducted. It seems to us sitting on these benches that there is a probability that despite the actions of the anti-gold faction elsewhere in the world, there are going to be a very considerable number of bidders for gold at those auctions and if that is so, I hope that the hon. the Minister will have the courage to carry us through this period. If he can do so, and if we are correct, then in the future South Africa will benefit a very great deal more than what it would benefit should he give notice to some of the mines which get State assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not really want to make a speech, nor had I intended to make one. I simply wanted to ask the hon. member for Johannesburg North a question, but the hon. member would not reply to it. Consequently I shall put my question to him in the form of a speech. The amending Bill which is before us is concerned with assistance to gold mines. In that respect I just want to ask the hon. member the following question: Does he consider it to be a symbol or a tendency of creeping socialism or a tendency of enlightened capitalism?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members of both parties on the other side for supporting this Bill. There is really nothing that can be added to what has been said, because this is a simple Bill. It merely proposes that the Minister should have the right, in the light of the fluctuations in the price of gold, to assist on a different basis in the future, after their circumstances have been re-examined, the mines we have been able to assist in the past. The Department of Mines and all the parties concerned will have to examine this matter very carefully in the future, and the hon. the Minister of Finance in particular will have to examine it very carefully, because this kind of assistance, which will be of the order of R44 million if we are to make the higher payments during the coming year, is the kind of assistance which can very easily amount to R100 million before you know where you are.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North asked us to be very cautious. Of course we shall be very cautious and the caution will stem from the approach of the Minister of <span class="col_7455-7456" refersTo="page_1058"/>Mines and of all the different parties concerned. I found it interesting to note the way in which the hon. member for Johannesburg North expressed the support of his party. I can understand that. There was a keener interest on the part of the hon. member when we spoke of gold. I do not blame the hon. member. He is very close to the gold mines. He also has a reason for his standpoint, of course. He and his party&#x2014;all of us, in fact&#x2014;have reason to be very grateful for what the State has done in the past to keep the industry going. However, the hon. member must not be quick to support us only when assistance to the gold mines is at stake. There are many other things which he would also do well to support.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The proposed Bill to amend the Uranium Enrichment Act, 1970, is primarily concerned with the financing of the activities of the Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa, Limited.</p>

<p>The existing section 5 of the Uranium Enrichment Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the State is the only shareholder in the corporation. Moreover it also provides that shares in the corporation have to be paid for from moneys appropriated by Parliament for this purpose. In practice, therefore, it means that the State is the only source for the financing of the activities of the corporation.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the corporation on 1 April 1971, but particularly with the recent announcement by my predecessor that the Government was proceeding with a commercial plant, the structure of the corporation has become increasingly industry-orientated. It also goes without saying that the State, for example, cannot finance the construction of a commercial plant solely out of its own resources. Therefore other methods of supplementary financing have to be created, and the most appropriate step is, as in the case of such other corporations as Iscor and Armscor for example, to grant the Uranium Enrichment Corporation the necessary loan powers.</p>

<p>This entails that the Uranium Enrichment Act, 1970, has to be suitably amended, and it is therefore being proposed that section 3 of the Act be supplemented by the insertion of a new subsection 3(1)(h), as set out in clause 1 of the Bill.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As I have said earlier, the State is the only shareholder in the corporation and pays for <span class="col_7457-7458" refersTo="page_1059"/>shares from funds appropriated by Parliament for this purpose This entails, in practice, that for all moneys received from the State, whether for capital or running expenditure, shares are to be issued to the State.</p>

<p>However, the question has arisen whether shares should also be issued to the State in respect of the operational cost of the pilot plant, which is solely regarded as a running ost and which can only, to a small extent, be covered by the sale of the product of this plant. It would seem more appropriate that such expenditure, which can mainly be regarded as research and running costs, should be financed in another way, for instance by an annual appropriation from the State Revenue Fund for which shares would not be issued. This matter has been discussed between officials of the corporation and the Treasury and the conclusion was reached that expenditure for the running of the pilot plant, as well as for research and development purposes in connection with the commercial plant, could more appropriately be defrayed from moneys appropriated by Parliament for this purpose without shares being issued. This would also provide for a more direct control by Parliament over such expenditure.</p>

<p>*The acceptance of the above-mentioned basis makes it essential, however, that money which has already been received by the corporation and for which shares have been issued to the State, should be re-allocated in order to place this expenditure in respect of the pilot plant in its correct perspective. It has consequently been decided to accept the basis that the construction of the pilot plant in general be regarded as the acquisition of a capital asset, and that all moneys made available to the corporation up to 31 March 1975 should therefore be regarded as share capital. Moneys which were, or are being made available after 31 March 1975 for the completion and putting into operation of the pilot plant are being dealt with in the accounts in the same manner. All other moneys which have been, or are being made available to the corporation since 1 April 1975, whether these were intended for the operation of the pilot plant or for research and development costs in respect of a commercial plant, or for the general administration of the corporation, are regarded as running costs for which shares are not issued. In future, therefore, such moneys will be appropriated separately for this purpose by Parliament. In order to implement this new policy, it will, however, be necessary to supplement the existing section 5 of the Uranium Enrichment Act, 1970, by substituting a new subsection (4), as contained in clause 2 of the Bill, for the existing subsection (4).</p>

<p>In addition it is also necessary to insert an additional new section 5A as set out in clause 3 of the Bill, since funds which have already been approved under the existing Act with effect from 1 April 1975 to 31 March 1977, pursuant to the amended policy, are deemed to be funds which, besides being appropriated for share capital, will also be appropriated for current expenditure in respect of research and development, as well as administrative costs. These appropriations therefore serve to augment the funds which, to a small extent, will be obtained by the corporation from the sale of the product of the pilot plant.</p>

<p>Since it may also be expected that the institutions from which money is lent will insist that the State underwrite the repayments of the capital sum and the interest on such loans, which are raised by the corporation, the necessary provision is also being made in the Act now, through the insertion of a new section 7A, as embodied in clause 4 of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill is the fourth Bill since 1970 dealing with the Uranium Enrichment Corporation and its work. The original Bill was introduced in 1970. There as an amendment in 1971 by way of the Finance Act, and a further amendment in 1974. This Bill is therefore the fourth Bill before the House in regard to an undertaking in this country that has not yet got beyond the pilot stage. It is quite clear that the difficulties or uncertainties in legislation that have arisen in connection with uranium enrichment are of course due to the fact that we are dealing with a new business which, to some extent, is unpredictable. It is therefore not unreasonable that, with growing experience and a growing realization of what is involved in this kind of development, changes should be made in the legislation. However, it is also clear from the attention and concern that comes through in this frequently revised legislation that we are dealing with something that is not only important from a strategic point of view, but is <span class="col_7459-7460" refersTo="page_1060"/>also going to be very important from a financial point of view. I would hesitate to predict a figure, but perhaps we can get some idea by looking at the costs of enrichment plants in other countries. Some of them, in the case of America for instance, run into sums as great as 2 000 million US dollars some 25 or 30 years ago. Having regard to inflation, the changing value of money and even allowing for the economy to be achieved in respect of the particular type of enrichment which is proposed to be conducted in South Africa, it is easy enough to predict that the eventual cost of a commercial enrichment plant is going to be a very large amount indeed. There is no question about that. It is going to be a figure that will stagger the imagination of many South African when it finally comes to be counted. In view of the kind of money that is involved, decisions and policies have to be determined not in isolation, but as part of a broad spectrum of energy policy in the country as a whole. We are not specifically spending any money tonight by approving this Bill, but we are looking at a structure of expenditure which threatens to involve a very large amount indeed. When we look at this kind of structure, it is right that we should at least stop for a few moments&#x2014;without venturing into irrelevance so far as the Bill is concerned&#x2014;to ask ourselves exactly what we are doing and how we are doing it.</p>

<p>I would suggest that it is time for South Africa to stop and take stock of its whole energy policy. Before we commit ourselves to one particular line of expenditure and another particular line of development&#x2014;I have in mind, particularly, enrichment and the large sums of money it will involve&#x2014;it is necessary that we take a look at our energy policy as a whole. That was, in fact, the recommendation of the Petrick Commission on the coal industry which tabled its report in Parliament not very long ago. Without taking up too much time of the House, I should like to read very briefly two extracts. The first is taken from a speech made by a United States Senator shortly after the Opec situation created an oil crisis. The Senator said the following of his own country&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Present public policies towards energy are so fragmented and inconsistent and administered by so many different agencies of government that it might truthfully be said that this country has no energy policy at all. Some policy must be established which will permit the managers of the various fuel industries to plan nationally for the critical years ahead.</block>

<p>Since that time the Americans have in fact established a national energy policy. It is a recommendation of the Petrick Commission that such a policy is urgently necessary also in South Africa. I quote from the Petrick Commission&#x2019;s report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Commission is of the opinion that a permanent, full-time energy planning and co-ordinating board should be established, more or less on the lines of the Board of Trade and Industries.</block>

<p>I shall take it no further than that. Let me merely say to the hon. the Minister, who has quite considerable responsibilities in respect of energy, particularly nuclear energy, that with due respect to him it is hardly possible to conduct a sensible, logical and comprehensive debate on energy matters in this House when they are so fragmented between different departments. Let me give one example. When one discusses uranium enrichment, which is of strategic importance to this country&#x2019;s power policy or energy policy and is therefore not only an export prospect, one has to take into account the development of nuclear power projects in this country. We have in mind for example, the Koeberg power station, tenders for which are to be adjudicated in the very near future. Koeberg power station falls under Escom, and Escom falls under the Minister of Economic Affairs. Therefore I am not entitled to talk to the hon. Minister for Mines about Koeberg, because it is not within his competence to discuss a nuclear power station, even though he, as Minister of Mines, is responsible for uranium enrichment. It is a ridiculous and absurd situation, and it will be impossible to conduct debates in this hon. House satisfactorily and adequately on energy policy for South Africa as long as this fragmentation exists in the conduct of energy policies by the Government.</p>

<p>Having said that, I want to come back to the Bill and to deal specifically with the financial provision that exists. The Bill before us tonight deals with three kinds of finance, essentially three kinds of money which will accrue to the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. <span class="col_7461-7462" refersTo="page_1061"/>The first kind of money is loan money. Provision is made for the Uranium Enrichment Corporation to borrow money from other sources. I believe that a good deal of that money will be borrowed from abroad. In time to come, the Uranium Enrichment Corporation will have to start concluding contracts for the sale of its products. A number of the countries which require enriched uranium, and have no uranium enrichment facilities of their own, are already being tied up in contracts for future years with the countries which are in a position now to supply enriched uranium. The time will come for South Africa also to commit itself to certain contracts, or to take advantage of certain long-term agreements with certain countries. This could possibly be done as part of a loan arrangement. If a foreign country were to lend South Africa a large amount of money to be employed for the development of this very costly project, it might in fact be repaid in due course by means of uranium enriched in this plant. This is the kind of project that one might have to have in view. However, the fact is that a new provision has been made for the Uranium Enrichment Corporation, a provision which did not exist before, namely that it may receive moneys by way of loans.</p>

<p>The second provision that has been made, which existed before but is being slightly altered, is that capital expenditure will be provided for by share issues. These share issues will, as before, be taken up by the Government. We have raised, in other debates on uranium enrichment in this House, the question as to whether, as in some other countries, a part of the share capital should not be issued and sold to other interested parties, and as to whether it is in fact necessary for the State to hold 100&#x0025; of the shares in the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. If security is the concern, I want to point out that, in the United Kingdom for example, the State holds 51&#x0025; of the shares in a similar type of enterprise in the related nuclear fuels enterprise, and is prepared to allow 49&#x0025; of the shares to go into the hands of other companies, private enterprises participating in this kind of business. However, this is something that will have to be looked at again, because I think it is wrong that the State should carry the whole burden of financing something to which private enterprise, in future years, might in fact make a very valuable contribution.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of running expenses. These have now been separated in the way which appears in this Bill&#x2014;in clause 3&#x2014;in terms of which there will be an annual appropriation by this Parliament in order that the expenses, which the hon. the Minister has defined&#x2014;I think he said it would be mainly concerned with the running of the pilot plant&#x2014;will be classified as running expenses, as distinct from the building of the commercial plant, which will be classified as capital expenditure. This is a rational separation, but we are not happy about the second subsection of clause 3, which provides that any unexpended surplus in respect of the appropriated moneys, i.e. the moneys appropriated annually by Parliament for running expenses, shall at the end of any particular financial year of the corporation be carried forward to the succeeding financial year. The hon. the Minister will know that it is the financial practice of this House, as far as possible, that when it appropriates annual moneys for any Government department, and indeed, for other Government utilities or businesses, to require any excess of money unused at the end of the financial year to be returned, and that Parliament has then to be requested to provide a new sum of money to be employed in the ensuing financial year. The reason why this is done is simply because it is a good financial practice which enables Parliament to exercise a higher degree of control over the money which it votes every year. Sir, I think it is particularly important in the case of the Uranium Enrichment Corporation that we should be cautious about how we spend money, firstly because, as I have said, the amount of money can be very large over the years. Secondly, as the constant amendments to the Act have shown, we are dealing with a largely unpredictable type of business of which we have no long experience.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is now introduced into this financial concept the idea that the Uranium Corporation may also raise loans. Clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill do distinguish, rightly, between capital expenditure and running expenses, but I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether, in respect of loans, i.e. the first category of revenue, there will also be a distinction made between capital expenditure and running expenses. In other words, while money appropriated by Parliament is clearly defined into a capital expense account and a running expense account, what happens to <span class="col_7463-7464" refersTo="page_1062"/>loans acquired from elsewhere? Will this also be kept in two separate accounts? Will loan money be used purely for capital expenditure, or will it be used purely for running expenses, and if it is not, what will the allocation be? If in fact the loan moneys are to be used, in whole or in part, for running expenses, what about accountability to Parliament? Parliament is now, after all, providing a certain amount of money each year for running expenses of the corporation. The corporation is also to borrow money abroad or from other sources. If this borrowed money, the loan money, is in fact going to be used for running expenses, and the corporation is also obtaining running expenses from Parliament, then surely it is important for Parliament to know what portion of loan money is being applied to running expenses, and it is surely also important that if loan money is used for that purpose, that money should be applied first before Parliament is approached for money for running expenses at all. In fact, I think that is the meaning of the Bill. It says, in the new section 5A, that running expenses of the corporation which cannot be defrayed out of the funds of the corporation at its disposal to cover those expenses shall be defrayed from moneys appropriated by Parliament. In other words, Parliament is only responsible for running expenses to the extent that the corporation is not able to provide for running expenses from other sources. Section 5(5) of the Act, which is now being deleted by the Bill, also provided that the assets of the corporation, in the form of moneys, rights, cessions, whatever the source, capital equipment and so forth, should be deemed to be appropriated by Parliament as part of the share capital. Parliament has to provide share capital of a certain amount and under the original Act, as amended by the Finance Bill of 1971, any assets in the hands of the corporation could be deemed to be part of the share capital, in respect of those moneys which Parliament had to appropriate to provide share capital. That subsection is now being deleted, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister, in view of the deletion of section 5(5), what now happens to the other assets which may still be on hand. Have these other assets all been transferred to the share capital or, if not, what is going to happen to them? Presumably they have been absorbed into the share capital, but I should like the hon. the Minister to reply to that.</p>

<p>I have referred to our objection to the right of the corporation to retain a surplus of moneys, unspent, in respect of the appropriation made by Parliament for running expenses. I think it is only right that Parliament should be kept more closely informed, and that the money should be returned and revolted each year. The hon. the Minister himself, when he introduced the Bill, said that the system he hoped to introduce was one &#x201C;which would give Parliament more direct control&#x201D;. I believe that if the hon. the Minister wants such direct control, this is precisely what he should do.</p>

<p>I do not think I need say any more, except that we welcome the steady improvement in conditions for the running of this Uranium Enrichment Corporation. It is necessary that we should learn by experience, and that we should prepare not only for technical improvements, but also, financially, for the very high commitments which this corporation will be called upon to meet. In all these respects we support the Government, although we believe that there are certain points which need clarification, and at this early stage we cannot support the idea that the corporation be given <i>carte blanche</i> on its annual running expenses. We should like to see any surplus money returned at the end of a financial year, the more particularly because of the loan implications which have now been introduced. These unused running expenses should be returned to Parliament and Parliament should maintain control by being asked to vote new moneys each year in accordance with the requisitions made by the corporation and justified by the hon. the Minister before this House. When this corporation becomes profit making, when it has a board which is actually looking after an economically run operation where costs will, in fact, be met out of profits, then we can reconsider the matter. However, here we still have a very young, untried and inexperienced industry which has not yet begun to produce for profit and I do not believe it should be let off the hook yet. I believe it must carry on from year to year and that Parliament must maintain a very close surveillance over the growth and activities of this corporation during the early years. For that reason we shall support the Second Reading of this Bill. During the Committee Stage we shall express our reservations in respect of clause 3(1), which we believe is premature and not called <span class="col_7465-7466" refersTo="page_1063"/>for at this stage of the development of the corporation.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to express a few thoughts. In the first place, in uranium we are dealing with a source of energy. The old classical concept which created factors which would be responsible for industrial growth, actually had three components. They were labour, capital and land. This old classical concept is also mentioned on page 190 of the Petrick report. In recent times, as a result of the drying up of energy resources and as a result of financial implications and the higher price which is being charged for sources of energy such as oil, a new component has come to the fore in connection with the decisive factors which influence growth in a determining, decisive way. Whereas the old classical concept also included energy within the capital component, I think the time has come for us to have to accept a new evaluation of energy as a decisive factor in the evaluation of growth and which factors will determine growth in the future. As I said, uranium is a source of energy and it is going to play an even greater role as a source of energy in the future. We know that our coal resources are not inexhaustible, we know that oil resources in the world are not inexhaustible and that South Africa is endowed with fairly rich deposits of uranium. We are proud of the achievements which have been made in the sphere of uranium enrichment. We are proud of the fact that we can enrich uranium at a lower cost and according to a different method to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Since uranium is one of our sources of energy, I just want to express a single thought in this connection. I think that we in South Africa have done far too little in connection with a comprehensive inquiry into the correlation, the co-operation, the alliance which may exist between all the sources of energy which we have at our disposal in South Africa. When I refer to sources of energy, I specifically want to mention that we have uranium, as well as the wind, the sun, the tides, coal, etc.</p>

<p>We also have water-power. I can mention even more. They are all sources of energy, and I think that there is really a need for launching a comprehensive scientific inquiry into the value of each of the sources of energy separately or in combination, one with the other, or by the merging of the value of one with that of another. I think we will be amazed at the results which will be obtained from an inquiry like this. We shall be amazed at the amount of energy which is stored in South Africa and may be made available by its correct application in a scientific manner and on the correct basis. We shall be amazed at how much energy will be available to us in South Africa in future when all our organic sources have been depleted.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on these benches will support the legislation. We share the reservations which have been expressed by the hon. member for Von Brandis in regard to clause 3 of the Bill. Obviously our country at the moment has two primary sources of energy, of which the most important at this point of time is coal. Potentially, the other is uranium, which is basically produced in this country as a by-product in the gold mines. I hope the hon. the Minister will remember in relation to the legislation which went before this. Obviously, when one comes to deal with the question of uranium enrichment, the sums of money become very large, as the hon. member for Von Brandis pointed out. I hope, therefore, that the hon. the Minister will give us the assurance that he will provide more information rather than less information to this House. Basically, that is what runs through this piece of legislation; it deals with loans, with subscriptions for shares and with the running expenses of the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. As I have said, Mr. Speaker, we shall support this legislation, but we share the reservations of the hon. member for Von Brandis, particularly in regard to clause 3.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this legislation has the support of all sides. This is a Bill which deals with a very important matter. It deals with large amounts involved in a new industry, and I want to remind this House of the fact that the Uranium Enrichment Corporation is not only a new industry, but also an enormous one. In the years which lie ahead, literally milliards of rand will be involved in this. The first remark which the hon. member for Von Brandis made&#x2014;and the hon. member for Carletonville <span class="col_7467-7468" refersTo="page_1064"/>also referred to this&#x2014;was that there were so many sources of energy that one might eventually have interests spread over various departments. For example, reference was made to the fact that the one source of energy generation fell under the Minister of Economic Affairs, while the Minister of Mines had to give his attention to uranium enrichment, etc. The fact of the matter is, Sir, that the Government is very aware of this. It is not a case of unco-ordinated development. There is a Cabinet committee in which the Ministers concerned deliberate over this development, and there is also an energy policy committee in which the departments concerned and the experts are brought together so as to ensure proper co-ordination between the various components. Consequently I am of the opinion that there is no reason for concern that there may be interests which will drift away from one another as far as the generation energy is concerned. The whole object is to co-ordinate this, and this is being done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis expressed misgivings with regard to two matters. In the first place he suggested that a balance which was available as a surplus at the end of a year, should be carried forward rather than returned. Although this body is not truly a government department, I want to point out that in the case of government departments, it is the practice to return any surplus to the Treasury and to make a new appropriation in the succeeding year. Then we also have the example of a body such as the National Institute for Metallurgy, in respect of which the Treasury has allowed this practice in the past. In a case such as this it is felt that as long as the surplus is taken into account as regards the following year&#x2019;s expenditure, i.e. taken into account by the applicant, in this case the corporation, and by the Treasury on the other hand, it is, in fact, purely a technical problem. I want to give the hon. member the assurance once again that the necessary consultation does take place, and that any surplus amount from the previous year is taken into account in appropriating funds for the succeeding year.</p>

<p>The hon. member also touched on the question of the utilization of loan capital. It is the intention to run this commercial enrichment plant on business lines, on the basis that loan capital, as well as fixed capital, will be utilized so as to effect total financing, and that running expenses will eventually be covered from production. Care will therefore have to be exercised that the utilization of capital will be such that capital will not be utilized unnecessarily for running expenses. This is the business aspect of the matter. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that this will also be the basis on which it will be run. It would be foolish if the body concerned were to borrow money and were to continue utilizing such loan capital for running expenses without the yield from production being utilized. If this were to happen, this corporation, financially, would not be able to exist In other words, it is an undertaking which will be run like an ordinary business, and I do not think we need have much concern in this regard. I also think it may be somewhat presumptuous at this stage for either the hon. member or the Minister to doubt the sound business management which there will be. However, it remains the responsibility of the Minister to see to this and it also remains the responsibility of this House to take notice of reports in this regard. I think the hon. member should be satisfied if I tell him that in terms of the agreement we have between the Treasury and the Uranium Enrichment Corporation, this will be within the ambit of sound business procedure. Perhaps it will be well for me to quote from the memorandum of the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. I do not think it will be amiss of me to read from this since it will allow the hon. member to see how this will be run. The document reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The independence of the Transkei will have certain effects as far as the implementation of the Unemployment Insurance Act is concerned. The position will be as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) From the date on which the Transkei becomes independent the Act will no longer apply there.</li>

<li>(2) Employers covered by the definition of employer in in section 4 will be excluded, and they and their employees will cease to be liable for contributions.</li>

<li>(3) In terms of section 41(1)(h) of the Act, persons outside the Republic are not entitled to benefits and from the date on which the Transkei becomes independent, no benefits can be paid there.</li>

<li>(4) Employees recruited in the Transkei on a contractual basis for service in the Republic who have to return to their country on conclusion of their period of service will, as in the case of citizens of all foreign countries, be excluded from the definition of contributor in terms of section 2(2)(a).</li>

<li><span class="col_7471-7472" refersTo="page_1066"/>(5) Inhabitants of the Transkei who are not working in the Republic under contract and who do not have to be repatriated on the conclusion of their period of service, will be contributors unless they are otherwise from the definition of &#x201C;contributor&#x201D;, just as in the case of all other persons in the Republic.</li>

<li>(6) In terms of a notice published under section 2(5) of the Act, all Bantu not born in the Republic are excluded as contributors.</li>

</ol>

<p>The question has occurred as to what obligation there must be towards contributors resident in the Transkei with regard to ordinary unemployment benefits, maternity benefits and illness allowances when the Transkei becomes independent, and what steps must be taken. As hon. members know, benefits from an unemployment insurance fund serve as a temporary source of income to assist the worker until he is again able to find employment. With a view to a gradual period of transition, the Government felt that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained for a period in order to prevent disruption and dissatisfaction in respect of workers who had been contributors and built up a credit before the date of independence. During the transitionary period, the Transkeian Government may decide what its own wishes are in regard to the establishment of an unemployment insurance for its territory.</p>

<p>Certain proposals relating to the implementation of the Unemployment Insurance Act after the date of independence were submitted as long ago as last year to the working committee nominated to undertake the necessary preparations for the independence of the Transkei. These proposals were recently accepted by the Transkeian Cabinet.</p>

<p>The proposals are embodied in the Bill at present before the House. I now take pleasure in providing hon. members with details of the envisaged amendments.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<p>This clause provides for the insertion into the Act of a new section 64A which will protect certain persons who were entitled to benefits and allowances before the independence of the Transkei.</p>

<p>Subsection (1):</p>

<p>Persons who were drawing benefits or were entitled to receive benefits will continue to receive such benefits in the normal way after independence, until the benefits are terminated for one reason or another in the ordinary course of events. Consequently, no changes come into effect until such time as the person has received all the benefits to which he was entitled with regard to the application in question, whether this be before or after independence. Payments in respect of any approved applications or applications which could be approved before independence, are therefore continued after independence.</p>

<p>Subsections (2) and (3):</p>

<p>Any person who was a contributor before the independence of the Transkei, who has built up the necessary credits and qualifies for benefits, may still receive such benefits for a period of three years after independence.</p>

<p>As far as ordinary benefits are concerned, a person can still qualify throughout the period of three years, since the proposed section 64A(3) provides that service in the Transkei during the three years is regarded as &#x201C;otherwise employed&#x201D;&#x2014;viz., not as a &#x201C;contributor&#x201D;&#x2014;because from the date of independence people in the Transkei no longer contribute to the fund. Whereas credits may therefore no longer be built up, such persons may qualify for benefits in regard to credits already built up before the date of independence.</p>

<p>As far as illness allowances and maternity benefits are concerned, persons will no longer be able to qualify after a certain period, depending on the date of inception of the disease or the expected date of confinement, since the Act provides that persons have to have been contributors employed for certain specific periods to qualify for such benefits. These provisions also apply to persons of the Republic who have ceased to work as contributors for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Subsection (4):</p>

<p>This subsection provides that the provisions of the Act relating to the keeping of wage records and contributors&#x2019; record cards will still apply in the Transkei after the date of independence. This is essential, so as to be able to determine, when he is unemployed, what a worker&#x2019;s earnings had been. The worker will also have to be in possession of his contributor&#x2019;s record card when he applies for benefits.</p>

<p><span class="col_7473-7474" refersTo="page_1067"/>Subsection (5):</p>

<p>The envisaged amendment provides that applications for benefits will be dealt with by the claims officers at East London and Durban. However, such applications will not be considered if they are not submitted before or on the date on which the period of three years expires.</p>

<p>Dependants&#x2019; allowances are not affected. Such applications may still be submitted after the period of three years. This is also the position in the Republic in respect of foreign citizens. Their dependants may apply irrespective of where they live. However, the qualifications for this are that applications must be made within three years after the date of death of the contributor and that proof must be furnished that the deceased had worked as a contributor for 13 weeks in the three years immediately preceding his death.</p>

<p>Those are the amendments in broad detail, and I trust that they will meet with the approval of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that one should talk unless it is essential to do so. Therefore, I shall say what I want to say to this House in a few sentences. It would appear to us that here the Government is putting the cart before the horse, because the Transkei has not yet become independent and yet we have a whole series of measures aimed at the eventual independence of the Transkei. Mr. Speaker, you will not allow me to discuss the merits of independence. As far as this Bill is concerned, I must therefore accept it as an accomplished fact. It is necessary, of course, for certain adjustments to be made when an area such as the Transkei becomes independent. What this Bill seeks to do, is set out in the long title, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To amend the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1966, in order to preserve for a period of three years the right of certain persons, who were contributors immediately prior to Transkei becoming independent, &#x2026;</block>

<p>One naturally has to accept this in principle. Therefore we agree to this and shall support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the provisions of this Bill are straightforward and very clear. We shall support the Bill at the Second Reading. I have two questions I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. Obviously, we shall come back to these in the Committee Stage, but I mention them here in order to obtain some information. In the proposed new section 64A(4) one reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any employer who in Transkei employs any person referred to in subsection (2), shall keep and retain for the purposes of this section the records &#x2026;</block>

<p>The question that obviously arises is how this is to be enforced once the Transkei has become independent. How does one have any jurisdiction over any employer or employee who happens to be in the Transkei? Whilst our legislation may stipulate that the employer shall do this and that, I fail to understand how it is possible for the Republic in its legislation to enforce regulations upon employers living in an independent country.</p>

<p>That is the one problem. The other concerns the period of three years laid down in the Bill. One wonders if some people are not going to be penalized and whether three years is sufficient time for this particular provision to operate. Is this enough time, or could it be extended should this be necessary? My own guess is that it will be necessary to extend the period. I hope the hon. the Minister will reassure us that no one will be penalized as a result of the fact that, after three years, this provision ceases to be.</p>

<p>Having put those two questions, let me say that we support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank hon. members for their support of this Bill. The question of the hon. member for Pinelands is a technical one. I do not believe he expects us to differ on it. The hon. member asked whether a period of three years was in fact sufficient time. We must have regard to the fact that this concerns unemployment insurance. It is a type of insurance which applies over a short period only. In this respect a period of three years is sufficient. Any country ought to be able to make provision itself for its people in that period. Apart from that, consultations were held in this regard. We came to the conclusion that three years were not only long enough, but <span class="col_7475-7476" refersTo="page_1068"/>also exceptionally generous. I do not want to compare South Africa to other countries, but the hon. member may well look at what has happened over the past 25 years with this type of legislation in other countries. I think the Transkei may be very grateful for the fact that we are really going out of our way to end matters like this and hand them over to the Government there to deal with at its discretion. I think that a period of three years in which someone has the opportunity to make use of privileges in terms of an Act passed by us, is very generous. I believe that the people of the Transkei will be the first to admit this and that they will be very grateful for this. The hon. member is welcome to raise this matter once again during the Committee Stage, but I do not believe that it is necessary for him to do so. I want to assure him that this, measured by any norm, is an extremely fair proposal.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill, of which I am now moving the Second Reading, is of a comprehensive nature and may also seem at first glance to be a complicated measure. Before I say any more about its principles, I think it would be appropriate to make a few general observations.</p>

<p>The Liquor Act has been on the Statute Book since 1928, and is generally known as the Tielman Roos Act. Since then it has been amended on 35 different occasions&#x2014;which is sufficient to demonstrate that we are dealing here not only with a liquid product, but also with a relatively fluid law.</p>

<p>Initially amendments to the Act were not required to any considerable extent, but since 1961 changes have already been effected by way of 21 different measures&#x2014;a clear demonstration that the Government, as a result of rapidly changing requirements in a rapidly changing world, is keeping abreast with and adapting to the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Whether all the changes which have been effected since 1928 may be described as improvements, is not for me to say. In the case of the product of the vine there are the so-called vintage years, and perhaps at a later stage in our history it may also be said that this was the position with our liquor legislation.</p>

<p>When one is dealing with liquor legislation, it is truly a case of <i>quot homines tot sententiae,</i> and only time will tell to what extent our legislation has succeeded in bringing about and maintaining the orderly distribution of liquor.</p>

<p>The Bill was published in advance in the <i>Gazette</i> for perusal and comment, but before doing so my department held extensive talks with the KWV, the Kaapse Wyninstituut, the Federated Hotel Associations and other bodies, including representatives of the Association of Law Societies. Consequently I am able to state here that, apart from possible minor points of difference, the measure is acceptable to the producers, to the trade in its various ramifications, as well as to the attorneys&#x2019; profession in so far as its functions are concerned.</p>

<p>I said at the outset that this Bill was of a comprehensive nature. It consists of 151 clauses, and is the bulkiest Liquor Amendment Bill that has ever been published. The Amendment Bill of 1963 (Act No. 88 of 1963), had 116 clauses, but in my opinion it contained far more contentious principles than the present measure. From this it may be deduced that, in my opinion, the Bill before this House in essence contains no controversial provisions. Naturally it is not expedient to give a detailed elucidation of each principle in the Bill in this Second Reading speech. I think we may, in so far as it may be necessary, discuss them in greater detail during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>However, the Bill contains a number of central principles which in my opinion may be regarded as being the most important, and I intend to explain these principles briefly. I want to point out that in the most cases, owing to the nature of its composition, any, even slight, amendments of the Liquor Act necessitate consequential amendments. This in itself is to a great extent caused by the voluminous nature of the measure. The first point I should like to emphasize is that this measure should be seen as the prelude to the final consolidation <span class="col_7477-7478" refersTo="page_1069"/>of the 1928 Act, as amended on numerous occasions. This is something which has repeatedly been envisaged in the past and which, as a result of this comprehensive measure has become even more real and pressing.</p>

<p>The second point I want to mention is that we are now bringing the 1928 measure into conformity with decimalization and metrication. At the same time we are raising licence and application fees, but I want to emphasize that the last time any change was made to the prescribed fees, which are now being raised, was in 1963. It is quite likely, too, that it will not be possible for the increase to come into effect before at least 12 to 18 months have elapsed, by which time we hope that inflation will be a tiling of the past. Here and there we are effecting improvements to the language, but this is a matter which will receive more attention when the measure is consolidated. The most important change which is being proposed in the Bill is an amendment of the licensing system. Hon. members will recall that at the time each magisterial district initially had a liquor licensing board, which consisted of the magistrate of the district and four members drawn from the private sector. In December of every year each council met to consider applications for the renewal of liquor licences, as well as applications for new liquor licences. During the course of the year it was also possible to hold interim and special meetings. Hon. members are probably aware of all the criticism that has been levelled at this system.</p>

<p>In 1956 the district boards were abolished and replaced by regional boards, each consisting of three magistrates. Each region consisted&#x2014;and still consists&#x2014;of at least one magisterial district. In the entire Republic there are at present 54 such boards. In 1961 the restrictions on the sale of liquor to Bantu were lifted, and the National Liquor Board was established. One of the principal functions entrusted to that body by Act No. 22 of 1961 was the consideration of applications&#x2014;so-called section 100<i>bis</i> applications&#x2014;for the provision of liquor to Bantu. In 1962 provision was also made for the section 100<i>sex</i> applications and the consideration of such applications was entrusted to the National Liquor Board. In 1963 the Liquor Act was drastically amended to provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the classification of hotels, a function which was also allocated to the Liquor Board.</p>

<p>As far as applications for new liquor licences are concerned, the 1963 legislation provides that such applications&#x2014;after they had been heard by the local board&#x2014;had to be referred to the National Liquor Board for consideration and the making of recommendations to the Minister of Justice. Other functions were then and subsequently, too, entrusted by law to the National Liquor Board and today this body is generally accepted as the body which, subject to ministerial supervision, exercises control over licensed liquor distribution in the Republic. It is probably not necessary for me to state here that the National Liquor Board has, in the fulfilling of its functions, withstood the test of time. The present main function of the 54 local liquor licensing boards is to consider annual applications for the renewal of liquor licences and to hear evidence in regard to application for new liquor licences. The organized liquor trade, and particularly the hotel industry has been pleading for many years for the abolition of this process of annual renewal of liquor licences. Apart from the costs involved, so it is alleged, there is no need for a renewal from year to year. Control measures exist, and others may be introduced in so far as these may be necessary to exercise proper control over licensed premises and the distribution of liquor.</p>

<p>Very careful consideration has been given to this matter and my department and I, as well as the Police, are satisfied that we can do away with the existing system of the annual renewal of liquor licences. In parentheses I want to say that the same principle applies to the annual renewal of so-called section 100<i>bis</i> and 100<i>sex</i> authorizations which are at present renewed departmentally. Because the annual consideration of applications for the renewal of liquor licences falls away, the most important function of local liquor licensing boards falls away.</p>

<p>Consequently it is being contemplated in the Bill to abolish local liquor licensing boards. Naturally this results in many consequent amendments because all references to renewals and the functions of local licensing boards have to be deleted. In accordance with the new system for which provision is being made in the Bill, a liquor licence will continue to exist after it has originally been granted until it is <span class="col_7479-7480" refersTo="page_1070"/>cancelled by the competent authority, or until it is abandoned by the licensee or, in the opinion of the competent authority, business is no longer being transacted in terms of it. Particulars of all liquor licensed businesses and other lawful liquor distribution points will be computerized and the department will send each licensee a notification annually by 30 September demanding from him payment of the prescribed licence fee for the ensuing year.</p>

<p>It is not possible for me, in the short time at my disposal, to furnish you with the details. However, the Bill makes detailed provision in this regard.</p>

<p>As far as applications for new liquor licences are concerned, apart from temporary and late hours occasional licences, it is being contemplated that such applications will be heard in public by the National Liquor Board. Incidentally, the same applies to new section 100<i>bis</i> and 100<i>sex</i> applications.</p>

<p>It is the object that the Liquor Board will hold an annual meeting every year in respect of each province for the purpose of hearing such applications.</p>

<p>Provision is for the most part being made for objections, review, appeal, special and interim meetings, etc., as this exists at present in the case of local liquor licensing boards. In this regard I am referring in particular to clause 12 which inserts an entire new chapter III in the Act to deal with matters of this nature.</p>

<p>I think it is not inappropriate, at this stage, to express the gratitude of the Government and myself for the major task which local liquor licensing boards have been performing since 1956. It is not necessary for me to say that our liquor legislation is extremely complicated. I therefore have great appreciation for the task which those magistrates who are members of liquor licensing boards are performing in this regard; particularly since it is work of a specialized and for the most part complicated nature.</p>

<p>A second principle in the Bill which comes up for discussion deals with the provision of liquor on election days. I do not think it is necessary to go into detail about the provisions relating to election days for the House of Assembly or the Provincial Council or the Coloured Persons Representative Council or the Bantu areas. Those matters, as far as the Liquor Act is concerned, are now being more clearly outlined in the Bill.</p>

<p>Apart from the provisions of the Liquor Act in this regard, section 181 of the Electoral Act, 1946, provides as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law, no person shall on any polling day fixed under this Act sell intoxicating liquor in any division in which a poll is being taken or at any place which&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) in the case of a general election held in pursuance of a dissolution of the House of Assembly or a provincial council is not more than 20 miles; or</li>

<li>(b) in the case of any other election if not more than 5 miles,</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>by the shortest practicable public road from any polling station at which any vote in connection with that election may be recorded.</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) Any person who opens or permits to be open any premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor or sells such liquor in contravention of this section shall be liable on conviction to the same penalties &#x2026;</li>

<li>(3) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the sale of intoxicating liquor under a wholesale licence to a ship &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>Section 79 of the Constitution and Elections Amendment Act 1973, repeals section 181 of the Electoral Act of 1946. However, the repeal has not yet been put into effect, pending a decision on the question of whether the provisions of the Liquor Act in regard to the sale and provision of liquor on election days should be adapted, and if so, in which respect.</p>

<p>The repeal of the said provision in the Electoral Act of 1946 took place by way of a majority decision on the recommendation of a Select Committee. In this regard I should like to refer to the discussions during the Committee Stage of the relevant measure as reported in columns 8968 to 8974 of the debates of this House on 12 June 1973.</p>

<p>The provisions of section 181 of the 1946 Electoral Act have now been included in this Bill, and you will find them in clause 147 (f).</p>

<p>Briefly, what it amounts to is that the position in so far as liquor sales on election days will remain as it is at present This means <span class="col_7481-7482" refersTo="page_1071"/>that the <i>status quo</i> will be maintained regardless of the repeal of the relevant section in the Electoral Act of 1946.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that this matter received particular consideration from me. I think it would be foolish to effect a change. I am completely convinced that the situation, as it is at present, does not prejudice anyone in any way whatsoever. The organized liquor trade did not express themselves opposed to the provision in the Bill. On the contrary. We received no representations in this regard whatsoever. My proposal, as reflected in this Bill, is therefore that the <i>status quo</i> be maintained and reaffirmed.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I wish to say something about the proposed amendment of section 100<i>sex.</i> I refer to clause 88 of the Bill. At present authority for the sale of liquor, on-consumption and off-consumption, may be granted to an association of Coloured or Asian persons having at least 20 shareholders and in which no single shareholder holds more than 20&#x0025; of the issued shares or contributed more than 20&#x0025; of the association&#x2019;s capital. In addition no person may have a financial interest in more than one such distribution point. However, there is an exception in the case of the Coloured Development Corporation.</p>

<p>After consultation with the departments concerned and with the CDC, it has been decided to delete these restrictions. Extensive provision was made in 1969 to deal with the case of a shareholder in a section 100<i>sex</i> authority who permanently departs from the Republic. I refer to section 100<i>sex</i>(2B) of the Act. This provision is considered to be no longer necessary and is being deleted. Section 94 of the Act prohibits the supply of liquor to Bantu except under circumstances set out therein. This provision is really a relic from the days of almost total prohibition as far as Bantu are concerned and is no longer considered necessary. It is accordingly deleted by clause 84.</p>

<p>Section 74 of the principal Act provides that before a club liquor licence can be granted, the authority considering the application must be satisfied <i>inter alia</i> that the establishment is a <i>bona fide</i> club. There is no definition in the Act of what a club is and it is really a matter which must be considered with due regard to, amongst others, certain requirements specified in subsection (2) of section 74. <i>Inter alia,</i> it is specified that a club must have at least 35 members and ordinary members must pay an annual subscription of at least R6. The Liquor Board investigated the question of clubs and came to the conclusion that the minimum number of ordinary club members should be at least 50 and that the annual subscription should be increased to at least R12 per annum. Effect is being given hereto in clause 60 of the Bill. The Liquor Board recognized, however, that in some rural areas there may be a need for licensed club facilities at industrial undertakings such as power stations, but where the 50 ordinary membership requirement will be difficult or impossible to meet. In such cases it is proposed that a licence can be issued if the club has only 35 ordinary members. I trust that these amendments will eliminate applications by institutions which cannot really claim to be <i>bona fide</i> clubs.</p>

<p>A liquor licence, except a temporary licence, can only be granted in respect of fixed premises. The Bill contains an innovation in this respect. I refer to clause 147(y) under which it will become possible to grant a wine and malt licence in respect of a boat which is lawfully operated on any lake, lagoon, dam or river. I can foresee that in the not too distant future pleasure boats will operate on our bigger dams. As in the case of all wine and malt licences, it will be necessary to make provision for the service of food on such boats. It is, however, not intended to make the provision of full meals compulsory. Clause 51 has reference in this connection. Provision for light meals will be made in conditions which will be applicable.</p>

<p>At present hotels may be authorized to close for certain periods&#x2014;the out-of-season periods&#x2014;of the year. This principle is being extended to all-on-consumption licensed premises. Provision is also made for keeping open part of any licensed premises in cases where a material portion thereof is destroyed or becomes unfit for the proper carrying on of the business. Clause 67 has reference. Section 112 of the Act limits an hotelkeeper&#x2019;s liability in respect of the property of a lodger on the premises, to a maximum of R40. There are certain exceptions to this restriction which are set out in subsection (1) of the section. The amendment proposed in clause 100 will increase the extent of liability from R40 to R100. Motivation is hardly necessary. Suffice it to say that the limit of R40 dates back to at <span class="col_7483-7484" refersTo="page_1072"/>least 1928 and that the hotel industry does not object to the proposed amendment.</p>

<p>As was done in 1962 and again in 1974, another opportunity is being given to holders of wholesale liquor licences to apply for conversion to bottle liquor licences. The relevant provision is to be found in clause 38. This will probably be the last opportunity for a long time to come, for this type of application.</p>

<p>Last year Parliament made it an offence to introduce, possess or consume liquor in any portion of a sportsground to which members of the public are admitted on payment of an admission fee. I undertook then in this House and also in the Other Place to give this particular provision further thought and consideration. It is now proposed to amend section 166(hA) as indicated in clause 139(f) of the Bill. I trust that this amendment will obviate the problems previously raised by hon. members.</p>

<p>Until now sportsground and theatre liquor licences have been grouped together in the Act as one class of licence. It is not necessary for me to say that this is really an impracticable situation. Separate provision is now being made for the two classes of licences as will be observed from, <i>inter alia,</i> clauses 7(b) and (c) and clause 55. As regards the proviso to the proposed new section 71<i>quat</i>&#x2014;see clause 55&#x2014;I want to say that it has been inserted with the specific purpose of being able to deal with a practice which has grown up over many years at the Milner Park Show Grounds and which, according to the department&#x2019;s view and that of the show ground&#x2019;s legal representative, will not fall within the ambit of the special condition prescribed in the proposed section 71<i>quat.</i></p>

<p>By clause 99 of the Bill it is proposed to extend the present limitation of the time for the recovery of retail liquor debts, from three to four months. I have agreed to this extension after careful consideration of the retail trade&#x2019;s representations to me. I do not think this concession can lead to any abuse.</p>

<p>In view of the additional functions which it is proposed under the Bill to entrust to the National Liquor Board I have agreed to the addition of a new subsection (10) to the existing section 118<i>bis</i> of the Act. I am referring to clause 109(b) of the Bill which authorizes the Board under certain circumstances to co-opt a person to assist it in the hearing of matters before it. This provision has been inserted at the suggestion of the Liquor Committee of the Association of Law Societies and has the support of the trade.</p>

<p>Another innovation introduced at the request of the lawyers, and fully supported by the trade, will be found in the proposed new section 173(2)&#x2014;clause 145. Provision is now being made for condonation, under certain circumstances, of certain formal or technical errors or omissions in applications submitted under the Liquor Act.</p>

<p>The existing penalty clauses are numerous and involved. In order to simplify matters clause 140 now prescribes maximum penalties in a very much simplified, understandable manner. I think the amendment will be welcomed by everybody&#x2014;from accused to legal representative to judicial officer. I wish to say something about the provisions of section 12(4) of the Liquor Act which provides as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State President may from time to time proclaim any area to be one in which no new bottle liquor licence shall be issued by a receiver of revenue save upon payment, in addition to the fees payable in terms of subsection (1), of a sum to be specified by the State President in such proclamation, and which shall not exceed &#x00A3;5 000.</block>

<p>This additional fee is commonly called an impost and as far as we are able to establish, is&#x2014;or I must rather say was&#x2014;intended to eliminate speculation with bottle store licences. Imposts have been imposed by way of proclamation in respect of a number of urban areas of which I only want to mention a few by way of illustration. In 1935 an impost of R10 000 was proclaimed in respect of Nigel while in the same year the figure was fixed at R5 000 for Germiston. In 1939 Springs, Brakpan and Pretoria were &#x201C;imposted&#x201D; to the extent of R10 000 while the figure for Bellville, Goodwood, Parow and Durbanville was fixed at R5 000. An impost of R2 000 applies to Herbertsdale and one of R5 000 to Great Brak River while the figure for the municipal area of Prince Albert is R500. In respect of Sandton, Randburg, Kempton Park, Verwoerdburg and Sasolburg an impost of R10 000 was proclaimed in 1971.</p>

<p>By all accounts bottle store licences are very valuable assets and the impost provision has <span class="col_7485-7486" refersTo="page_1073"/>done nothing to minimize speculation with new bottle store licences.</p>

<p>According to reliable information goodwill value in respect of certain existing bottle store licences, particularly in certain urban areas, has risen to astronomical figures. We also have it on good authority that bottle liquor licences are disposed of, even before a single bottle of liquor has been sold, at prices which range between R60 000 and R150 000. The State finds itself in the position that it can give a bottle liquor licence to a particular individual person who finds himself in possession of a piece of paper often immediately worth tens of thousands of rand. This is a completely undesirable state of affairs which has been receiving consideration for many years.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice has come up with a scheme which, on the face of it, has much to commend itself. This scheme was provided for in the draft Bill which was published for general information and comment. Briefly it amounts to this: The State would share in the price paid for goodwill if a bottle liquor licence is alienated within five years from the date of grant on a sliding percentage scale. As I have said, this scheme has much to commend itself, and I think I am correct if I say it has all-round approval of the principle involved. From the comments we received, however, it is clear that the details of the scheme will have to be looked into again as there are a number of problems which can arise there from.</p>

<p>In view of what I have said, I have decided not to proceed at this stage with the amendment proposed in the draft Bill. I intend referring the matter to the National Liquor Board for consideration in conjunction with interested parties. As an interim measure the existing impost proclamations will be reviewed, and the question whether there are not other areas which should also be &#x201C;imposted&#x201D; will be investigated.</p>

<p>The supply of liquor by certain restaurants which are not licensed for the sale of liquor and whose premises and business operations do therefore not come under the provisions of the Liquor Act, is causing concern. It appears that at least at certain of these places, it has become the custom to supply liquor&#x2014;usually wine, but often also spirits or beer&#x2014;to customers under the pretext that it is given free of charge merely as a gesture of goodwill. The charge for the liquor is not reflected in the bill but, so I am informed, is hidden in the price of the meal. Restaurants who wish to supply liquor to their clients, must apply for and obtain liquor licences so that proper control can be exercised.</p>

<p>I have been informed that the existing provisions in the Liquor Act relating to dealing in liquor without a licence, are inadequate to meet the problem. I have therefore decided to insert the necessary provision in that part of the Act which deals with evidence and in which a number of presumptions already exist to make the task of the prosecution less onerous in proving certain Liquor Act contraventions. The relevant amendment will be found in clause 128 of the Bill.</p>

<p>*As I said at the outset, it is unpractical to explain the provisions of this measure clause by clause. I have mentioned to you what I consider to be the most important provisions of the measure. At this stage I want to content myself with saying that the Bill contains very sound principles&#x2014;and this is not only my view, but also the feeling in general of those people who are most closely involved in the provisions of the Liquor Act.</p>

<p>If the Bill should become law, there are of course many administrative actions which will have to be carried out, particularly in so far as the preparation for the introduction of the altered licensing procedure is concerned. It will definitely not be possible to finalize these matters during the present year, and I think a reasonable estimate would be towards the second half of 1977 at the earliest.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as is traditional with this side of the House, where a matter concerns the supply of liquor, the question is regarded as a matter of conscience and is therefore subject to a free vote on this side of the House. As there are members who consider that this Bill in fact extends the supply of liquor&#x2014;I must say that this a contention with which I do not agree, but nevertheless it is held&#x2014;this means that there will be a free vote in this regard and members on our side will be entitled to express their personal convictions in regard to that aspect of the Bill. [Interjections.] I have said that members are entitled to hold that view. If they get shot down later, then that is a matter for debate. That is the purpose of debate.</p>

<p>I must say that I become very suspicious when we have a little measure like this <span class="col_7487-7488" refersTo="page_1074"/>introduced with honey and syrup, which the hon. the Minister can assure the House&#x2014;and he is correct&#x2014;enjoys the support of the department, the support of the legal profession, the support of the Federated Hotel Association&#x2014;this I know&#x2014;and the support of the organized liquor trade. In fact, it seems to enjoy everyone&#x2019;s support, and this makes me very, very suspicious indeed, because there is only one person left who has not expressed an opinion, and that is the consumer! If everybody else is happy, can the consumer be happy too? That is a matter which will perhaps come to light as we proceed with the Bill.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister pointed out, this simple little Bill, comprising 217 pages, with 151 clauses amending the 176 sections of the Act itself, does not leave much unchanged. If one has 151 amending clauses and only 176 sections to amend, it means that only 25 sections of the original Act are unchanged. This is virtually a rewrite of the Liquor Act.</p>

<p>I believe that the general effect of this Bill is that it introduces improvements. Nevertheless, I think it is necessary to place on record that something I warned this House about many years ago has come to pass, and that is that the total power, the total &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; over liquor and the liquor trade in South Africa, has now been concentrated into the hands of the National Liquor Board, now to be called the Liquor Board.</p>

<p>Do you have any objection to it?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It was not this hon. Minister, but his predecessor whom we warned about creating an empire. Some of us foresaw that this empire would seek to gather in all the strings so that the whole control, the &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; over the liquor trade, would rest in one neat and compact body. The hon. the Minister himself has now become the chief licensing officer. Throughout the Bill it is the Minister who will take decisions, who will impose conditions, who will determine even down to what colour towels one will have and down to what the building will look like. To the smallest detail the Minister will take these decisions. He does not have the power to delegate that authority. In the granting of licences and the imposing of conditions, clause after clause states that it is the Minister who takes the decision. The recommendation comes from the Liquor Board, but the Minister, technically, has placed himself in the position of a licensing officer in many aspects of the control of liquor.</p>

<p>This is the Minister, Mr. Speaker, who is responsible for Justice, for our security and even for determining clemency in the case of death sentences. He is the person who, in his capacity as Minister of Justice, deals with matters vital to the State, to the safety of the State and to the people, and I believe that this Bill goes too far in adding to those onerous and responsible duties the task of a licensing officer. I believe that the Minister should be the court of appeal to whom persons can go, as applies in certain circumstances, and that there should be a body with a more judicial make-up than the existing Liquor Board to grant licences. That is why, in the past, it has always been judicial officers, magistrates, who have headed liquor licensing boards, both local boards and regional boards. This was done in order to bring in the judicial approach. Now the body which considers these matters is to be a body of officials and not a judicial body, and the person who is to make the decisions is the Minister. I believe it would be much sounder, whilst we are rewriting this Act to such an extent, to introduce into the body which has to hear applications and make decisions, a greater judicial element. This can be done by making the chairman of the Liquor Board a judge or a person with judicial experience. The Minister can then hear appeals while the administration, from the official side, can deal with administrative matters.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what I do not want is jobs for pals and the possibility of suspicion. When you hear that sort of interjection, it makes you wonder what that hon. member is scared of. What is he scared of, bearing in mind that we are talking of a judicial approach to what is a judicial decision taken after guidance by the advice of the technical experts, the people whose job it is to find out, analyse and present the facts? I feel that there is too great a tendency for the same organization which has elicited the information and collected the facts, also to make the decision on those same issues with which it <span class="col_7489-7490" refersTo="page_1075"/>has itself become involved. I would like to see a greater separation taking place, so that the Minister has a smaller part to play in the specific task of taking detailed decisions. He should rather be the person to whom one can appeal for an impartial review. As this amending Bill reads now, there is no really effective appeal. The only appeal is an appeal against <i>mala fides</i> or an appeal against a point of law. There is no appeal to a court on fact or on merit. I accept that that is also the existing situation. The only appeal that can be made, once the Liquor Board has made a decision, is to the Minister, but when the Minister takes a decision there is no effective appeal.</p>

<p>I think this is a weakness which, whilst the Act is being amended by a Bill with such far-reaching consequences, should have been taken into account. In practice, of course, this has already become the position, because your local licensing boards, and lately your regional licensing boards, in fact only recommended to the National Liquor Board. In practice those recommendations were absolutely futile, because the decision was taken at the centre in Pretoria. The hon. the Minister will admit that in recent times those boards have ceased to even make recommendations. They have simply been a post office submitting and forwarding applications and information. They have not even bothered to put in recommendations, because the recommendations have not been the deciding factor.</p>

<p>Of recent times? My information is that they stopped making recommendations because the effective decisions were taken in Pretoria by the National Liquor Board. So what you are really doing is that you are eliminating a post office. I am not going to argue about the fact whether there were recommendations or not. The local magistrates have simply become a channel of communication. This Bill is therefore entrenching what is the <i>de facto</i> position. I do not believe that that makes it any better, because all power is still being centralized in a body in Pretoria. In effect that is what happened. It does not mean that that is the best way. I think that there should be a provision for some sort of advisory information-gathering source at local level to counteract the possibility of wrong information by a visiting inspector who is not aware of the local situation.</p>

<p>At the centre? Yes, that is an improvement. There are many improvements. I am not disputing the fact that there are improvements. I am saying that whilst these radical amendments are being made, I would like to have seen the matter being taken further to bring in the concept that justice must not only be done, but must also be seen to be done. This is particularly so in an issue where the hon. the Minister himself has said that a licence, granted as a simple piece of paper before you have sold a bottle of liquor, becomes worth tens of thousands of rands. The fact alone indicates how important it is that South Africa should know that it is not possible that that piece of paper gets given to someone by favour or by fortune. It makes it all the more important, and the hon. the Minister will agree, that there must be no possibility of suspicion in the granting of licences.</p>

<p>A Government under which in other fields&#x2014;it has not happened here and I have no cases to quote here&#x2014;there have been examples of nepotism, of favouritism, of apparent bribery, of apparent departure from the standards of public honesty. Therefore it is more than ever important that, when a Government has been in power too long and because that sort of thing happens, as has happened in the Faros case, as has happened in the Agliotti case and with so many other things, that where Parliament deals with a grant which carries high financial value, every possible step must be taken to ensure that the procedure, that the method which is followed, is beyond any shadow of suspicion. That is all that I am trying to put to the hon. the <span class="col_7491-7492" refersTo="page_1076"/>Minister. A new procedure is going to be followed now, and all that I am asking is that it should be beyond any question. To do that, I have suggested a judicial element in the decision-making process.</p>

<p>There is another aspect I think the hon. the Minister should consider. Here I am referring to the tremendous powers he and the Liquor Board are taking to impose, alter, cancel, suspend, add, relax and/or restrict conditions on licences and trading. Although we are giving certainty to a licence holder&#x2014;and I welcome the removal of the annual renewal&#x2014;it is being replaced by an uncertainty which can be imposed at any time.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into all the relevant clauses of the Bill relating to the power to impose, change or suspend conditions. One is therefore giving permanence to a licence, but together with that permanency one is creating uncertainty as far as the conditions of operation are concerned.</p>

<p>In this field let me refer to the question of objections that may be made by any person&#x2014;I think in August&#x2014;against the renewal of a licence. Here again one is granting permanence and yet opening wide the door to unnecessary objections and requests for the cancellation of licences. I agree that there must be some procedure in terms of which a local authority or organization can indicate that a certain hostel, bar or bottle store is a menace and is creating a nuisance as far as the community is concerned. That machinery must be there, but I do not believe that the door must be left as wide open as in the case of the present provisions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Upon representations being made, there will be an open inquiry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This nevertheless means that any individual who is opposed in principle to the sale of liquor can come along and lodge an objection asking for the cancellation of an hotel licence. This has always been the case with a renewal, and it means that every applicant has to have an attorney or an advocate&#x2014;someone to take his case&#x2014;and this merely to deal with standard objections that come along year after year. I have nothing against attorneys; I believe we have to give them a little molly-coddling and protection and a little job reservation, but I do not think we need to be doing this. I think requests for the cancellation of a licence should be restricted to new grounds. In other words, if there are new circumstances that have arisen since a previous complaint or objection, these can be taken into account. However, where it is the same complaint by the same body on the same grounds, with no new circumstances pertaining, I do not believe the licensee should be put to all the expense of having to defend himself with all the procedural paraphernalia of a hearing, adjournment, renewed hearing, merely to hear a stereotype case based on complaints that are lodged year after year by well-meaning organizations who are opposed to any licence in principle.</p>

<p>Then we come to the restrictions and clause 61 with which I shall not deal in detail at this stage. However, there are pages and pages of restrictions. Surely, it is possible to simplify the provisions of a Bill like this. Why is it that when you deal with liquor, you see so many spooks that you have to write in 176 clauses to control it? I am quite sure that you do not have to have something like 20 pages of differing limitations and restrictions for every different type of licence, for each area and for every specific possibility. Surely, it should not be beyond the bounds of the wit of an able Minister who brings in such an amending Bill to streamline the provisions by saying that in a particular field, these are the outer limits and simply provide therefore. I can give an example.</p>

<p>In the principal Act there is a provision that a licensee or his wife may provide liquor to a member of his or her family living with him or her, but in order to add the words &#x201C;employee or manager&#x201D; the whole provision has been rewritten and a simple little sentence is now changed into a sentence containing 51 words. This has deen done in order to provide that an <span class="col_7493-7494" refersTo="page_1077"/>employee or manager may give a member of his own family resident with him alcoholic liquor. By the time one has waded through the amended provision, it takes one about five minutes to understand what it is all about. This is what I mean by suggesting that a much simpler approach could have been adopted.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into the details of the clauses, but there are one or two matters to which I want to refer so that the hon. the Minister can consider them. One he has dealt with himself, and I refer to the fact that election days are to be closed days. On the recommendation of a Select Committee which considered this problem from every angle, this House took a decision and amended the Electoral Consolidation Act as an experiment. I repeat that it was a decision of this House agreed to by the Minister of the Interior. However, the Minister of Justice has his own empire and he is not prepared to accept the will of Parliament or the decision of his colleague, the Minister of the Interior; he says, &#x201C;No, as Minister of Justice, I am going to frustrate the will of Parliament; I am going to frustrate the will of a Select Committee and while you have amended the Electoral Consolidation Act, I will block you through legislation which I control.&#x201D; The object of that amendment of the Electoral Consolidation Act was to test whether South Africans were becoming adults or whether they still have to be treated like children. This, I think, is fundamental to the thinking when it comes to liquor. The Liquor Act treats everybody who gets anywhere within sight of a bottle of liquor like a child who must be restricted, protected, limited, tied. We wanted to make a small test in order to establish whether South Africans were now adult enough to do as people in every civilized country in the world do and that is to fight an election without being told that they cannot be trusted in case they have a drink.</p>

This is one of the things which the hon. the Minister himself highlighted by saying in his introductory speech that although this House had amended section 181 of the Electoral Consolidation Act, he was not prepared to accept that and was going to block it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we in these benches are going to take the somewhat unusual, and yet, we believe, very important step of opposing the motion of the hon. the Minister that leave be granted to introduce this legislation. Although the title is short, it is quite clear from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s motion that the Bill deals with a fundamental matter, namely the question of independence for what is at the moment an integral part of South Africa. We want to deal with this because we do not believe that this is in the interests of the people of South Africa. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is an historic occasion for the hon. members opposite because it is in a sense the climax to the separate development policy enunciated first by Prime Minister Verwoerd in his &#x201C;new vision&#x201D; speech in this House in January 1959. But, Sir, it is also historic from the point of view of South Africa, for what has been a single constitutional entity is now to be fragmented. In other countries this happens as a result of war or as a result of secession, but in South Africa this is going to happen, if the Government has its way, as a deliberate act on the part of the Government. [Interjections.] The granting of independence to the Transkei is tied in with a vision for the future of South Africa, a vision which hon. members opposite have quite clearly, namely a vision of a country which is fragmented into a number of independent States on an ethnic basis. On the other hand, there is another vision, the vision of those of us on these benches, a vision of a single South Africa in which 25 million people will co-operate without the need for independence of any one section of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let me make it quite clear that we oppose leave to introduce this Bill to grant the Transkei independence because we in these benches do not believe that the solution of the problem of South Africa lies in the establishment of independent homelands, be it the Transkei or any other. Secondly, we believe that if what the Government is seeking by asking leave to introduce this Bill is economic progress and national security and the elimination of race discrimination, this is best done within the framework of one country in which self-governing provinces co-operate. The mere fact that this Bill is being introduced, shows that under the policy of separate development the Government intends to grant independence to the Transkei. We want to make it quite clear that we believe that the Government&#x2019;s action, based on the information before us at this stage, is wrong. Thirdly, we do not believe the move which is envisaged by this motion by the Minister will eliminate any of the areas of potential conflict existing in South African society today. Indeed, they may well generate new areas of conflict&#x2014;over land, over citizenship and over the treatment of people from the Transkei in South Africa. Nor will it help to resolve the cardinal issue facing South Africa, and that is the sharing of political power in the economically active areas which are shared by Black and White. Finally, why we oppose a motion for leave to introduce a Bill to grant independence to the Transkei in these specific circumstances is that there has been no proper choice put before the people of the Transkei or the people of South Africa. The choice was not a choice between full citizenship in the Transkei or full citizenship in South Africa; it was a choice between full citizenship in the Transkei or nothing in South Africa. It has not met the essential prerequisite even at this stage of there having been a referendum on this issue. We believe that the people of the Transkei who are affected by this measure, and the people of South Africa, who are also affected by the fact that part of their country is now going to become independent, have a right to express their view by a specific referendum in which the options are pointed out to them.</p>

<p>So we are opposed to the introduction of this measure. This is perhaps what the Government claims, i.e. a watershed for this generation of South Africans, a watershed because the intention is to fragment South Africa. But we have sufficient faith in the essential strength of South Africa to believe <span class="col_7497-7498" refersTo="page_1079"/>that the people and the communities of South Africa, will in due course come together again in one unfragmented South Africa. Because we believe that this proposed measure is fundamental, because it deals with our vision of the future and the Government&#x2019;s vision of the future, because it deals with the fragmentation of our country, and because a proper choice has not been put before the people clearly and expressly by way of a referendum, we oppose the introduction of this measure.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Official Opposition will support the First Reading of this Bill. We are a federal party with a federal ideal for South Africa and we do not believe that the federal alternative has been placed before the people of the Transkei. By the same token, Sir, there is no doubt that the people of the Transkei have asked for independence. They have been promised independence and they are so far on the road to independence that we feel that this is a matter which should be left to their own self-determination. Whether this Bill contains the necessary machinery for the type of constitution they should have, whether it is a satisfactory Bill to us, we cannot yet say. But as it stands at the present moment, we believe that this Bill is entitled to a First Reading because of the wishes of the people of the Transkei as expressed through their duly elected Assembly and because it gives them that measure of self-determination to which we believe they are entitled. We will keep our options open until we have studied the Bill. We shall then decide what our attitude is to be.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. T. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the hon. member for Sea Point whether he does not want to withdraw the insult he paid Chief Minister Matanzima and the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei. Sir, here we have a request by the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei for independence, for self-determination. However, the hon. member for Sea Point alleges that this request by the Legislative Assembly is not a reflection of the opinion of the inhabitants of the Transkei. In other words, the hon. member for Sea Point maintains that Chief Minister Matanzima, his Cabinet and the Transkeian Legislative Assembly are out of touch with the true aspirations and feelings of the Xhosa nation. He now wants to prescribe to them, in the typical old imperialist colonialist manner, what is and is not good for them.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have a National Party, a party which believes that every nation has a God-given, inalienable right to self-determination, the right to determine its own fate. This is the policy of the National Party and this is the opportunity the National Party affords other nations living in South Africa, just as it claims them for itself. I was absolutely amazed to hear this political stupidity, impudence, presumption and insult towards the people of the Transkei from the hon. member for Sea Point this afternoon. I say again: It is a repetition of the old colonialist imperialist mentality which still lives on in that party. People are prescribed to from elsewhere as to how they, in turn, should prescribe to other people in other places. What the big boss says, has to be done. Once again this afternoon we saw this illustrated here very clearly. The hon. member said: &#x201C;It is not in the best interests of the people of South Africa.&#x201D; This is the &#x201C;one vision&#x201D; of which he spoke. The &#x201C;other vision&#x201D; of which he spoke, is an undivided unitary state in South Africa.</p>

<p>They as a party, who are so concerned about human rights, human dignity, discrimination and similar matters, want to create a unitary state in South Africa in which the rights of minority groups are protected. There is only one way in which to protect the rights, the privileges of minority groups and their human dignity, etc., and this is by means of this very policy of separate development, a policy which gives every homogeneous national group sovereignty over itself and enables it to protect its own identity. A small nation like the Ndebele cannot maintain themselves in a unitary state. They would be unable to protect their identity in a unitary state. Nor could they acquire sovereignty in a unitary state, because they would become the slaves of the majority groups in South Africa. Do the hon. members of the PRP not want to learn the lesson of Africa? Africa does not share power. Either the one or the other is master. What is becoming of the minority groups in Angola? Can those hon. members tell me where Dr. Savimbi&#x2019;s people are and what became of the rights of the people of the FNLA? Can they say what happened to the rights of the minority groups in Mozambique? Are the rights of such groups recognized there? Are their rights respected there?</p>

<p><span class="col_7499-7500" refersTo="page_1080"/>The PRP is striving for a policy which will bring about the downfall and obliteration of the identity and sovereignty of all minority groups in South Africa. This is what would happen if we were to follow their policy. In contrast to this, the policy of the NP is one of the freedom of peoples. It is a policy which does not impose a ceiling on people. It is not a policy in terms of which people may be tricked with all sorts of constitutional gimmicks. It is an honest policy, a policy which gives every nation its inalienable, God-given birthright, namely the maintenance of sovereignty over itself and the protection of its own identity. This involves the inter-dependence of coexisting in peace and prosperity in a country with other sovereign entities.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I did not shout when he spoke; the hon. members on the other side may as well give me a chance, too. I want to agree with him that the problem of minorities in Africa is a critical one. However, the important point is that the hon. member wants to make out that the policy of the Government solves the problem. The fact, is, however, that the policy of the Government does not do so. The legislation we are now considering must be seen as the culmination of the Government&#x2019;s plan to solve the problems of co-existence in South Africa. The issue, therefore, is not merely the independence of a particular tribe; in fact it is the co-existence and continued existence of Black and White in South Africa, and the legislation must be judged as such. As such it must be seen as part of the plan of separate development by means of which the Government proposes to solve the problem of minorities. We in these benches, however, are convinced that this cannot be done. I should like to mention one point to which the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development himself referred during the debate on his Vote. I should like to read from Hansard, 1976, col. 5559&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What the hon. member does not realize either is that the moment the Transkei becomes independent, the Transkeians will, in terms of the constitution, which will then be their final constitution, and in terms of the legislation which we shall pass here, cease to be South African citizens. At the same time they will automatically become Transkeian citizens so that if the Transkei should thereafter refuse or withdraw the citizenship of some of them, they will not become stateless as a result of an Act passed here in Cape Town but as a result of a step taken by the Transkeian Government. That should be very clear.</block>

<p>By saying this, one is saying by implication that one is going to take away the citizenship of people in the urban centres. I want to ask the hon. member, in all honesty, whether he really thinks that this will contribute towards the solution of the problem of conflict with which we are faced. Does he really think that this legislation will be of any help in solving the problem of the co-existence of White and Black in cities? The hon. the Minister also made the following remark&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surely, the hon. member must realize that according to our policy of separate development as I tried to sketch it here again this afternoon, the separate nations each have their own national area and this area, White South Africa, is the area of the Whites.</block>

<p>If one supports this type of legislation, one supports this philosophy by implication, and after all, we have never done this. Indeed, I do not believe that any Opposition party accepts the philosophy that national areas should be worked out on a geographic basis for the Coloureds, let alone for the Indians! [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister only referred to the Bantu, but what about these two groups? It is these central, fundamental problems which come to the fore when legislation of this type is considered. The issue is not merely a specific group of people who are becoming independent; the issue is actually the fact that this type of legislation is being put forward as part of a great policy, a great plan for the solution of the race problem in South Africa. This is why we cannot support it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to suggest that when we reach this stage in the development of the homelands and a political party opposes legislation of this nature, its opposition should be fully in accordance with its basic approach. I therefore want to point out that what the PRP did today was in conflict with the basic approach they have expounded from time to time since 1972. Not only did they have a committee in 1972 which looked at their policy and found that such great progress had already been made along the road of constitutional development in South Africa that the PRP had to revise its policy, but that in the revision of their policy they also made provision for a federation. Before the hon. member for Rondebosch was elected as a member of this House and before he could say that no opposition party accepted geographic separation as a solution, the hon. member for Houghton said in answer to a question in the House that when the homelands became independent, the PRP would invite them to be part of their federation.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>In the pamphlet which bears the photo of the hon. member for Sea Point as the leader of the party, their policy is set out, and it is indeed full of loopholes, as the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development pointed out. In it the hon. member for Sea Point says that the components of their federation will be self-governing areas. In other words, the PRP themselves foresee the possibility of independent, autonomous components within their federation. However, they now object to the first step in this direction. It is absolutely immoral of a party to go back entirely on what they have said and put forward these arguments. The hon. member for Sea Point also quoted a typical argument which we had not had clearly presented by them before. When we have accused them of association with the HNP in the past, we have not had very strong grounds for doing so. The hon. member for Houghton has always been here and I could never see her as a bed-fellow of Jaap Marais. However; the hon. member for Sea Point built his argument around the element of fear. He phrased it very carefully. He made out that we wanted to endanger the security of South Africa. The hon. member introduced an element into this debate which will place under suspicion everything the PRP says from now on on behalf of the Blacks. This is undoubtedly the case.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say that the speech of the hon. member for Rondebosch in connection with citizenship is absolutely presumptuous at this stage.</p>

Quite the opposite is true. We are being completely consistent.

What is more, we have always opposed the fragmentation of South Africa, and this Bill will precisely have the effect of fragmenting South Africa.

<p>I do not need to read the Bill. The title of the Bill tells us exactly that independence is going to be granted. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, do you think you can get them to be quiet for a moment? The title of the Bill makes it absolutely clear that, as from the time that this Bill is passed by this House, the Transkei will no longer be an integral part of South Africa. We are against that fragmentation. We stand for one multi-racial South Africa, and that is not in conflict with our policy as was alleged by the hon. member for Bloemfontein West. We have said that, when the PRP comes to power &#x2026; [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, for a party that is disintegrating so fast that it can barely split any further, this type of laughter is very ironical. However, we have said, and we still maintain, that any homeland which has become independent under NP government will be invited to join the federal Republic of South Africa. That still stands.</p>

<p>Sir, there is not yet an independent Transkei; this Bill is the mechanism whereby the Transkei is going to become independent, and we are not about to encourage that. That is not part and parcel of our policy, and, for the benefit of the hon. members behind, that has nothing whatever to do with the acquisition of land under the 1936 Land Act, when the question of independence was never discussed.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I state again that our opposition to the First Reading of this Bill is completely in keeping with our policy. We are not going to assist the Government in carrying out its grand plan for apartheid, because, as the hon. member for Rondebosch has said, the granting of independence to the Transkei, or to any other Bantustan for that matter, is the penultimate step in the carrying out of the so-called grand plan of apartheid by the Nationalist Government. [Interjections.] We have always rejected the NP solution of the so-called problems of co-existence in South Africa. We do not believe that by attempting to remove, firstly 3 million to 4 million people in the form of the Transkei Independence Bill, to be followed later by the remaining Africans in their particular homelands, from the body politic, from the citizenship rolls of South Africa, will ensure their disappearance from the Republic of South Africa; the White Republic of South Africa. That, of course, is what is behind it all. What is behind all this, is the Government&#x2019;s intense desire to prove to the rest of the world that South Africa has in fact a White majority Government, because the peoples of the <span class="col_7505-7506" refersTo="page_1083"/>different Bantustans will be excised from the population of South Africa by the granting of independence. That is the main reason why the Government is pushing ahead with this with all deliberate speed. We on these benches are going to do all that we can to block the passage of this Bill by voting against it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have already indicated, during the Second Reading of this Bill, that this side of the House supports it. Consequently, we shall also promise our support of the Bill as far as the Third Reading is concerned. In other words, we welcome the provision which is being made for the improvement and extension of the in-service training of Bantu employees. We are sorry that the Bill does not go further and that we are not at this stage making proper provision for the training of Blacks as skilled workers. Naturally we have dealt with the Bill in the form in which it was presented to this House. We believe that the Bill would have functioned better and would have been more effective if the hon. the Deputy Minister had been prepared to accept some of the amendments which we moved during the Committee Stage. Indeed a considerable number of questions which were put in the Committee Stage to which no satisfactory answers were provided. I do not want to use the same expression which the hon. the Minister of Community Development used a few days ago when he spoke of Tupperware, because it would be plagiarism. But the discussion during the Committee Stage debate reminded me a great deal of the stupidity of the proverbial block-head. Questions were put in connection with training in the mining industry. This is excluded from the Bill.</p>

<p>As far as the Chamber of Mines is concerned, it is clear that that training is being provided, but it must be added that there could be a large number of smaller undertakings, in various mining activities and not in gold or diamond mines alone, where assistance in regard to in-service training could fulfil an essential function. The hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s answer to this was that as far as he knew, this was done in terms of a Cabinet decision. In all honesty, surely this is no answer. If this is the case, the Cabinet should be here to tell us why this decision was taken. It seems to me as if a possible reason for the exclusion of the mining industry could be the type of problem which might be caused should some of our other friends acquire representation in the House. I was very acutely reminded of that problem when I read in <i>Rapport</i> on Sunday what Mr. Andries van Wyk reported from Washington. I am going to read this to hon. members here because the same kind of sentiments were expressed here by the hon. members for Hercules and Vanderbijlpark. This columnist from Washington had this to say&#x2014;</p>

Daardie inskripsie moet lui: &#x201C;Aan Arrie Paulus as erkenning van die lofwaardige diens wat hy Suid-Afrika in sy moeilikste omstandighede bewys het deur die volgende gevleuelde woorde in &#x2019;n buitelandse verslag die lig te laat sien. &#x201D;</block>

<p>Then he quoted this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Wat my vakbond betref,&#x201D; s&#x00EA; mnr. Paulus, &#x201C;is die Swarte se toekoms di&#x00E9; van &#x2019;n arbeider. Omdat alle myne binne ons Wit tuislande val, is dit geregverdig om van die Bantoe sekere vaardighede te weerhou. &#x2019;n Bantoe kan Eerste Minister in sy eie tuisland word, maar ek kan nie soontoe gaan en Eerste Minister word nie. Waarom moet dit dus vir hom moontlik wees om hier in Suid-Afrika in my tuisland die status van &#x2019;n Blanke mynwerker te bereik?&#x201D;</block>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, surely that is no answer. The basic issue here is the question whether Blacks should also be trained as skilled labourers. It is that simple, and all I asked the hon. member for Carletonville, was whether or not he is in favour of it.</p>

<p>Sir, there are also other aspects in respect of which we expressed misgivings. We asked whether or not, in terms of clause 11 of the Bill, all the other training facilities which have been made available in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, therefore also become illegal now. We also indicated that we believe that assistance for schemes should also be offered to employers, in the manner envisaged in the Bill, outside the so-called economic development areas. In addition we said that in our opinion the provisions of clause 11 of the Bill went much too far and were unsound. However, I do not want to repeat those arguments.</p>

<p>Before I raise other matters, I just want to say that we trust that the Department of Bantu Education as well as the Ministry and the council which is being created here, will display a great deal of initiative in putting this Bill into operation. We know that there are employers who want to make use of these facilities and we on our part, wish to express the hope that employers will make full use of the possibilities and the facilities which are being created by this Bill.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, you must allow me to reply to certain points which the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned at the end of the Second Reading debate. In other words he mentioned those points at a stage when we were no longer able to comment on them. On that occasion the hon. the Deputy Minister quoted Van Wyk Louw to illustrate what he said. Sir, I have far too high a regard for the person of the late N. P. van Wyk Louw to drag him into a petty party-political dispute in this House. His was a great spirit and he was an open person, and I am therefore not prepared to drag him into this. But for every passage which the hon. the Deputy Minister can quote from N. P. van Wyk Louw, I can quote another. In fact there is a quotation from him in the latest edition of <i>Rapport.</i> However, I do not want to quote Van Wyk Louw now, and I want to say that I really do not think it is <span class="col_7509-7510" refersTo="page_1085"/>necessary for the hon. the Deputy Minister to go to Van Wyk Louw when he has a case to put here. As a result of our views on the Bill, the hon. the Deputy Minister suggested that we had allegedly made an error of reasoning. With reference to Van Wyk Louw he referred to the hon. member for Hillbrow and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not a lack of sentiment, but an error of reasoning. If one fails to perceive the major racial differences in South Africa, then one is suffering from a colour blindness which obfuscates all political discussion. This is a truth with which we are dealing here. We in the National Party state the reality in South Africa as far as the people in this country are concerned.</block>

<p>This is that we in South Africa are not simply dealing with a total population of 25 million, but that we are dealing with groups, etc. Sir, no thinking person in this country can deny the existence of the diversity in our population structure. He would be making a fool of himself if he did so. I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister at once that to suggest that we deny the existence of that diversity, is not correct. But it is not the existence of diversity which is of interest&#x2014;nobody denies this. What is of interest, is to what degree that diversity provides justification for the withholding or the granting of rights, privileges, obligations, responsibilities or whatever.</p>

<p>Order! I allowed the hon. member to reply very briefly, but I must point out that the Bill is before this House for its Third Reading, and it deals purely with the training of Bantu in the centres which are being created for that purpose, and with the financing thereof. Therefore, the hon. member must confine himself to the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Sir. Then I shall proceed to the next point which the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned, with reference to Prof. Murray, etc. As far as this is concerned, too, I want to say at once that it is quite inexplicable to me, for arising out of the statement of Prof. Murray, to which the hon. the Deputy Minister reconciled himself, he said that Prof. Murray referred to ethnic corporations. Sir, I am returning to the question of labour now, since the hon. the Deputy Minister raised it in his speech. He said Prof. Murray calls the people Black ethnic corporations and then the hon. the Deputy Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At present these non-White ethnic corporations are in a position where they cannot really offer much more than their labour. As corporation this is their most important export product to the White area. The time will arrive, however, when they are no longer exporting their labour only, and when they should, within their <i>lebensraum</i>&#x2014;homelands, group areas and rural areas&#x2014;produce enough to export more than just their labour to the White area. The relationship between them is not that of one community, but that of a contractual relationship between various corporations.</block>

<p>In all honesty, what has this to do with the in-service training of Bantu labourers?</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I can still understand it if the hon. the Deputy Minister refers to the Bantu in the homelands who are able to export their labour, but where are the Coloureds and Indians going to export their labour to? What can they provide apart from their labour? No, an argument is being used there in connection with the in-service training of Bantu which does not hold water. The hon. the Deputy Minister was reacting to a question asked by the hon. member for Hillbrow. The hon. member for Hillbrow asked whether there was a difference between the in-service training of a Zulu and that of a Xhosa. He asked what the difference is between a Zulu and a Xhosa mechanician. Then the hon. the Deputy Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7511-7512" refersTo="page_1086"/>That is precisely what I am trying to bring home to the hon. member, i.e. that one cannot qualify that person simply as a mechanician. Surely there are more aspects associated with his existence than simply the fact that he has a specific manual skill.</block>

<p>He continued in this way. What has this to do with the Bill? Does the hon. the Deputy Minister want to allege that we should have different training centres for different groups of people? Should we tell an employer that his training scheme will be approved only if he provides separate training facilities for those who speak Sotho, Xhosa, Zulu, or whatever? If this is not the case, what is the meaning of all the words which were used here? However, if this is the case, the hon. the Deputy Minister must now tell the employers that his department is not going to provide them with assistance unless they create separate facilities for the various groups. If the hon. the Deputy Minister had said that it would have been better, owing to language differences, to provide separate training facilities, we could still have understood it. However, this is a question of in-service training. Mr. Speaker, I just want to add that this sort of motivation has done the in-service training far more harm than good. This statement reveals a complete lack of logic. If the hon. the Deputy Minister has a good case, he must not spoil it by dragging in a lot of totally unnecessary and inappropriate ideological arguments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ligthelm">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. W. LIGTHELM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while listening to the hon. member for Edenvale, I thought right from the outset that the hon. member wanted to agree with us that this legislation concerning in-service training was essential. However, the hon. member beat about the bush and tried to say that what the hon. the Deputy Minister had said in his Second Reading speech, had nothing to do with the in-service training of Bantu. In the process, however, he only succeeded in showing that what he had to say himself, had nothing to do with the in-service training of Bantu.</p>

<p>I take pleasure in supporting the Second Reading of this Bill. One hears more and more today about an insistence on higher wages and the narrowing of the wage gap, while regard is not always had to the fact that higher wages must be accompanied by higher productivity. Without that we would never be able to achieve economic production. Increased productivity, in turn, can only be obtained by training and an increase in skill. This, again, is only possible as a result of the availability of effective and orderly training and training programmes. Seen in the light of the need for economic development and the combating of stubborn, negative and incorrect influencing of the human spirit, efforts to provide education, information and training may not be slackened. On the contrary. They must be developed by every nation concerned until it becomes a South African slogan. Specialized knowledge and skills must achieve a status much higher than that of general education merely for the sake of education. Experience has taught us that a positive line of action forms the basis for better, sound labour relations and particularly Bantu labour relations.</p>

<p>In general, education and training are a collective function, and the responsibility of the State towards its inhabitants for the purpose of developing to the highest possible level the potential for achievement in both the individual and the community, to the best advantage of the national economy. This responsibility is carried out in conjunction with a large number and variety of other responsibilities which cause a particular order of priority to develop according to which the State takes action, taking into consideration the limited means at its disposal and the multiplicity of requirements which have to be complied with. Since the resources of the State are very intimately bound up with the income-generating ability of its subjects, it follows as a logical conclusion that in the first instance there ought to be sufficient employment opportunities through which efforts can be made to attain to this achievement. This means, therefore, that the creation of employment opportunities and the generation of income may be the highest priority of the State under certain circumstances, particularly if there is an acute shortage of employment opportunities in the national economy concerned. To put it differently, the creation of employment opportunities is extremely important in a country like South Africa with its ever-increasing rate of population growth, where unemployment may lead to extreme distress. However, if there are indications of full employment and there is confidence that <span class="col_7513-7514" refersTo="page_1087"/>such full employment is reasonably stable, the pattern of priorities may change and education and training may enjoy a higher priority, taking into consideration the initiative of the State and the larger percentage of State funds which will have to be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>In particular, the priority which will have to be accorded to the training of Bantu labour in South Africa, must be viewed in the light of, firstly, the need for trained manpower in the various sectors of the economy and, secondly, the ability of the State and the individual to bear the costs involved in this&#x2014;once again, seen in the light of the sectors in which the creation of employment opportunities and income may be effected most rapidly. It is general knowledge that the creation of new employment opportunities in the primary sectors of mining and agriculture are connected, on the one hand&#x2014;in the case of mining&#x2014;with new discoveries of minerals or a sudden increase in the demand due to technological breakthroughs, for example, and the higher price levels which make the mining of marginal deposits economical, or, on the other hand&#x2014;in the case of agriculture&#x2014;with a large-scale rapid change-over to more intensive exploitation and utilization of agricultural resources. Apart from the level of national priority accorded to training as a collective responsibility of the State, it must also be very purposeful and practical to be able to comply with the many special requirements of the total economy. Otherwise it may lead to a state of unemployment among trained people in the one category, and a lack of manpower in another category. Training must therefore never be a goal in itself, but must always be a means or an instrument for achieving an aim, because otherwise it may result in far-reaching disadvantages. Incorrect priorities as far as training is concerned, may have extremely harmful consequences for the economy of the community, over the long term, especially where such training programmes are introduced outside the natural operation of the market mechanism. In South Africa, owing to a conservative and sound economic policy, we have fortunately had conditions of full employment for several decades, and to such a degree that the demand and need for artisans and technicians is still increasing. This demand can be ascribed chiefly to factors such as a sustained and successful expansion of the economy in accordance with various targets aimed at, the extraordinary employment opportunities which arise as a result of the practical implementation of our policy of multi-national development, the gradual inclusion of skilled Bantu labour as a result of mechanization and cost-saving techniques, the stringent requirements set in respect of quality and the high standards set by world markets for our export products and, in conclusion, the desire and willingness of the Black labourer to develop himself, to exploit and apply his own potential more effectively to the advantage of his own people and to achieve a higher standard of living for himself.</p>

<p>Although sufficient statistics are not yet available, the information at our disposal already indicates that the demand for trained manpower already constitutes more than 32&#x0025; of the total demand for manpower in the building industry, for example&#x2014;that is to say, one in every three. According to the figures for 1970, the economically active population in the homelands is therefore already 1 472 000. On the basis of a ratio of 1 : 20 of trained as against unskilled, this means that there is already a demand for 73 600 specially trained people, whereas in the White area, with a general ratio of 1:10 it may mean a demand of approximately 350 000. If we take into consideration the fact that the expansion increases at an average rate of 40&#x0025; per annum&#x2014; everything indicates that the expansion rate will continue at this rate for a long time&#x2014;it means that it will not be possible to satisfy the demand for specially trained manpower for a long time. Information is available which indicates that there is a considerable shortage of staff to fill available posts in various categories, but similarly there is another tendency in other categories, a tendency which indicates that there are already more trained people than there are available posts. These opposing tendencies are a typical result of successful development programmes in developing economies. That is why it is so imperative that the authorities, by adopting specific measures, must take the greatest care to ensure that the limited number of trained people are trained in well-balanced proportions. There are departmental training centres for the purpose of the necessary training, situated in centres distributed throughout the country, the total cost of which is borne by the State. There are also private industrial training centres, the capital cost of which is provided by <span class="col_7515-7516" refersTo="page_1088"/>the State, while the running costs are borne by the employer himself. Furthermore, centres already exist where farmers can have selected labourers educated in a variety of practical agricultural subjects at their own expense. Over and above the formal training, it has been found that a combination of formal and in-service training is by far the most economical, and for this reason tax concessions have existed since 1974 in terms of which employers who offer approved training courses to their labourers, are entitled to deductions. There is a great deal of evidence that the already existing training programmes of the central Government can be carried out with a fair amount of success and that in this way steadily improving Bantu labour relations may be achieved. The total net result, at the very least, could involve major advantages for every separate population group in the broader Southern African economic and international political context.</p>

<p>I am full of confidence that greater successes are a practical reality, and I believe that South Africa and all its various peoples deserve this. This legislation envisages the orderly regulation of in-service training of Bantu employees, as well as the advancement thereof in the interests of industry and the country&#x2019;s economy. It is also in the direct interests of the particular employer himself. Therefore I should like to support the Third Reading of this Bill wholeheartedly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we supported the Second Reading of this Bill and I now want to speak in support of the Third Reading as well. The hon. member for Middelburg has made some important observations, one of which in particular, is the link that always exists to link higher wages&#x2014;the lowering of the wage gap&#x2014;with increased productivity. That, of course, means that, if one is going to go for this, one must also link that with training. This is perhaps one of the reasons why the Bill before us is so important and so far-reaching. It has not only something specific to say about in-service training, but I believe it bears commentary on the entire economic system which we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>This is an important piece of legislation. I believe it is a further pointer that it is now generally accepted that the Black worker in South Africa has an indispensable role to play in the growth of the economy of South Africa. This emphasis on the Black worker as an important component in our economy, together with the recent increase of wages paid to Black workers, reflects, what I believe to be, the beginning of a process away from a labour intensive, low wage, low productivity economic system, which characterizes the early years of an industrial society; a moving away from this kind of system to a capital intensive, high wage, high productivity system, which characterizes advanced industrial countries. This is the dilemma, I believe, that we face in South Africa, that on the one hand one has a First World situation, and yet, cheek by jowl, one has also a Third World system. What one has to try and do, is to build a bridge between a First World, highly industrialized system and a Third World, low trained&#x2014; sometimes uneducated&#x2014;mass of workers. In-service training, of course, is one of the best ways in which we can build that kind of bridge. That is why we are supporting this Bill.</p>

<p>Obviously the emphasis on training, whether it be in-service training or other kinds of training&#x2014;there is a wide variety available today&#x2014;can only be of direct benefit to all South Africans and to the South African economy as a whole and not merely to the Black workers concerned. I also agree with the hon. member for Middelburg when he makes the point that the State has a very real responsibility in this regard. I should couple this with the very real responsibility employers have. Together with the hon. member for Edenvale one sincerely hopes that employers will take advantage of this. But, as I tried to stress during the Second Reading debate, unfortunately some employers have not taken advantage of the incentives which have been given in recent years. One hopes this will not be the case as the in-service training centres are further developed. I should also emphasize that the responsibility does not rest with the State or the employer only, but a tremendous amount inevitably depends on the willingness of the individual worker himself. While all the facilities and opportunities can be afforded by the State and by an employer, if the employee himself is not willing to take advantage of the further training, then nothing that either the State or the employer can do is going to be worthwhile in the long run.</p>

<p>I also hope that the emphasis on in-service <span class="col_7517-7518" refersTo="page_1089"/>training will create an even deeper awareness. Those of us who advocate so strongly that the private enterprise system is the system best calculated to raise the standards of life and to open doors of opportunity to all, must demonstrate very urgently and clearly that the private enterprise system and its attendant benefits are not marked for Whites only. I think it is well known that private enterprise is under attack in many parts of the world, including our own country. I believe that one of the best ways to guarantee the continuation, the development and the entrenchment of the private enterprise system is to make it possible for as many people in South Africa as possible to participate in the responsibilities and the privileges which flow from the private enterprise system. This, I believe, is one of the reasons why in-service training is so vitally important. Unless people are trained adequately and sufficiently, they cannot really participate in the private enterprise system as they ought to, and therefore this in turn holds a threat within the system for all of us.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading debate I said that the Bill as set out placed what I described as an emphasis on control rather than on the promotion of training. I said that was the emphasis. In reply the hon. the Deputy Minister assured the House that this was not so. I hope this will prove true in practice and that the emphasis will be on encouragement and on promotion rather than on control. Inevitably some control mechanisms are necessary but I hope that the emphasis will be on promotion rather than on control.</p>

<p>I also expressed concern about existing training centres which were not registered in terms of the Bantu Education Act. As I do not think that there was any direct reply to this concern as I expressed it during the Second Reading debate, I do hope that provision will be made for provisional registration or temporary exemption until the formalities of the Act can be complied with. There are some of these training centres, and I mentioned as an example the garment industry in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>Finally, in supporting the Third Reading of the Bill, I reiterate the view made during the Second Reading debate and in the Committee Stage, that the co-ordinating council which is going to bear a great deal of the responsibility will do its work more effectively if Black persons with intimate knowledge of in-service training, problems and needs were to be included in its membership.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me, at the conclusion of the Third Reading to thank my hon. colleagues and other hon. members for their contributions. I want to thank the hon. member for Middelburg for the interesting and well thought out contribution which he presented here. One can certainly follow up the ideas he suggested. I also want to thank the hon. member for Pinelands sincerely for the remarks he made and for the positive contribution he made to the discussion. The hon. member rightly pointed out that the emphasis must be on the advancement of the in-service training of Bantu employees. I am convinced that this is in fact the purpose of this legislation, even though in clause 11 the emphasis is more on control, but there is a good reason for this. In the wider context, the whole machinery is set in operation with a view to the advancement of the in-service training of Bantu employees. The hon. member raised important facts in connection with private initiative, but I think that in a country like South Africa, with the many problems we experience not only on the level of labour, it is necessary that this should take place in an orderly manner. I think the hon. member agrees with me on that score.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Edenvale for having supported this Bill on behalf of the UP. It is a good thing that a Bill like this should come into effect with the support of all the parties in the House. The hon. member for Edenvale again put questions to me in connection with the schemes under the provisions of the Industrial Conciliation Act. I think I made a remark about this, but perhaps it was a little brief. However, I told the hon. member that certain private schemes could continue as usual, but should such schemes enter a field covered by the provisions of the Bantu Education Act, they would have to take account of the fact that they could not, by way of a private scheme of this kind, provide training to which the Bantu Education Act, from which these functions are now excluded, applies. However, if the employees of more than one employer are being trained, then in terms of clause 11, this legislation seeks to exercise control over this because in <span class="col_7519-7520" refersTo="page_1090"/>all the discussions we have held with employers and employees, they foresaw certain problems and asked us to provide for those problems. Organizations and existing centres will be afforded the opportunity to be approved in terms of the provisions of this legislation. Sufficient time will be allowed should they want to involve themselves under the provisions of this Act in order to savour the advantages of the legislation by way of tax concessions.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Edenvale seems to be so friendly and sociable after his speech that I do not really want to react to his image of &#x201C;so toe soos Tupperware&#x201D;. I think I must leave it at that because I do not want to conjure up an image for him too. However, someone once called another person as &#x201C;toe&#x201D; as the bar at Koekenaap between one and two. However, I am not quite sure that it is very &#x201C;toe&#x201D;, otherwise it could possibly have been applicable. However I shall leave it at that.</p>

<p>But then it is really &#x201C;toe&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As far as the mines are concerned, the fact of the matter is that they have a very good system of selection, recruitment and training. In other words, the mines do not need a stimulus for in-service training by means of this legislation. This is my first argument. The second is that these people did not approach us with the request that they be allowed to link up in this regard. The discussions were held with both employers and employees. The hon. member for Edenvale can shake his head&#x2014;I do not hear anything inside it. But this is the position.</p>

<p>I do not want to repeat the argument about which he became so heated. The hon. member for Hillbrow followed the whole argument and was so friendly towards me later on that I thought he would cross to this side of the House at any moment. The hon. member for Hillbrow spoke about the separation and the distinction we were drawing between the various national and race groups in South Africa. What his argument amounted to by implication was that we should try and stop this differentiation and distinction between the various national groups, something which we are now also extending to the training of workers. As far as that standpoint is concerned, I then said that he was making a fundamental mistake if he wanted to shut his mind to the idea of separation and distinction and extend that shutting of his mind to the distinction, to the labour level as well. This was the origin of the argument. I then told the hon. member that if he wanted to shut it from his mind, I too could quote good authorities to the contrary. That was how I came to Van Wyk Louw. Now, I do not know why the hon. member is so afraid of quoting Van Wyk Louw. He was very welcome to do so. Even we who sometimes argue a little from the Bible say, for example: &#x201C;But after all, it is written that&#x2026;&#x201D; Then the other man is very welcome to say &#x201C;But it is also written that &#x2026;&#x201D; The one quotes Paul and the other quotes Jacob. They are very welcome to do so. Paul is even quoted against himself. The hon. member was therefore very welcome to quote Van Wyk Louw. However, I quoted a clear statement by that honoured author, the statement that whereas the liberals are so quick to speak of one nation of ten million people&#x2014;of course, it is already 25 million people now&#x2014;he criticizes that idea as an error of reasoning because they do not take the major race differences into consideration.</p>

<p>On the basis of the race differences that exist, he says it is nonsensical to speak of one nation of ten million people. Now the hon. member says that it goes without saying that he endorses this, because he also endorses the diversity in the population. Sir, this is the case, and we almost want to say &#x201C;thank you very much for that recognition&#x201D; because this is a very important recognition. The recognition of the fact of diversity involves many implications. One cannot simply recognize that fact and then forget about it. The fact of the diversity of nations has many implications, <i>inter alia,</i> in the social, the educational, the economic and particularly in the political spheres. Against that background the hon. member for Hillbrow then asked: &#x201C;What is the difference between a Zulu mechanician and a Xhosa mechanician?&#x201D; I then said to him that, in the broader context, whether a man is a good mechanician or not, is surely not all that is at stake. Obviously one also has to see that man against the background of his social <span class="col_7521-7522" refersTo="page_1091"/>structure and his political structure. Against that background I quoted Prof. A. H. Murray in regard to the national corporations. As far as this is concerned, the hon. member tried to fish for information concerning the Coloureds, but Prof. Murray referred to a national corporation specifically in connection with the Coloureds, too, and about the export of their labour, and said that they should develop more than just a labour potential within their own areas&#x2014; whether group areas or rural areas or whatever, not to mention the Bantu homelands. He said that they should develop their production there so that they could export the products they manufactured and accumulate capital in this way. This is also the argument of this side of the House.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think it is necessary to say anything more. I think I have answered the points which hon. members raised. In conclusion I just want to express my sincere thanks once again for the support which came from all sides of the House.</p>

I shall therefore not waste the time of this Committee by repeating our attitude in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in dealing with this particular clause, which basically is one containing definitions, I first of all would like to draw attention to the definition of &#x201C;school&#x201D;. Quite rightly the hon. the Minister has indicated in his Second Reading speech that this definition will in fact not be applicable to private schools. But there are one or two aspects which I would like to raise at this stage. First of all we should bear in mind that there are today very few genuine private schools as such and that most private schools are in fact receiving some form of subsidization. As such they will to a certain extent come under the jurisdiction of this Bill except, as the Minister has pointed out, in as far as it will be voluntary registration and that there will be no disciplinary powers possible over them. But the one point I think we must raise at this stage is that teachers at private schools are not prevented in any way from joining a teachers&#x2019; association, and that in fact they should go out of their way to do so. But there is of course inherent in this a weakness, in the sense that the professionally qualified teacher&#x2014;in terms of the definition here of a &#x201C;teacher&#x201D;&#x2014;who teaches at a private school will be able to become a member whereas unqualified teachers will not be able to become members or provisional members. The hon. the Minister knows that unqualified teachers in departmental schools, will in fact be able to register provisionally. I can appreciate the difficulty, but when we come to another clause, we will move certain amendments, the object of which is to overcome this inherent weakness which has been brought about as a result of this definition of school. I can only say to the hon. Minister that I hope he will be wise enough to see that we in fact have a point, and that we are not moving amendments to the definition of &#x201C;school&#x201D; at this stage in the hope that we will get a sympathetic hearing from him in respect of the other amendments.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, you will notice that I have two amendments standing in my name on the Order Paper. Before I speak on them and before you, Sir, remind me that the principle of this clause has already been accepted at Second Reading, I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that as a Minister and as a person with a doctorate I know that he knows all about functional literacy&#x2014;to be able to read and comprehend&#x2014;and having read and comprehended what has been printed he can now see how easy it would have been to overcome all these problems if in fact he had <span class="col_7523-7524" refersTo="page_1092"/>done so before the time. Sir, I would still like to move the two amendments, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 3, in line 17, to omit &#x201C;for Whites&#x201D;;</li>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that in the definitions in clause 1 no definition is given of &#x201C;registrar&#x201D;, although the registrar is referred to in clause 11 of the Bill. I do not know whether it is due to an omission or whether it was done intentionally. But if one looks at other legislation of a similar nature, the S.A. Medical Council for example, one finds that there they define &#x201C;registrar&#x201D; and refer to him specifically in a certain section of their Act. Also in the Pharmacy Act a definition of &#x201C;registrar&#x201D; appears in section 1 of the Act and the registrar is referred to specifically in a section of the Act. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister feels that it is desirable that the registrar should be defined in this particular Bill. If he does, I am prepared to move the amendment which I have prepared in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville. It concerns clause (1)(xii), which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Professional teachers&#x2019; qualification&#x201D; means a degree, diploma or certificate recognized by the committee as a professional teacher&#x2019;s qualification for employment at a school to teach.</block>

<p>We should like to substitute the word &#x201C;council&#x201D; with &#x201C;committee&#x201D;. The motivation for this may be found in clause 3, which concerns the objects of the council, that is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object of the council shall be to uphold and promote esteem for education and the teaching profession and the prestige of those who are engaged in the teaching profession.</block>

<p>We feel strongly that a council like this should also have the power of being able to decide on the qualifications of its members and the validity of such qualifications. I know there may perhaps be administrative reasons which the hon. the Minister may advance for its having been essential in the past, but with this legislation we are now creating a new institution precisely with the purpose of lending prestige to the teaching profession and promote respect for it. One of the most important characteristics of any such professional organization is after all the degree of earnest with which they see to the qualifications of their members. In the definition the council itself does not actually have a say about the professional qualifications of its members. Therefore I should very much like to support the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<p>I should also have liked to say a few words about the other amendments, but I shall do so later.</p>

<p>That is the position in terms of that Act. Therefore I cannot accept the amendment unless I repeal the relevant part of that Act or amend the Act. I already stated yesterday, in my reply to the Second Reading debate, that after this council has been instituted, the committee of heads of education, the federal council and this council can have a round-table conference&#x2014;and I shall see to it that this happens&#x2014;and iron out this problem. My present situation is such, however, that I simply cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, the reasons being those I have already furnished.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Berea <span class="col_7525-7526" refersTo="page_1093"/>and his question about the definition of &#x201C;registrar&#x201D;. My department informs me that the legal advisers did not think it necessary to define that word because it is only used once in the entire Bill and that is in clause 11, if my memory serves me correctly. However, in view of the fact that the hon. member has raised this matter, I shall again ask the legal advisers whether it would not be advisable to define &#x201C;registrar&#x201D;.

My object in raising the matter with the hon. the Minister at this stage is to point out that if at any time in future it becomes necessary to enlarge upon or further define the functions of the registrar, it will be desirable to have the term defined in the definitions clause.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal very briefly with the amendment which I have moved. I am appreciative of the fact that the hon. the Minister is going to consider it and I shall therefore not waste time. The only point that I should like to make is that because a subsequent statute which gives the power to another authority will impliedly repeal the previous statute, it will be proper to accept this amendment. I accept, however, that he wants to have consultations. I think it is a reasonable request on his part, and therefore we shall certainly not cause undue delay in regard to the matter. We rely on the hon. the Minister to produce an amendment at some future stage when undoubtedly he will have to give further powers to this council.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in view of your ruling I shall not move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, but should like to avail myself of the opportunity, afforded me in terms of your ruling, to state once again the dilemma in which we find ourselves with this particular type of legislation. The hon. the Minister has pointed out to us that he will have multi-racial or inter-racial co-operation and that he will try to achieve that by means of the provisions of clause 18(g), which provides that the council may&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">co-operate with any other councils or institutions whose objects or purposes are similar to those of the council.</block>

<p>This is the reason which the hon. the Minister advanced in reply to the Second Reading debate why he wants to have a council which bears the name given to it in terms of the Bill, namely the South African Teachers&#x2019; Council for Whites. I take it that there will eventually be a multi-racial body.</p>

<p>I feel that if the name of the council could have been &#x201C;the South African Teachers&#x2019; Council&#x201D;, as we have proposed, the whole matter could have been regulated in terms of certain provisions contained in the Bill. There is another point which was only pointed out to me yesterday by members of a Coloured teachers&#x2019; association. They pointed out that every time a White teachers&#x2019; association or any White association, for that matter, wants to attend an international meeting or conference, the one point which immediately disqualified it is the very fact that the word &#x201C;White&#x201D;, contained in the association&#x2019;s name, gives rise to an argument that the particular association is purely a racial institution with the result that in many cases the association is not allowed to take part in the international conference or meeting. However, if an organization had merely the description &#x201C;the South African Teachers&#x2019; Council&#x201D; as its name, the organization would at least stand a chance to be heard at and to be a member of international conferences.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall abide by your ruling but there are a few points which, although they have already been raised, I should like to emphasize once again. The type of description or definition laid down in our legislation, will really be to the disadvantage of South Africa. One can look at a simple definition, <i>inter alia</i>, that of &#x201C;teacher&#x201D; or &#x201C;council&#x201D; and this racial connotation immediately strikes one. If this is the case, it becomes practically impossible to explain from international platforms what the logic, the view, is behind a definition like this, because nowhere else in the world will one find something such as this. I wonder whether it is not possible for the hon. the Minister even to accept an amendment. Since the principle is contained in the definition, there is no reason why it should necessarily be included in the name of the council. I simply cannot understand it. In any event that principle is laid down in the definition concerned.</p>

<p>There are many names which can be used without referring to the race of people. After all there are many synonyms which one may use in this connection without referring to the race of particular people. It is possible. I cannot understand why the race of persons must be indicated in the name of the council in this case. The point has already been made earlier that this Bill affords us an opportunity to move away from this kind of word usage in South Africa. I believe that the hon. the Minister also desires to avoid such embarrassing aspects. Secondly it was mentioned that whereas attempts are being made to obtain greater co-operation on international level, this kind of word usage may definitely be a stumbling block. Therefore I really cannot see why it is necessary to retain the reference to race in this particular clause.</p>

<block name="quote">On page 5, in line 23, to omit &#x201C;for Whites&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The wording of this amendment is similar to that of the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Central. I want to motivate this amendment by saying that, as the hon. member for Rondebosch has indicated, the principle that this council is for Whites has been accepted and that, therefore, we cannot move an amendment which changes that principle. However, the name in itself could be changed. For example, instead of calling it the &#x201C;S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Council for Whites&#x201D;, it can be called the &#x201C;S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Forum&#x201D;. There is no magic in the name as long as the principle has been accepted. In any event, we believe that it is in the interests of South Africa to delete the words &#x201C;for Whites&#x201D;. The hon. member for Durban Central was under the impression, wrongly I think, that such an amendment would be out of order nevertheless, we should like to pursue it.</p>

<p>Because of his sincerity, his enthusiasm is also infectious. We saw him display this enthusiasm here yesterday during the Second Reading of the Bill. I hope the hon. the Minister will give serious consideration to the acceptance of my amendment and having done so&#x2014;having accepted it&#x2014;he will give it the impetus of his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>This clause sets out the objects of the council as being &#x201C;to uphold and promote esteem for education and the teaching profession and the prestige of those who are engaged in the teaching profession&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman, objectives such as these are highly commendable and will surely meet with the approval of all members of the teaching profession. However, I feel that all dedicated teachers will want to continually strive for higher standards of education, for higher standards in their profession. I am positive that this is an aim and an objective towards which teachers will work with a measure of dedication and enthusiasm. I firmly believe that people who enter the teaching profession, are people who do so with a dedication of purpose. Admittedly there is a larger or lesser degree of dedication, but I do not believe it can be denied that the dedication is there and is a very real thing. Equally I do not believe it can be denied that dedication, properly guided and motivated, leads to enthusiasm. I feel that in order to make the best possible use of these two attributes, namely of enthusiasm and of dedication, we should expand the objectives in this clause so as to permit and to encourage this proposed council to take whatever steps it deems necessary to improve, wherever possible, the standards of education. After all, this is what it is all about. Surely it must automatically follow that the higher the standard of education, the higher the esteem for and prestige of those who are responsible for achieving that standard. It follows, therefore, that an acceptance of this amendment will ensure the fulfilment of the very objectives that are currently embodied in this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I really cannot understand how the hon. member for Umhlanga can move an amendment to the effect that this proposed council be instructed to improve the standard of education. If the teacher is given a more elevated status, and the status of the teaching profession improves, this will naturally mean that the standard of education will also be improved. However, if the council is entrusted with the specific task of trying to improve the standards of education from above, the council will in actual fact be trespassing on the field of the employer, the education departments, whose task it is to maintain the standard of education at a certain level. They have inspectors of education who go round to ascertain whether the standard of education in the schools is high enough. The council does not have professional officials and experts who can go to schools to see whether the standard of education is low or high. In any event, it would lead to a conflict of interests if the council as well as the Department of Education were to try and lay down a standard of education. The Bill and the establishment of the council will automatically cause the standard of education and the status of the teacher to improve, and consequently the standard of education will also improve. However, it is not necessary to write this into the Bill.</p>

Is this not, after all, destroying what one could call a basic <span class="col_7531-7532" refersTo="page_1096"/>ambition? Can one have a situation where one would want something to work from within as well as from without? One is not interfering with the rights of the employer. I cannot quite concede that it is correct to say that it should only be the employer who must lay down the guide-lines for the improvement of standards. Isn&#x2019;t it a desirable situation to have the employee also participating in encouraging an improvement of standards? It is merely a matter of incorporating this as one of the main objects of the Bill, as an objective and as something for people to aim at. I do not see that there is any mileage to be gained by not encouraging participation at all levels in what must surely be the prime objective, i.e. the maintenance of the highest possible standards of education.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we all agree with the last statement of the hon. member for Umhlanga. The question is: What is the correct thing to do in terms of the functions of this council and the functions of the other bodies which also deal with related matters in education? In this regard I can mention the Federal Council and the Committee of Heads of Education.</p>

<p>I really considered very seriously whether or not to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlanga to such an extent even that I had discussions with the Federal Council this morning. They told me that because what the hon. member for Umhlanga proposes it is not a function of the council, the amendment is not acceptable to it. They say that these two things will be in conflict with each other. Consequently, this amendment is not acceptable to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened to the explanation given by the hon. the Minister. However, I should like to point out to him that there are other statutory bodies which state quite clearly that one of their objects is to assist in the promotion of certain aims. In the first place I should like to refer the hon. the Minister to chapter I of the Medical, Dental and Supplementary Health Service Professions Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The objects of the council are &#x2026;</block>

<p>And the first one is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To assist in the promotion of the health of the population of the Republic.</block>

<p>I should also like to refer the hon. the Minister to the Pharmacy Act, Act No. 53 of 1974. The first of the objects stated in the Act is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To assist in the promotion of the health of the population of the Republic.</block>

<p>Here one has two different statutory bodies, both performing health services, who are able, in their respective statutes, to have exactly the same subsection and object. I believe that under such circumstances the hon. the Minister should be able to overcome any difficulty he might encounter as a result of a clash of interests with the Federal Council or any other body.

<p>Mr. Chairman, to a certain extent this reminds me of the argument of what comes first: the chicken or the egg? I should like to know if one could indeed attain the necessary esteem and prestige for the teaching profession if there is doubt about the educational standards of the teaching profession. The one goes with the other. I want to read out to the hon. the Minister what sort of criticism I received from an educationalist, a Scottish educationalist. The first point he made is that the object is merely to uphold. He pointed out that there was no indication that the object should also be to improve. If we refer to the functions of the Teaching Council of Scotland, then we find that they do not have any specific object stated. But under the general functions it is stated as the very first function of the council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It shall be the duty of the council to keep under review the standards of education.</block>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has mentioned, and quite rightly, as far as our council is concerned, <span class="col_7533-7534" refersTo="page_1097"/>the only other council of this kind that existed in the world is the Scottish Teaching Council of 1965. There we find a specific reference to the standards of education. They use the word &#x201C;review&#x201D;. If one reviews something, one does it with something in mind. Is it to improve or to uphold? Quite frankly, that council does not only exist to uphold and promote the esteem for education and of the teaching profession, but particularly to investigate the standards of education. This is all we wish to achieve with this amendment, and I wish to express my disappointment that the hon. the Minister could not sell this to the Federal Council&#x2019;s representatives. I am quite sure that if I was given the chance, I would have been able to sell it to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I feel that I should like to add my voice in support of this argument. There is no doubt in my mind that if this council is to have any credibility, it will have to be given the object to look after the standard of education. The hon. the Minister seems to have a problem with the Federal Council. I can see no reason why the Federal Council and this council cannot both have this as one of the functions. I foresee that in time the Federal Council will become the trade union of the teachers while the council will have to set the standards. To my mind, one cannot leave this out as one of the objects of the council. It is absolutely imperative to its credibility.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think we should begin to argue about words here. The fact remains that the purpose of this Bill is to establish a teachers&#x2019; council. What is its object? The object of the council is to uphold and to promote esteem for education, for the teaching profession and for those who are engaged in the teaching profession. If one reads it in context, I do not see how one can fail to take cognizance of the term &#x201C;esteem for education&#x201D;, which is actually a vital aspect and which is the important matter we are concerned with here. I believe that the standards of education are already very high today. Constant attempts are made to improve the standards of education, and seen in the context of the objects of this council, as set out in this clause, I cannot see how we can replace the word &#x201C;esteem&#x201D; with &#x201C;high standards of education&#x201D;. The higher standards will follow in any case. After all, we have seen now that people do not have the esteem they should have for education. That is the problem we want to solve.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down spoke about the substitution of certain words by the words which I have proposed to insert into this clause. This is not a substitution at all. I have simply proposed that the words &#x201C;high standards of education&#x201D; be inserted in this clause. Surely it is not just the aim of this Bill to establish this council. We must also consider this matter in the broader field. If we want to do the right thing by this council, it should be given every encouragement to do its work in the way in which I am sure the teaching profession itself would like to see it operate.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the two amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 5, in line 29, after &#x201C;who&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;are South African citizens and&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(2) on page 5, to add the following proviso at the end of subsection (1):</li>

</ol>

<p>: Provided that an alternate to act in his absence may be elected or appointed, as the case may be, in respect of each <span class="col_7535-7536" refersTo="page_1098"/>member of the council in the same manner as such member.</p>

<p>Before I advance my argument in favour of these two amendments, I wish to refer to one sentence in the speech of the hon. the Minister. When he replied to the Second Reading debate yesterday, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; want ek wil baie graag soveel van die amendemente aanvaar as wat ek moontlik kan.</block>

<p>I hope that it is in that spirit that the hon. the Minister will consider these two amendments. I shall proceed now to tell him why I believe he should accept them. The first amendment is aimed at ensuring that one of the conditions for membership of the council shall be that persons so appointed or elected are South African citizens. I referred to this matter in the Second Reading and I do not wish to reiterate those remarks in detail. I do, however, want to point out to the hon. the Minister that there is nothing new in this principle. It was adopted in a slightly different form as far back as 1957, in the Nursing Act. In that Act it was stated that no person shall be appointed or elected as a member of the Nursing Council who is not a South African citizen.</p>

<p>This provision is also to be found in the Medical, Dental and Supplementary Health Services Act, No. 56 of 1974. There again the wording is slightly different, but the intention is the same. In section 6 of that Act it is stated that a member of the council shall vacate his office if he ceases to be a South African citizen. I believe that as time goes on, the status, the functions and the powers of this council will be augmented and broadened, and I suggest that at the highest level, where the teachers of South Africa, who are concerned with the education and training of the minds of young South Africans, are represented on this statutory body, this education and training should be in the hands of people who are dedicated to South Africa and are fully identified with South Africa. I therefore regard South African citizenship as an essential requirement for membership. Let me say again, just so that there may be no misunderstanding, that I acknowledge the significant contributions to education by teachers from the United Kingdom and Europe. I have indicated that that is a factor which I have taken into consideration, but I submit that South African citizenship should be a fundamental condition for eligibility to this council.</p>

<p>Then I would like to move on to the second amendment which deals with the question of alternates. Although perhaps in negotiations with the teaching organizations this matter may not have come under discussion and perhaps the teaching associations did not specifically suggest it, I want to point out to him that it is already so in practice. I have here a page from the <i>Journal of Education</i> of June 1975, where the officers and representatives of the S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Association are dealt with. On the standing committee of elected members provision is made for an alternate and furthermore under the joint council of the SATA and the SAOU, under the elected members, provision is also made for an alternate. So I believe that this is a system which is already entrenched in the set-up of the teachers&#x2019; associations in South Africa. But I want to go further and say it is also entrenched in legislation in South Africa.</p>

<p>For the Minister&#x2019;s benefit I wish to quote some of the examples to indicate that this principle is regarded as a reasonably important principle in our legislation in South Africa. May I quote in the first instance the Unemployment Insurance Act, No. 30 of 1966. The Unemployment Insurance Board, consisting of not fewer than eight or more than 16 members, functions on the basis of the appointment of alternates. Subsection (2) of section 12 says &#x201C;the Minister may appoint such a number of alternates as he may deem fit&#x201D;. Then we come to the Architects&#x2019; Act, involving a specific profession. Here the provision is obligatory, because in that Act it states, in section 3(6), that there shall be an alternate member appointed in the same manner as such member of the council. Then we come to the Wine, Other Fermented Beverages and Spirits Act of 1957, in terms of which the Brandy Board may not exceed five members. There again the Minister concerned may, subject to such conditions as he may determine, appoint an alternate to any member of the same board. We have the same principle accepted in the Bantu Affairs Administration Act of 1971, section 3(4). Here it says that for each member of the board there shall be an alternate member appointed in the same manner as such member. Sir, this also applies&#x2014;and I will not go into details&#x2014;to the <span class="col_7537-7538" refersTo="page_1099"/>Stock Exchanges Control Act, Act 7 of 1947. Incidentally, this particular Act was amended in 1971 to make specific provision for alternates. We have the same principle in the Fuel Research Institute and Coal Amendment Act of 1963. We have it in the Universities Act, No. 61 of 1955, where alternates may be appointed to the board for the recognition of land surveyors&#x2019; examinations. We have it in the Public Accountants and Auditors Act, No. 51 of 1951, another example where, like the architects, a professional statutory body operates on the principle of alternates. Sir, I have quoted some of these examples because I believe that this is a suggestion which could result in a much more efficient functioning also of this legislation.</p>

<p>I say this because if one considers the representation one finds that the hon. the Minister may appoint one person, and if that person is not able, for some unforeseen reason, to attend the meeting, as I understand it no possibility exists for the hon. the Minister to appoint someone else. This also applies as far as the Administrators are concerned. I think it would be regrettable for any province, for example the province of the Transvaal which represents probably the largest number of teachers and pupils in the Republic, if its representative appointed by the Administrator were in terms of this Bill unable, for some unforeseen reason, to attend the meeting. If the hon. the Minister accepts the amendment, provision will be made in the Bill for the appointment of alternates if this is considered necessary. My request is purely a permissive one. I believe it is a constructive suggestion that can only make for the efficient and smooth working of this Bill. I therefore earnestly ask the hon. the Minister to accept it.</p>

Hon. members should then only move those amendments formally and not discuss them. In that way we can save time.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your guidance. It is a pleasure to me to inform the hon. member for Berea that I shall accept his first amendment. However, I cannot accept his second amendment, simply because this is a big council and consists of 30 members. I discussed the matter with the Federal Council this morning. The hon. member must remember that this is an agreed measure. After the officials and the Federal Council had discussed this matter in detail again in the light of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, they felt that they would prefer no alternates to be nominated to the council, at this stage at least. Consequently I am not able to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. In any case, it is not a very important matter. I hope the hon. member will accept my explanation and reconcile himself to it. If alternates do prove to be necessary in the future, we can reconsider the matter, but at this stage there is really no need for them. This is the way the Federal Council feels about it.</p>

<p>I come now to the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Central. I am glad to inform the hon. member that I shall accept his amendment.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Unfortunately I cannot accept the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville, because a teacher appointed in terms of clause 4(1)(b) may be an official of a particular Administrator. It is a general and accepted principle that it is the prerogative of such an Administrator to make such appointment for such period as he may determine. Changes in an Administrator&#x2019;s staff position may compel him to make a change in his appointment to the council. For those reasons the hon. member&#x2019;s first amendment is unacceptable.</p>

<p>However, the hon. member&#x2019;s second amendment is acceptable.</p>

If one looks at the schedules, one sees that there will be quite a number of teachers&#x2019; associations which will be represented by only one member. In other words, the associations concerned consist of fewer than 2 000 members. Because of the fact that there will be no alternate for them, certain groups which could benefit from the attendance of certain important meetings will not be able to attend those meetings. However, the situation would have been quite different if they had been able to nominate an alternate if the elected member could not be present. I really find it a pity that the hon. the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the two amendments printed in my name on the Order Papers, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 5, in lines 36 to 42, to omit subsection (2) and to substitute:</li>

<li>(2) Subject to the provisions of section 5(2), a member of the council shall hold office as such for a period of five years.</li>

<li>(2) on page 5, to omit all the words after &#x201C;by&#x201D; in line 45 up to and including &#x201C;office,&#x201D; in line 48.</li>

</ol>

<p>In regard to the second amendment, which the hon. the Minister has indicated he will accept, I shall say nothing at all, because that matter requires no further argument.</p>

<p>As far as the first amendment is concerned I want to express my regret that the hon. the Minister will not accept it. The difficulty which the hon. the Minister has can very readily be solved in terms of the provisions of clause 6(d) in that quite obviously any person who is an official and who resigns from the service of the department, can be asked to resign his post and quite obviously he will resign. The very object of the amendment is to try to ensure continuity in membership for the whole of the five years and to ensure security of tenure.</p>

<p>I regret that I have to say it, but I am not impressed with the arguments advanced against the amendment, because it is covered in terms of clause 6(d). I therefore think the hon. the Minister should reconsider the matter before the Bill goes to the Other Place. If he finds merit in the point which I put, he may then effect an amendment there.</p>

<p>In regard to the three amendments moved by the hon. members for Berea and Durban Central, we support the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Central and the first amendment of the hon. member for Berea. I just want to say one word in clarification of what our attitude is. Whereas we accept that, by reason of the importance of this council and its significance, the members of the council should be South Africans, we do not want our attitude to be construed that we agree with the attitude of the Government and some of the Provincial Administrations in regard to the employment of non-South Africans in the teaching profession. On the contrary, in our view the number of unemployed graduates who find themselves in the United States and elsewhere in the world, can very readily be used to solve our own problems in relation to the teaching of science, mathematics, biology and such subjects if we recruit these people to come to South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am just making it clear that there should be no misunderstanding, because whereas we accept the principle, we actually believe that in so far as teachers are concerned, the failure to recruit is one of the reasons for the crisis.</p>

<p>In so far as the second amendment of the hon. member for Berea is concerned, we support that amendment, but we say that we do not regard it as being fundamental to the Bill, and I do not think the hon. member himself regards it as such. However, if the hon. the Minister should decide to reconsider the matter&#x2014;there is ample precedent for it&#x2014;I should like to draw his attention to the fact that any acceptance of this amendment would require a consequential amendment to clause 6(b) by reason of the absence of certain office bearers mentioned in that subsection. In other words, the situation will have to be covered if an alternate is present to represent the actual member. I think that will require a consequential amendment if the proposed amendment is accepted when the Bill goes to the Other Place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as clause 6 is concerned, the first amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville is acceptable.

Staff changes can make such a step absolutely essential. I hope that this explanation will be acceptable to the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

As regards the second amendment, I must say that, regrettably, I cannot accept the validity of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation. The whole purpose of this amendment is to ensure security of tenure. If an appointment can be withdrawn, there is no security of tenure, and I have indicated that if a person who is in the service of the department is transferred, quite obviously he would resign if they wanted to replace him. Although I shall not pursue the matter now, I would nevertheless ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider the matter before he goes to the Other Place.</p>

<p>In other words, at least eight persons have to ask for a special meeting. I am of the opinion that the possibility exists that eight persons can, in different ways, make the life of the council unbearable by forcing the council to meet on insignificant matters. For that reason I cannot support the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville. As the clause reads at present, one member may try to influence the chairman and ask for a special <span class="col_7543-7544" refersTo="page_1102"/>meeting, but the chairman need not agree with it or the chairman may say: &#x201C; I do not agree with you, but I shall convene a special meeting in any case.&#x201D; When is this provision going to be necessary? One will only need this when the chairman is not prepared at all to co-operate with his council. In such a case there would be an impasse.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me very briefly deal with the points raised. I think that, if one refers to precedents, it is quite clear that in no case does one need a requisition by a majority in order to call a special meeting. All that is normally required is a reasonable percentage of the total number of members of the body concerned. This applies particularly in the case of a body with such widespread representation as this council, which makes it most undesirable for a majority to be required. In fact, one would imagine that also those who normally allege to speak for a minority would themselves say that a minority ought to be able to do this as long as it is a reasonably sized minority. Even the same sort of rules apply in respect of institutions that we are all a party to. If one always needs to have a majority, one can never have a meeting unless one already has a majority for what one seeks to requisition. So, with great respect, the so-called defenders of the minorities have today been found wanting.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Yeoville says that, unless there is a majority, it will be impossible to hold a meeting.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Where does he find that here? If he reads clause 8(2), he will see that &#x201C;a special meeting of the council may be convened by the chairman on his own motion and shall be convened by him at the written request of the majority of members of the council stating the purpose for which the meeting is sought&#x201D;. In other words, if one or two members want a meeting, they can approach the chairman and request that a special meeting be convened. Although the chairman may not agree with their point of view, a minority can still be instrumental in calling a meeting. The only point against which we want to express ourselves, is the stipulation of &#x201C;at least 25&#x0025;&#x201D;. We can play around with this. We could have made it 30&#x0025; or 40&#x0025;, but I believe that when it boils down to 25&#x0025;, in a body where only eight people are needed in order to call a meeting, it can easily lead to abuse of the opportunity given to them. It is not a question that every meeting must take place following an agreement by the majority. A meeting can be called at the request of only a few members, and after all, the chairman has to use his discretion. He should realize at all times that, should he not listen to such requests from members&#x2014;even if there are only a few of them&#x2014;it could ultimately lead to a vote of no confidence in him as chairman. In the circumstances, I am not prepared to support the 25&#x0025;.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what we are thinking of here, and what the hon. member for Durban Central has in mind, is the smooth running of this council.

We do not want to sound cynical, but I believe we can speak from experience&#x2014; experience which the hon. the Minister has not had&#x2014;that it is easy for a small, well-organized minority to make life very difficult for a majority.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. W. MILLS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 11, to add the following subparagraph at the end of paragraph (a) of subsection (1):</block>

<ol>

<li>(iii) any other person whose education, training, fitness to teach and experience, in the opinion of the council, warrant provisional registration: Provided that the council shall from time to time publish, in such manner as it thinks fit, a statement specifying the principles upon which such provisional registration is made.</li>

</ol>

<p>Clause 15 refers to the registration of teachers, whether qualified or not. If one looks at the definition of &#x201C;school&#x201D; and &#x201C;teacher&#x201D; it would seem that this registration is virtually subject to the veto of the heads of education because clause 1(xvii)(a), which deals with the definition of &#x201C;school&#x201D;, states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; controlled or subsidized by the Department of National Education or a provincial administration or the Administration of the Territory of South West Africa.</block>

<p><span class="col_7547-7548" refersTo="page_1104"/>This will include most schools, except for a very small number of entirely privately financed schools. The definition of &#x201C;teacher&#x201D; means&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a White person who holds a professional teachers&#x2019; qualification.</block>

<p>In clause 15(1)(a) teachers may be registered in terms of their qualifications. This will include those teachers employed in private schools because they have academic qualifications. They can also be registered in terms of clause 15(1)(a)(ii) which refers to every other person who is employed in a school to teach. Our concern is that it leaves out one small body of teachers, viz. those who do not have academic qualifications and are employed in entirely private schools. We feel that although registration becomes virtually automatic for people who are in Government or subsidized schools&#x2014;whether they are qualified or not&#x2014;it also eliminates the small body of teachers I do not think we should not like to see as outcasts from the profession in view of the fact that they are doing a very good job of work. Therefore I move this amendment for two reasons, viz. to give the council some autonomy in terms of registering teachers and to avoid the elimination of this small section of teachers.</p>

<p>It also lays down some sort of norm, because they must take into consideration the education, training, fitness to teach and experience of the people whom they are considering for registration. Of course, the council will also have to publish reasons from time to time as to why they have considered a person to be fit for registration.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that it does round off the whole of the teaching profession, and does not leave out a small group who are doing a good job of work simply because they do not fall under the categories as defined here.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, from your remark I take it that the hon. the Minister will accept the amendment. For that reason I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 11, in line 39, to omit &#x201C;with the concurrence of&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I should just like to mention a few further points in support of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Here again, Mr. Chairman, I shall have to make a trip to Scotland. As regards the question of registration, the Scottish council has the power to register unqualified teachers if in their opinion such a teacher&#x2019;s education, training and fitness to teach warrants his registration. I believe that at the present moment it will assist the Committee of Heads of Education as well if there is a system whereby people can go directly to the council and register themselves provisionally. In fact, I believe that this will cut out a great deal of administrative red tape. In terms of clause 16, which makes provision for provisional registration, we find that the actual decision lies with a head of education because he makes a permanent appointment and all the council really does is to enter the name of the person concerned in the register. That person is then a provisionally registered teacher. I believe, therefore, that the administrative procedure will be cut down if a teacher can say:. &#x201C;T have already satisfied the council personally that I am a provisionally registered teacher.&#x201D; There is then no need whatsoever for the head of education to refer that individual person&#x2019;s case back to the council. There is a further advantage in terms of this amendment, and that is that the council, like its counterpart in Scotland, will have to publish, from time to time, a statement indicating the principles upon which it has decided that such a person&#x2019;s education and training warrants provisional registration. This, then, will serve as a guide-line for other people, and I think that if the hon. the Minister accepts this amendment, he will find that it will reduce the work considerably, as well as making possible the smoother functioning of the council.</p>

<block name="quote">,and may amend from time to time,</block>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch will deal with the third and fourth amendments printed in my name. I should like to point out that my first amendment is substantially the same as the amendment which the hon. member for Durban Central has moved. His amendment provides that the council shall draw up a professional code of conduct &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D; the committee. The effect of that is that the council will have the final say. I have not provided for that, because the council may in fact consult anybody it wants to consult. To all intents and purposes, therefore, whether the hon. the Minister accepts the hon. member for Durban Central&#x2019;s amendment or my first amendment, there will be very little difference.</p>

<p>As far as my second amendment is concerned, I want to say that there is no provision in the Bill at the moment for the amendment of the code of Conduct once it has been drawn tip. I think there should be specific authority for the amendment of a code of conduct once it has been drawn tip, because if somebody is charged under that code, it may Well be argued that subsequent amendments&#x2014;and obviously a code of conduct has to keep up to date with developments&#x2014;are invalid, since all that is permitted in terms of the Bill is the code as initially drawn tip. That is why my proposal gives the council the authority to amend the code from time to time.</p>

In terms of this subsection the council is compelled to struck off a person&#x2019;s name from the register and all these two amendments seek to do, is to provide for circumstances where the person concerned did not receive his mail, for instance. For instance, if he is on holiday or is abroad, he will not be able to react to the letter asking him to pay his subscription. In any case, the council has the right to struck off the person&#x2019;s name if he does not pay his subscription, and these amendments can only lead to a specific case being dealt with more justifiably.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to react briefly to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North. I accept that in moving this amendment the hon. member and his party had a small group of people in private schools in mind, but if the proposal is accepted that a person could be conditionally registered by virtue of his education, training, fitness to teach, and his experience, the door would be Opened again to people who are not qualified. As a result of that the whole purpose of the Bill Would be watered down so that it Would no longer serve any purpose. The purpose of this Bill is for a person who teaches in a school to have a minimum qualification. The provision which is being made for conditional registration is only to accommodate those people who are already permanently employed in certain Schools, or people who will be permanently employed in future and who will have to be kept employed because they comply with certain conditions and have a specific knowledge of a subject for which no qualified teachers are available. If we were to establish a general provision for people to be registered conditionally without their complying with the specific minimum qualifications, we would be extending endlessly the conditional registration and destroy the objects of the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The amendments moved by the <span class="col_7551-7552" refersTo="page_1106"/>hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North are, unfortunately, not acceptable to me. The Federal Council discussed the matter again this morning but remains opposed to the extension of conditional registration and is not prepared to extend this principle any further than what has been agreed to. Provision for this is being made in the Bill. When a person is conditionally registered by the council, such a person qualifies for permanent appointment, and when a head of education refuses to appoint such a person permanently he can appeal to the council. For these two reasons, both of which are well founded, it is impossible for me, however much I regret it, to accept the amendments of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I am, however, prepared to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban Central. The first amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville is not acceptable in the light of the fact that I have accepted the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Central.</p>

<p>*But as far as the second amendment is concerned, this is not acceptable to me either, because the authority does exist to effect amendments from time to time. The Interpretation Act, No. 33 of 1957, in any case makes revision possible from time to time. For that reason it is not necessary to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. As far as the third amendment of the hon. member for Rondebosch is concerned, I am also sorry to say that it is not acceptable to me, because if the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; is inserted it means that the council will have to exercise a discretion every time, in other words, the name of A is struck off but the name of B is not struck off. It is not really possible for a norm to be laid down, and provision is made for deferment of payment. To my mind the authority of the board can really not be watered down to such an extent as we would be doing if we were to accept the amendments of the hon. members. Surely, it has always been argued here that the council should be given powers. I cannot understand why hon. members come along with an amendment, the effect of which will really be that the powers of the board will be destroyed. Then we also have the fourth amendment moved by the hon. member for Rondebosch. If the hon. members agree with what I have said in respect of the third amendments, it simply follows that the fourth amendment is also not acceptable to me. I hope the hon. members accept it in that way.</p>

<p>I am disappointed with the reply given by the hon. the Minister. I wonder whether he has considered that the woodwork teacher, who is skilled with his hands and has a tremendous amount of knowledge which he can impart to a child, can never while he is at a private school be admitted in terms of the definition of &#x201C;school&#x201D; and &#x201C;teacher&#x201D; and in terms of clause 16 of the Bill before us.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. W. B. PAGE</person>:</from>

<p>He can never be admitted, and so he is lost to the profession; he is lost to the school. He can only be admitted by this council. This is the only way he can possibly be admitted, through this council. The hon. member for Algoa says we are going to open the door for all manner of people who are not qualified, but I dispute that because control will be in the council&#x2019;s hands. The council will have control over whom to admit. Surely we cannot be so shortsighted as not to admit people who are able to instruct, who are able, by virtue of the trade and the pride they take in their work and the ability, to impart the knowledge of their trade to young people. Why on earth do we virtually victimize these people, and why do we not have them admitted by this council? There is no other way for them other than through the council. So I would appeal to the hon. the Minister to look at this again in this light and possibly have a re-think on it when it comes to the Other Place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to refer to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Rondebosch. I realize that the Minister has just indicated that he is not able to accept it in its present form. But I believe it has some merit, and I would therefore like to leave a thought with the hon. the Minister which perhaps he could consider with his legal advisers. And perhaps he might be prepared to amend this in the Other Place to make the <span class="col_7553-7554" refersTo="page_1107"/>provision for something which applies to other statutory bodies. I would refer him to section 19 of the Pharmacy Act and to the Mental, Dental and Supplementary Health Services Act, No. 56 of 1974, where it says that the council may direct the registrar to remove from the register the name of any person, and then I want to quote just the one which I believe is relevant to this particular subject &#x201C;who has failed to notify the registrar within a period of three months as from the date of an inquiry by the registrar, by registered letter, to the address appearing in the register in respect of such person of his present address&#x201D;. I believe that if one were to develop some amendment along those lines, it would be possible to cater for the intention which is behind the amendment moved by the hon. member for Rondebosch.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>I just very briefly want to deal again with amendments (3) and (4) on the Order Paper. Sir, the difficulty I have with the approach of the hon. the Minister is that he is in fact making it mandatory to strike a person&#x2019;s name off the register, while we are suggesting that there should be a discretion. It would be so easy when a list is submitted to the council and the council then exercises its discretion, if in fact it is appropriate. But there can be cases where it will do a tremendous injustice to make it mandatory to strike a man&#x2019;s name off. I would ask the Minister to look again at clause 20 and the consequences there would be for a man who, for example, might be ill in hospital and unable to attend to his affairs, who might be on the staff of the school and might be coming back to the school, and in terms of clause 20 if in fact he has not paid, there is then a problem for him in regard to his job. That can have the most serious consequences, and to make it mandatory seems to me to be quite wrong. I believe that even if the Minister does not want to accept amendment (4), which is about the question of giving him notice in writing, there can be no harm in changing &#x201C;shall&#x201D; to &#x201C;may&#x201D;. It is no hardship to the board and it makes it very much easier from the point of view of the individual. I would ask the Minister to consider this. It does not affect the powers of the council, because to have a discretionary power is something greater than to make a thing mandatory.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am glad the hon. the Minister says he shall reconsider these amendments, because I think it is really necessary. But I want to come back to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North. It is quite clear to me that a misunderstanding is developing. The hon. members on the opposite side, and also the Minister, think that what we are dealing with here, is merely to open the door even further. The hon. member for Algoa said we wanted to open the door even further. The fact remains that the door is already open for the unqualified teacher at this stage. All we are arguing about, is who should open the door. Our amendment says that the body that should open the door is the council, that the council should decide whether that person has the necessary qualifications and experience. As it stands here and particularly when one considers clause 16, the door is not opened by the teachers&#x2019; council, but by the head of education. He appoints the person. The council is the highest professional body and it is surely the first party to be consulted in a matter of this nature. I cannot see the objection of the hon. the Minister. Let us just understand this quite clearly. It might perhaps entail an increase in respect of the one case, in the case of the small number of purely private schools which exist. But the rest does not entail any increase. As far as the rest is concerned, I should just like to point out that it is extremely important for a profession as to who is going to obtain conditional registration. In the first place that decision has to be taken by the members. Initially the teachers&#x2019; associations insisted that only qualified teachers should teach. However, they decided to compromise with the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and this I accept&#x2014;because they should like this teachers&#x2019; council to become a reality. They should just not pay too high a price for it. Now all they have to do, is to sit back and to see to it that this most important <span class="col_7555-7556" refersTo="page_1108"/>decision is taken by the head of education. What task do they have to perform then? They simply have to wait until they are notified that certain persons have been appointed permanently. They have no choice and should merely enter the names concerned in the register. In clause 15 (1) reference is made to&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) every teacher; and</li>

<li>(ii) every other person who is on the date of commencement of section 5 employed in a full-time permanent capacity at a school to teach.</li>

</ol>

<p>Now we want to add a third case in respect of which the board will be able to decide. One finds exactly the same kind of thing in connection with the Scottish council, and why did they do it? I put this question to the hon. the Minister. I understand why the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations was prepared to compromise. From the nature of the case they had to do it. However, it is our duty in this House to ask whether or not this clause is going to help them. It is on that basis that this amendment is being proposed. There should be no misunderstanding on this score. We do not say that the door should simply be thrown open. All we say is that it should be opened by the council.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to say a final word about this amendment standing in my name. My concern is that by not accepting this amendment, one would be discriminating against that small group of unqualified teachers in the private schools. The heads of education have their hands tied. There is nothing they can do about the matter. Their hands are tied in terms of the definition of &#x201C;school&#x201D;, &#x201C;teacher&#x201D; and by clause 16 of this Bill. The doors have already been opened. The hon. member for Algoa I think mistakenly let slip a short while ago that we were casting the net too wide. I disagree with him; the net has already been cast to accommodate unqualified people and they must be brought in. The only way in which one can do so is by way of this amendment.</p>

<p>I should like to motivate this amendment briefly. The clause provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The name of a person who does not hold a professional teacher&#x2019;s qualification but is appointed by a head of education in a full-time permanent capacity in a post at a school approved by the committee, shall <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> in the manner contemplated <span class="col_7557-7558" refersTo="page_1109"/>in section 15(1)(a), be entered provisionally in the register.</block>

<p>In other words, once there is an appointment, his name must be entered into the register and he then is provisionally entered. However, in terms of clause 17 the council has a right to refuse a registration, whether a final registration or a provisional registration, on grounds which are connected with the person&#x2019;s conviction of any offence or of any contravention of the professional code of conduct. Therefore, unless this amendment is accepted, the Minister can force upon the council the provisional registration of a person who has a conviction or who has contravened the code of conduct, circumstances which would have been regarded by the council as adequate grounds for refusing such a person registration. It seems to me clear that certainly people should not be imposed upon the register when, in fact, in the normal course of events their registration would be refused because of their conduct.</p>

After all, we are concerned here with establishing a norm, a standard, and I feel that the amendment will result in the council being informed as to why a provisional registration is made.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I regard this but unfortunately I am unable to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville. If I were to accept the amendment, it would make the task of the head of education absolutely impossible, because the primary task of the head of education is to ensure that there is a teacher in the classroom. My difficulty with the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville is that it will complicate the task of the head of education a great deal and may even make it impossible. Therefore, I cannot accept his amendment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North either, because his amendment will affect existing powers. There has been no opportunity to discuss this matter with the heads of education and the Administrators, and since this is an agreed measure, I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment. I shall discuss the matter with them at some later stage, and it is possible that we may come back to this House in this connection later on with a view to effecting an amendment. At the moment, however, it is impossible for me to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very disappointed in what the hon. the Minister has said about the amendments I have moved. I am not sure that he actually appreciates the significance of what he said. He said, in fact that if a man applies to be registered provisionally and is turned down by the council because of a contravention of the professional code of conduct, all the man has to do to become provisionally registered is to go to the department and get a head of education to appoint him to a school. The hon. the Minister said the man has to fill the job, but what is then the point of this provision?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_national_education">

<p>He can be appointed on a temporary basis.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, Sir, that is the whole point. If such a man is appointed on a temporary basis, there is no need for provisional registration. I do not think the hon. the Minister appreciates the seriousness of what he is saying. The whole concept of this council is such that the council must finally decide who is going to be registered and who is not going to be registered, whether provisionally or otherwise. The vested interests of the people, who are holding down jobs at the moment, are protected. The <span class="col_7559-7560" refersTo="page_1110"/>question of not appointing people without registration is covered by clause 20. In other words, until such time as there are sufficient teachers, there is not going to be a closed-shop arrangement at all. However, once there is such a closed-shop arrangement, surely one cannot have the situation such that a mere desire to appoint a particular person can lead to the whole set-up being ignored. This destroys the whole fabric of the council and its authority. If some other reason had been advanced for refusing this amendment, I could still understand it, but the reason the hon. the Minister has just given&#x2014;viz. that a post must be filled even if it is filled by a person with convictions against him, a person who is dangerous and should not be put onto the list&#x2014;is a disastrous one in my opinion. All that I ask for in this amendment is that it should be possible to make this appointment subject to the fact that there are no grounds for refusing registration because of a conviction or because of a contravention of the code of conduct. However, one cannot circumvent the whole thing and destroy the power of the council by saying: We do not care whether he has been convicted or not and whether he is a danger or not; we are going to appoint him because there is in fact a vacancy. If that is to be done, we are playing with fire.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has been reasonable. Therefore I ask him not simply to reject this, but to think about it and take advice. If he then still adheres to his view, that is all there is to it, but if not, he can still do something about it. I should, however, like to impress upon the hon. the Minister that this is a serious matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is very clear to me, too, that, before this Bill reaches the Other Place, the hon. the Minister will possibly have to make an attempt to have consultations with the various administrators with regard to this specific clause, with these amendments in mind. We are grateful to the hon. the Minister for intimating that he will give consideration to this, but such consideration will have to take place in conjunction with the administrators because they are the people who will have to make the concessions in this case.</p>

<p>In respect of the amendment of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North, I want to mention for further consideration that we took great pains with our amendments not to complicate matters for the heads of education. They may continue appointing people provisionally. As I said before, we had hoped that the permanent appointment of a person would enable him to be registered provisionally. We only ask that when the council makes requests from time to time, specific reasons have to be furnished for the appointment of certain persons. This is simply to ensure that the council, too, will be consulted in the matter. In terms of the clause as it stands, the council is not consulted at all in this vitally important matter. In my opinion, the hon. the Minister has to enter into further negotiations on this basis. I am also in full agreement with the plea made by the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>Clause 18:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause is one of the most important in the Bill as it deals with the powers which the council will have. As in the case of the code of conduct, there are powers which have to be truly meaningful. I want to thank the Minister for the fact that the clause dealing with the code of conduct has now been drafted in a way which&#x2014;so we believe&#x2014;will render it more meaningful. I also want to point out to the hon. the Minister that we told his predecessor on several occasions in the past that if he were to propose a professional council, it would have to be a council having truly effective powers, i.e. he wanted such a council to have the full support of this side of the House.</p>

<p>The powers contained in clause 18, oblige me to tell the hon. the Minister that the disciplinary powers seem to be adequate, although the rest of the powers&#x2014;I say this with respect&#x2014;came as something of a shock to me. I believe it is our duty to improve on this. As you will note, Sir, three amendments appear in my name on the Order Paper. I now move all three as printed&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 13, after line 55, to insert:

<ol>

<li><span class="col_7561-7562" refersTo="page_1111"/>(d) require a head of education or the Minister to furnish it with such information concerning details of teacher training from any institution training teachers as the council may require to ascertain if any aspect of that training militates against the recruitment for the profession and the achievement of the object of the council as stated in section 3;</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) on page 13, in line 56, to omit &#x201C;advise&#x201D; and substitute &#x201C;make recommendations to&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(3) on page 13, to add the following proviso at the end of paragraph (d):</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">: Provided that if such recommendations are rejected by the committee, the committee shall furnish the council with the reasons for such rejection.</block>

<p>I first want to deal with amendments (2) and (3) of mine. These two amendments relate to the requirements for the training of teachers and to the requirements for admission to the training course. During the Second Reading debate yesterday, the hon. member for Virginia waxed lyrical about clause 18(d). He suggested that in future&#x2014;in terms of the provision contained in clause 18(d)&#x2014;teachers would be in a position allowing them to offer advice to the committee. I cannot understand how this can be something to make one wax lyrical. Clause 18(d), as worded at present&#x2014;I say this in all seriousness&#x2014;is an insult both to the teachers&#x2019; council and the teaching profession. It creates the impression that these professional people are capable only of giving advice to their employers; to the Committee of Heads of Education. The image is created that this is all they are capable of doing. For the rest the clause has no substance. It is as vague as vague can be. [Interjections.] I can hear one of the hon. members muttering away on the opposite side. If he speaks a little louder, I may be able to hear what he is saying.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>According to the law advisers there is a difference in meaning between the word &#x201C;proposals&#x201D; and the word &#x201C;recommendations&#x201D;. You will notice, Mr. Chairman, that my second amendment mentions &#x201C;to make recommendations to&#x201D;. In Afrikaans this means &#x201C;om aanbevelings te doen&#x201D;. I also believe that they are at least entitled to be informed of the reasons why their recommendations are not acceptable.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I must say once again that this is very relevant to what we have been pleading for years. We said to the predecessor of the hon. the Minister that he should submit a Bill containing proper powers. I am on record as having said to him that he should take the Scottish council as a guide-line if he wanted our full support. In order to assess this particular matter, let us just look at the position regarding the Scottish council. In the case of the Scottish council the council can make recommendations to the Secretary of State. The council can make recommendations, and that is all that I seek. What actually happens in Scotland, is that the Secretary of State&#x2014;should he find it inexpedient to put regulations into practice&#x2014;has to refer it back to the council for modification. Should there still be no agreement, it is stated that he can go ahead and alter the particular regulations. However, he has to publish a statement giving his reasons. This is what I want to achieve in the second and third amendments I have moved. What I propose is the exact equivalent of the situation in the Scottish council which has been functioning well for a period of eleven years.</p>

<p>What are the advantages? The advantage for the council members is that they will officially know why their recommendations have been rejected and not implemented. In other words, they will feel they have a definite say in this matter. However, there are also advantages for the Committee of Educational Heads. When the council members decide on recommendations, and these are not accepted, they will know what the reasons are for their not being accepted. My information is that this in fact prevents the committee, or in the case of the Scottish council the Secretary of State, being flooded with irrelevant recommendations. When the council members know that reasons will be published to indicate why their recommendations cannot be put into effect, they will act very responsibly and make sure that when they do make recommendations those recommendations are worthwhile.</p>

<p><span class="col_7563-7564" refersTo="page_1112"/>*I should like to deal briefly with the first amendment. In terms of the amendment there is a request for the council to have the additional power, to obtain, when they deem this necessary, information in connection with the training of teachers from the Minister or from the heads of education. Here we are dealing with a council, the object of which is set out in clause 3. However, what powers are we giving to the council to achieve its object? Apart from clause 18(d), which refers to advice, there is only the provisions contained in Clause 18(c) which provide that the council may require a head of education to furnish it with such information as the council may require for the keeping of the register. Nothing further is said. The council may give advice, but if one has to give advice about something, one must be properly informed. One may give advice concerning the training of teachers. However, one must be in a position to go to somebody and ask what exactly the position is in respect of the training of teachers in South Africa. At present training is given at ten universities and at various provincial training colleges. How many of the possible 30 members of the council will really be in a position to be able to say that they know exactly what courses are followed and how many people are being trained? Unless they may go to somebody who can give them the exact information, they will not be in a position to make proper recommendations. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to accept the amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very sorry, but I am Unable to accept the amendments. I hope the hon. member for Durban Central and other hon. members will understand my position as far as this is concerned. I said during the Second Reading debate that this was an agreed measure. I want to point out to hon. members that the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations is a body with authority. The hon. members on the opposite side must not speak of it lightly as though it is a body the recommendations and findings of which one may simply brush aside. One cannot do this. It is an important educational body consisting of teachers, and one has to take it into consideration. The same holds good for the Committee of Heads of Education. Since we agreed on the wording of the clause after protracted discussions with those people, I want to ask hon. members to understand that I cannot change the wording of the clause. I have already said and want to repeat, that after legislation has been passed, there is the possibility of the council itself possibly giving attention to this and of the powers possibly being extended. My personal opinion is that the powers will in fact be extended. At this stage, however, I cannot extend these powers unilaterally in this House.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member&#x2019;s second amendment. In pursuance of the pattern of negotiations with the Committee of Heads of Education, I ask hon. members to meet me in this connection, too, because I have accommodated them as far as possible. Hon. members must give the council a chance. The powers will be expanded. However, I cannot do that in this Bill.</p>

<p>Let me briefly motivate the amendment. The effect of this clause is that one may use a record in court proceedings as <i>prima facie</i> proof of the commission of an offence. One may do this without calling the witness. However, it may well be that when one has an inquiry there may well be allegations which are contained in the record as well as statements which were made and which could be challenged and approached from a different angle. The criminal proceedings are then <i>res inter alias acta.</i> They are not the same proceedings in respect of the same parties. For that reason one should have the right, if one so wishes, to test the allegations of anybody who gave evidence and whom one wishes to have called. It is merely in order to give this safeguard that I moved the amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have great regret about this. The effect of this amendment is not to start the proceedings again from the beginning, because the court proceedings are still <i>prima facie</i> proof of the commission of that offence. Nobody is asking for that to be deleted. In the proceedings there might have been, for example, 10 witnesses who gave evidence and it may be necessary, for the purpose of this particular situation, to have one of those witnesses recalled. Without having that right, the person who has been charged before the inquiry is substantially prejudiced. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he would not refer this back to the legal advisers and ask them to reconsider it. I think he will be advised that it does not detract from the fact that the court proceedings are still <i>prima facie</i> proof and that it merely means that he can cross-examine any person he wish in order to establish what has happened.</p>

<p>The purpose of this amendment is that, in terms of this clause, the point to amend the schedules lies with the State President.

In terms of the existing situation, one can in fact have representation if there are 101 members. Therefore, by making it 1 000, it is by no means a splinter organization.

However, if the council goes into the matter and should feel at a later stage that if a teachers&#x2019; association consists of 1 000 members it is necessary that they, too, have the right to appoint a member, then this can take place.

I am not saying that there will be new organizations, because there will not. The issue is that people with vested political interests normally do not like new political parties to arise and in exactly the same way we do not like new teacher associations to arise. For that reason I should like to see these rights entrenched and that is why, while I regret that it will not be accepted, I hope that further consideration will be given to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the crucial clause of the Bill and I briefly want to state our view on it. In the first place we believe that if there should be a registration office for copyright, then it should be a registration office for copyright in the broader sense, in respect of all copyright that can be registered. There may be some practical difficulties, but I think almost all copyrights should be registered. We believe that this is what any piece of legislation in respect of this matter should have sought to achieve. In the second place, we believe that in these times of inflationary conditions, additional Government expenditure, to create new offices, employ new staff and have additional expenditure, is not in the public interest. That is our attitude to the broad issue of clause 2.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the difficulty I have is in respect of the opposition, all that the person who opposes sees, is the advertisement. I am reasonably sure that it is not possible to draft an advertisement which conveys to the public exactly what there is in the film, to see whether it is a matter which can be copyrighted or whether it goes against any existing copyright. What I should like to know is whether the hon. the Minister will not consider, perhaps before he goes to the Other Place, the fact that there should be a right to view the film before any opposition is entered. In other words, any person who seeks to oppose as a result of an advertisement, should have the right to view the film before he opposes it so that he knows exactly in what he is involving himself. If he does not view the film, it is almost impossible to decide whether or not there should be opposition. He might oppose it while if he had seen the film he would not have opposed it, or, on the other hand &#x2026;</p>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before we debate this particular measure, I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That progress be reported and leave be asked to sit again.</block>

<p>We are obviously concerned here with one of a conglomeration of measures. This particular measure is only one. The principal measure is quite clearly item No. 26 on the Order Paper, namely the Status of the Transkei Bill. That is the principal measure, and none of these other measures can be given effect to until that particular measure has been approved by Parliament. All these other measures are dependent upon the acceptance of that Bill, or are concomitant with it. What we are in fact doing in discussing this measure now is naming the offspring even before the marriage has been consummated; or, to put it differently, we are dividing the spoils of the marriage even before it has been annulled. What would happen, for example, if the Status of the Transkei Bill were not accepted or if the Government were to change it in any radical form? If that were to happen, we would be wasting our time, because we would be dealing with a measure which would be entirely superfluous. We obviously do not want to waste our time. Let us look at clause 1 of this Bill which is now before us. The new section 64A, which is inserted by this clause, states specifically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No benefit or allowance payable &#x2026; shall cease to be payable on or after that date by reason only that the person concerned ceased to be a contributor by virtue of the Transkei becoming independent or that the Transkei is no longer forms part of the Republic.</block>

<p>Here, quite clearly, we are putting the cart before the horse. If we were to accept this measure in this form, I submit that it would inhibit discussion under the main measure, because we would already have had accepted in principle the fact that the Transkei was going to become independent. In view of these factors, I want to say that it would be proper for us first of all to discuss the main measure. Only after that measure had been accepted by the House would it be proper for this Committee to consider all the other subsequent measures which follow upon it. That is why I have moved that we should report progress and ask for leave to sit again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Hillbrow is a few months too late with his suggestion. There is only one reason why today, at this stage, after this Bill has already been read a Second Time, he showed up with these theoretical objections like a Rip van Winkle, and that is the behaviour of the members of the PRP yesterday. The members of the official Opposition now feel that they are one step behind the PRP. They allowed themselves to be caught on the wrong foot yesterday, and are afraid of the Press. They are afraid that a march may be stolen on them. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. members on the side of the Opposition must now stop this childishness. I want to tell the hon. member for Hillbrow this year at least two other Bills have been taken <span class="col_7573-7574" refersTo="page_1117"/>through all their stages, Bills which have just as much to do with the independence of the Transkei as this one. I refer him to a Bill which we accepted a few weeks ago, which affords an independent Transkei the right to allow appeals to the Appeal Court in Bloemfontein. Why did they not raise this objection then? The hon. member sat with a mouth full of teeth then, because at that stage the PRP had not yet raised their objections. Sir, the hon. members of the UP are allowing themselves to be taken on tow by the few hon. members who are sitting there. The sooner they forget about that little party and continue with their work, the sooner they will look like a decent Opposition. Sir, these things are happening in this House today because there is no longer any control over what the Opposition does and says.</p>

<p>I want to point out further to the hon. member that right at the beginning of the session, months ago, we approved the Bantu Trust Amendment Bill. In that legislation we give the Trust the right to purchase land in an independent homeland. Why did the hon. member not raise his objection then? Now he quite childishly wants us to believe that this is a new objection of theirs and that this objection has substance. Surely this is ludicrous. After all they are only doing this because the members of the PRP did what they did yesterday.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to hon. members of the official Opposition. I want to ask them to behave like adults and like representatives of the nation, who have been sent here to accomplish a task. They must stop wrangling and fighting among themselves as they have been doing lately, because while they are doing so, the business of this House cannot run smoothly. I want to tell hon. members that we are wasting the country&#x2019;s money. We are wasting this House&#x2019;s money and making this House ludicrous as a result of the manner in which they are behaving here. The sooner the hon. the Leader of the Opposition realizes his responsibility in this connection and issues the necessary instructions to his Whips and all aspirants sitting over there, who are making and breaking as they please today and creating disorder in that party&#x2019;s discipline, the sooner we shall be able to dispose of the work of this House and fulfil our obligations.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it ill behoves the Chief Whip on the other side to talk about &#x201C;wanorde&#x201D;. The Order Paper should have been properly prepared. It is only logical that the status of the Transkei should be discussed first, before the matter which is now under discussion. The hon. member gave us an example of what we had already passed, i.e. the question of the Appeal Court. That does not, however, necessarily depend on the independence of the Transkei, If the people of the Transkei want to come to our Appeal Court, we say that they can come to our Appeal Court. That is quite a different issue.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>At that time this matter was not so high on the Order Paper and the hon. the Minister will remember that in our discussions we asked when the Transkei Bill was coming, because so many matters were dependent upon it. [Interjections.] I should like to tell the hon. the Leader of the House that he was not present at the discussions which we had; the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was there when he told us about the Bills still to come.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly! At that meeting he told us of the Bills still to come. As far as the Appeal Court is concerned, the right to come to our Appeal Court is a right we have given to the Transkei if they want to use it. If they do not want to exercise that right, it is up to them. It does not adversely affect the residents of the Transkei, It is an additional right we are giving them. The amendment to the Bantu Trust and Land Act allowing the trust to buy land in independent homelands, was a right we gave the Bantu Trust to protect the people who are living in those areas, viz. the farmers who want to sell in those areas. That is a relief we are giving to people.</p>

<p>As far as this Bill is concerned, we do not know how it is going to affect these people. We were waiting for the Transkei Bill, and why have we only got it now? It is the most important Bill to be introduced&#x2014;as <i>Die Burger</i> says&#x2014;in the history of this Parliament. We have to wait right until the end of the <span class="col_7575-7576" refersTo="page_1118"/>session before we get it. We did not know what is in that Bill. There may be provision for this sort of thing in that Bill, because there is a reference to agreements which have been made by this Government with the Transkei Government. Has there been any agreement on this issue? We want to know how the people are going to be affected afterwards. It is only logical that this matter should have been discussed after the Transkei Bill has been passed, and I cannot see why the Government will not agree. What is the objection to discussing this after the Status of the Transkei Bill has been passed.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say that I was most disappointed with the case put forward by the hon. Chief Whip on the other side. I do not believe that he tried in any way to deal with the merits of the argument put forward by the hon. member for Hillbrow. Not in any way did he try to deal with the merits. He came instead with a political attack on what he considers to be a division within this party. I am sure that you will allow me, Mr. Chairman, to reply to the hon. member. We have not been motivated in any way by anything which the gentlemen of the Press or the gentlemen of the PRP have said about this matter. I believe that the hon. member for Hillbrow put forward a perfectly logical argument, an argument which is so logical that the NP finds itself in a position that it cannot counter. That is why the hon. Chief Whip gets up now, hurls abuse and launches into what is nothing more than a political red herring, a tirade, to try and draw the attention of the House away from the real facts of what we are dealing with now.</p>

<p>What are we dealing with? We are being asked here this afternoon to consider a Bill which makes provision that immediately prior to the date on which the Transkei becomes independent certain things which apply at that date shall apply afterwards.</p>

<p>On what authority does the hon. the Minister say that it shall be 26 October? He has no authority whatsoever for saying so, because there is a Bill before this House&#x2014;which I am not permitted to discuss now&#x2014;which suggests that this House may decide that the Transkei shall become independent on 26 October. At this stage, however, there is no such decision. How can we consider a matter like that? If we want to take the matter further, in subsection (2) of clause 1 of the Bill which is now under discussion, it is provided&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(2) Any person who, if he had not ceased to be a contributor as contemplated in subsection (1) or if Transkei had not ceased to be a part of the Republic,</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs is quite correct when he says that Parliament has accepted the principle of this Bill, but what is the principle of this Bill? It is simply that people&#x2019;s rights shall be protected. Now, however, we are dealing with the details, and I believe that before we are entitled to consider the details of this measure, we must have the other details cleared up, <span class="col_7577-7578" refersTo="page_1119"/>those details which go to make up this Bill. The hon. the Chief Whip referred to the provision that allows the Transkei to use our Appeal Court. That applies now, not only after the Transkei receives independence, and the hon. Chief Whip knows that, yet he comes along here and misleads the House. He also dealt with the question of the Bantu Trust and the transfer of land to the Transkei Government. He knows that that can happen now and is not dependent upon independence.</p>

<p>I now want to say something to the hon. the Leader of the House. The question of these Bills was raised. I have the word of the hon. the Chief Whip on our side that this matter was raised at last week&#x2019;s Whips&#x2019; meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on a point of order: May the hon. member say the Chief Whip of this side of the House is misleading this House?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall withdraw it and rephrase my statement. The hon. Chief Whip made certain statements by which he certainly misinformed the House. I do not know whether he had the intention of misinforming the House, but I do not question his integrity at all. His statements, however, certainly had the effect of misleading the House at the time he made them. If the hon. Leader of the House looks at the Order Paper he will find that there are 11 measures on the Order Paper at the moment affecting the question of whether the Transkei shall or shall not become independent. I consequently believe that it is important that that principle be established before we can deal with any of those 11 measures, including the one before us now. [Interjections.] I do not believe it is necessary for me to have to detail those 11 measures now, but in the interests of justice and in the interests of not making Parliament a laughing stock&#x2014;a matter the hon. the Chief Whip on that side is so worried about&#x2014;I believe that you Mr. Chairman, should now report progress and ask leave to sit again after we have dealt with the measure which will decide whether the Transkei shall or shall not become independent.</p>

He said then that the Government was putting the cart before the horse and that this should be considered after the Transkei Bill, but because the principle embodied in the legislation was simply the protection of the rights of people, he said that we would let the Second Reading proceed.

<p>Mr. Chairman, like the Chief Whip, I want to <span class="col_7579-7580" refersTo="page_1120"/>appeal to hon. members not to waste the time of this House any longer at this stage. The hon. members on the opposite side do not have a valid case at all because of four very clear reasons. The first question is whether a precedent is not being created here. It has been very clearly indicated that a precedent has already been created during this session in that legislation of a similar nature in connection with the Transkei has been accepted. During the Second Reading debate the hon. member for Hillbrow, in spite of a certain remark he made, said that the official Opposition supports the Bill. He gave no indication at all that the Opposition objected to the legislation being dealt with at this moment. Furthermore, hon. members, who had the opportunity to register their objections when the Order Paper was prepared, gave no indication at all that they were not satisfied with the order in which the various orders of the day were settled. Therefore it is not justified for hon. members to advance the arguments they are advancing now.</p>

<p>I feel that we should proceed with the legislation. Hon. members on both sides of the House gave the Bill their support. The hon. member who participated in the Second Reading debate on behalf of the PRP, indicated that he would ask a question on a technical point during the Committee Stage, and that was the only indication that there would be any discussion at all during the Committee Stage. I therefore want to ask hon. members not to waste the time of the House any longer.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, while the Committee has rejected my motion, it has at least had the useful by-product that is has illustrated once again the disarray in the ranks of the PRP. It has given certain members of the PRP an opportunity of making a gesture of defiance.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the proposed new section 64A(4) refers to employers in the Transkei. The injunction is, clearly, that they are required in terms of this provision to retain, for purposes of this section, certain records. The question has been posed what right Parliament has to pass legislation which will provide an instruction to a foreign independent power to do certain things. It illustrates once again the point I tried to make, viz. that it would have been very useful for the Status of the Transkei <span class="col_7581-7582" refersTo="page_1121"/>Bill to have been discussed first. One would imagine that the Government had entered into certain agreements with the Transkei Government and that this particular measure is the result of such an agreement. This has not been indicated to vs. It just shows why it would have been so useful to deal with these Bills the other way round. We should like the hon. the Minister to explain to us precisely what agreements have been entered into with the Transkeian Government in regard to this particular provision.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I shall abide by your ruling. I want to refer to subsection (4) of the proposed new section 64A. The hon. the Minister will recall that I raised a question in the Second Reading as to the implementation of this provision. No one wants to pass legislation which cannot be implemented. I raise the question again, particularly under clause 1(4), as to how it will be possible&#x2014; should the Transkei become a sovereign independent State&#x2014;for another State to impose certain regulations or instructions on employers living in another separate State. If there is an agreement or an arrangement, and if discussions have been held, obviously, this hon. House should hear about it, and I would like to ask the hon. the Minister again what his reply is to this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the matter which has now been raised, concerns clause 1(4), which deals with the actual implementation of this agreement. I should just like to mention that a provisional agreement exists between this Government and the Transkei Government. This is an agreement which will be of force and effect also when the Transkei becomes independent. The said agreement covers the full implications of this legislation. In the first instance it is provided that, when the Transkei becomes independent, the validity of unemployment insurance will not immediately be done away with. All such unemployment insurance will remain in effect for another three years, and people who will qualify for benefits from such unemployment insurance, are the same people who would have qualified for benefits in any event, even though the Transkei had not become independent.</p>

<p>An agreement has quite correctly been reached about the manner in which this will take place. The agreement was reached between this Government and the Government of the Transkei. This is an agreement in terms of which the Transkei Government will appoint the necessary people, with whose training the Government of the Republic will assist in order to ensure that the process continues so that no problems will arise in respect of the implementation thereof. Great care will be taken that the card system kept by both employers and employees, is handed over and that the entire procedure in this regard will run smoothly until the date of expiry. All this is being done by way of the agreement. There will therefore be no practical or technical problems in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe the hon. the Minister has had some throat trouble. If he has difficulty in replying to any of the matters, I would be quite happy to leave those matters over until the Third Reading. If, at any stage, he feels like it, I just want to indicate to him that we would be quite happy to do that.</p>

<p>The point that I want to raise in connection with clause 1, relates to industrial policy. The hon. the Minister is raising the limit for <span class="col_7583-7584" refersTo="page_1122"/>industrial policies from R600 to R1 000. There are many of us who have some problems in connection with the whole existence of industrial policies as such, particularly because of the abuse to which they can be put. The question that I would like to put to the hon. the Minister, is whether he, by increasing the amount from R600 to R1 000, actually means that he is permanently wedded to the concept of industrial policy, or whether he is prepared to give consideration to a whole review of the concept of industrial policies in the insurance world?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the hon. member for Yeoville for his consideration. At the moment my voice is working and I hope it continues. I think that as far as the point that he raised is concerned, we are quite prepared to look at that matter more broadly. If the hon. member would like to discuss that with me, I shall be happy to do so.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I support the concept of converting foreign insurers to domestic insurers. There is no amendment that we intend moving to this. But there is one issue which, I believe, has been raised with the hon. the Minister, and that is the position in regard to the payment of stamp duty and transfer duty in respect of the transfer of assets from a foreign insurer to a domesticated entity. This is not the correct piece of legislation to give relief there, that will have to be done under other legislation. But, is it intended to give any relief where this compulsory conversion does take place?</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to move the two amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 19, in line 3, to omit &#x201C;two&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;three&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(2) on page 19, in line 21, to omit &#x201C;two&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;three&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>The object of these amendments is not to indicate that I am wedded to the figure of R300 000 as opposed to R200 000, but to focus attention on the fact that I believe&#x2014;and I believe there are many people who believe it with me&#x2014;that whereas the figure of R100 000 in respect of capital was grossly inadequate, many of us feel that the figure of R200 000 is still grossly inadequate, despite the fact that there is a provision which follows on it in respect of the percentage of premium income. We believe that if one enters this type of business, one needs to be of substance and it needs to be a concern which has adequate reserve capital. I, for one, even think R300 000 is probably not the right kind of figure. On the one hand one does not want to put small entrepreneurs out of business, but on the other hand one has to give security to people who invest their money in this type of activity. That is why in my view R200 000 is grossly inadequate. If the hon. the Minister wanted to go beyond R300 000 he would certainly find support from our side, because we believe that companies in this type of business need to be substantial concerns, particularly if you consider the fact that in this kind of activity there is going to be more and more spread of shares as time goes on. There is no reason why the real capital which the people who are in business have invested, should not be more substantial as a protection to policy holders and people of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I readily concede that this is an arbitrary amount to a certain extent. As the hon. member for Yeoville has just said, it is necessary to increase the present amount in any event. After discussions with interested <span class="col_7585-7586" refersTo="page_1123"/>parties, a figure of R200 000 was decided upon, i.e. double the present amount. I want to suggest that we accept this figure of R200 000 and see how it works out in future. We can always effect an amendment later, if necessary. However, the matter was discussed very thoroughly it was considered very carefully, and I am not prepared simply to change the figure with a stroke of the pen without having gone into the matter once again together with the parties concerned. At the moment I should like the clause to remain as it is. However, I want to concede that this is an arbitrary amount. It had to be increased. However, the hon. member for Yeoville himself said that we should not go too high, as this might have a detrimental effect on small undertakings.</p>

</ol>

<p>I am not going to repeat all the arguments I put forward during my Second Reading speech why I am not in favour of this clause. I shall restrict myself to motivating the amendments. The first amendment seeks to oblige the hon. the Minister to consult with the chairman of the Incorporated Insurance Brokers&#x2019; Association of South Africa before he issues a proclamation in terms of clause 10. The motive behind this is merely that the other side should be heard. Any proclamation under this clause would be on the initiative taken by certain insurance companies by putting a case to the hon. the Minister. It is important that before a proclamation is made that, in all fairness and in the interests of the industry as well as the public, the other side should be heard. I accept the undertakings given by the hon. the Minister that he would, in any event, consult with all people concerned before he issues a proclamation. But as the hon. the Minister will accept, Ministers of Finance change from time to time and he himself has said that no Minister can be tied to obligations made by his predecessors. I feel that in the interest of equity, the industry generally and the public in particular&#x2014;as insurance brokers are the people most affected and as they are the watchdogs of the public with regard to insurances&#x2014;that there should be an obligation on any Minister of Finance at any particular time to hear the other side.</p>

<p>The question could be asked why it should be the chairman of the Incorporated Insurance Brokers&#x2019; Association that should be consulted. The reason is that this association represents the majority of the major insurance brokers and the vast majority of, broker premium income in South Africa is handled by members <span class="col_7587-7588" refersTo="page_1124"/>of this association. This association works closely with other associations representing brokers, and therefore if the hon. the Minister is to be obliged to consult with the chairman of the brokers&#x2019; association, he would get a fair picture of how intermediaries in general view a proposed proclamation. As the hon. the Minister knows, this clause has caused disquiet as well as a certain degree of tension in the market. If the brokers, i.e. the intermediary side of the industry, knew they would be consulted before a proclamation was issued and that all future Ministers of Finance would also always be obliged to consult before proclamations were issued, they would feel that at least their side will always be heard. That is the motivation for the first amendment.</p>

<p>The second amendment in my name seeks to remove the word &#x201C;towards&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;resulting in&#x201D;. The word &#x201C;towards&#x201D; is far wider than the hon. the Minister actually wants to go. There are many activities which take place and in which intermediaries are involved which do not result in a policy being serviced, or effected or maintained but in the widest sense of the word they could be seen as activities towards those objectives. Let me give the hon. the Minister an example: A committee on which insurers and intermediaries serve together to investigate certain aspects of insurance. The moneys that have to be provided for such a committee to proceed with its activities, would normally be provided by the intermediaries and the insurance companies jointly. As the clause reads, it could be interpreted as meaning that as those activities are towards effecting policies, obtaining policies or servicing policies the Insurers cannot contribute. If the hon. the Minister were to accept my amendment, accept the words &#x201C;resulting in&#x201D; then there is no room for any misunderstanding. It is quite clear what the hon. the Minister is aiming at, i.e. that the proclamation in terms of this clause will in fact control commissions, remuneration for activities which result in maintaining, effecting or servicing policies.</p>

<p>The third and fourth amendments standing in my name have as object to make sure that any proclamations as far as commission is concerned, is blanketed over all intermediaries for a particular service done. It is obviously not fair that there should be discrimination between the remuneration of one form of intermediary and another for the same work. In addition, in the absence of any legal definitions of different classes of intermediaries, anybody can call himself an insurance broker, an insurance consultant, a chief agent or an agent. These are not legally defined terms and there is no form of licensing whereby an intermediary has to qualify to be able to place himself in a certain category. Therefore, if one does discriminate in a proclamation, for example between a chief agent and a broker, it is in fact meaningless because chief agents can call themselves brokers and brokers can call themselves chief agents. Therefore, until such time as proper licensing and proper legal definitions have been given to these various terms, it would be in fact unworkable to differentiate between various classes of persons.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 25, in lines 48 and 49, to omit &#x201C;prohibiting any consideration from passing or being offered, or&#x201D;;</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">, other than a full-time director, official or employee,</block>

<p>The first amendment mainly deals with the word &#x201C;prohibition&#x201D;. I can understand the motivation behind limiting the consideration for services in connection with insurance brokerage activities, if I may use the broad term, but I cannot understand a desire to prohibit any consideration. The prohibition on any consideration seems to me to be utterly illogical, because in terms of this provision the Minister could in fact be given the power to put the whole of the insurance brokerage industry in South Africa out of business by a stroke of the pen. With respect, Sir, that is something which one cannot agree to. One can understand, whether one agrees with it or not, the fact that, by reason of certain problems in the industry, the commission should be limited. I can understand the logic of that&#x2014; whether one agrees with it or not is irrelevant, because that principle has presumably been accepted at Second Reading&#x2014;but I cannot understand why one should want to put an end <span class="col_7589-7590" refersTo="page_1125"/>to a whole industry which is necessary and essential in this field in South Africa.</p>

<p>As regards the second amendment, I can understand the power being given to limit the remuneration or commission which is paid to people who are brokers, who are in part-time activity, or who are agents, but I cannot understand why this power should be extended to enable the remuneration of full-time employees to be limited. That is something which I do not think the Minister has in mind, but in terms of the clause as it stands he is being given the power. This is something which we believe should not take place, because it will establish a precedent. Once this is put into one piece of legislation, it will mean that you will in fact be able to limit the remuneration of anybody in any kind of activity, and that is obviously undesirable.</p>

<p>I am not, with these two amendments, trying to destroy the clause. On the contrary, I am trying to give effect to what the hon. the Minister himself indicated during the Second Reading in so far as this clause is concerned. Finally, as regards the clause itself, I am not sure that the problems which exist in the industry will be overcome by action in terms of this provision. I believe that there should be negotiation and voluntary control in respect of this matter, and that if the powers under this clause have to be exercised, a mistake will be made. For that reason I regret to say that we cannot support the clause as a whole, because we do not believe it is in the interests either of the insurance industry or of the insurance brokerage industry. Even once this provision is on the Statute Book, we hope that the Minister will seek not to use these powers but rather to have voluntary restraints in the industry which should be adequate in the circumstances.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to repeat any of the arguments which I raised in regard to this clause during the Second Reading. We on this side of the House do have reservations about the implementation of this clause, because to me it seems that the Government is taking unto itself powers to interfere directly with the private enterprise system and with market mechanisms. I think, however, that we have to be realistic in regard to the conditions that exist in the insurance industry and which exist in the relationship between the insurance industry and the insurance brokers. At present an unhealthy position does exist, where insurers are competing for business on the basis of offering higher and higher commissions to intermediaries. It is not by any means happening in all cases that insurance brokers are being paid out of proportion to the services they render. I think in many cases insurance brokers render very valuable services and fully earn the commissions that they are paid, but in other cases that condition does not prevail. That applies in many cases, and we on this side of the House recognize that something should be done in this connection. We would like to see a voluntary agreement being reached in the industry whereby the industry could put its own house in order without compulsion being used. If the hon. the Minister were successful through negotiations in getting the industry to put its house in order, we would agree to him taking action in terms of this clause. The hon. member for Randburg has moved an amendment to the effect that action should only be taken after consultation with the body representing the brokers. I think that that is only half an amendment. I think that if action has to be taken, it must certainly be taken after consultation with the industry. However, the industry consists not only of brokers; it consists of insurers as well. I would strongly suggest to the hon. the Minister that if he has to use these powers, he does it after consultation, not only with the Association of Brokers, but also after consultation with the Association of Insurers. It is not going to be an easy task to lay down a fair and equitable scale of remuneration for intermediaries, and I do believe that the hon. the Minister must exercise the closest co-operation with the industry if he is going to use the powers which he is taking in terms of this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer to two of the amendments which have been moved, one of them by the hon. member for Randburg and the other by the hon. member for Yeoville. With reference to the clause, the principle of the clause, which was accepted at the Second Reading, is that machinery should be established to control or prohibit malpractices which could arise in the broking industry. This principle is that it must be ensured that the insurer can be given the maximum benefits at the lowest premium. That is the crux of the matter. This principle <span class="col_7591-7592" refersTo="page_1126"/>has two legs. One leg deals with control and limitation. This is stated very clearly in clause 10, which deals with the limitation of consideration and the prohibition of consideration for certain services. When we look at the limiting aspect of this principle, it actually means that one wishes to limit measurable considerations, measurable commissions which can be abused in order to violate this principle of the maximum benefit at the lowest premium. A very good example we can mention is annuity insurance, where a maximum amount is taken from the first year&#x2019;s premium which is generally accepted to be too high at the moment. That can be limited. Therefore it is a measurable consideration which can be limited. The second principle, where the malpractices occur most frequently, is the principle which is not measurable, where consideration is given which is not directly related to the quality of the insurance. The idea is that this sort of consideration should be prohibited. It takes the form of consideration such as salaries or fringe benefits, for instance, and there are even cases where overseas trips are offered to certain intermediaries of brokers who sell the largest number of policies. The irony of the matter is that the policies of the insurer who does not want to contribute towards that consideration just do not count for the quota of the broker or the intermediary for earning the overseas trip. It is this type of malpractice which can arise which this clause aims to restrict. If the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville is accepted, the whole principle will in fact be destroyed. The greatest malpractices could then arise. Therefore I suggest that this amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville totally destroys the principle which was accepted at the Second Reading. Therefore I suggest that this amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville is totally out of order and therefore cannot be allowed. Mr. Chairman, if you will not concede this point to me and if the amendment has to remain as it is, I am certainly unable to support it.</p>

<p>I should now like to refer to the last amendment of the hon. member for Randburg. He requires amendments to be made in respect of persons or classes of persons who may be restricted, in other words, where regulations can be made to prohibit certain persons from performing certain tasks or from selling certain forms of insurance. However, his amendment has precisely the opposite effect from what he has in mind. It will in fact have the effect of imposing a restriction and discriminating, because one does not put plaster on the whole body, after all, if only a part of the body has been hurt. The principle of the proposed new section 23A(2)(a)(iv), (vi) and 23A(2)(b) deals with the necessity for discrimination so that this clause may be applied only where malpractices may arise. Therefore I cannot support that amendment of the hon. member for Randburg either.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is obviously an important clause. I think the discussion has shown that. Let me say at once that I do not particularly wish to take powers to force anything on the industry at all if the industry could reach voluntary agreement among short-term insurers. We have a voluntary agreement about commission in respect of long-term insurers, as the hon. member for Yeoville and others will know. I do not say it is ideal, but at least the various parties have come together and reached agreement. However, the position is not as satisfactory when it comes to short-term insurers. The Registrar is using his best offices to bring about the proper climate and conditions for voluntary agreement. Whether that will succeed or not, we shall have to see, but it is against that background that I shall be replying to the specific amendments moved because I share the particular philosophy that if things can be done voluntarily, there is no need for the Minister to intervene. The position, however, has certainly not been satisfactory in many respects and is not in all respects satisfactory at the moment.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the hon. member for Randburg who said there should first be consultation with the chairman of the Incorporated Brokers&#x2019; Association. It is not an unreasonable suggestion, but I do not really think it is necessary because in all these matters prior consultations take place as a matter of course. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a Government official who conducts more consultations in his particular field of activity than does the Registrar of Financial Institutions. One of the reasons why we held this legislation over from the previous session was precisely because it seemed to us, as a result of certain reactions that are still coming in, that it would be necessary for the Registrar <span class="col_7593-7594" refersTo="page_1127"/>and his staff to pursue certain consultations still further, even though they had been pretty detailed up to that stage. I would therefore merely like to assure the hon. member for Randburg that the type of prior consultations he has in mind will most certainly always take place. The further point which I think arises here&#x2014;if I remember correctly, the hon. member for Constantia raised it&#x2014;is that if one includes the Brokers&#x2019; Association, some of the other societies or groups in the insurance field will certainly feel that, if there is to be such a provision in the legislation, provision should also be made for them. After all, we have the South African Registered Insurance Brokers&#x2019; Association, the Life Underwriters&#x2019; Association, the Life Offices Association, the South African Insurers&#x2019; Association, etc. They could certainly claim that they and their members are very much concerned in a measure like this. Rather than try to make legislative provision for this sort of consultation with a whole number of societies, institutions or organizations, I prefer to leave the matter as it is and give a complete assurance that these consultations will most certainly take place on any occasion where this sort of thing is under discussion. Of course, it stands to reason that any of the affected organizations can at any time approach the Registrar, or myself as Minister, as they do from time to time, and raise any of these matters. Their representations will be given very careful consideration. That is the spirit in which I would approach that amendment.</p>

<p>I should like to continue with the amendments of the hon. member for Randburg. I refer to the one which seeks to omit the word &#x201C;towards&#x201D; in line 53, page 25, and to substitute &#x201C;resulting in&#x201D;. As I understand it, the substitution of &#x201C;resulting in&#x201D; for &#x201C;towards&#x201D; will have the effect of placing beyond the scope of the proposed controls the payment of remuneration in cases where the remuneration is not related to specific issues of policies and where the intermediary is remunerated on what could be a salary than a commission basis. I do consider it necessary that the Minister should have power to control remuneration in such cases as well, should such wider powers become necessary. It is a question of enabling powers, and certainly, as we see it, circumstances may arise where it may be very necessary to have this broader perspective. We therefore prefer to make provision for that. It will certainly not be possible for me to have that discretion if we effect an amendment as proposed.</p>

<p>I now come to the third amendment of the hon. member for Randburg. He wants to omit all the words after &#x201C;only&#x201D; on page 27 up to line 14. As I understand it, this amendment will have the effect of precluding a restricted application of the controls to a specific class of intermediary. The area required to be controlled may be limited, for example, to brokers only or to company representatives only. We do consider it necessary to have the controls sufficiently flexible so as to be able to restrict their applications to the problem area, and to exclude those classes of intermediary whose remuneration may seem to present no problem. This will, of course, not be possible if I accept the amendment. That is all there is to it.</p>

<p>The final amendment of the hon. member for Randburg seeks the omission of &#x201C;classes of such persons&#x201D; on page 27. I think this is a consequential amendment, consequential to the hon. member&#x2019;s third amendment, and therefore it does not call for further comment from me. Perhaps I can just inform the hon. member for Randburg that the Life Offices Association, with whom these clauses were very carefully discussed too, in fact supports the provisions as they appear in the Bill. As regards the amendments that have been proposed since the Bill&#x2019;s publication, we have not had representations asking us to change these provisions. In view of the very full consultations we have had over a long period, I would therefore be rather reluctant to change the provisions now. Certainly, we must have powers to intervene if it is absolutely essential that we should do so. I want to say again that, personally, I hope that it will not be necessary to do so, but that the industry will look after its own affairs. I believe the industry is certainly able to do that.</p>

<p>I shall now turn to the other amendments. In the first instance, there is the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville in regard to the question of prohibition referred to on page 25 of the Bill. I should like to give the assurance that it is certainly not my intention to use any of the powers I am given in terms of this clause to place a general prohibition on the remuneration of insurance intermediaries. However, the powers must be adequate to deal effectively with certain undesirable forms of consideration which, I think, could well be <span class="col_7595-7596" refersTo="page_1128"/>expected to arise in consequence of control, should it have to be resorted to. Subsection (2) provides for a flexible and selective application of a prohibition or limitation. A limitation of consideration, passing or offered, can easily be circumvented by resorting to forms of consideration that are not readily assessible in monetary terms. I think the hon. member for Wonderboom also referred to this. For example, various so-called &#x201C;perks&#x201D;, such as the use of cars, telephone services, etc., can be resorted to. It is also envisaged that it may become desirable to prohibit remuneration in cases where the intermediary&#x2019;s activity does not justify remuneration. For example, the mere reporting of a likely insurance prospect would not seem to me to merit remuneration in this sense, nor would the so-called switching of a policy. It is really for those reasons that I have some difficulty in accepting the relevant amendment of the hon. member. However, I wish to repeat that I certainly have no intention of imposing any kind of general prohibition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville also moved that after &#x201C;person&#x201D; in line 52, page 25, the words &#x201C;other than a full-time director, official or employee&#x201D; should be inserted. This amendment does not indicate to whom the full-time director, official or employee is related. If, as would seem to be the case, the words to be inserted are intended to relate to &#x201C;a registered insurer or an underwriter at Lloyds&#x201D;, as in line 51, the effect would be to restrict the scope of the proposed control measures to independent intermediaries, whereas the object of the provision is to bring within its scope the remuneration of all intermediaries irrespective of their relationship to the insurer. I trust I have given a reasonable interpretation to the question of to whom precisely those officers are related. Because we want to make provision to embrace the remuneration of all intermediaries, I do have some trouble in accepting that amendment. That is all I wish to say at the moment.</p>

<speech by="#enthoven">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I may react to some of the comments made by the hon. the Minister on my first amendment, viz. that the Minister should be obliged to consult with the Chairman of the Brokers&#x2019; Association, I want to say that what I am basically trying to get at here is the principle of <i>audi alteram partem,</i> i.e. that the other side be heard. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that if a proclamation was made, it would be made at the initiative of certain insurance companies who would explain to the Minister, as they have done, that the position was such that such a proclamation was necessary. However, in the circumstances, the other side, that of the intermediaries, should be heard. I do not think it is necessary that legislation should oblige the Minister to consult every one on the other side, because if one desires to oblige the Minister to do this, it could become an impossible task. My object in mentioning just the one body is that it is the largest body.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Constantia feels that there should be consultation with the Insurers Association as well, I shall not object to that at all. However, I feel that in their case, they would already have been heard, and that is why a proclamation is being considered. The purpose here is that the other side should be heard. If I could relate this to the answer given by the hon. the Minister on the third and fourth amendments moved by me. The hon. the Minister said that if there was disorder in any one category of intermediaries, he would want to act against that category of intermediary only without acting against the other categories. I believe, however, that the hon. the Minister is going to find himself with a problem, because there is no such thing as a legally defined category of intermediaries. Anybody can call himself whatever he wants to call himself. You can have an insurance brother who is at the same time an insurance consultant and is also the chief agent for various companies. Therefore he is not only a brother but he is also a chief agent&#x2014;in other words, a representative of the companies themselves. Let us assume that the hon. the Minister wishes to act against insurance brokers only. In practice he would find that persons exist who whilst being insurance brokers&#x2014;the class the hon. Minister wishes to act against&#x2014;are also insurance consultants and chief agents&#x2014;classes the Minister does not want to act against. Until such time as there is a legal definition for each class of intermediary, I believe the task of the hon. the Minister is going to be very difficult in this respect.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has said&#x2014;and we all accept it&#x2014;there are problems in the industry, problems which we all wish to see <span class="col_7597-7598" refersTo="page_1129"/>put right, but acting in terms of this clause could be very counter-productive. If pressure is brought to bear on the Minister to act against brokers on the assumption that they are alleged to be the problem, but that it is not necessary to act against agents because as representatives of the companies they can be controlled by the companies, a very unfair discrimination could arise&#x2014;and that is that company agents who do not represent the public could receive a greater renumeration for the same work than brokers who do represent the public. This would not be in the interest of the public.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that this will happen under this hon. Minister or this registrar, but to avoid this clause being used in the future in a way that could well be discriminatory and counter-productive, it should be suitably amended.</p>

<p>The two points therefore are that the legal principle <i>audi alteram partem</i> should apply and that, secondly, a proclamation that singles out one class of intermediary only for control would be unfair and would cause a disruption in the industry, apart from the fact that it would be very difficult to implement in practice.</p>

<p>In connection with my second amendment, I want to point out that it appears from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply in this debate, that the hon. the Minister wishes to go much further than he indicated in his Second Reading speech. The effect of this is going to mean a reappraisal of many joint activities presently undertaken by companies and brokers&#x2014; ranging from seminars, committee work, even sending commissions overseas to investigate matters relating to common problems in the industry. The reason for this is that it will preclude companies providing any monies for these activities. I believe the hon. the Minister should certainly consider this aspect again.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall be very brief. There are just two points. The first is on the amendment I moved. The hon. the Minister said there was no intention to prohibit and yet he seeks the power to prohibit in case the other powers are not wide enough. Sir, with respect, that is not really a valid reason for rejecting the amendment. Now the second point. The hon. the Minister is quite right. As the amendment has been drawn up, the meaning of it is quite clear. It relates to people who are full-time directors, officials or employees of registered insurers or underwriters at Lloyds. The significance of not accepting this amendment is that if, for example, a company wants to employ a chief agency manager as a full-time employee or a marketing manager as a full-time employee or a director in charge of marketing, the Minister can decide what his salary should be. With great respect, that cannot be the intention. If it is, then it should not be the intention, because quite clearly the salary structure of a registered insurer has nothing whatsoever to do with any problems that exist in the insurance industry in respect of commission at the present moment. With great respect, Sir, a company must be allowed to pay people what that company thinks they are worth. You cannot now apply control in respect of the salaries of full-time employees. Sir, I would ask the hon. the Minister to consider this again. If he does decide now not to accept it now, perhaps he will consider it before it goes to the Other Place.</p>

<p>The last point I want to make is that I accept completely that there will be, if anything is done in the registrar&#x2019;s office, consultation on the broadest basis. I think it is necessary to say, so that there will be no misunderstanding, that the reason for the moving of this amendment by the hon. member for Randburg is not because of any lack of confidence in the fact that the registrar consults. I, for one, know that the registrar is sometimes available too much to people. In fact, possibly the registrar&#x2019;s staff is the most accessible staff that I know of in any Government department. The question of consultation as far as they are concerned, is not at issue. I think the object one wants to achieve here is to make it clear&#x2014;this is a very wide and important power&#x2014;that the people most fundamentally concerned should be consulted, before their living is affected, on the widest possible basis. I think that is the sole motivation behind this.</p>

<p>The other point I think needs to be made is that I do not believe that any regulation like this will be as strong as getting the cooperation of the industry. The Minister knows, as well as I do, that whatever rules are made, someone will find a way around them. The only way of really solving this problem is to get the co-operation of the industry, getting them involved. Because if you do get them to co-operate, then the question of finding a way around something is going to become <span class="col_7599-7600" refersTo="page_1130"/>academic. That is why we make this appeal. The real answer to this is to get the cooperation of these people. I think it can be obtained and I think the hon. the Minister should try to ensure that he explores every avenue to attain this. This is a far better way of dealing with this problem than any form of regulation.</p>

<p>The other point I think needs to be made is that it is easy for the long-term insurers to find a solution here. I do not think they are as volatile as the short-term insurers. Yet the need to get the co-operation of the short-term insurers is probably more acute than it is in the case of the long-term insurers, because there is where the greatest danger to the policy-holders lies, if anything should go wrong. That is also where the greatest problem lies in respect of the increase in premium. That is why I want to stress, before I conclude, the fact that the co-operation of the industry is going to be worth three times as much as the most water-tight regulations the Minister can make.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I could not agree more with the hon. member for Yeoville when he stresses the importance of co-operation with the industry. However, I can say again without reservation that the Registrar of Insurance and of Financial Institutions and his staff make an absolute point&#x2014;and I am glad that he has confirmed it&#x2014;of carrying on these consultations virtually at any time in order to improve the whole climate in which this important industry operates. I think the effects are to be seen the whole time. I think conditions have improved a great deal and I think they will continue to improve. I hope they will improve to the extent that we do not have to make use of this kind of provision.</p>

<p>I have listened to the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments with great care. I have briefly stated my own position on the various amendments. I should like to stand by that. But I can assure the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;when he asked me whether I would particularly reconsider the amendment in which he wants it to read &#x201C;other than a full-time director, official or employee&#x201D;&#x2014;that I shall certainly look at it carefully. It has been done, but my point is: What is to prevent someone calling a man who normally would do this business and receives a commission, an employee? He should fall under the provisions of this clause, but because he is called something else, he might escape altogether. This is one of the difficulties one finds in practice. However, I shall certainly look at it very carefully again, specially in the light of this special request made to me. If necessary, I shall be happy to discuss it further with the hon. member. I do not think I can say much more than that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister how he intends issuing a proclamation which affects one class of intermediary and not another class of intermediary. For instance: If the hon. the Minister wanted it to affect brokers only, how could he make it work and how would he stop people who are brokers from calling themselves chief agents or insurance consultants? Does the hon. the Minister have any idea as to how he can make the proclamation applicable to one class of intermediary and not another?</p>

<p>In practice, this is of course a very important point. Classes of intermediaries will have to be defined within the regulations.

<block name="quote">4B. Bills, bonds or securities issued or guaranteed by or loans to or guaranteed by the South African Bantu Trust established by the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936 (Act No. 18 of 1936).</block>

<p>The question of negotiable deposits is one which we certainly want to raise. We believe that the hon. the Minister should motivate this to a greater extent. It is known that this has already been implemented in practice, but what worries us is that the hon. the Minister is taking away from insurance companies something which is, in fact, mere cash. It is an investment which can be realized with short notice if it is needed. We believe that the motivation behind this is not an investment motivation, but a motivation to encourage greater investment in securities of the Government or semi-Government institutions. Our objection is that there is an ever-increasing demand on financial institutions in South Africa to invest with the Government. This is another example of it. Unless the hon. the Minister can motivate to show that there is another reason, the inference we have drawn must be the logical one.</p>

<p>The second amendment arises out of a debate which took place during this session. It does appear to be desirable that, if the securities issued by the S.A. Bantu Trust can be held as assets by insurance companies and third schedule assets held in another way&#x2014; there is a similar amendment coming later&#x2014; then it will assist in so far as the ability to pay farmers for farms that are being taken from them in pursuance of this Act is concerned. We believe that it is not enough for the securities to be issued, but that there should also be a home for them. A home for them could in fact be the insurance companies and other institutions. Without this being included in the third schedule a home will not be readily found for the securities issued by the S.A. Bantu Trust.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in dealing with the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville, I should like to say that during the last few years banking institutions obtained funds by way of the issue of negotiable certificates of deposit on a very large scale. In the case of some institutions, and practically in the case of all those falling in the category of smaller banks, the liability in respect of negotiable certificates of deposit represented between 40&#x0025; and 61&#x0025; of their total liabilities to the public, and between 48&#x0025; and 68&#x0025; of total deposits. I think it has clearly been shown during periods of tight money conditions, especially over the last two years, that that position is not desirable. The technical committee on banking and building society legislation went into this matter very thoroughly. It is on the recommendations of this committee that it was decided not to impose direct restrictions on the issue of negotiable certificates of deposit, but rather to narrow the market for these instruments by removing them from the assets which rank as Part I assets for insurance and prescribed investments for the other financial institutions. That, in fact, is the reasoning behind this. It is based upon the very positive recommendation after very careful study by the technical committee. In his second amendment the hon. member for Yeoville moved that there be inserted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; bills, bonds or securities issued or guaranteed by or loans to or guaranteed by the S.A. Bantu Trust established by the Bantu Trust and Land Act.</block>

<p>The effect of this would, of course, be to accord recognition of the securities of the S.A. Bantu Trust as Part I assets. I should really say that up to now no request for such recognition has been received from the authorities concerned. Whether they will do so later, we shall have to wait and see. However, I understand the Bantu Trust does not at present have the authority to issue such securities. If it is deemed necessary for the Bantu Trust to raise funds in this manner, the registrar does have the power to approve such securities in terms of paragraph 6 of the third schedule to the Insurance Act. The power is therefore in the registrar&#x2019;s hands. I think we shall have to see what emerges here, and play it by ear, as they say. I can quite see the hon. member&#x2019;s point. If <span class="col_7603-7604" refersTo="page_1132"/>that were to happen and the Trust wished to procede in this way, according to the information given to me, they would have to take the necessary powers to enable them to issue such securities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am indebted to the hon. the Minister for his explanation regarding negotiable certificates of deposit but the difficulty with that explanation is that in order to remedy an issue in the banking sector, what is in fact happening is that you are penalizing insurance companies by restricting their investments. In other words, because it is felt that there is too much paper being issued in the banking sector in respect of negotiable certificates of deposit, you are depriving the insurance industry of a very important medium of investment. With great respect, Sir, I still think, particularly if we bear in mind what one has to invest with instead of investing in negotiable certificates of deposit, that it is quite clear that there is still a further issue behind it all, and that is to get some more money into the Government coffers from insurance companies.</p>

<p>Secondly, may I suggest that the hon. the Minister should create the occasion to talk to the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, because only a few days ago, when I suggested this, he said: &#x201C;Oh, no; there is power for the S.A. Bantu Trust to issue this.&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, I cannot be wrong twice. I can only be wrong once as far as this is concerned. Either I am right now, or I was right before. To my mind, if there is not power, there should be power. If this power is given, I think these should rank as Part I assets. I do not think there is any question about it. If we want a precedent, we need only look at the new paragraph 4A which is being inserted here, because the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards are allowed to have their securities rank as Part I assets. To me it seems illogical that the Bantu Trust should not be treated in the same way. I would therefore ask the hon. the Minister to get together with the Department of Bantu Administration on this matter in order to sort out what I believe is not a political issue at all, but which is something that should be done in order to arrive at a logical position.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as regards the last point raised by the hon. member, I shall certainly have a chat with my colleague, the hon. the Deputy Minister. I am, however, not ruling that out. I think we shall just have to see how this develops. I think the hon. member has done well to draw our attention to this at this early stage. As far as NCDs are concerned, the hon. member will realize of course that we are not making it impossible for insurers to invest in NCDs. All we are saying is that those will not rank as Part I assets. It is, as I have said, as a result of this very positive recommendation, after very careful study, by a highly technical committee that we felt it was desirable to do so. I hope the hon. member will feel that, in the light of this explanation, he can accept that position.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 33, in line 55, after &#x201C;maintenance&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">: Provided that when a spouse or descendants of a member are nominated by such member, the person managing the business of such fund shall consider such spouse or such descendants as being dependants.</block>

<p>If we look at the clause as it stands, we find that a new definition of &#x201C;dependant&#x201D; has been drawn up, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;dependant&#x201D;, in relation to a member, means a person considered by the person managing the business of the fund concerned as being dependant on the member for maintenance.</block>

<p>In other words, Sir, it is the person who manages the fund who decides who the <span class="col_7605-7606" refersTo="page_1133"/>dependants should be. The proviso which I would like to have added to that definition, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that when a spouse or descendants of a member are nominated by such member, the person managing the business of such fund shall consider such spouse or such descendants as being dependants.</block>

<p>In other words, where a member of a fund decides that he is going to nominate his own dependant, and such dependant is a spouse or a descendant, i.e. a child or a grandchild, then the manager of the fund has to accept that nomination. That is the purpose that I have in mind here. If you did not do this, then the manager of the fund could nominate someone that he considers, in his discretion, to be the dependant, and one could in fact have a spouse and a dependant excluded, or any one of them. That is the motivation behind the amendment which I have moved.</p>

<p>Following on this, the hon. the Minister moved an amendment which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And includes the spouse or a descendant of the member who in accordance with the rules of the fund may become entitled to a benefit.</block>

<p>The difficulty that I have with this amendment is that although it seeks to remove part of the fault, it still does not give the member of the fund the real discretion of deciding whom of his dependants should be the ones to receive the benefit. That is what I seek to achieve, and my difficulty is that I am not sure that the Minister has achieved the object which I have with his amendment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that I regard this amendment as being a useful one. I think that it clearly has merit. However, as the wording stands, it will have the effect of requiring nominations to be made in the case of existing funds, which in some cases could present difficulties. After this amendment appeared, the registrar took the opportunity to discuss the position with the Association of Pension and Provident Funds and also with the Life Offices Association, in as far as the Life Offices Association is concerned with underwritten pension schemes. After these discussions, it was felt that the wording of my amendment would perhaps be preferable, because the insurance people themselves want a wording which will meet all situations, as they put it. This, for what it is worth, does carry their approval arising out of the proposal made by the hon. member for Yeoville. It is in that sense that I have taken the liberty to move an amendment as it were on the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville after those very careful discussions. I think the spirit is the same, while in essence they are virtually the same. This seems to be the preferred wording. I accordingly move my amendment, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 33, in line 55, after &#x201C;maintenance&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the intention of the hon. the Minister and myself is identical in respect of this matter. It is merely a question of which one of the two amendments achieves the object best, and therefore one cannot feel strongly about it. I think the reason why on the one hand the Association of Pension Funds might feel that the amendment of the hon. the Minister is better, is because I am looking at it more from the member&#x2019;s point of view, whereas they are looking at it more from the manager&#x2019;s point of view. What I would not like to see happening is that in terms of an amendment and in terms of a definition of &#x201C;dependant&#x201D; a man who has contributed to a pension fund might be deprived of the right or might have in the result a situation that the very people whom he wants to receive the benefit, do not receive it, but somebody else who is not related to him, has no blood ties, makes that decision for him. That is why I look at it from the point of view of the member. I do not only look at it from the point of view of the pension fund. Because this is a technical matter where one seeks to achieve the same object, I am quite happy if the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment is accepted&#x2014;as it obviously will be with his majority in the House backing him&#x2014;but that he would still look at the point which I have <span class="col_7607-7608" refersTo="page_1134"/>made this afternoon, so that if he comes to the conclusion quite objectively after discussion with the people in the registrar&#x2019;s office, that his amendment in fact does not achieve the object which I want to achieve, and with which I think the hon. the Minister agrees. Because, obviously, a man who is a contributor to a pension fund should be able to say: &#x201C;I want my children to have it&#x201D; or &#x201C;I want my wife to have it&#x201D;. It should not be left to somebody else to decide that matter. If he comes to that conclusion he has another opportunity of amending it and I hope that he will give that consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposed by the hon. the Minister is undoubtedly an improvement in that it gives greater clarity in defining a dependant. We on this side of the House support the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment. However, we have also studied the amendment placed on the Order Paper by the hon. member for Yeoville, and to a certain extent I believe that there is an aspect of that amendment which the hon. the Minister could well bear in mind when he takes this Bill to the Other Place. I am referring to the question of a person who is nominated by the member of a pension fund. I think the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville indicates the position of the nominated person in relation to the member. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment defining the dependant adds the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and includes the spouse or a descendant of the member who in accordance with the rules of the fund may become entitled to a benefit.</block>

<p>Perhaps the hon. the Minister would give consideration to including the word &#x201C;nominated&#x201D; before the word &#x201C;descendant&#x201D;. In other words, his amendment would then read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and includes the spouse or a nominated descendant of the member who in accordance with the rules of the fund may become entitled to a benefit.</block>

<p>Thus the member who nominates a particular person whom he wishes to see benefit as a member of that fund should receive the due consideration when the definition of a &#x201C;dependant&#x201D; is considered.</p>

<p>I do not intend to waste any time on points I have already argued. I have tried unsuccessfully to persuade the hon. the Minister to accept my first amendment. I merely repeat that I think there is a case for its acceptance.</p>

<p>I have also argued the point in respect of my second amendment and the Minister has replied. I do not think, therefore, that there is anything more to say about that.</p>

<p>As this stands at the moment, I believe it, means that anyone can be appointed. What I am seeking to achieve is that the person to be appointed should be a qualified person, and the only one which to my mind seems logical is an appraiser appointed in terms of the Administration of Estates Act, and that is why I have moved the relevant amendment.</p>

<p>My fourth amendment deals with the restrictions that exist in respect of the lending of money to certain entities. I think the hon. the Minister is as aware as I am of abuse which has taken place and also the potential for abuse in this field. What I have tried to do here is to make abuse even more difficult, in other words by limiting the ability to lend money or to invest in the shares of certain companies. The proposed new section (5B)(b) states that one may not grant a loan or invest in the shares of the company &#x201C;controlled by an officer or a member of the fund&#x201D;. I would like to add &#x201C;or by a director of the employer&#x201D;. In other words, a pension fund should not be used in order to finance the activities of the employer who is concerned with that pension fund.</p>

<p>The second amendment seeks to include a further category of company to which money may not be lent, namely a company of which an officer or his spouse or a member of the fund or his spouse is a director. In other words, they may not control the company, but they may still be directors. I think we have to cover the position of wives. Very often you find that there is abuse because although the man himself is not involved, his wife is a director.</p>

<p>The sixth amendment is purely a consequential amendment which flows from an earlier one.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, taking the first amendment by which the hon. member wants to insert after &#x201C;person&#x201D; the words &#x201C;who is an appraiser appointed in terms of the Administration of Estates Act&#x2026;&#x201D;, I should like to say that in view of the very large number of member loans granted by pension funds, it may not always be possible in practice for the funds to obtain the services of such sworn appraisers. I think, too, that in a case like this it will be desirable to consult the Association of Pension and Provident Funds carefully on this issue, but as yet we have not been able to consult them. I do not want to rule this amendment out, but the Bill was drafted in this form, as I have already indicated, in order not to cause practical difficulties where there are such a large number of valuations required. I should like to suggest that we leave the provision as it is at the moment. The Registrar will follow up the proposal of the hon. member and should it be necessary, we will find an early opportunity to incorporate an amendment of this kind. My information is that there are practical difficulties along the lines proposed and, indeed, those have been brought to our attention. I shall nevertheless be quite prepared to deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal in that way.</p>

<p>The hon. member also moved to insert after &#x201C;fund&#x201D; in line 19, page 41, &#x201C;or by a director of the employer&#x201D;. I am able to support this amendment in principle since the proposed addition will be a further safeguard. The amendment is therefore acceptable, but I think it will be necessary to qualify &#x201C;employer&#x201D; as set out in the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper and which I now move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 41, in line 19, after &#x201C;fund&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7611-7612" refersTo="page_1136"/>or a director of a company which is an employer participating in the scheme or arrangement whereby the fund has been established.</block>

<p>It is a question of wording, and my amendment follows on the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville also moved two amendments on page 41 of the Bill. The first one seeks to insert&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">a company of which an officer or his spouse or a member of the fund or his spouse is a director &#x2026;</block>

<p>and the second one seeks to omit &#x201C;such a first-mentioned company&#x201D; and to substitute Certain words. My difficulty here is that these are father important matters. I would not say that the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestions have no merit at all, but I think here again the Registrar has to have an opportunity to consult carefully with the Association of Pension and Provident Funds. The registrar has not as yet had an opportunity to have such consultations. However, the registrar will certainly have such consultations. I may say that I am prepared to have further discussions with the hon. member in the light of what comes out of those consultations.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. member will agree that for the time being we should keep his suggestions concerning negotiable deposit certificates and the Bantu Trust in abeyance, as I have already explained my position in those respects.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 43, in line 20, after &#x201C;law&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<p>This amendment arises out of the wording of this clause in terms of which no pension can really be attached, hypothecated or be subject to any order of a court. In consequence, it is completely immune. One accepts the principle that pensions should be immune to ensure that people will have a certain income in their old age. However, the difficulty that arises is that one may have what is called a &#x201C;top-hat&#x201D; pension, viz. a tremendously large pension of, say, R20 000 to R30 000 per annum. If one then does not pay one&#x2019;s debts, nothing can be done in terms of this clause, even though the pension is that large. Particularly in terms of the Magistrates&#x2019; Court Amendment Act which was put on the Statute Book this session, when one investigates a person&#x2019;s financial position, the effect is that, although the man may have a tremendously large pension, the creditor cannot get the money he is owed. Therefore the purpose of my amendment is that R3 000 of the pension should be protected but that the rest should not be protected but may be taken into account in respect of section 65 of the Magistrates&#x2019; Court Act. That is the purpose of my amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 43, in line 52, to omit &#x201C;six&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;nine&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Let me say, Sir, that we on this side of the House agree with the principle involved in this Clause. This is consistent with other pension legislation in that it provides that a pension shall not be attachable. If one checks through various other Statutes, it soon becomes apparent that this is indeed a very sound principle. However, the hon. member for Yeoville has moved an amendment which does indicate that a situation could arise which would make it necessary to provide for some ceiling or level <span class="col_7613-7614" refersTo="page_1137"/>beyond which the pension would not be immune. We on this side of the House believe there is some merit in the amendment of the hon. member, although perhaps the figure of R3 000 per annum, which he has set, could perhaps be a higher figure&#x2014;say, an amount in the region of R5 000 per annum&#x2014;due to the rapid decline in the purchasing power of money. We are all aware of the way in which pensions are eroded over a number of years so that a pension soon becomes rather small in comparison with the cost of living as regards the necessities the pensioner has to buy either for himself or for himself and his dependants.</p>

<p>Let me now motivate my amendment. In the proposed new section 37C provision is made that pension benefits on the death of a member shall not form part of the estate of the deceased member, with the proviso that should there not be a claim within a period of six months from any dependant, or should the fund itself not be able to trace any dependant within that period of six months, the benefits that have accrued to the member shall then be paid over to the estate of the member concerned. The object of this amendment is to grant a longer period of time so as to enable dependants who, for various reasons, might no longer be resident at their previous address and who may have moved to another address&#x2014;they might even have moved to an entirely different part of the country&#x2014;to make a claim as being dependants in terms of this particular provision. A further period of three months&#x2014;maybe even a period of nine months&#x2014;would seem to be a reasonable period whereby the dependants must make claims as being dependants as far as the benefits are concerned that had accrued to a deceased member. Therefore, we believe that it would be of assistance, particularly to the dependants, to give them more time in order to enable them to make a claim, should their claim be necessary. At the same time one cannot make this period too long, because obviously the fund is anxious to finalize the matter and would not like the matter to continue indefinitely. However, they are specifically excluded as being part of the estate of the deceased member and, therefore, every opportunity should be given them&#x2014;those persons who are claiming to be dependants&#x2014; of making their claim timeously. That is the reason why I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to accepting this amendment, so as to provide for the granting of a longer period of time to such dependants.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the effect of the proposal moved by the hon. member for Yeoville is that an amount of R3 000 per annum of a pension benefit would be protected in the event of an order against the judgment debtor. I am quite happy to accept that. I am pleased to say that I accept that amendment.</p>

<p>As for the hon. member for Umbilo, I believe he did raise this matter in general terms during the Second Reading debate. In representations the Life Offices Association have stated that they feel that a period of nine months is unnecessarily long, because normally the fact that a deceased member does or does not have dependants can be established earlier, according to them. A longer period would operate prejudicially, and perhaps unfairly, against heirs and creditors. In the case of a member who has left no dependants, it means, of course, that the books must also be kept open. I would like to point out that the proposed new section 37C provides that a deceased member&#x2019;s benefits may be paid into the estate after the lapse of six months. The fund is therefore free to delay the paying over of benefits to the estate. The position is designed to facilitate the administration of pension funds.</p>

<p>As I have said, I personally have no very strong feelings, but&#x2014;as I have also mentioned&#x2014;the matter has been taken up with the people who have to deal with it every day and their feeling is that they hope we will adhere to six months rather than nine months. If I may, I would suggest to the hon. member that we had better wait and see how this works out. If, despite the advice the Life Offices Association has given us, it nevertheless proves that six months is not a period which is as easily handled as the insurers think, I would be quite prepared to consider making this sort of amendment. I would trust that we might handle it that way.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, I now move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 43, in line 50, after &#x201C;dependants&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7615-7616" refersTo="page_1138"/>, or to a guardian or trustee for the benefit of such dependant or dependants</block>

<p>The same words appear in the proposed new section 37A, and in order to remove any possible doubt as to the authority&#x2014;i.e. the authority that is being mentioned in the new proposed section 37C&#x2014;to make a payment to a guardian or a trustee, it is desirable for the wording of the two proposed sections relating to this, to be the same. Therefore the amendment I am moving here, is being moved at the request of an institution concerned. I believe it is reasonable and will lend greater force to the wording of the clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to move the two amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 51, to omit all the words after &#x201C;he&#x201D; in line 33 up to an including &#x201C;holders&#x201D; in line 39 and to substitute:</li>

</ol>

<p>The position in regard to participation bonds is important. As this clause reads at the moment, it means that a participation may not be recovered by an investor unless a majority, in value, of the participants in the bond agree. This is unfair to the individual investor. When you invest in a bond, the bond runs for a period of time. There is a minimum period of time laid down. I believe that when that minimum period of time has expired the individual investor should be allowed to get out of the bond and to get his money back, whether or not the majority of investors agree. He has been tied for a period of time and he could virtually be tied for ever if the majority does not agree. I think this is a wrong principle, and that is why I believe that a participant should be entitled to recover his participation even if the majority do not agree.</p>

<p>My second amendment deals with the negotiability or rather, and more correctly, the transferability of a participation. Originally it was three years, but was then changed to five. I believe that even if the investment itself should remain for a period of five years, the ability to transfer a participation, if it is to be restricted&#x2014;and I must say I do not believe that it should be restricted at all; I think it should be negotiable&#x2014;would, I believe be sufficiently restricted if the period was to be three years!</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say something about the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. I do not believe that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to accept this amendment, for obvious reasons. Were the procedure proposed by the hon. member for Yeoville to be adopted, I believe it would and could result in the mortgagor being expected to make provision at short notice for what is demanded of him, and that it must be borne in mind that this could happen at a very difficult time. It may happen that the mortgagor is simply unable to comply with what is demanded at that time, and it must also be borne in mind that it can be followed up; in other words, this mortgage may be called up piece by piece and demands for payment can be made of the mortgagor from time to time, at short intervals. I believe that this may involve tremendous disadvantages for a mortgagor and in some respects may have a very unreasonable effect on his interests. It could also be unfavourable to the mortgagers as a group <span class="col_7617-7618" refersTo="page_1139"/>should demands of this nature be made from time to time. Under given circumstances it may occur, should the mortgagor be unable to comply with the requirements, that execution proceedings could be instituted against him. Should this be followed up from time to time, it may also affect the rights and interests of the mortgagees as a collective group. I therefore think that under this provision, as is proposed at present, the majority participants will be able to call it up, and I think that this will be the correct procedure. I do not believe that these amendments as moved by the hon. member for Yeoville, embody the appropriate procedure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Ermelo stated my standpoint as well. I worked very hard on these amendments and therefore I should like to summarize my standpoint in this connection.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I should like to say that the proposal of the hon. member for Yeoville will of course defeat the object of the amendments which are introduced by clause 34(a). As the Act now reads, any participant may, after the expiry of a minimum period of five years, demand repayment of his participation. Many investors do not withdraw their money on the expiry of the minimum investment period. The result is that a large proportion of the funds of the schemes is at present on a short-term basis. If mortgagers could be required to repay such funds at short notice, the position of schemes and of mortgagors may be seriously affected, especially during a period of scarcity of investment funds. The arrangement now proposed, whereby joint action by participants holding a majority in value, of the participations is required before repayment of the mortgage loan can be demanded, will afford participants the necessary protection, will ensure the stability of schemes, safeguard the position of mortgagors and will remove the existing anomaly, i.e. that the interests of the other holders of participations in a bond, as well as the interests of the mortgagor, are subordinated entirely to the demands of a participant holding a minority participation, in value, in a bond. The holder of a minority participation will, in any event, still be able to withdraw from the scheme after expiry of the prescribed minimum period. He will be able to do so by transferring or ceding his participation, with approval of the manager of the scheme, to another investor. I should like to add that the amendments contained in this clause have been dealt with in close consultation with the Association of Participation Mortgage Scheme Managers. With his next amendment the hon. member for Yeoville wants to omit five years and to substitute three years for the scheme. The minimum period for which moneys must remain invested in the name of a particular investor in participation bonds included in the scheme, was extended by Parliament during 1972 from three to five years. Therefore, until quite recently, the period was three years. Traditionally investments in mortgage bonds are fairly long-termed. The extension of the minimum investment period during 1972 became necessary in order to curb the flow of short-term funds to participation bond schemes, in competition, particularly with the building societies, and to bring the minimum period of such investments into line with the period for which comparable investments had to remain with other institutions, e.g. the five-year fixed-period shares in building societies.</p>

<p>If participants in these schemes are again allowed to transfer or cede their participation after the expiry of only three years, as requested in the amendment, then the object of the 1972 amendment will be defeated and managers of these schemes will again attract short-term money. What concerns me is that at this time, when capital is certainly not in over-abundance, we are not going to make things easier for some of the other institutions, particularly the building societies, if we revert to the position as it was before 1972. Under the present circumstances I should certainly rather maintain the <i>status quo.</i> I am therefore in difficulty about accepting this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>The difficulty that exists at the present moment is that there is a tremendous shortage of money for industrial development. One cannot obtain funds from decentralization authorities when one actually needs it and while one should actually be encouraging people to start new investments in South Africa. One of the functions of the participation bonds schemes has been to provide money for a type of activity which is not catered for by the building societies or any other financial institution. I think the hon. the <span class="col_7619-7620" refersTo="page_1140"/>Minister will agree with me that that is part of the function of the participation bonds scheme, particularly in regard to certain types of industrial development. The participation bond industry is in the doldrums. I think everybody will agree with that. By saying that it might draw money away from other financial institutions, e.g. building societies, the hon. the Minister is putting his finger on a situation of an industry which caters for industrial development in many respects at a time when the economy should, in fact, be encouraging this type of activity in order to get an economic revival in the type of activity we need and not in the type of activity which does not add to South Africa&#x2019;s economic strength. One of the difficulties I have&#x2014;and this is why I move the amendment&#x2014;is that I see the participation bond industry as an essential part of the structure in South Africa, particularly in order to encourage revival in certain industrial activities. We are actually harming industry very much.</p>

<p>I did not ask that the investment should be reduced to a three-year period, I said that it should be left at five years. However, I asked that we should at least make it transferable after three years, so that it gives some encouragement to this industry. I believe that, if we were to kill the participation bond industry, we would be doing a disservice to the financial structure of South Africa, because I believe it plays a part in that structure. If we look at the figures in regard to new money that has come into this, the case is made out. I think the hon. the Minister knows what the figures are. They certainly are very unsatisfactory. At the moment there is no danger of their doing the building society movement harm, because the transferability itself is not going to make a dramatic difference. However, it may help to deal with a very real situation. No one can say that we are not now in a stage where people who want to engage in the type of activity related to industry should not be allowed to have a source of money to allow development.</p>

<p>I should like the hon. the Minister to tell me where in fact the industrialists who cannot get money from the IDC or from other decentralized authorities, can get money from in order to develop industrial premises or to build new premises. At the moment he cannot get it anywhere. One can get a few lease-backs from insurance companies, but that is about all there is. However, ordinary mortgage money is just not available. I do not believe it is in the interests of the economy of South Africa to kill off the participation bond industry.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say at the outset that we cannot disagree with the last statement made by the hon. member for Yeoville. We agree with him that we dare not kill off the participation bond industry in the country. As the hon. member pointed out, it has its function. As a matter of fact, I believe it has grown into a very important sector of the financing industry in the country.</p>

<p>I find myself with a difficulty, however, as far as his second amendment is concerned. In terms of the Act, a person who participates in a participation bond knows at the time when he invests his money that it is invested for a minimum period of five years. I think the hon. member for Yeoville will concede that. Now he seeks to introduce an amendment in terms of which that person will be entitled to transfer his rights after three years. I agree that in terms of his amendment such a person may not call up his rights, so that the mortgage is not affected by the amendment at all, but he seeks to provide that the investor may, after three years, have the right to pass his rights on to a third party. What will the effect of this be? I think the hon. the Minister put his finger on it when he said that this would have the effect of drawing into this market short-term money. It can be argued both ways, as to whether this short-term money should be brought into this particular sphere of the financial world, or whether it should be left in the hands of, for instance, the building societies and other similar institutions which are today handling short-term investments. My view is that it should stay with the building societies and similar organizations, which also have a function in the financial world of South Africa today. I admit that the hon. member for Yeoville made a very valid point regarding industrial development and long-term investment, but I believe that this is another sector of the market; it is not the short-term market.</p>

<p>As regards the question of where we get the money from, I think the hon. member for Yeoville will agree <span class="col_7621-7622" refersTo="page_1141"/>with me that we have to go to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;although not under this Bill&#x2014;and talk to him about making money available for that very purpose. I do not, however, believe that this is the place to do it.</p>

<p>In the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2019;s first amendment he seeks, in his own words, to protect the rights of the individual investor. Sir, that is a very noble sentiment, but must we look to the rights of the individual investor or must we look to the rights of the majority of the people concerned? If his amendment were accepted, I believe that it would jeopardize or prejudice the rights of the majority of the members concerned. The hon. member for Ermelo has pointed out that the mortgagee might not be in a position to raise the money at the time, and the question I think the hon. member for Yeoville must ask himself is: What happens if this amendment of his is accepted and a participant does call up his share of that participation bond, and the debtor is unable to pay or to raise the money? What is the next step?</p>

I think it has played a very important part in our financial structure, and undoubtedly is destined to play a very important part.

The first amendment is on page 57, in line 32, and I there seek to <span class="col_7623-7624" refersTo="page_1142"/>exclude from the definition of &#x201C;associate&#x201D; a director or officer of a company. Because there are a large number of amendments I shall be very brief. The definition of &#x201C;associate&#x201D; is, in my submission, so wide that even if two completely independent persons sit on the same board of directors, they are for the purposes of this Act deemed to be associates. This really cannot be the intention because you may in fact have directors who are business opponents sitting on the same board as outside directors. In many cases, too, you have directors of boards whose interests are quite conflicting. They merely happen to sit on the same board because they represent shareholding interests in that board or otherwise fulfil certain functions. This provision has a very wide effect. If I may refer the hon. the Minister to clause 42, he will see that this affects the ability to hold a percentage of shares in a bank. You may find, for example, that the hon. member for Simonstown and the hon. member for Pinelands, purely by accident, are sitting on the same board, and they would be deemed in terms of this law to be associates.</p>

<p>It would be a very interesting board. They would be deemed to be associates and it would be quite ludicrous to suggest that. For them, therefore, to be restricted in respect of their own investments in a bank I think really illustrates the point. With great respect, I think that in these circumstances to include &#x201C;director&#x201D; goes too far in respect of the definition of &#x201C;associate&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The second amendment, on page 59, relates to the definition of &#x201C;financial company&#x201D;. What I am suggesting here is that when a company has its shares listed on the Stock Exchange&#x2014;and there is only one Stock Exchange in South Africa&#x2014;that should be regarded as being an adequate spread of the shares. What this means is that the registrar has complete discretion to decide what he thinks is an adequate spread of shares. That may be appropriate in respect of a company which is not quoted, but we believe that if a company is a quoted company, that should be regarded as being adequate from the point of view of the shares. The only remaining point is that the function of the company then should be such that its activities consist mainly of the making of investments. In other words, it should be a quoted company on the Stock Exchange whose business is mainly the making of investments, and that should be adequate. In respect of the other matters, the registrar should exercise his discretion.</p>

<p>There are other companies than newspapers in the world.</p>

<p>May I then proceed to the next amendment, after that brief interlude into another field with the hon. member for Simonstown. The following amendments, with the exception of No. 8, all relate to what I think can be termed the &#x201C;grey market clause&#x201D;, if I may refer to it in that form. The first of these amendments, namely No. 3, means that before the registrar declares a manner of obtaining money as banking, he should publish a notice in the <i>Gazette</i> calling for a comment from interested parties. There is provision here that he should consult with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, but this can affect the businesses of many people, and we believe that in these circumstances he should give people the opportunity of making representations to him. I have said that he does consult on a very wide level and I believe that he will consult, but the difficulty that I have here is that he may be concerned with one particular company which is conducting a particular type of business. Knowing the way that the registrar works, I would imagine that before he would act here, he would consult with that company. There may, however, be many other businesses in the same field which may be able to put forward a completely different picture if they are also given an opportunity of making their <span class="col_7625-7626" refersTo="page_1143"/>representations. That is why we believe there should be public notice.</p>

<p>My fourth amendment requests that &#x201C;in the opinion of the registrar&#x2019; &#x2019; be deleted in line 60 on p. 61 of the Bill. The reason why I suggest this is that the acceptance, as a regular feature of business, of deposits from the general public should be a question of fact and not a question of opinion. I say this because it is a question of fact. That is why I ask that the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the registrar&#x201D; be deleted.</p>

<p>My fifth amendment also requests the deletion of the words &#x201C;in the opinion of the registrar&#x201D; in line 19 on page 63 of the Bill. Here again, whether security is or is not sufficient should be a question of fact. It should not be a question of the opinion of the registrar.</p>

<p>My next amendment requests the deletion of the words &#x201C;or otherwise unsatisfactory&#x201D; in lines 19 and 20 on page 63. Why I request this is because the point at issue is whether the securit&#x00FD; is adequate, or not. There should not be other reasons affecting this decision. If the security is adequate, the fact that some other aspect of the security may be involved, is irrelevant. It is the adequacy of the security that is at issue.</p>

<p>My seventh amendment deals with the question of debentures. A prospectus has to be issued with debentures, and anybody who gets a prospectus should know all the facts. There is consequently no need to protect the investor in regard to this matter. Secondly, if the debenture is secured, it is also not a deposit in the true sense of the word at all. Thirdly, if the period is at least three years, this is not really a question of a disguised deposit. The hon. the Minister may know&#x2014;the registrar&#x2019;s office certainly does&#x2014;that it is possible to draw a prospectus for a debenture with a debenture payable on demand. He may recollect that having occurred. If one makes the period three years and makes the debenture a secured debenture, there is no reason why one should not be allowed to issue debentures and then use the money for the purpose of conducting a credit business in the ordinary course of events.</p>

<p>My eighth amendment falls into a slightly different category because although it comes under this clause, it relates to different matter. In regard to undesirable practices, the registrar now gets far wider powers than he has ever had before under the Banks Act. We believe that before the registrar notifies the banking institution that a practice is irregular or undesirable, there should be a proper hearing, and that is why I have moved this amendment. Once the registrar has made up his mind that something is undesirable or irregular, it may be very difficult to persuade him otherwise, and such a decision on his part could have a wide-ranging effect on a business. He has taken the view in the past that certain practices have been undesirable, although he has not quite had the power to deal with them. However, I think he has dealt relatively satisfactorily with the banking industry which has been co-operative in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the three amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 65, in line 47, to omit &#x201C;registrar&#x201D; and to substitute:

<p>Minister, after consultation with the Registrar and the Governor of the Reserve Bank.</p></li>

<li>(2) on page 65, in line 51, after &#x201C;may&#x201D; to insert:

<p>, after allowing a period of three weeks wherein such banking institution may make representations in regard to such notification, and after considering such representations in consultation with the Registrar and the Governor of the Reserve Bank,</p></li>

<li>(3) on page 67, in line 4, after &#x201C;offence&#x201D; to add:

<p>: Provided that the Minister shall table a report on such notice in both Houses of Parliament within fourteen days if Parliament is then in session or, if Parliament is not then in session, within fourteen days after the commencement of its next ensuing session.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>During the Second Reading debate I expressed the opinion that under this clause the Registrar of Financial Institutions was being granted too wide powers in the powers which he has been granted to declare certain banking institutions <span class="col_7627-7628" refersTo="page_1144"/>irregular and undesirable. In his reply to that debate the hon. the Minister was at pains to draw my attention to section 3 of the Banks Act which lays down that the registrar performs his duty subject to the control of the Minister and that parties affected by decisions of the Registrar do have the right of appeal to the Minister. I was quite aware that that was the position, but I was also aware that in the principal Act, the Banks Act, the functions which have been assigned to the registrar are administrative functions. In fact, in terms of the Banks Act, the registrar has an administrative job. Admittedly, in carrying out his job in terms of the Act, he does have wide powers of discretion and of interpretation. I may mention that, for example, he has wide powers of discretion when he determines whether a bank complies with the requirements of the Act in regard to registration. It is for the reason that he has such wide powers, that he has such a great deal of discretion, that there is an appeal to the Minister by parties which are affected by the Registrar&#x2019;s decisions.</p>

<p>However, I maintain that the powers envisaged in this Bill in terms of the proposed subsection (7) are not powers to administer the Act; they are powers to legislate in terms of the Act. They are powers to make rules, rules which, if contravened, will constitute an offence and subject the party which contravenes them to punishment. What is more, the very nature of the rules which can be made in terms of the proposed subsection is such that considerable harm could be done to a banking institution if rules are not very, very carefully made. The words &#x201C;irregular or undesirable practice&#x201D; or &#x201C;undesirable method of conducting business&#x201D; which are the terms used, are very wide generalities and can be interpreted extremely widely. In fact, I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that in section 1(6) of the Banking Act which deals with irregular practices, there are already actually spelt out seven undesirable practices. In other words, seven undesirable practices have been described, spelt out and incorporated in the Act. Now it is proposed that additional undesirable practices can be decided on by the registrar whereas up to now undesirable practices have been incorporated in the Act and have been decided on by Parliament. I therefore think that the powers which the hon. the Minister proposes should be delegated to the registrar in terms of this subsection are too wide and should be circumscribed considerably more than they are in the Bill. I wish to emphasize that nowhere else in the Banking Act does the registrar have powers to make rules or regulations. The power to make regulations is provided for in the Act, but that power is given to the Minister and not to the registrar.</p>

<p>Taking all the factors I have mentioned into account, and also the importance and far-reaching nature of the powers it is proposed to delegate to the registrar, I believe that the amendments I have moved are fully justified. In the first place they would place the power and responsibility of determining what constitutes an irregular and undesirable practice in the hands of the Minister and not in the hands of the registrar. The Minister could then only act after consultation with the registrar and the Governor of the Reserve Bank.</p>

<p>My second amendment would allow a banking institution, which is affected by any determination under this clause, a period of three weeks in which to make representations in regard to any declaration made. I believe that this precaution is a very necessary one in view of the very serious effects which any determination could have on the business of a banking institution. My third amendment provides that all determinations made in terms of this clause should come under the scrutiny of Parliament. I think that such a procedure is only right and proper since, as I have already mentioned, other practices which are regarded as undesirable have already been described and included in the Banking Act and have been legislated for by Parliament. I think that at least Parliament should be able to scrutinize any determination made in terms of this clause.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to remind the hon. the Minister that in another Bill which has just passed through both Houses of Parliament during this session, i.e. the Trade Practices Bill, provision is made for, <i>inter alia,</i> the declaration of undesirable and unfair trade practices. In terms of that provision, the Minister concerned may only declare a practice to be undesirable after he has had a recommendation from an independent committee&#x2014;and he must abide by the recommendations of that committee. He cannot declare a practice undesirable unless he has that recommendation. Sir, I think that the powers that are given to the registrar in terms <span class="col_7629-7630" refersTo="page_1145"/>of this clause are extremely wide. I am not proposing that the Minister should circumscribe these powers to the extent that they have been circumscribed in the Trade Practices Bill, but I do consider that they should be considerably more circumscribed than they are in this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the three amendments moved by the hon. member for Constantia. This clause, in its application, can have serious repercussions. It can cause great losses and at the same time it can cause a lot of hardship to the affected parties. It may well be that a specific practice or method of conducting business may be irregular or undesirable. Obviously, none of us want to create a situation which encourages irregular or undesirable business practices. We, on our side, would like to stamp put any irregular or undesirable business practices, and I think the hon. the Minister is with us on that particular point. However, somebody has to have the responsibility of passing judgment on a business practice. We feel that that responsibility must rest in the hands of the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister must accept that responsibility and, after due consultation with the registrar and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, he must take a decision. We feel that if the hon. the Minister does not accept that responsibility, he will actually be passing the buck to the registrar. If the hon. the Minister refused to accept the first amendment, it means that one person, viz. the registrar, will have powers that are far too wide, as was pointed out by the hon. member for Constantia. In fact, that person would have almost unlimited powers.</p>

<p>The second amendment merely recognizes the <i>audi alteram partem</i> rule: the other side must be given the opportunity to state its case. I am certain that the hon. the Minister will agree with that amendment, because the other side will not be heard as the clause is worded at the moment. However, in terms of the amendment, the <i>audi alteram partem</i> rule will apply and the other side will be given the opportunity of being heard in this particular case. Surely, the hon. the Minister will not wish to penalize a banking institution without acting in a reasonable and in a fair manner towards that institution, of giving that institution the opportunity of being heard in a fair and equitable sort of manner.</p>

<p>The third amendment is a guarantee to the offending banking institution that the registrar&#x2019;s decisions must stand open to the public eye, and also, at the same time, be open to scrutiny and debate. This is a safeguard that should be welcomed by the hon. the Minister and also by the registrar, a safeguard that the decisions have to be well reasoned and justified&#x2014;decisions which will also have to be justified towards this House in a final analysis. With those few words I want to support the amendments proposed by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am replying briefly to the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. I must say that the example he mentioned, i.e. an association between the hon. member for Simonstown and the hon. member for Pinelands, was perhaps not as far-fetched as he thought. I believe that there is in fact a common basis on which they might reach agreement in certain circumstances. Therefore I believe that there are adequate grounds for maintaining that even in that case they could, in certain circumstances, be regarded as associates; certainly as associates in their actions towards this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville asked for the exclusion of a director, and yet he had no objection to a business partner being regarded as associate. As far as I am concerned, there is no difference. In my view, whether the two serve together on the board of a company or whether they serve together in one concern as business partners, creates exactly the same position. As far as clause 27 is concerned, the principles that were accepted here during the Second Reading were the concepts of possession and control. This was made very clear by the hon. the Minister in his Second Reading speech. It was also made very clear in the recommendations of the Franzsen Commission. An &#x201C;associate&#x201D; is defined in detail on page 57 of the Bill, where &#x201C;associate&#x201D; is defined, and the meaning thereof is clearly stated. With regard to a company, &#x201C;associate&#x201D; also includes the director or official of that company. I want to go so far as to maintain that if it were to be excluded&#x2014;if the idea of a director were to be excluded&#x2014;the whole concept of possession and control would be <span class="col_7631-7632" refersTo="page_1146"/>rendered worthless, inadequate and ineffective. What this amounts to, therefore, is that the whole intent and principle of this Bill is emasculated because a procedure is being created on the strength of which the whole idea of possession and control may be circumvented. Sir, if we look at the other clauses and determine how associates are defined there and how essential it is that this should be defined restrictively, then one becomes thoroughly convinced, particularly if one refers to pages 63-65, to subclauses (b) and (c), to the indirect interests to which reference is made, that it most definitely belongs here and should not therefore be excluded.</p>

<p>In regard to the two amendments moved by the hon. member for Constantia, I should just like to point out that this is an administrative measure. These are indeed the powers the registrar as such possesses and he is indeed pre-eminently the person who has to decide on these matters. Let us bear in mind that one still has the position that literally every decision of the registrar is going to be subject to appeal and approval of the Minister. That is why I do not think the amendment is valid. I think the argument of the hon. member for Walmer, that the other side should also be heard, is valid. However, provision has been made for that. There is nothing preventing a person from putting his case to the registrar or to the Minister in due course. Therefore I personally think that there is no need for these amendments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to make it clear to the House what the attitude of this side of the House is in regard to the eight amendments moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. We will support amendments (2), (3) (6) and (8), but the other four we are not able to support for the reasons I shall advance. As far as amendment (1) is concerned, which deals with the definition of &#x201C;associates&#x201D;, as the definition stands in the Bill, a director or an officer of a company is regarded as being as associate of that company. This clause has any real meaning only if the company itself has an interest to which the definition of &#x201C;associates&#x201D; applies. I believe that in the majority of cases, if a company has a particular interest&#x2014;in this case it would probably be a share-holding interest in a bank&#x2014;a director of that company who has the same interest would act in harmony with the company and in fact company and director would act as associates. It could happen that that would not be the case, but I regard that situation as being a comparatively rare one; certainly that is my experience. As far as amendment (4) is concerned, I believe there is a very fine dividing line between the process of accepting deposits as a regular feature of business and doing so on a spasmodic or non-regular basis. Very often it is difficult to determine whether accepting deposits is regular business or not.</p>

<p>We can take the case of retail trading concerns which do accept loans at call and use these loans in their business. They may be doing so on a fairly regular basis. However, in certain circumstances, in terms of this Bill, they will be excluded from being classified as banking institutions. I believe it is very necessary for someone to have the power, where there is this difficult dividing line between accepting deposits on a regular basis and on a spasmodic basis, to decide whether they are being accepted as banking businesses in the ordinary meaning of that term. Obviously that person should be the Registrar of Financial Institutions.</p>

<p>As far as the fifth amendment is concerned, it seeks to remove the registrar&#x2019;s discretion in deciding whether the security for a deposit is sufficient or insufficient. I do not think there is any absolute test whether security is sufficient or not. It is not a matter of fact, as the hon. member for Yeoville said, unless very elaborate, hard and fast rules are laid down to cover every particular case. That is obviously not feasible. In the absence of hard and fast rules according to which one can determine whether security is sufficient or not, it becomes a matter of opinion. Clearly, in the case of this legislation, the right person to exercise that opinion is the Registrar.</p>

<p>Finally, as far as amendment (7) is concerned, I believe that if this amendment were to be accepted, the registrar immediately would have to exercise his powers in terms of subsection 2(b), page 61, and declare the acceptance of money against debentures to be the business of a banking institution if that money is used to grant loans, credit or to conduct leasing or factoring business. I say this because the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville would exclude from the Banking Act debentures if they were secured <span class="col_7633-7634" refersTo="page_1147"/>by notarial bonds against loans, debtors or lease agreements. That security could, in fact, be financed by the funds which were provided by the debentures in the first place. I think it is that type of operation which this clause is designed to bring within the ambit of the Banking Act, an aim which has our full support. This amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville would only be acceptable to us if it were clear that debentures were secured by adequate security quite unconnected with the assets for which the finance provided by the debenture was to be used. I think, however, the clause, as at present framed, is preferable to any possible amendment to the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when one looks at the first amendment as moved by the hon. member for Yeoville, the question of associates comes up. Here I should like to draw the attention of the hon. member to page 57 of the Bill where in clause 37(a)(i) it says that the definition of &#x201C;associate&#x201D; is first of all &#x201C;in connection with a person&#x201D;, and then, in lines 32 and 33, it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and, in connection with a company, includes any director or officer of such company.</block>

<p>It is in relation to a company that a director is an associate, and it does not follow that the directors are associates among themselves. As I have said, they are associates specifically in relation to a company. I should just like to point that particular interpretation out.</p>

<p>The object of the proposed legislation is to prohibit persons other than a registered bank controlling company or registered banking institution from obtaining control of a banking institution or a bank controlling company. If the suggested omission of these words is agreed to, it will, of course, be possible for a financial company and two or more of its directors or officers together to hold the majority of shares in a banking institution or bank controlling company and thus have control of the institution. That, of course, is what we are trying to prevent in this instance. It would not be possible for me to accept an amendment of that kind. It would largely negate what, in fact, we are trying to do, and that is to prevent this type of control of a bank.</p>

<p>The next amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville deals with the question of shares being listed on the Stock Exchange. If the proposal were accepted, the registrar&#x2019;s approval would not be required in the case of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The intention is that the registrar&#x2019;s approval must, in fact, be obtained before a company can qualify as a financial company in respect of a particular banking institution or bank controlling company. When considering applications in this regard, the registrar will not necessarily apply the same criteria as those normally used by the Stock Exchange in the case of a listing application. That is quite an important point. It is not deemed necessary to make listing a statutory condition for qualifying as a financial company. Therefore, it is again very difficult for me to accept this amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>The third amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 61, in line 47, after &#x201C;registrar,&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;after notice in the <i>Gazette</i> calling for comment and&#x201D;</block>

<p>As has been mentioned in the course of the debate, in terms of section 3 of the Banks Act the registrar performs the functions assigned to him by the Act under the control of and subject to appeal to the Minister. That is written into the Act. Everything he does is done under the control of the Minister and, as far as other parties are concerned, subject to appeal to the Minister. The procedure for such appeals to the Minister is in fact laid down in regulations under this Act. I have with me the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 20 October 1972 in which the procedure in regard to appeals to the Minister is set out. Any person who feels that the decision of the registrar notified in the <i>Gazette</i> is not justifiable, may obviously appeal to the Minister. The type of irregular business which it is the intention to stop may require speedy action. In dealing with the matter the registrar will naturally liaise fully with the parties concerned. It is an absolute matter of course that he does this in all his work.</p>

<p>I should now like to proceed to the next amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7635-7636" refersTo="page_1148"/>On page 61, in line 60, to omit &#x201C;in the opinion of the registrar&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I do not think it is practicable to define, for the purpose of the Banks Act, &#x201C;deposits&#x201D; and &#x201C;general public&#x201D;. Consequently it is necessary to designate a person to determine whether, in a given set of circumstances, the transactions constitute the acceptance of deposits from the general public as a regular feature of the business. If such a person is not designated, hundreds of cases would, I imagine, have to be taken to court for a decision. Here again, however, the registrar&#x2019;s decision is clearly subject to appeal to the Minister. I must point out that if you look at the practicalities here, I do not see how you can leave that out. Someone clearly has to say what the position is, and that duty is given to the registrar.</p>

<p>Then there is another amendment on page 63, to omit &#x201C;in the opinion of the registrar&#x201D;. Again, as I have just tried to show, it is necessary that somebody should take a decision to determine whether the security furnished is adequate or satisfactory. It seems to me that the registrar is the obvious person to do that.</p>

<p>A further amendment on page 63 is to omit the words &#x201C;or otherwise unsatisfactory&#x201D;. I would say here that the security offered for loans obtained from the public may be sufficient to safeguard the investment, but be of a nature which is not acceptable for the purpose in question. For example, a subsidiary in a strong group may borrow large amounts in total from the public, giving guarantees by the parent company as security. It may not be possible to show that the security is insufficient, but the transactions will not be acceptable as in essence they will constitute deposit-taking. The object of the Banks Act is of course not solely to protect the savings of the public. Equally important, I think, is the fact that it is also aimed at ensuring good order in the banking sector and in the exercise of monetary policy. That is why we want to be very sure that this matter is sufficiently tight to give us that discretion.</p>

<p>A further amendment on page 63 relates to debentures. If the Act should permit the issuing of debentures by non-banking institutions for the purpose of conducting what is considered to be banking business, it can be foreseen that the mobilization of money by way of such debenture issues will become indistinguishable from the taking of deposits, particularly as regards its effect in the financial markets and the influence it may have on the exercising of monetary policy. It is accordingly considered that banking business should not be conducted with the proceeds of debenture issues.</p>

<p>On page 65, in line 47, the hon. member wants to omit the words &#x201C;in writing notify a&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;after affording a hearing to the banking institution concerned, in writing notify such&#x201D;. In principle there is no objection to the suggested hearing, and in practice the registrar will invariably have a discussion with the institution concerned before arriving at a final decision. There may, however, be some danger in writing the requirement, that the institution first be afforded a hearing, into the Act, as in some cases it may be abused in order to delay a notification by the registrar. I think that is a possibility. Wherever practicable an institution will be afforded a hearing by the registrar prior to notification being issued to it. Again, Sir, I would remind the Committee that an institution will of course be able to appeal to the Minister against any such decision of the registrar.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia has moved, on page 65, in line 47, to omit &#x201C;registrar&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;Minister, after consultation with the registrar and the Governor of the Reserve Bank&#x201D;. The determination as to whether a practice or method of conducting business is irregular or undesirable is in practice, as the matter stands, within the functions assigned to the registrar. The Act, however, does not provide a remedy where an institution persists in a practice or method which has been declared to be irregular or undesirable.</p>

<p>I think that has been a clear weakness. The proposed new section 1(7) will merely clarify the position by making the continuation of a practice or method which the registrar has by due notice declared to be irregular or undesirable, a punishable offence. In terms of section 3 of the Act&#x2014;if I may just repeat this&#x2014;the registrar performs the functions assigned to him by the Act under the control of and subject to appeal to the Minister The procedure for such appeals has been set out in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> A bank is therefore afforded an opportunity to lay before the Minister a fully argued case if it feels aggrieved by a decision <span class="col_7637-7638" refersTo="page_1149"/>of the registrar, always remembering that it is specifically stated in the Act that the registrar acts under the control of the Minister. In fact, as I know only too well, the registrar does perform his duties in very close association with the Minister. The registrar must therefore clearly act with responsibility when declaring a practice or method of conducting business as irregular or undesirable, and it is quite normal practice for the registrar to consult with both the Minister and the Reserve Bank before making a decision of this kind. In this connection, Mr. Chairman, I would like to draw your attention to the Banks Act and the position of the registrar. The registrar, for example, as the Act now stands, has complete discretion as to whether he will register or not register a banking institution. It is therefore entirely up to him. He can also decide whether he wants to register a bank on a temporary basis or whether he wants to extend that temporary basis or make it a permanent registration. If one goes through the Act one will find a number of very far-reaching discretions given to the registrar, but I think that was clearly done because written into the Act is what I consider to be a very far-reaching requirement, namely that he must at all times act under the control of the Minister. It is not often that you will find in statutes that an officer who does certain things is required to act under the control of the Minister. That is often presumed, but here it is specifically stated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia has an amendment, on page 65, in line 51, after &#x201C;may&#x201D; to insert the words &#x201C;after allowing a period of three weeks wherein such banking institution may make representations &#x2026;&#x201D; I would suggest, in the light of the explanation I have tried to give here, that this proposal might well fall away. The procedure in respect of appeals to the Minister affords the institution a similar opportunity to place its case before the Minister.</p>

<p>Then, on page 67, in line 4, after &#x201C;offence&#x201D;, the hon. member has moved an amendment requiring the Minister to table reports on this matter. I would merely say here that in a number of other matters the registrar is given discretion to make decisions and indeed in certain instances publication in the <i>Gazette</i> is also required. For example, the registrar may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> add to the list of securities which rank as prescribed investments. It is quite a far-reaching decision when you come to think of its impact on the institution. In none of these other cases is it required that a copy of the notice or decision be laid before the Houses of Parliament. I must say that one does not like in any way to do anything which Parliament may feel it should do in the first instance, but I do not honestly think that a case has been made out for this procedure. If the Committee is going to adopt this amendment, this procedure might well create a certain measure of administrative uncertainty. Therefore, for those brief reasons, I really do not see my way clear to accepting these amendments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendments printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) On page 79, in line 33, after &#x201C;obtained&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">, which written authority shall not be unreasonably withheld</block>

<block name="quote">(2) on page 79, in line 54, after &#x201C;representative&#x201D; to insert: who is permanently resident</block>

<p>The first amendment asks that in respect of subsidiaries, the authority of the registrar should not be unreasonably withheld, while the second, which is much more important, relates to the representative of a foreign bank, i.e. a representative who is permanently resident here. In accordance with the present wording, visiting bankers who come here to see the hon. the Minister or others are all covered by this section. I do not think this was ever intended. I think that what is really intended here is to refer to the formal representative of a foreign bank who is resident in South Africa. One certainly does not want any and every representative of a <span class="col_7639-7640" refersTo="page_1150"/>foreign bank who comes to South Africa to have to have himself registered. I am sure that was never the intention underlying this provision. The proposed new section 27D at present reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A foreign bank shall not without the consent of the registrar have a representative in the Republic &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, the physical presence here of any visiting representative would be undesirable. I am sure that is not what the hon. the Minister has in mind.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with regard to the first amendment, I think it really does go without saying that where a statute confers discretionary powers on an official, clearly the latter must exercise those powers in a reasonable manner. If it should happen that the registrar should ever bring himself to act unreasonably, obviously the aggrieved party would have the immediate right of appeal to the Minister. I think the Committee will agree with me that the risk of an official of the standing of the Registrar of Financial Institutions acting unreasonably is to all intents and purposes negligible. I would therefore prefer to leave the wording as it is and not to embody the amendment.</p>

<p>I hope I understand the hon. member&#x2019;s second amendment correctly, though I am not altogether sure I understand its aim. The insertion of the suggested words would mean that the registrar&#x2019;s consent would not be required in cases where representatives of foreign banks remain in the Republic under temporary residential permits. That is how I read this clause. I have read the relevant provision many times, but that is the only interpretation I can arrive at. If permanent residence is made a requirement for representatives of foreign banks, it would create problems in view of the existing position. I should very much like to hear whether I am interpreting the hon. member correctly.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in relation to the first amendment, I just want to say that the test of reasonableness to be applied by the courts cannot be applied to statutes; it can only be applied to regulations and by-laws. This is an accepted principle of law and I regret to inform the hon. the Minister that his arguments are not correct.</p>

<p>As far as the second amendment is concerned, I suggest that the hon. the Minister should think about it again before the Bill goes to the Other Place. As the Bill reads at the moment, if Mr. Schmidt comes from Germany to South Africa and he is here as the representative of a foreign bank, the proposed section 27D applies even if he is just here for a week. However, that was not the intention. The unfortunate thing is that the proposed section reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A foreign bank shall not without the consent of the Registrar have a representative in the Republic &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, their physical presence is enough. What I have in mind, is not that he should be permanently resident with a view to becoming a national of this country; but I have in mind the man who comes here to establish an office. He should be registered, but the man who comes on a temporary visit for a week, two weeks or a month does not have to be registered. That is all that I have in mind. If the hon. the Minister can achieve that in a way which overcomes this difficulty, I shall be quite happy to see that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. member has in mind the case of somebody who comes here to represent a foreign bank, I should like to have an opportunity to have another look at the matter.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members will perhaps recall that I indicated in my Second Reading speech that I wish to move an amendment to this clause. After thorough consideration of representations which were made to me, I am of the opinion that cases may occur <span class="col_7641-7642" refersTo="page_1151"/>in future in which it would be in the best interests of the country, having regard to all the circumstances, to allow a foreign bank or banks to acquire a greater share than 30&#x0025;&#x2014;the maximum as provided at present in this Bill&#x2014;in a banking institution. Naturally, this will only be practicable in the case of relatively small banking institutions. I therefore deem it necessary for the Minister to be empowered to approve in specific cases that a foreign bank or banks may acquire up to 50&#x0025; of the shares of a banking institution, and owing to practical considerations, temporarily even more than 50&#x0025;, on condition that it is reduced to 50&#x0025; within a reasonable period as determined by the Minister.</p>

<p>Consequently I move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) On page 87, to omit subsection (2) of the proposed new section 28E and to substitute the following subsection:</block>

<block name="quote">(2) The Minister may&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">(a) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1(a), in a particular case approve, on the conditions which he deems desirable, that shares in a banking institution (other than a discount house) of a total nominal value equal to not more than thirty per cent of the nominal value of all the issued shares of the banking institution be registered in the name of an approved financial company or approved financial companies directly or indirectly controlled by foreign shareholders, and of its or their associates, if the Minister is satisfied that it is desirable in the public interest and that it cannot lead to the domestic shareholders&#x2019; losing control of the banking institution;</block>

<block name="quote">(b) notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (1), (3) and (6), in a particular case where he is satisfied that it is desirable in the public interest, approve, on the conditions which he determines, that shares in a banking institution (other than a discount house) or bank controlling company of a total nominal value equal to not more than fifty per cent (or, during such period as the Minister may determine, such higher percentage as he may approve) of the nominal value of all the issued shares of the banking institution or bank controlling company, as the case may be, be registered in the name of a foreign bank or foreign banks;</block>

<block name="quote">(c) notwithstanding the provisions of section 28(2), in a case envisaged in paragraph (b), approve that the shares held by a foreign bank or foreign banks in a banking institution or bank controlling company be registered in the name of a foreign company if all the shares in such company are held by the said bank or banks and warranties to the satisfaction of the Minister are furnished to the effect that no shares in the said company will be alienated to any person other than a bank approved by the Minister or a domestic shareholder.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to indicate immediately that we support these amendments. In fact, as the hon. the Minister knows, this is the line we have taken for some time and we have also made representations in this regard. We therefore welcome the amendments.</p>

<p>I think I may say at this stage that there are many other things in this Bill which have been changed over a period of time and which resulted from representations we have made. I must say that the whole attitude towards this piece of legislation has to my mind been one of complete co-operation. I think this is the way in which one does get legislation which is of a non-political nature and which is, in fact, good legislation. I should like to express my appreciation for the fact that there are many amendments which we did not move today but which have already been incorporated in the Bill, amendments which we have suggested before. In cases where we could substantiate such amendments convincingly, we found people were prepared to listen to us.</p>

<p><span class="col_7643-7644" refersTo="page_1152"/>Mr. Chairman, I now wish to move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 81, to add the following subsection at the end of the proposed section 28A:</block>

<block name="quote">(2) A declaration by a transferee that he does not hold the shares as a nominee, or is not a foreign shareholder, or is not an associate of any other shareholder, shall, in the event of other evidence not being available to the banking institution or bank controlling company, be deemed to be sufficient evidence of such fact to permit the registration of such shares in the name of such transferee.</block>

<p>I want to motivate this amendment by saying that a very real problem exists in regard to the investigations to determine whether in fact a shareholder is a nominee shareholder, an associate shareholder or even a foreign shareholder. I am not sure that my amendment is a complete answer to that problem and I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree with me that the Bill as it stands does not provide a complete answer either. In the case of a foreign shareholder, there is no real problem if the matter is put honestly. However, in the case of nominees it becomes very difficult. Some relief has been given to the companies in the redrafting of this Bill, but there is still not complete relief. I believe that the nearest one can get to it is that if a transferee declares that he is not a foreign shareholder, an associate of any shareholder or a nominee, the company should be prepared to accept it. In these circumstances I ask the hon. the Minister to consider my amendment.</p>

<p>As this is the last amendment I wish to move, I want to say one final thing. I believe that the deputy registrar is retiring from office and, as he is present this afternoon, I hope you will permit me, Sir, to say that I think that the banking sector, the insurance sector and the other people who have been associated with him, can all pay tribute to him for the service he has rendered to financial institutions in South Africa. I would like to add my tribute for what the deputy registrar, Mr. Van Deventer, has done for financial institutions in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to indicate that we of the Official Opposition will support the amendments moved by the hon. the Minister. They have the merit of introducing to this legislation a greater degree of flexibility we have pleaded for all along in respect of this legislation. We on this side of the House agree with the principle of parity in shareholding in banking institutions between domestic shareholders and foreign shareholders; in fact we see great merit in the concept of partnership in banking of this nature. What is important, however&#x2014; and this has been improved by these clauses&#x2014;is how one reaches that position in cases where foreign shareholders have a majority shareholding. It is very important that this reduction from a majority position to a parity position should be arranged with great discretion and great patience and I believe that the amendments before us will enable the Minister to do that better than before.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to reply briefly to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Yeoville. My problem with his amendment is that I think that this matter should be left to the discretion of the registrar. The idea that a declaration as such will be conclusive and adequate could create problems for us because there is not full control over all the persons who are able to make such a statement. I am thinking for example of foreigners from overseas, or in the neighbouring states. One has no control over such a person and if the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment were to be accepted, it would be to the effect that, if and when a statement were to be made, it should be accepted as adequate and conclusive. I do not think this will give us an adequate measure of control.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Ermelo has put the sort of view I would be inclined to adopt here. A transferee would not normally be in a position to declare that he is not an associate of any other shareholder of the bank; of any particular bank. That is, of course, the practical position. However, the bank will be in a position to determine what information should be called for from the transferee in order to establish whether the requirements of the proposed new section 28D(1), read with the proposed new section 28B, will be met. <span class="col_7645-7646" refersTo="page_1153"/>That is how we came to word this clause as it stands.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has obviously given very careful thought to this, and has put up a very carefully worded amendment. I will look at it carefully again. At the moment I cannot accept it as it stands, but I will certainly look at it again, and see whether, in the light of his arguments, we have covered the position. I would like to recheck on that. I would also just like to say that I share the hon. member&#x2019;s opinion about this debate which has been on a very technical sort of issue. In fact, I believe that this omnibus set of amendments has covered something like eight or nine Acts, some of them extremely important financial measures in this country. I would therefore like to thank all hon. members who have participated, for the very constructive manner in which this has been done. It certainly is very helpful to myself as well as to the office of the registrar when we can have such positive and such constructive discussions on these issues.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs_and_of_forestry">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND OF FORESTRY (for the Minister of Finance)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister of Finance has a throat ailment which prevents him from presenting this speech. I am therefore presenting it on his behalf.</p>

<p>The Bill before this House seeks to repeal the existing obsolete measures for the provision of cover by the State against war damage and substitutes for them powers which are being conferred on the authorities to establish insurance schemes as circumstances require. To elucidate the matter I shall go into the existing position briefly.</p>

<p>The War Damage Insurance Act (Act No. 21 of 1941) was passed during the Second World War. As the long title of that Act indicates, provision is made in that measure&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;for State insurance against damage to property caused by acts of war or by certain other acts, and for the payment from State funds of compensation for such damage.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The most important provisions of that Act may be summarized as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) &#x201C;war damage&#x201D; is in general defined as any damage to property in the Republic, other than a vessel or property on a vessel, amounting to not less than R10, caused by a member of the armed forces of the enemy (other than prisoners of war) or of the armed forces of the Republic or of its allies or by persons committing public violence or any action taken in quelling such public violence.</li>

<li>(b) The Minister of Finance shall, at the result of any person, enter into a contract of insurance with that person for the payment of compensation for any loss exceeding R2 000 which that person may have suffered as a result of war damage to his property. In the case of public violence or any action taken in quelling such public violence the insurance contract may also cover damage not exceeding R2 000. Compensation shall only be paid in respect of 90&#x0025; of any war damage caused mainly by fire. The Minister shall from time to time fix the premium rates which are applicable to such contracts of insurance and shall publish those rates in the <i>Gazette.</i></li>

<li>(c) The Minister shall establish a War Damage Insurance Fund into which premiums as well as any moneys appropriated by Parliament for this purpose shall be paid. All damages and the cost of administering the Act shall be paid out of the fund. Surplus moneys in the fund shall be invested with the Public Debt Commissioners.</li>

<li><span class="col_7647-7648" refersTo="page_1154"/>(d) Any person who has suffered any loss up to R2 000 as a result of war damage&#x2014;other than damage caused by public violence or the quelling of such public violence&#x2014;shall be entitled to compensation from such moneys in the fund as have been appropriated by Parliament, without any premium being payable. Not more than R2 000 shall be paid to any one person.</li>

<li>(e) The Minister of Finance shall be responsible for the administration of the scheme and may enter into agreements with any associations or individuals for the assessment of any damage and performance of any other word arising from the Act.</li>

</ol>

<p>During the Second World War the scheme was administered by the Treasury, assisted by an advisory committee. Insurance companies acted as agents of the Treasury for the Collection of premiums and the assessment of damage. The total premium income for the duration of the war amounted to R3 163 000, while the total claims amounted to R14 300.</p>

<p>The Minister of Finance indicated the Second Reading of this legislation that the Act was intended to cover purely temporary circumstances. The Act would remain in force with regard to the state of war which was prevailing at that time. Consequently, on 31 October 1948, the surplus in the fund after all claims had been paid, i.e. R3 198 000, was paid over, in terms of section 7(1) of the Second Finance Act, No. 49 of 1948, to the Public Debt Commissioners for repayment of State debts.</p>

<p>Therefore, although the War Damage Insurance Act of 1941 is still on the Statute Book, it has virtually fallen into disuse since 1948 because the temporary circumstances for which it was intended at the time came to an end. But the fact remains that it stands on the Statute Book, and the public may at any time when war conditions arise, claim the cover which it offers.</p>

<p>In peacetime the owners of merchant ships may normally obtain insurance cover through the insurance industry against war risks in respect of damage, loss of expenditure sustained or incurred in connection with their ships. However, all these insurance policies contain clauses to the effect&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) that the cover automatically lapses if any hostile detonation of a nuclear weapon occurs, wherever and whenever it may occur, and regardless of whether the insured ship is involved in it or not;</li>

<li>(b) that the cover automatically lapses upon the outbreak of war between any of the five major powers; and</li>

<li>(c) that the insurance cover may be cancelled by either the insurer of the insured upon 14 days&#x2019; notice: Provided, however, that the cover may be reinstated after an agreement has been reached between the insurer and the insured on a new premium rate and/or conditions.</li>

</ol>

<p>War damage insurance is consequently inoperative in case of a nuclear war or a war between any of the five major powers. In the case of lesser wars, as well as political seizure of ships, it is in fact possible to obtain cover, but as a result of the coming into operation of the cancellation clause, the new conditions which may be negotiated in the case of such a contingency could probably result in a premium scale which might be beyond the means of shipowners. As a result of this situation, and arising from representations received from the shipping industry for the introduction by the authorities of an effective and economic war risk insurance scheme, section 6 of the Finance Act, No. 76 of 1964 was passed. Section 6(1) of this Act provides that if the Minister of Economic Affairs is satisfied that the owner of a South African merchant vessel is unable to obtain insurance cover against the risk of loss, damage or expense arising from any nuclear war or war between any of the five great powers, the payment of compensation for such loss, damage or expense may be guaranteed by the State. Where any insurance contract provides for the release of the insurer in the event of a nuclear war, any other hostilities or war, or any political or detention of the vessel in question, section 6(2) of the Act provides that the Government may furnish a guarantee to the effect that the difference between the normal premium scale and any higher premium scale which may be negotiated for the cover will be paid by the State.</p>

<p>Up to now none of the powers granted by this section have been used.</p>

<p><span class="col_7649-7650" refersTo="page_1155"/>On 28 April 1968 the previous Minister of Finance appointed a committee of inquiry with the terms of reference to inquire into and report on desirable amendments to the War Damage Insurance Act of 1941, with particular regard to the definition of &#x201C;war damage&#x201D; and the establishment by the State of a war insurance fund or funds. The committee also had to consider whether the provisions of section 6 of the Finance Act of 1964 with regard to commercial vessels should not be incorporated in the War Damage Insurance Act. The committee reported in 1972 and pointed out that the War Damage Insurance Act of 1941 at present required the State to pay compensation, without any premiums being charged for war damage&#x2014;other than damage caused by public violence or the quelling of public violence&#x2014;suffered by any person in the Republic, up to an amount of R2 000. This statutory provision, which is still applicable today, entails the possibility of the State having to pay considerable compensation in the case of damage of any appreciable extent. However, there is at present no war insurance fund from which any such payment may be made. On the other hand, although the Act still provides that the Minister may enter into an insurance contract with any person, there is at present no scheme in this regard.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the committee found that the present legislation does not cover contingencies arising from a state of political hostility between the Republic and another country or countries without the two parties engaging in actual warfare. Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1964, provides for the furnishing of State guarantees in respect of the risks attached to an undeclared war, but only if the war is between the five great powers and only in respect of merchant vessels and the cargoes on such vessels.</p>

<p>Since the Second World War, and even since 1964, the war risk situation in general has changed considerably. A few of the more important changes are the following: The development and distribution of nuclear weapons; the rapid development and improvement of conventional weapons with their greatly improved striking power over long distances; and the diversity of the present-day war risks, from nuclear warfare, conventional warfare, terrorist attacks and violence on the one hand, to undeclared warfare and hostile acts, such as political seizure of merchant ships and commercial aircraft in foreign waters and countries on the other. With this complicated modern situation in regard to war damage risks, it is clear that future contingencies are not predictable. It is therefore unpractical and almost impossible at this stage to devise elaborate measures and comprehensive schemes which will ensure that adequate cover is available at all times and under all circumstances against all forms of war damage risks, which simultaneously take into consideration the financial ability of the State to bear these risks.</p>

<p>The existing War Damage Insurance Act of 1941 and section 6 of the Finance Act of 1964 are obsolete and do not cover the present circumstances. The committee recommended that that Act and the said section be repealed, and that in their place a more flexible statutory framework be established so that it will be more readily possible to make adjustments to changing circumstances and to the specific requirements and circumstances which may arise from time to time. The statutory provisions which are required should be of as least a restrictive nature as possible and should invest the executive with adequate powers to establish schemes administratively and cope with the situation in the light of the requirements and circumstances. Legislation ought therefore to be of a purely empowering nature because the application thereof in practice will entail the drawing up of considerable regulatory and other administrative directions, terms and conditions. Of necessity the legislation has to grant wide discretionary powers.</p>

<p>A Bill has been drafted which contains purely empowering provisions. These entail that the Minister of Finance shall have the power to establish a scheme or schemes, in the light of the requirements and circumstances which apply from time to time, in terms of which the persons whom he stipulates may&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) obtain insurance cover against loss of, or damage to, the types of property as determined by the Minister;</li>

<li>(b) subject to the limits and in respect of the types of properties determined by the Minister&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) receive compensation from the fund for war damage; and</li>

<li><span class="col_7651-7652" refersTo="page_1156"/>(ii) obtain Government guarantees in respect of the difference between normal premium rates and the higher premium rates which may be charged in consequence of a state of war.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>The Bill also provides for a war damage fund into which premiums payable in respect of insurance contracts and government guarantees, and moneys appropriated by Parliament and other legislative authorities for the defraying of war damage, shall be paid, and from which the expense of the State in regard to war damage shall be defrayed. Provision is not again being made in the Bill for the payment of compensation up to a specific amount because it has been decided that the most practical approach is to establish a voluntary insurance scheme or schemes.</p>

<p>I shall now furnish a brief explanation of certain provisions of the Bill. The first clause contains, as is customary, the definitions. In this regard the definition of the term &#x201C;war damage&#x201D; is important. The proposed definition comprises the following principles&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) War damage is limited to damage, loss, or expenditure sustained or incurred in respect of property including merchant vessels, commercial aircraft and any cargo on board such merchant vessel or commercial aircraft. For the rest it is being provided that property which will qualify for the purpose of the legislation shall be prescribed by the Minister of Finance by regulation.</li>

<li>(b) The damage, loss or expenditure shall amount to at least R50 before it qualifies for the purposes of the legislation.</li>

<li>(c) Except in respect of merchant vessels, commercial aircraft and the cargo on such vessels or aircraft, the damage, loss or expenditure shall have been sustained or incurred in regard to or in respect of property in the Republic.</li>

<li>(d) The damage, loss or expenditure shall arise from any hostilities or actions of a war-like nature with conventional weapons by the armed forces of any hostile power or the armed forces of the Republic or of its allies and may be extended to include damage by unconventional warfare, i.e. nuclear weapons, and acts of violence of a political nature.</li>

</ol>

<p>Clause 2 empowers the Minister of Finance to establish, from time to time, a war damage fund, into which premiums received and moneys appropriated by Parliament and any other revenue shall be paid.</p>

<p>Clause 3 empowers the Minister of Finance, by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> and subject to the terms and conditions which he determines, establish a scheme or more than one scheme whereunder the persons or bodies stipulated by him, may obtain the following&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) insurance cover against war damage risks;</li>

<li>(b) compensation for war damage sustained;</li>

<li>(c) guarantees for the compensation of war damage which may be suffered; and</li>

<li>(d) guarantees for the payment of the difference between normal insurance premiums and higher premiums which may be payable in terms of an insurance agreement if war should break out or actions of a specific hostile nature should occur.</li>

</ol>

<p>Depending on the nature and extent of the war risks which may arise by virtue of specific circumstances, it will be possible to establish various kinds of schemes. In other circumstances it might be necessary to go further as well, and it will be possible to pay compensation for certain war damage actually sustained without any premiums having to be charged.</p>

<p>The underlying premise of this clause is therefore to make it possible to establish a diversity of schemes depending on the requirements prevailing at that particular time.</p>

<p>War damage insurance ought not to be compulsory. Consequently no provision is being made in this Bill for the exercising of any compulsion on the part of the authorities to ensure participation in any scheme or schemes.</p>

<p>Clause 4 determines the purposes for which the moneys in the fund shall be utilized, while clause 5 creates a temporary escape mechanism in cases where liabilities exceed the revenue in any specific year.</p>

<p><span class="col_7653-7654" refersTo="page_1157"/>It is desirable that compensation paid in terms of a scheme under this legislation will be used to restore or to replace damaged or destroyed assets, particularly factories, ships, homes, etc., or to utilize the moneys &#x201C;usefully&#x201D; for other purposes. Clause 6 therefore provides that the Minister of Finance may link the payment of moneys due to such conditions of utilization.</p>

<p>Clause 7 provides that the legislation shall be administered by the Treasury. The intention is that this task shall be entrusted to the Registrar of Financial Institutions because he and his office are conversant with insurance principles and practices and are in close contact with the insurance industry. For the rest the office is an integral part of the Department of Finance and is therefore in direct contact with the State bodies responsible for the financial and general economic policy of the Government.</p>

<p>During the Second World War the Treasury was assisted in the administration of the War Damage Compensation Act by an advisory committee. This Bill also provides for the appointment, if necessary, of a war damage insurance committee to be of assistance with the administration of the legislation. The underlying idea is to allow the insurance industry to act as agent of the State in so far as the handling of insurance contracts, the collection of premiums, the assessment of damage, etc., is concerned.</p>

<p>Clause 11 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister of Finance on any matter which may be necessary to achieve the purposes of the legislation.</p>

<p>I recommend this legislation to the consideration of this House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great interest to the Second Reading speech in this Bill, which was so ably delivered by the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs. We on this side of the House appreciate the very comprehensive history and background which have been given of this legislation. It certainly enables us to understand the legislation and to appreciate it better than we would otherwise have been able to.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House agree with the principle that a war damage insurance and compensation law is required in this country in present circumstances. We regard this legislation as being part and parcel of the precautions that need to be taken for the defence and security of our country, just as much as military precautions and civil defence precautions need to be taken under present circumstances. It is because this legislation cannot very easily be separated from the defence and security situation of our country that the hon. member for Durban Point will have a few words to say on the subject in this debate.</p>

<p>This Bill is primarily an enabling measure. It gives the hon. the Minister the power to introduce a war damage insurance and compensation scheme. Let me say that I fervently hope that even if a scheme has to be devised and introduced, it will not have to be used in practice. The existing Act, i.e. the Act of 1941, as the hon. the Minister said during his Second Reading speech, was designed to cover circumstances as they existed in the Second World War and although that Act is still in force, it needs up-dating and modernizing to make it suitable for present-day conditions, and not only for present-day conditions, but for conditions that may arise in the future. It is because the circumstances that a war damage insurance scheme has to cover cannot be foreseen and cannot be accurately predicted that this measure must be in the nature of an enabling measure and that the Government should have flexibility to determine, not only the nature of the war damage to be covered, but also the type of property to be insured against damage and for which compensation may be provided in the light of circumstances that may exist now or in the future. Therefore, we have no objection to the manner in which this legislation has been framed.</p>

<p>This measure differs from the 1941 Act in certain important respects, as the hon. the Minister has said in his Second Reading speech. That measure provided war damage insurance and compensation for fixed property and goods situated within South Africa. It specifically excluded ships, aircraft and the cargoes carried by ships and aircraft. That exclusion was suited to the conditions that existed during the Second World War. Ships and cargoes, which were by far the most important of those three items, were able to be insured through insurance companies which in turn could reinsure those risks during the last World War with the British Government who ran, through the British Board of Trade, their own war insurance scheme. Civil aircraft were <span class="col_7655-7656" refersTo="page_1158"/>not the war damage risk that they could be under present circumstances because aircraft were hardly used at all during the last World War for non-military purposes. The position, of course, is very different now. Obviously there is no longer recourse to any British sources for compensation or insurance. The insurance industry may underwrite war damage insurance in isolated instances, but it is very unlikely to undertake to cover war risks in the event of our country becoming involved in any serious hostilities. Certainly the insurance industry would not provide compensation as is provided for in this Bill. In any case, war damage insurance provided by the insurance industry only covers ships and cargoes carried by those ships while they are actually at sea. It does not cover the period of transport between factory and ship or ship and destination. Obviously, therefore, provision must be made in our legislation for war damage insurance and compensation for these three items. So, besides providing war damage insurance to cover specifically described property, this Bill also enables the hon. the Minister to determine other types of property to be covered. Also, besides providing cover for specific types of war damage, such as damage resulting from the use of nuclear weapons and damage in circumstances of civil disorder directed against the security of the State, it also enables the hon. the Minister to determine other types of war damage.</p>

<p>I believe that the wide discretion provided for in this Bill is necessary in the circumstances. It is necessary because the circumstances in which this measure may be implemented&#x2014;though I hope it will not have to be implemented&#x2014;cannot be determined or foreseen. The other aspects of this Bill are unexceptional and I therefore have pleasure in stating that this side of the House will support the measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I stand up to indicate the support of the PRP for this Bill. It is a vast improvement on the 1941 Act, which is being repealed. There are just three points to which I should like to direct the attention of the hon. the Minister. Firstly, we would be happy if the definition of &#x201C;war damage&#x201D; were extended to include all political aggression and not merely external aggression. I am thinking, for example, of internal insurrection, political riots, strikes and civil commotion. Secondly, we feel that all property, and not only prescribed property, should be covered because the prejudice a man suffers as a result of loss of property is the same no matter what the nature of that property is. Thirdly, we feel that the provisions and the accounts for South West Africa should be kept separate from those of the Republic.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in view of the coverage that has been given to the subject in the introductory speeches of the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Constantia, I shall not deal with the insurance aspect. I think that aspect has been adequately covered. I should like, however, to raise two matters concerning direct compensation.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to ask whether it is the intention of the Government to establish such a fund immediately and to make immediate provision for coverage by compensation as a result of war damage. We are, in fact, in a state of undeclared war in certain areas, and damage has already been inflicted on private property, whether accidentally or by the enemy one does not know. This, however, is the nature of the present situation in areas covered by this Bill. I would therefore like to know whether immediate provision is being made for claims for damage which may occur or has already occurred.</p>

<p>I think that another aspect has been missed here. I am referring to civil defence. The civil defence organization is a vital part of the security of the country. However, there is no provision made, for example, for movable property such as the vehicles of persons working for civil defence or for damage that might occur as the result of their actions in civil defence. This action is not directly linked with enemy action or the action of hostile forces, and not necessarily even connected with warfare itself, being part and parcel of the security procedure which is necessary to protect the country. I would like the hon. the Minister to assure us that he will give consideration, in any scheme which is drawn up, to adequate coverage for those who are involved in providing home front security in the form of civil defence. I would, in fact, like to see the matter taken further than only fixed property because in civil defence, in particular, people use their own vehicles and equipment. In that respect there is no protection for them. There is no insurance for life or <span class="col_7657-7658" refersTo="page_1159"/>property. I do, however, believe they would be covered by this fund when damage is linked with warfare.</p>

<p>One other assurance I would ask from the hon. the Minister is that the limits of insurance should be more realistic than R2 000 per property, which is the existing figure. R2 000 offers no protection when it comes to a factory or even to a private home. I think we need a much more realistic figure as far as the available compensation is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to thank those hon. members who have spoken for their support of this Bill, which I am sure is a timeous one in the conditions in which we live.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Randburg wanted the definition of &#x201C;war damage&#x201D; extended, but I think the definition is perhaps a little wider than he possibly reads into it, because if he looks at clause 1(vi)(a)(iv), he will see that the definition also covers any prescribed property in the Republic. It reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and arising from any hostile action directed against the security of the Republic.</block>

<p>If it is essential to compensate, we can make compensation available. The fund can be financed from premiums on policies entered into under schemes, it can be financed by moneys appropriated by Parliament, or in whatever other legitimate way. Civil defence people who suffer any loss as a result of the sort of situation which is very widely described here, will definitely be covered, depending on the Minister&#x2019;s decision. The Minister can decide what property is involved and it is very simple to extend the definition to cover all the properties which the hon. member has in mind. I think he mentioned the motor vehicles of these people. It will certainly be possible in terms of the legislation to provide cover. The Bill is very widely drafted and, as the hon. member for Constantia said, is enabling legislation. There is no limit put on the amount, and I think we will find that as a result of this Bill, we will for the first time be in a position to deal adequately with any eventuality of the kind envisaged.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is only right that I should state at the beginning of the Third Reading that we are now dealing with an improved Bill. As a result of the amendments which the hon. the Minister was prepared to accept I believe that there is now a far better chance that in the implementation of this Bill <span class="col_7659-7660" refersTo="page_1160"/>the Teachers&#x2019; Council will in fact be able to achieve its envisaged objects. At the beginning of the Second Reading I could only say that I was satisfied with the disciplinary powers, but now I can tell the hon. the Minister with more certainty that as a result of the acceptance of the amendments relating to the drafting of the code of conduct, we are dealing with a Bill with an improved professional content. The fact that the code of conduct will no longer be subject to the right of veto of the Committee of Heads of Education as was originally envisaged, is in my opinion a major step in the right direction.</p>

<p>One of the first tasks awaiting the council will therefore be the compiling of the professional code of conduct. It will be no easy task. In the last analysis the co-operation of every teacher is necessary. The code of conduct is the one aspect concerning which there must be total acceptance by every member of the profession. Every teacher must be prepared to give it his whole-hearted support.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In other words, Sir, there must be a complete commitment on behalf of every teacher to adhere to this code of conduct.</p>

<p>*I have enough confidence in the council and in the teaching profession as a whole, too, to be convinced that they will tackle this task with the utmost vigour. If they do so, the teaching profession will have a code of conduct which, in my opinion, will not only be their own product through and through, but may even serve as an example for other professions. The second task is that every teacher will have to take it upon himself to abide by this code of conduct at all times. Thirdly, the council has a great responsibility to ensure that when the code of conduct which they themselves have approved is contravened by any member of the profession, disciplinary steps be taken against him. It would not help the teaching profession if the council was not prepared to punish a person who contravened the code of conduct.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to what I believe will be a fourth task in regard to the implementation and execution of this Bill. This is not really a task which the council itself can do anything about. However, it is a matter which is still in the hands of the hon. the Minister in a half-finished form, as the implementation of the Bill will show us. As far as the registration of teachers is concerned, it will be seen from the implementation of the Bill that in point of fact, the council will only play the role of a spectator. Nowhere are they placed in a position of power with regard to registration. As far as qualified teachers are concerned, the role of the council is solely advisory and as far as the unqualified teachers, viz. those who will be given provisional registration, are concerned, there is not even a reference to advisory powers. In this respect, as I have said, the council will only play the role of a spectator or a clerk whose job it is to record inscriptions. During the Committee Stage the hon. the Minister promised to see what he could do about these aspects. I take it that he will try to do something about this before the Bill is submitted in the Other Place. The hon. the Minister also informed us yesterday that he had negotiated with representatives of the Federal Council. With all respect, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that as regards the matters concerning administration which have not yet been rectified, he will have to initiate negotiations with the people who can in fact make the concessions to him, and not with the Federal Council. Those people are really the Administrators or the Committee of Heads of Education. It is clear to me that the fly in the ointment&#x2014;to put it very frankly&#x2014;is some of the education departments. By that I mean the provincial education departments, irrespective of the role played in the matter by heads of education, the Administrators and the executives of provincial councils. All I want to say to those who adopt this obstinate attitude is that when the implementation of this legislation causes friction in this regard, they will have only themselves to blame. However, what they must have no illusions about is the fact that as a result of this obstinate attitude of theirs, the council will in future be deprived of the opportunity to carry out all the tasks&#x2014;I stress &#x201C;all the tasks&#x201D;, because most of the tasks to be performed by the professional council are in the hands of the council&#x2014;which one would like to place in the hands of a professional council of this nature.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the negotiations must be initiated with these specific people. As I have said, the implementation of the Bill will show that by not granting their co-operation, they may prevent the council from performing all the functions it ought to perform as a professional council. Furthermore, I just want to say the following briefly. I have already put this to the hon. the Minister, and he has given us a positive undertaking that there is other legislation which will have to be amended as well. The hon. the Minister already realizes this. However I now want to address a very friendly invitation to hon. members opposite. I do not address the invitation to all of them, because there are some of them who do in fact co-operate. Unfortunately, however, there are some hon. members who are always just sitting and waiting in the hope that one of the hon. members on this side may say something which they could make an issue of by interpreting it as an insult to the teachers. [Interjections.] Perhaps this is exactly what we have just heard there once again. As I have indicated, the implementation of this Bill is going to reveal one more important defect. At present this Bill stands on two sound professional legs, viz. the code of conduct and the disciplinary powers. I regard those two legs as sound.</p>

<p>The third leg, viz. the professional requirements for registration, is still very shaky. That is the defect. My invitation to hon. members is rather to forget all the negative attitudes they are displaying. Put your shoulders to the wheel and assist the hon. the Minister, and me and other hon. members on this side of the House, so that that defect, too, may be rectified. [Interjections.] Rather do that than maintain that everything is 100&#x0025; in order. After all, hon. members also have an influence in their provinces. They must convince those who could still hamper the proper implementation of the Bill, and convince them in a way which will make them gain a better understanding of these matters. Let the following be our slogan in implementing this Bill: &#x201C;There may not be losers in education. If there are losers, they will be our own children. &#x2019; &#x2019; If this Bill is to be a means to an end, then I hope that that end, apart from the primary aim of inspiring and promoting respect for the teaching profession, will include solving the other problems in education. Now I want to say a few brief words about the powers of the council. Clause 18(g) envisages co-operation with other councils or institutions whose objects or purposes are similar. The effect of this, according to the hon. the Minister, will definitely be that other population groups will also desire to become members of a registration council or to register, or to become members of a teachers&#x2019; council, and the other Ministers involved here will have to see to it that the grass does not grow under their feet. There is a feeling among the Coloureds that this must be implemented there and I believe that the Teachers&#x2019; Council, and the Federal Council too, of course, will have to do their very best to offer their co-operation to the other population groups as far as possible.</p>

<p>To conclude, I just want to tell the hon. the Minister that in his reply to the Second Reading, I believe he had the incorrect information when he said that in the past this side of the House had only advocated a registration council and not a professional council. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that I have taken part in eight or ten discussions of the Vote, and on each occasion that I have spoken, I have clearly stated that what we wanted was a professional council. If we have perhaps made use of the term &#x201C;registration council&#x201D; from time to time, then that does not derogate from this in any way, because this was advocated in the sense which the Federal Council had in mind, and in this connection I can quote from one of its documents, the following excerpt in connection with a registration council, which was to have the following powers&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_7663-7664" refersTo="page_1162"/>The general powers of the council must be the following: Prescribe the minimum qualifications required for registration as a teacher and also prescribe the code of professional ethics to be observed by all registered teachers.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, Sir, whether you call it a professional council or a registration council, if it can have those powers, then that body is indeed a professional council.</p>

<p>*I conclude by saying that we wish the council and the teaching profession all of the best.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a pity that the hon. member for Durban Central had to use the opportunity afforded by the Third Reading as well to continue to be negative about this very fine piece of legislation we have before us. One could understand an argument being conducted over a certain aspect in the Second Reading and even during the Committee Stage, but after the adequate replies given by the hon. the Minister towards the end of the Second Reading and also during the Committee Stage, one expected a far more positive note to have been sounded by the Opposition during the Third Reading. I hope that the hon. member who is going to speak after me, the member of the PRP party, will at least sound a much more positive note.</p>

<p>Sir, this legislation lends itself, as I have said, to a positive discussion. It goes without saying that the last word in regard to this legislation cannot be said now, and that this legislation has to be exposed to an evolutionary process. The hon. the Minister has already said this. In the past this was the case with most statutory boards. They had to find their way, and having found it the final pattern was of such a nature that most people were satisfied with it. What is important to us about this legislation, however, is that with its acceptance a new era is not only being ushered in for the teachers of this country, but also for education in its entirety. What is also important and what probably cannot be stressed sufficiently, is that under clause 3 esteem for education, for the teaching profession and the prestige of those engaged in the teaching profession shall be upheld and promoted. It ought to be the point of departure of all of us to build on that object to ensure in that way that the legislation develops in such a way that it can comply with these requirements. This legislation is of course making history. Except for Scotland, our approximately 45 000 White teachers out of a grand total of 20 million teachers throughout the world, are the only teachers who are being placed in a position, by means of a statutory board, to realize, maintain and promote the objectives contained in clause 3.</p>

<p>Since the earliest days we in the Republic of South Africa have always been fortunate to have a teachers&#x2019; corps who were educators in the true sense of the word. Up to now they have always compelled respect from the pupils and the community. This has also assured them of a special place in the community, so much so that teachers of this country have frequently been lauded by poets. In this way G. A. Watermeyer said that teachers were the casting moulds of the youth and of those casting moulds he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Gietvorms van ons jeug, ons vra dat julle skouers breed moet dra, want julle elke denke, elke daad, strek hom ten goede of ten kwaad. As julle oud en sterk is, sal hoop wat julle gesaai het, swerf en groei in die gedagtegrond tot nardus van ons m&#x00F4;restond.</block>

<p>This is the teacher, and it is for this teacher and his position in society that legislation gives us certain directions. Therefore I maintain that we should, particularly in these days in which the struggle for the soul of our people has intensified, enable our teachers by means of statutory powers to preserve the domains which they have conquered with difficulty over the years, and rightly so too. In contrast to this one still finds in many countries of the world an attitude that there is no place for the teacher in society. I can quote many examples where the teacher is regarded as a person who occupies a low position on the scale by means of which the position of people in society is measured. We in this country have, over the years, ensured that our teacher occupies a special place in our society. This legislation will contribute to assuring the teacher of that position in future.</p>

<p>It imparts professional status upon the teacher, and rightly so. To impart professional status on a person, one has to consider that person&#x2019;s formal education. In my opinion we can say, with great pride in the case of South <span class="col_7665-7666" refersTo="page_1163"/>Africa, that there is nothing lacking in the training of our teachers. To this we may add that our teachers&#x2019; corps maintain a very standard in their conduct, in practice and in the sphere of ethics. We should take off our hats to them for that.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say in regard to the economic status of teachers that a word of gratitude should be expressed to the hon. the Minister who indicated that he accorded priority to the matter and that in the months which lie ahead a definite improvement will be effected in this respect. As a former teacher I want to thank the hon. the Minister for this.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is very little in what the hon. member for Springs said that can be faulted, except, of course, the acrimonious remarks he levelled at the hon. member for Durban Central. I must honestly say that I did not find anything negative in the speech made by the hon. member for Durban Central. In my opinion there was a very constructive spirit in everything he said. This positive spirit is something which has been reflected on both sides of this House during all the stages of the Bill. The Minister in particular proved himself to be very accommodating during the Committee Stage with regard to the debating of the Bill. Surely this is a demonstration that both sides of this House are in earnest about the Teachers&#x2019; Council being important, and that all of us support its establishment and will, together, try to make it as effective as possible. In fact, I think a record has been broken in that eight of the 18 amendments which we moved were accepted. This serves to demonstrate the measure of co-operation which there can be if everyone believes in the importance of a specific institution such as the Teachers&#x2019; Council.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Teachers&#x2019; Council should be seen within the broader context of education in South Africa, particularly with a view to the problems with which education is having to cope with at present. In this respect I am thinking specifically of the shortage of teachers, particularly in certain technical and scientific subjects. Scientific subjects are very closely associated with the manpower which can be produced by the educational system in a society. The problems which exist in education are also very closely associated with the status of the teacher.</p>

<p>A few years ago there was no doubt that the teacher was held in high esteem and enjoyed an elevated status. However, as South Africa became industrialized and urbanized, the teaching profession had to compete with other professions, not only in respect of status, but also in respect of salary. One of the basic problems we are faced with is the fact that the status and prestige of the teaching profession is being threatened. The Bill in fact seeks to enhance the prestige and status of the teaching profession and also to establish a code of conduct. In this way the teaching profession will once again occupy an honoured position in society.</p>

<p>A council such as the Teachers&#x2019; Council is only one of the many steps which will have to be taken to restore the teaching profession to its former position of honour, to restore it to health. This is a very essential measure. I believe that we in South Africa, particularly if we consider the future and the need for manpower, have a great need for a coordinated approach to education in the broadest sense. I am referring to the entire educational system in South Africa, for all population groups, and the task of this system to provide South Africa with skilled manpower and to raise the level of literacy and education in general. That is why we in these benches believe that a co-ordinated federal council will eventually have to be established, in which all groups of society may be represented. Because this particular measure</p>

<p>On the basis that if a teacher is a teacher, then it makes no difference whether he is a White or a Black teacher. He has the same problems as far as his status is concerned, and he encounters the same problems in enhancing his prestige in the <span class="col_7667-7668" refersTo="page_1164"/>eyes of the community. That is why I believe that this measure under these circumstances may be seen as a positive step in that direction. That is why we in these benches support the measure, but we believe that it will merely be the beginning, and that it will ultimately have to form part of a greater, federated council.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the Third Reading of the Bill I want to thank all the members on this side of the House as well as the members of both Opposition parties, in the first place, for their support of the Bill. Everyone concedes that it is an important Bill. Why? Because what is at issue here is the status of teachers in our community and for that reason, too, the education of our children. I want to tell hon. members very candidly that this is as I wanted it to be, for when I made my first speech as Minister of National Education here in the House of Assembly I asked for the support of both Opposition parties for education. I pleaded that we should lift this matter out of the political arena and that we should, in the interests of all our children, do our best in this country for education and teaching. I also requested the newspapers for their support, and for that reason I now want to convey my sincere thanks for the support which I did receive. I went out of my way, and was very accommodating by accepting no fewer than eight of the 18 amendments moved by hon. members opposite, and I hope they will not forget it. I afforded hon. members the opportunity to be co-builders of the legislation, legislation which, as the hon. member for Springs rightly said, ushers in a new era in education. If we would in this way co-operate and build together on the education of our children and in respect of our teachers in future, then we can do it. I want to say that there are undoubtedly very fine prospects for education in the Republic of South Africa, and we have to accomplish these things, because it is in the interests of South Africa and all its people that we do.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Rondebosch that this is only one measure, but is in fact an essential measure, to elevate the position of the teacher in our society and to do the best for education of our children. We shall undoubtedly have to come forward with other measures. There is no doubt at all about that. In fact, work is already in progress in this regard, and this work will have to be done quickly, because we realize how essential it is that this should happen. I want to plead again that we, in this Parliament, as well as our people, should realize that it is essential that the climate should be created in South Africa which will cause the teaching profession to come into its own. Teaching is not simply ordinary work. Teaching is far more than ordinary work, and this should be said loudly and clearly in South Africa. Without any doubt at all this Bill is therefore very important because it affords all of us in this country the opportunity to demonstrate with it, in addition to the other measures which still have to come, that we in South Africa accept that education is not ordinary work, but that it is far more. What is education if we say it is far more? It is making an effort. It is taking action, showing the way, giving instruction, lending assistance and giving guidance to children. After all, children are our greatest possession. We have nothing more important than children in South Africa. They are the future of our people, and that is why they are so important. We say and we believe that it is more blessed to give than to receive. To truly be a teacher, and this we have to realize, is to give of yourself; and to give of yourself, is true giving. We must make the teachers in this country feel, and also tell them, that there is appreciation of the fact that they are giving <span class="col_7669-7670" refersTo="page_1165"/>themselves to education, and to our children. It means a sacrifice of their time and energy. It requires an involvement which in fact requires the teacher&#x2019;s whole life. Since I became Minister of National Education I have received many kinds of complaints from teachers throughout the country, for example about salaries and other minor matters. However, no one has complained to me that the life of a teacher is not meaningful. I know of no teacher who, after a long period of service in education, retired and alleged that they had lived a useless life. This I find to be what is splendid, what is enduring about education, something which has been as true for more than a century in South Africa as it still is today, viz. that although teaching is tiring&#x2014; and we should not lose sight of this; it is tiring&#x2014;it is also meaningful; it gives sense and meaning to the life of the person who engages in it. In this regard I want to endorse what Nietsche said so strikingly in this regard. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He who has a why to live for, can bear with almost any how.</block>

<p>This, I think, makes education very meaningful and splendid. I was present the other day when the centenary of the Transvaal Education Department was held. The minister there expressed it so well when he said, in his survey of education over the past hundred years in the Transvaal: &#x201C;Thank you for the hundred years of grace.&#x201D; If we consider education in that light, i.e. that we say thank you for the grace, for the teachers who became involved in the matter in this way, the legislation which we are passing here is meaningful and we are making a contribution to restore the teaching profession to its rightful place in our community and by doing the best for our children in that way.</p>

<p>I do not want to conclude on a negative note. In any event, I think I have already said enough. But I still want to refer to a single point before I resume my seat. I want to tell the hon. member for Rondebosch that our policy is very clear, and that there should be no doubt about this. Our policy differs from that of the hon. member for Rondebosch, as he stated it once again here this evening. Our policy is that there will be a Teachers&#x2019; Council for Whites. In addition we do not begrudge any other population group in South Africa also having its own&#x2014;each of them&#x2014;professional teachers&#x2019; council, just as we have. Surely that is fair, good and just, and there is nothing wrong with that. It also works much better in practice, for at present there are still many major differences in respect of qualifications, and hon. members must not think that I am simply talking for the sake of talking here. We sat down around the conference table and worked out this matter for hours and days, just the matter of the non-Whites and their representatives. Therefore we are not coming forward with a half-baked measure. However, having said that our policy is a separate council for each nation according to requirements, we are providing in clause 18(g) that a co-ordinating council or an umbrella council may subsequently be established in which these people may discuss matters of common interest with one another. We must understand this matter now, and not be destructive in our criticism of the Teachers&#x2019; Council for Whites, for it will not get us anywhere, and it will create the impression&#x2014;as previous speakers have in fact done in this debate, something with which I have serious fault to find; the newspapers also reported it in this way&#x2014;that in respect of our non-White population groups bad relations are being created, and this is not necessary at all. We want only the best for them, the non-Whites, as well, and we shall help them to achieve the best. Let us therefore understand one another in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Springs very sincerely for his contribution. This morning I had the privilege of being in his constituency and attending the centenary of the Transvaal Education Department, as well as the fifteenth anniversary of the Republic. There were almost 30 000 children present there. It was truly inspiring. I want to congratulate the hon. member on this wonderful function. I also want to congratulate him on his very positive contribution in the interests of education which he made here this evening as a former teacher.</p>

<p>That hon. member was not here for the entire debate.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Durban Central. I also want to thank him for the positive contribution he made here this evening. I shall gladly remember the words with <span class="col_7671-7672" refersTo="page_1166"/>which he concluded his speech. He said he wished the Teachers&#x2019; Council and education everything of the best in the Republic of South Africa. I have appreciation for that. However, there is one minor error which I have to rectify so that there will be no misunderstanding. I find it a pity that the hon. member referred here to the recalcitrance of the Administrators and the Committee of Heads of Education, and did so after so much success has up to now been achieved. I know the hon. member had no ill intentions, but I should like to place this matter in its correct perspective. That kind of comment can only, in the nature of the case, mar further negotiations, and I did after all promise here that further negotiations would take place. We should therefore be a little more careful.</p>

<p>The hon. member should, in addition, understand that there can be no question here of a veto right, not on the part of the Committee of Heads of Education nor on the part of the Federal Council nor on the part of this Teachers&#x2019; Council. These bodies simply have to sit down around a conference table and decide what further powers they are prepared to confer upon the Professional Teachers&#x2019; Council. I have promised that I would be prepared to act as chairman there. I shall try to help to do my best to effect a sound agreement. I do not have any doubt at all that such an agreement can in fact be achieved.</p>

<p>I am afraid that a misunderstanding may subsequently arise, and therefore I now want to mention two points briefly. I hope I understood the hon. member correctly. As I understood him, what his argument amounted to was that the responsibility of ensuring that a teacher is able to stand in front of a class should be taken away from the provinces&#x2014;i.e. from the head of education&#x2014;and given to the Teachers&#x2019; Council.</p>

Although we agree that we should grant wider powers to this Teachers&#x2019; Council, we must not harm education in the process in that we go too far and give them powers which really do not belong to them.</p>

<p>I undertook to consider certain things before I referred the Bill to the Other Place. I shall keep my word, as hon. members know.</p>

I do not know when the legislation is going to the Other Place, and I cannot therefore guarantee that I will be able to liaise with the Administrators and with all the other bodies concerned before that time in order to effect changes.</p>

<p>In my opinion the consequences of this legislation could be legion. I think the teaching profession deserves a far higher status, and I believe that this council will achieve this. However, we must all commit ourselves to helping in this regard. The enhanced status will not only be determined by conduct, but also by the qualifications of the teachers. A greater discipline will have to be created, not only among their own number, but also in our schools and in our society. Surely it will be to the advantage of the whole of South Africa if greater discipline is created in this way. I also express the hope that a child will be able to say plainly to his friends: &#x201C;That is my teacher. This is what he accomplished, this is what he did, and I follow him, because he has proved to me, as child, that he is a leader. &#x201D; So we see it as an ordered community.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telecommunications">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Hon. members will have noted from the explanatory memorandum which was tabled that this measure is, for the most part, of an administrative nature. The chief aim is to combine all provisions relating to the financial management of the Post Office in the Post Office Act, in view of the repeal of the Exchequer and Audit Act of 1956 by the new Exchequer and Audit Act of 1975 which came into effect on 1 April this year. At the same time adjustments to the Post Office Act for which there is a practical need are being effected, various obsolete provisions are being deleted, and certain provisions are being rearranged with a view to a later consolidation of the Act. By means of clause 3 of the Bill, the new sections 2A to 2D, which contain the financial powers of the Postmaster-General, and in which his other powers are also set out in full, are being inserted in the Bill.</p>

<p>The exercising of the powers set out in the new section 2B was subject to the approval of the Minister, but naturally provision is made for extensive delegation of authority by the Minister and by the Postmaster-General as well, which is essential to the efficient management of an undertaking as large as the Post Office.</p>

<p>One of these powers to which I would like to give special attention is that contained in subsection (3) of the new section 2B in accordance with which special rates which may be lower than the normal rates, and in terms of which particular users of the services of the department may be exempted from the payment of fees, may be determined when rates are being prescribed.</p>

<p>It is of course true that where rates lower than the normal rates are determined, or users of services are exempted from payment, the Post Office is giving up revenue and rendering certain services on an uneconomic basis. This is not in accordance with normal business principles. Furthermore, it is also true that such concessions may involve indirect subsidies to certain groups by the Post Office, whereas it is desirable that welfare and other aid granted to specific groups by the State, be identified as such and canalized through the department responsible for the provision of aid. The power to make concessions may therefore clash with the basic principle that the Post Office must be run as a business undertaking and that it is not the task of the Post Office to render welfare services. Whether it does clash with this principle depends on the way in which it is applied. I should like to make it clear that it is not the intention to deviate from the basic principle I have mentioned to any notable extent by way of this power. The Post Office needs the power because it is a public undertaking and must also comply with international agreements and established practices. Specific examples of the concessions involved are the gratis transmission of weather reports to ships at sea in terms of the International Telecommunications Regulations, the gratis transmission of health reports from ships to harbour masters or advice to ships by doctors, the provision of gratis telephone services to visiting warships of other countries, and the gratis delivery of post for the blind. I must stress that whereas for practical reasons the Post Office needs the flexibility afforded by this power, it will only be possible to apply it to a limited extent and by way of exception if the Post Office is to comply with the basic statutory directive to run its affairs in accordance with business principles.</p>

<p>A chapter on finance is being inserted in the Act by means of clause 5. Its provisions are largely domestic, and for the most part consist of the re-enactment&#x2014;with certain adjustments&#x2014;of existing provisions and the inclusion of provisions which correspond to <span class="col_7675-7676" refersTo="page_1168"/>provisions of the new Exchequer and Audit Act, 1975.</p>

<p>Arrangements in the new chapter to which I should like to refer are, firstly, those contained in the proposed section 12F(6), in accordance with which it will not be necessary to submit an Additional Post Office Appropriation Bill in a financial year in which the total amount voted is not exceeded by more than 2&#x0025;. Since in terms of subsection (5) the Minister will be empowered to authorize expenditure in excess of voted amounts or for purposes for which amounts were not voted, up to this limit, it is not deemed justifiable that Parliament should have to deal with special legislation which only provides for amounts of this size which have already been spent. Such expenditure may still be reviewed by Parliament when, as required by section (6), it is submitted for approval together with the subsequent main Post Office Budget.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the arrangement in the proposed section 12G in accordance with which the Post Office is authorized, during a maximum period of two months after the start of the financial year, to incur expenditure in respect of that financial year in anticipation of the passing of a Post Office Appropriation Bill. I undertook in the Other Place to shorten this period by one month and I shall move an amendment to that effect. As hon. members note, all three Government budgets&#x2014;the main budget and the Railways and the Post Office budgets&#x2014;are usually submitted in March of each year. The budgets of the Railways and the Post Office both have to be dealt with timeously so that the appropriation bills may be published in the <i>Gazette</i> before or on 1 April. In the case of the Post Office Budget, administrative problems due to the time factor have occurred on more than one occasion in the past. I should like to explain that the new arrangement merely seeks to provide leeway in this regard and that it is not the intention to introduce the Post Office Budget later than in March every year.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, the next matter to which I should like to refer is the adaptation of the provisions relating to the Post Office Savings Bank proposed in clauses 18, 20 and 25.</p>

<p>The main object of the proposed changes is to bring about greater flexibility in the administration of the Savings Bank by providing for matters like limitations on deposits in ordinary accounts, Savings Bank certificates and the manner in which interest on Savings Bank certificates may be paid, as determined by regulation. The stipulation that Savings Bank certificates may only be issued to persons who hold ordinary accounts is also being removed, and the minimum amount for which a Savings Bank certificate may be issued is being reduced to R50. These changes will enable the Post Office further to streamline and improve its Savings Bank facilities.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, the Treasury transferred the control of the Savings Bank to the Post Office in 1974; since that time it has been run by the Post Office for its own account. I should like to make it clear, however, that the Treasury, as the central monetary authority of the country, retains control over the interest rates and those other conditions not fixed by the Act which apply to deposits in the Savings Bank. For this reason this Bill stipulates that, where such matters may be determined by the Minister or prescribed by regulation, this must be done in consultation with the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Lastly, I should like to deal with the proposed amendments to section 78 of the Act that are put forward in clause 33, and particularly the arrangements with regard to cable television and antenna systems contained in the proposed new subsections (1B) and (3). Under section 78, the Post Office controls telecommunication lines that are not confined to particular sites. The term &#x201C;telecommunications line&#x201D;, as used in the Bill, includes cable systems which, for instance, may be used to distribute television transmissions from a central point to a number of receivers in a specific area.</p>

<p>Such a system may consist merely of a central antenna on a high point from which broadcasts picked up by the antenna are fed by cable to a number of receivers in a so-called &#x201C;shadow&#x201D; area as a means of improving reception. Systems like this only take place of individual antennas, and their control is proper to local authorities. These antenna systems are excluded from Post Office control under the proposed new subsection (3). However, where such a cable system is used to distribute transmissions that are generated in the system itself, it in effect becomes a broadcasting system. To ensure proper control over such cable television systems, the proposed subsection (1B) precludes their use without the <span class="col_7677-7678" refersTo="page_1169"/>approval of the Minister of National Education, who is responsible for broadcasting, or without due regard to the views of our national broadcasting organization.</p>

<p>In the event that the Minister of National Education approves the use of any cable television system, he will under subsection (1B) be able to lay down conditions with regard to its use and to determine fees to be paid by persons connected to the system.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before concluding I should like to draw attention to a printing error in the English version of the Bill that might cause misunderstanding. I refer to clause 1, page 5, where in the definition of &#x201C;depositor&#x201D;, the words and figures after &#x201C;Savings Bank certificate&#x201D; in line 24 up to the semicolon in line 26 should be disregarded. Their appearance in the Bill is a <i>bona fide</i> printer&#x2019;s error which will be clerically corrected when the Bill is reprinted. As hon. members will note, these words and figures do not appear in the Afrikaans version.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the details of the remaining provisions of the Bill at this point. The details are elucidated in the explanatory memorandum, and may in my opinion, be more fruitfully discussed with reference to specific points which hon. members may wish to raise in this connection. I shall carry out the undertakings I have given in the Senate concerning the proposed new section 12G as contained in clause 5, and in respect of clause 18, by moving amendments at the appropriate time.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has said that this Bill is mainly of an administrative nature and that it effects adjustments for which a need exists in practice, but unfortunately the hon. the Minister was silent on what we in the official Opposition consider to be the main principle of this legislation. The main principle of this legislation, in our opinion, is the profit motive of the Post Office. This is being introduced into the Post Office for the first time and we find it strange that the hon. the Minister did not emphasize this aspect. The other point which we also consider to be very important and which we thought that the hon. the Minister would emphasize is the fact that he is now paving the way for a new status for the Post Office, that of a State corporation. Sir, the Minister emphasized that the services provided on an uneconomic basis were subsidized by other departments and he mentioned a few examples. But we feel that the Minister did not go far enough. He should have declared that the Post Office would provide effective services to the consumers, to the public in general, in spite of the fact that some of these services are uneconomic. As far as clause 5 of the legislation is concerned, the hon. the Minister said that its provisions were mainly of a domestic nature, but he did not say that this clause was introducing the principle of a profit motive for the Post Office. The Act used to provide for affairs to be administered on business principles, but there was no profit motive in the administration of the Post Office. Certain other amendments to the Post Office administration create the impression that the Minister is paving the way for a kind of institution which will no longer be a department, but which will be a State corporation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, there is clear evidence that the hon. the Minister is attempting to give the Post Office the status of a State corporation. If one follows this Bill, one sees, first of all, that the profit motive is being introduced for the first time, there is also the question of reserves, for which the Post Office has not had any authority in the past, and then there is the utilization of moneys appropriated for a particular financial year, after the close of that financial years, and for another financial year for which they were not appropriated. Lastly, there is the incurring of expenditure without the authority of a Part Appropriation Bill. This question of using unexpended moneys after the end of the year and incurring expenditure without appropriation, introduces very dangerous financial principles, as Parliament has no control over them at all. We find that if that is the case, the Post Office will be in exactly the same position as a State corporation in relation to Parliament. We know what the position is in regard to State corporations, and we know of the trouble we have had with the SABC. We know that we have never been able to debate fully all the other State corporations. They spend money as they please and whenever we ask questions about it, we do not get proper answers. It seems to me a most retrograde step&#x2014;and we on this side of the House believe it to be that&#x2014;to <span class="col_7679-7680" refersTo="page_1170"/>introduce this principle into this Bill and, what is more, not to say a word about it at its introduction. Surely it is the most important principle that this Bill contains, and we believe that the hon. the Minister should have made it his duty to explain just why there is this change of policy, why there is now a profit motive and why the Post Office should now be turned into what is tantamount to a State corporation. It must be so, Sir, because if one compares the provisions of this Bill with the Exchequer and Audit Act, it is quite clear that that is the case, because the Exchequer and Audit Act prohibits the expenditure of moneys other than in the financial year for which moneys were appropriated. This Bill goes against that all the way. We also expected at this time that the hon. the Minister would produce a statement of policy on the Post Office. This is an appropriate occasion. If the hon. the Minister was going to change certain basic principles in regard to the Post Office, then this was the appropriate opportunity to have said what his basic policy for the Post Office was. Unfortunately we do not know what it is. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he thinks along the lines of the United States where the authorities have stated quite clearly what their postal policy is, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United States postal service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States.</block>

<p>I believe that it is a most important principle and one that should also be in the Minister&#x2019;s policy statement. But we have not heard it. They continue to say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The postal service shall have as its basic function the obligation to provide a postal service to bind the nation together through the personal, educational, literary and business correspondence of the people.</block>

<p>We have not heard a word about that from the hon. the Minister. They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It shall provide prompt, reliable and efficient services to patrons in all areas and will render postal services to all communities.</block>

<p>The most important part we find in the last sentence, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The cost of establishing and maintaining the postal service shall not be apportioned to impair the overall value of such service to the people.</block>

<p>I think this is one of the most important principles the hon. the Minister should incorporate also in his policy statement. I think the hon. the Minister should also take another leaf out of the United States&#x2019; policy and say something along the following lines&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The postal service shall provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining. No small post office shall be closed solely for operating at a deficit, it being the specific intent of Congress that effective postal services be ensured to residents of both urban and rural communities.</block>

<p>I do not want to quote any more, but it is quite clear to me that if the hon. the Minister had really wanted to do something when he introduced this legislation, we would have been treated to a policy statement, something of the nature of what I have just read. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that, as he avoided doing so when he introduced the Bill during the Second Reading, he might consider doing it at the commencement of the Committee Stage or perhaps during the Third Reading. The hon. the Minister could perhaps also do it in his reply to the Second Reading debate. Perhaps the hon. the Minister is giving in to a little doubt; that is why I did not suggest it in the first instance. If the hon. the Minister would like to borrow my book, I am quite prepared to hand it to him so as to give him an opportunity of doing just this.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with some of the aspects of this Bill which I think we should debate in some detail. The Bill makes it clear that the Post Office is no longer regarding itself as a department with the prime object to provide a service, notwithstanding the fact that that service is not profitable.</p>

<p>For the first time we now have in a Post Office Bill the word &#x201C;profit&#x201D;. Hon. members will know that the Act speaks about the &#x201C;total <span class="col_7681-7682" refersTo="page_1171"/>earnings&#x201D; of the department. This Bill substitutes the word &#x201C;profit&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;total earnings&#x201D;. We on this side of the House believe that what is meant by this is the statement in the Bill of what items should be charged against total earnings to arrive at a profit. If one looks at that particular clause, one finds that it refers to the maintenance, replacement, renewal and depreciation of fixed assets, the payment of interest on loans, the redemption of loans, the provision of new fixed assets and the meeting of any other financial liabilities. Those are all provided for as items that should be deducted from total earnings so as to arrive at a profit.</p>

<p>However, the Bill goes further. It provides for what is called &#x201C;reasonable reserves&#x201D;. This is a subject which is going to cause us a great deal of trouble. Why the question of reserves crops up, I do not know, but I believe I can take a good guess. When the balance sheet for the Post Office was produced for the year ended 31 March 1976, for the first time in the records of the Post Office balance sheet, there appeared an item, &#x201C;Reserves&#x201D;. The figure given is R19 256 000. I believe that what happened&#x2014;and this is the reason why this Bill is before us in this form&#x2014;is that the Auditor-General spoke to the hon. the Minister and said to him that he noticed there was an item of R19 256 000 as reserves, and then told the hon. the Minister that, in terms of the Post Office Act, he had no right to have reserves. I believe that, simply because the hon. the Minister had R19 256 000 and did not know where to put it in the books of the Post Office, he came to the House on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and said that he regarded R19 256 000 as a reasonable reserve and that, therefore, the Post Office Act had to be amended to provide for a reasonable reserve. I believe that that is the reason. If there is a better reason than that, I hope the hon. the Minister will tell me, because I do not think the reason I have given is a good one at all.</p>

<p>There is a clear indication that the hon. the Minister has in mind that Post Office charges shall be such that sufficient income must accrue to the Post Office to allow it to show a profit, a profit of such proportions that a reserve fund can be accumulated. That is something quite new. It is also a matter on which the hon. the Minister was completely silent in his Second Reading speech. If these provisions are considered together with the new principle that it is no longer necessary for the State President to approve alterations in the fees, rates and charges levied by the Post Office, it is quite obvious that the Minister may raise the fees, rates and charges if he feels that the profit he will make from the existing tariff is not sufficient to produce the profit required. I think this is a very important point. Formerly the State President had to approve the increase in the rates and charges, but now the Minister does it himself. If we pass the legislation in this form, it is an open invitation to the hon. the Minister to say: &#x201C;I do not think that I made enough profit this year, so I am going to put up the rates and charges.&#x201D; It goes further, however, because if the hon. the Minister is incompetent and if he is inefficient and runs a really bad show as far as the Post Office is concerned, so bad that he is running it at a loss, then, in order to cover his inefficiency and incompetence, he can put up the rates and charges. He does not have to go to the State President any more, because he can do it on his own. What is more, he can do it whenever he pleases. All he has to do is to publish a notice in the <i>Government Gazette </i>and that is that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>He does not even suggest in this legislation that it might be a good point to give commerce and industry and the public at large some notice of the fact that he is going to put up these rates and charges; he can put them up right away. I am wondering what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude is going to be today, because we are going to move an amendment in the Committee Stage in regard to the question of putting up the rates and charges. We will suggest to the hon. the Minister that there should be a time limit within which notice should be given to the public at large of the intended increase in these rates.</p>

<p>The other point which we should deal with is the fact which I think the hon. the Minister should always have uppermost in his mind, namely that the Post Office is a monopoly. It is very definitely a monopoly, and because it is a monopoly one must be very careful of how it operates. If one has a monopoly and it operates adversely, there is nothing one can do about it. Everybody has to suffer because of this <span class="col_7683-7684" refersTo="page_1172"/>monopoly. If it is a monopoly, it must operate in such a way that it gives the best treatment to everybody that uses it and even those who do not use it. At the same time it is an essential part of the infrastructure. If the service is to be provided under a monopoly, it should be provided in such a way that it is efficient. It should also be provided in such a way as to give the best service possible, whether there is any profit in it at all or whether there is no profit, whether it breaks even or whether it runs at a loss. That makes no difference at all because a service must be provided and it must be a good service.</p>

<p>The degree of efficiency of the mail service, I believe, determines to a large extent how civilized a country is. In South Africa we fall far short of the international norm for a good postal service. The hon. the Minister has heard me say before what the international norm for a good postal service is, but I think that it is so important that I am going to repeat it. A good postal service, according to the international norm, is one post office to serve 20 to 40 square kilometres and approximately 3 000 to 6 000 inhabitants. If we regard postal agencies as fully-fledged post offices&#x2014;and we know that postal agencies are certainly not fully-fledged post offices, but for the purpose of my argument I am prepared to regard them as such&#x2014;and we add them to the number of fully-fledged post offices, then there are just short of 3 000 post offices in the Republic. This means that in the Republic each post office serves an area of 696 square kilometres and 8 962 inhabitants. These figures are far short of one post office for an area of 20 to 40 square kilometres and 3 000 to 6 000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>During the past 18 months 13 post offices were closed on account of poor support or their proximity to other post offices. Seven post offices were closed on account of the fact that they were not bringing in sufficient income. In addition, five post offices were degraded to postal agencies as a result of poor support. I believe that these figures already show that a profit motive exists in the mind of the hon. the Minister. If he is given his head, he will close more post offices if keeping them open will affect his profit adversely. That is why I think it is so important that we should deal with this profit motive here this evening. In an undertaking such as the Post Office such a monopoly will only be justified if an efficient service is given at a reasonable cost. Already this is not the case. The present structure of the Post Office, with its lack of facilities for the public in respect of postal services, is not efficient. If more post offices are closed, it will be even more inefficient. Telecommunications has a fairly constant backlog of 100 000 telephones, thousands of crossed lines, wrong numbers and incorrect metering.</p>

<p>We are subjected to all this although the telecommunications part of the Post Office runs at a profit. What will happen when profit, which is now not the main motive, becomes the main motive? That is what it is going to become. The Post Office has a monopoly in radio frequencies for two-way radio communication. The result is that the Post Office refuses to grant permission for frequencies if it can supply a service. The Post Office only supplies a service on a rental basis and the equipment remains the property of the Post Office. The rental for a base station and three portable units is R100 per month, payable to the Post Office. Private enterprise, however, is prepared to sell the same service on a monthly instalment basis so that the user becomes the owner of the equipment after all the instalments are paid. At the same time private enterprise renders monthly services to the equipment. The total monthly instalment for the private system is R73,60 per month and the monthly service charge is R15,75 per month, making a total monthly payment of R89,35. When one takes into consideration that the private system becomes the property of the user after payment of the instalments&#x2014; which is not the case in so far as the Post Office system is concerned&#x2014;the comparative figures of R100 per month for the Post Office service and R89,35 for the private system assume greater significance. There is the question of a monopoly. If this monopoly is going to be conducted well it has to be conducted at reasonable competitive prices. In this particular case the Post Office cannot compete. Because the Post Office cannot at present handle mail as efficiently as users would have it handled, many firms either already deliver mail themselves or engage <span class="col_7685-7686" refersTo="page_1173"/>someone else to do it. The effect of this is to make for less support of the Post Office and this may in due course cause the hon. the Minister to close further post offices for lack of support.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>When a post office in the suburbs does not provide efficient service the postal users are apt to patronize the general post office in the city. This also makes for lack of support and the eventual closing of the inefficient post office. When this Bill is passed, the hon. the Minister will have the excuse to close any post office which does not show a profit, irrespective of the fact that it could render efficient service if well supported.</p>

<p>I now come to the point why all this legislation is necessary. It is only necessary, as far as I can make out, because the hon. the Minister believes that he should do certain things which have been tried in other countries and have been a complete flop. In the USA there was an attempt to float a Post Office service corporation. At the last minute these plans did not materialize. Similar attempts have been made in other parts of the world. In every case, however, the result has been a worse service, in fact a curtailed service, and irate mail users. There is no reason at all for us in this country to embark on such a course. However, I believe that is the course the hon. the Minister is embarking on. He thinks that because the Post Office must be run as a business, it has to be run at a profit. That is quite unnecessary. The Post Office must be run in a businesslike fashion, but it does not need to show a profit in order to be run as a business. The hon. the Minister has made it clear in his speech that he regards the profit motive as one of the most important of motives. I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Post Office Bill because, <i>inter alia,</i> it introduces&#x2014;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this day exactly 28 years ago, on 26 May 1948, the telephones rang across South Africa&#x2019;s plains. However there were not many telephones in those days because a United Party Government was in power. We could not even send telegrams, because there was no service, and that was owing to a United Party Government. In the course of 28 years South Africa has had the blessing, good fortune and prosperity of an NP Government, whereas from the UP we have had the poor kind of speech we had this evening from that Hon. member.</p>

<p>That hon. member can speak in a moment. Since that time the telephone service in South Africa has grown and flourished as few things in this world have done. This evening the hon. the Minister of National Education said that one of the country&#x2019;s greatest assets was its children. I think that after its children, the most important asset is South Africa&#x2019;s telecommunications system. There is nothing in a country so important as post and telecommunications services. Nothing can happen in this country if postal and telephone services are not functioning well. No branch of our society can function without these services, whether it be the Railways, the Defence Force or the UP. Postal and telecommunications services are the most important services we have. It is tragic that the hon. member for Wynberg raised with so many petty and trifling matters here while we were engaged in discussing so important a matter.</p>

<p>South Africa can count herself fortunate that that hon. member <span class="col_7687-7688" refersTo="page_1174"/>is not in the business world. Before dealing with the points raised by the hon. member, I want to quote the proposed section 12A(1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The affairs of the department shall be administered on business principles, due regard being had to the promotion by means of efficient postal and telecommunications services, of commerce, industry and agriculture in all parts of the Republic, and to the promotion of the Republic&#x2019;s foreign trade.</block>

<p>However, the hon. member wants to suggest that services are not rendered in every part of South Africa. He compares our position with the position abroad, but in the process he drew comparisons which did not apply to South Africa in any way. One of the points he made was that in South Africa there was one post office for every 666 square km. He compares this state of affairs with the number of square miles per post office in the densely populated countries of Europe. He should really bear in mind that we are a developing country and not a developed country. This really makes quite a big difference. The hon. member launched an attack on the principle that the Post Office should make a profit. Would the hon. member have jumped up and shouted &#x201C;Hurray&#x201D; if the hon. the Minister had said that the Post Office should operate at a loss? Where is the money to come from if we operate at a loss? With what does the hon. member want to finance capital works? With what does he want to pay the administration costs of the Post Office? With what does he want to pay salaries if the Post Office is to operate at a loss?</p>

Within five minutes we can phone to Windhoek to hear whether the United Party has appointed a candidate there. Surely that is service and that is how the Post Office has progressed. That is why we are proud of the Post Office.</p>

<p>The hon. member also launched an attack on the expression &#x201C;reasonable reserves&#x201D;. Surely it is only good business to have reserves and we are running the Post Office on business principles. I do not want to reproach the hon. member on this score, because he is not a financial expert; he is an attorney, a lawyer. I cannot discuss legal aspects with him. I am not going to take it amiss of him for not understanding these matters; they are somewhat beyond him. Nor do we take seriously the blunder he made. I can understand him having made such a blunder. Surely any business has a balance sheet and anyone who knows anything about the economy or finance, or has perhaps done a year of bookkeeping at university, will know what a balance sheet is and what a reserve is. Surpluses are deposited in the reserve. That is a reasonable reserve.</p>

<p>The hon. member goes on to maintain that they will not have the right to discuss this aspect or advance criticism in this regard. Surely that is not true. Surely this is in no way a State corporation. The Post Office budget is introduced in the House every year by the hon. the Minister. Hours are set aside for this purpose. So much so that they do not even have enough speakers to take part in the debate concerned. They had a very difficult time of it this year. They were unable to speak for the full time allocated to them. There was too much time for them in which to level criticism. What was the difficulty? There was nothing to criticize. The affairs and the administration of the Post Office, the Minister&#x2019;s policy and the whole policy of the NP in the service of South Africa was too good and the hon. members opposite did not want to say thank you. They could have devoted half the time to conveying their thanks for the good service provided.</p>

<p>I want to convey my heartfelt thanks to the hon. the Minister and the department for the fine explanatory memorandum provided. I am sorry the hon. member did not thank the hon. the Minister for this. I should have liked him to do so. The explanatory memorandum facilitates the task of the Opposition. There are so few of them that they are very hard put to it to inspect the legislation and make speeches about it. Now the hon. the Minister comes along and helps them to this extent. All that remains is for him to write their speeches for them. This memorandum contains all the explanations required. Although the hon. member did not do so, I hope that the next speaker will thank the hon. the Minister for this. In fact, I shall thank the department and the hon. the Minister for this memorandum on their behalf. It helps the Opposition a great deal that these matters are set out so clearly in the memorandum. I am very pleased, too, that we have this Post Office Amendment Bill before us this evening, because all the provisions which are necessary for the Post Office and in accordance with which the Post Office has to run its affairs, are lucidly set out in one Bill. As hon. members will know, some of the Acts relating to the Post Office have virtually been repealed in their entirety as a result of all those sections that have been replaced. I want to ask the hon. the Minister please to introduce a consolidating measure, not next year, but in 1978. That would give this piece of legislation a full year in which to be implemented. In the course of the year we shall be able to identify any remaining difficulties to be ironed out. Perhaps we shall also have to come up with amendments. As far as this is concerned, I want to invite the Opposition to come up with recommendations and criticism in the year that lies ahead so that we may further improve this Bill. If it should appear to be necessary at that stage, we could then effect the amendments in question in 1978 when we consolidate this legislation. However, I want to predict now that we shall have no recommendations or amendments from the Opposition because they will not find any weakness in this Bill.</p>

<p>I took it upon myself to go into this matter thoroughly and even though this legislation is complicated, the Minister and his department have thought far ahead. Nowadays we cannot afford to waste or fritter away the time of this House and in this connection I want to draw the attention of the House to one minor matter, viz. that the Part Appropriation, for example, can now be eliminated to some extent. I have pointed out in the past that unnecessary overlapping sometimes occurs in this House. For example, the same matters are simply repeated in the no-confidence debate and in a series of other debates. This Bill now entails the benefit that the Part Appropriation can be eliminated and only the main budget submitted to the House. In my opinion this is a very positive step in the right direction. In conclusion, I just want to say to the hon. member for Wynberg that in spite of the criticism he levelled at the Post Office and in spite of the comparison he drew with America, I do not want to draw any further comparisons. However, it would do the hon. member good to take an unprejudiced look, for a change, at the services provided by the Post Office and at the finances of the Post Office, and to compare them impartially with the position in other countries. We do not deny that the Post Office is experiencing problems in South Africa. For example, distances in South Africa are five times as great as in European countries. However, when we compare the Post Office with the Post Offices of other countries in the world on that basis, ours is one of the best in <span class="col_7691-7692" refersTo="page_1176"/>the world. In conclusion I once again want to thank the hon. the Minister for this legislation.</p>

<p>We are going to support the Bill because, unlike the official Opposition who appear to see it as a very negative and evil thing with the prime purpose of making money out of the poor South Africans, I think that that is not the prime purpose of this Bill if one studies it very carefully. If one studies the Bill, one sees that it is obviously an endeavour to provide the Postmaster-General and his entire staff with the management means in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Post Office and also to improve the services which it renders to the South African public. I hope that that is so. I think that if one looks at all the provisions contained in the Bill, one finds that that is clearly what the aim was of the people who drafted the Bill.</p>

<p>I think that the Post Office in South Africa today renders a very large range of extremely important and significant services to South Africa and its people. I want to say immediately that in many respects the Post Office has not yet achieved the level of efficiency and service we should like to see. It is our job from time to time to point out to the hon. the Minister where the Post Office is failing and where it can bring about improvements to its services. I think that this particular Bill was drawn up to give further powers, further tools, further management means to the Post Office to achieve a better service and higher levels of ability and efficiency. Mr. Speaker, I believe it is important that, where efficient management is wanted, managers must be given the means to provide that efficient management. One must give them the power they require; one must give them the power to delegate; one must give them the authority and responsibility which they require. However, one very important point is that when one has entrusted to one&#x2019;s top managers&#x2014;and after all, the people who run the Post Office are top management people in South Africa&#x2014;these powers and these responsibilities, as well as this authority, one is entitled to call them to account for their performance. I believe that our job this evening in this House is to entrust to the Post Office and to its officials the powers for which they have asked, to show confidence in them, to wish them the best in the carrying out of these duties and responsibilities, and to make it very clear that, as far as the services that they render and as far as the efficiency of those services are concerned, we in this House will call them to account as regards their performance, from time to time when the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg was very concerned and distraught at the fact that the word &#x201C;profit&#x201D; appears in this Bill. I do not believe that it is the primary intention of this Bill in any way to make of the Post Office a profit-making organization. The primary responsibility of the Post Office is to provide efficient services at the lowest possible rates to South Africa, its people, its industry and its commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not talking rubbish! The hon. member for Constantia, who is the finance spokesman in this House for a party which is supposed to stand for free enterprise, says it is nonsense to say that a profit incentive&#x2014;and I was going to say it before he opened his mouth&#x2014;is an incentive for higher efficiency, and, in fact, can lead to the reduction of costs &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the concept, in the first instance, of having a profit on one&#x2019;s balance sheet is the opposite of having a loss and it is true to say that in any organization, irrespective of what that organization is, if the concept of a profit is being introduced&#x2014;obviously it is not the primary consideration, but it is a concept and a consideration nevertheless&#x2014;it can, and we hope it will, lead to the inspiring of the organization and of its people to reach higher levels of efficiency. It can also&#x2014;this has been proved on numerous occasions&#x2014;reduce costs to the customers of an organization. I do believe and I do hope that this is the intention of the hon. the Minister in bringing this Bill before the House.</p>

<p>I also believe that the objection to the provision for reasonable reserves is not a valid one, because any organization, once again, is entitled to produce reasonable reserves for that organization in order to stabilize the services that are rendered, and in order to stabilize expenditure. Provided the hon. the Minister is sincere when he says &#x201C;reasonable reserves&#x201D;, and provided he is sincere when he says that the primary aim is not to make a profit but to provide service, I believe we should go along with what the hon. the Minister has put forward in this Bill. Of course, we must retain for ourselves the right, on behalf of the South African people, to call the hon. the Minister and his department to account in respect of the performance and the service that they deliver and in terms of the rights and the powers which we have extended to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the new section 2(2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Postmaster-General shall have the supervision and control of all persons in the service of the department and all post offices and other offices or work-places of the department &#x2026;</block>

<p>I believe that the words &#x201C;shall have the supervision&#x201D; is possibly not very good English, and that it should read: &#x201C;The Postmaster-General shall supervise control and exercise responsibility &#x2026;&#x201D;I think the word &#x201C;responsibility&#x201D; should be included, because I believe that authority without responsibility is unacceptable. It is actually the responsibility and the accountability which is important as far as this Bill is concerned. Certainly, this Bill gives the Postmaster-General and his staff very wide powers; extended and additional powers.</p>

<p>I believe, as I have said previously, that that is vitally important in order to give the Postmaster-General and his staff the opportunity of providing a more efficient service. This will in fact give them the chance to streamline the organization much further than they have done already. The important point is that decisions will be taken much faster, much more effectively and will come into effect faster as a result of the additional powers which have been extended to the Postmaster-General and his staff in respect of this particular provision.</p>

<p>I would like to say, with regard to the fees, rates and charges&#x2014;as provided for in the proposed new section 2B(1)(e)&#x2014;that I hope that it is again the intention of the hon. the Minister and of his department to apply the utmost discretion in the raising of fees, rates and charges, and that at all times the attempt will be made to avoid at all costs the increasing of such fees and charges, particularly bearing in mind the effect which such charges have on the inflationary spiral in South Africa. Because it is a service to commerce and to industry, it is of necessity so that when fees and charges are raised in basic services to commerce and industry, such increases must result in increased costs to the consumers of South Africa as a whole and will therefore contribute to inflation. Therefore I hope that the hon. the Minister, the Postmaster-General and his department, and all the people to whom he delegates this authority, will apply the utmost discretion and the utmost caution before such increases are considered or <span class="col_7695-7696" refersTo="page_1178"/>brought about. The following provision on which I should like to comment is the proposed new section 2B(m) where the following words appear in line 35&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Vary or cancel a contract to the detriment of the department.</block>

<p>I should like to suggest that the hon. the Minister should consider the following wording&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Vary or cancel a contract which is to the detriment of the department.</block>

<p>Then the next provision I should like to comment on&#x2014;and I should like to comment on it by way of approval&#x2014;is the proposed new section 2(C) which states that: &#x201C;The Postmaster-General may in his discretion approve the write-off of the whole or any portion of an amount owing to the department by any person, if he is satisfied that the recovery of the amount would cause undue hardship to the debtor&#x201D; or that the assets of the debtor or in the estate of the debtor would adversely or detrimentally affect the person. I think it is important that we should approve of this humanitarian provision in this Bill, and it is important to me certainly, as it is pleasing to know, that the department, in introducing this legislation, did in fact give thought and consideration to the effect that these provisions may have on people who are destitute and who certainly cannot afford to be subjected to these provisions. The proposed new section 2(D)(2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Postmaster-General shall not be divested of any power delegated by him and may amend or withdraw any decision made in the exercise of that power.</block>

<p>I have difficulty in regard to this particular provision, namely that if a power is delegated to any particular official and that official, in terms of that power, negotiates with another party, certain agreements being reached based on those negotiations, it would possibly be unfair and unwise of the Postmaster-General to have the power to amend or withdraw any decision made in the exercising of that power. If that provision is allowed to stand, a person who has made a contract, or has reached an agreement, in terms of a provision of a service by the department to him or his organization, the Postmaster-General is empowered to withdraw that decision. This could severely prejudice the third party who made that agreement with the Post Office. I believe there should be some further thinking, in regard to that provision, in order to avoid the difficulties or the prejudice which could result from the summary withdrawal of such a decision.</p>

<p>Then we come to chapter II and the proposed new section 12(A), where we deal with what might be described as a statement of the policy of the department, a statement which the hon. member for Wynberg thought was very important. This proposed new section states that &#x201C;the affairs of the department shall be administered on business principles &#x2026;&#x201D; I think that is important because this is what this Bill is all about. The intention and the purpose is that this department should operate on sound business principles. One cannot, however, instruct an organization to operate on sound business principles if one does not, at the same time, hand to that organization the management tools and the powers enabling it to operate on sound business principles, and with due regard being had to the promotion, by means of efficient postal and communications services, of commerce, industry and agriculture in all parts of the Republic and the promotion of the Republic&#x2019;s foreign exchange.</p>

<p>Here I would like to say, as I said at the outset, that by no means has the Post Office at this stage achieved the efficiency or the level of service which is needed by the fast-growing South African economy. There are still large backlogs with regard to telephone services, and there are still a large number of problems being experienced by telephone users, particularly by the one-man business operators who operate from their homes and people like nurses and doctors who perform essential services. These people need a telephone but cannot get one. I do not wish to expand on this, but I want to urge to the hon. the Minister that it is absolutely essential that he should give urgent attention to the improvement particularly of the telephone services in those areas where the telephone services are a vital aspect of the daily life of the people concerned. I refer to small businesses and to people who require the telephone either for their business, for health reasons or for any other <i>bona fide</i> reasons.</p>

<p>I should like to make use of this opportunity to reply to an offer which was made previously by the Government to myself and to the hon. <span class="col_7697-7698" refersTo="page_1179"/>member for Randburg at the time. The hon. the Minister said that he was prepared to take steps to eliminate the backlog of telephone applications in Soweto, provided that I and the hon. member for Sandton would be prepared to forego the installation of backlog-services in our constituencies. I think it is most important that we state very clearly what our attitude is in regard to the provision of services for all South Africans. My party&#x2019;s attitude is simply that every single applicant for a telephone service or any other service provided by the Government must be treated on the merits of his application without any regard whatsoever to the race, colour or creed of the applicant concerned. In other words, we believe that all applications for telephone services, whether they come from Soweto, Bryanston or anywhere else in the country, should be treated by the hon. the Minister and his department on a colour-blind basis. They should not see or consider the colour of the applicant when they consider the application. I certainly hope that in future the hon. the Minister and his department, in considering applications for services of this nature, will not differentiate in any way between the various race groups, but that they will demonstrate that they are prepared to provide a service on a non-discriminatory basis and purely on the merits of the applications.</p>

<p>The proposed new section 12C is a provision I should like to approve of. It introduces the principle that all State departments who obtain services from the Post Office, should pay their way. I think it is important that we should indicate that it is something of which we approve. The proposed new section 12F(3) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may approve that a saving on an amount which in respect of any financial year has been appropriated by a Post Office Appropriation Act for a specific purpose, be applied towards the defrayal of excess expenditure for any other purpose or purposes for which an amount or amounts have been so appropriated.</block>

<p>I think there is a difficulty and a danger here, because one might have a large saving on a very large amount that has been voted. That money is then available to be appropriated in respect of any other matter for which money has to be voted, and for which very little has been made available. I think one has the difficulty here that since an indiscretion could be committed in the appropriation of such excess funds, it might be necessary for the hon. the Minister to consider, when excess funds are reallocated, a percentage of the vote to which they are reallocated&#x2014;whatever the percentage may be&#x2014;as the maximum additional funds that can be allocated to such a vote. In terms of the proposed new section 12F(4) and (5) provision is also made for additional expenditure of funds. I think it must be clear&#x2014;I hope the hon. the Minister will confirm that it is clear&#x2014;that this will happen only in exceptional circumstances and that there will be a justification for the allocation of such additional funds.</p>

<p>I see that the hon. the Minister restricts the additional overall expenditure of funds to 2%. I think that an allowance of an additional 2% on a very large provision of funds, is very responsible and modest. I think the hon. the Minister may find that in times to come that may not be sufficient and that he may have to increase it to 5% for instance.</p>

<p>Then, the proposed new section 12F(6) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Particulars of amounts spent under authority in terms of subsection (5) and of the purposes for which the amounts have been spent shall be submitted to Parliament by the Minister &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, the Minister will report to Parliament such additional expenditure. I should like the hon. the Minister to consider the extension of subsection (6) to cover also the provisions in subsections (3) and (4) and not only those in subsection (5).</p>

<p>A number of provisions in this Bill deal with the handling of the finances of the Post Office and the investment of the funds of the Post Office. I think it is important that the utmost degree of control and also morality should be applied by the department in the handling of the finances such as who will handle it where funds of the department will be invested. I say this because, inherent in these provisions, there is the danger, at least, of a charge being made that preferential investment of funds can be made by the Post Office and that preferential contracting can take place with regard to who will handle the financial affairs of the Post Office. I think the hon. the Minister should consider the possibility of cycling the handling and investing of <span class="col_7699-7700" refersTo="page_1180"/>finance between institutions, or spreading the handling or investing of funds amongst institutions.</p>

<p>The proposed new section 12R(5) deals with a person employed by the Post Office who caused the department any loss or damage for a number of reasons. As I read the reasons why a person can be acted against, it would appear that theft is excluded. By and large it is because of the omission of the regulations or the non-compliance with the requirements of the job that such a person can be acted against in a certain manner. What I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us is what provisions are made in the case of an employee or ex-employee who is found to have transgressed in this manner. Will he have the opportunity of what we call a fair hearing? In other words, will he appear before a board or committee with an opportunity of being represented and with an opportunity to answer any charges laid against him? Once again, it is a humanitarian and very good discretion that the postmaster can decide not to act against such a person or to penalize him. I also believe that it is a good thing that such a person can appeal to the Minister and to a court of law if he feels that he has been further wronged by such action.</p>

<p>Apart from the reservations which we have and the questions we have asked, we believe the Bill is by and large a good one providing the means and the machinery for the department to carry out its work in a more efficient and more effective way in the interests of all its customers. We hope the hon. the Minister will be able to report that that is, in fact, the case when next he reports to the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to reply briefly to what was said by the hon. member for Sunnyside. He said that the hon. member for Wynberg deems it advisable for the Post Office to show a loss every year. The hon. member for Wynberg has never suggested anything of the kind. He simply said that he cannot see why it is necessary for the Post Office to have to show an exorbitant profit. If the hon. member for Sunnyside is so sensitive about the word &#x201C;profit&#x201D;, why has the word &#x201C;surplus&#x201D; not been used in the Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member what the difference is between profit and surplus?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question, because my time has already been curtailed. The hon. member also referred to the fact that he was unable to make a telephone call during the 1948 election. I want to remind the hon. member that the position has certainly not improved a great deal. When an hon. Senator stood for elections in Durban North, he was probably unable to use a telephone either. He had to send telegrams. A great number of telegrams have been sent and that costs a great deal of money. The hon. member said that it is easy to make a telephone call to New York these days. I challenge him to try and make a telephone call to Somerset West any evening during the week.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Bryanston has apparently not read the legislation. He may have read the memorandum, but he certainly did not read the legislation. How he can say that he is very hopeful that services will be provided at a lower cost, I do not know. There is no mention of that in the Bill. The hon. member also said that there is need for efficient management in the Post Office. We did not know that there was a need for more efficient management in the Post Office. We are very pleased with the management in the Post Office. We think it is of the highest quality. Whatever fault we have to find with the legislation is not in regard to the management of the Post Office.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of a free enterprise system. I do not know how the hon. member can speak of a free enterprise system when he speaks about the Post Office. In a free enterprise system there must be competition, but the Post Office is one of the most monopolistic enterprises in South Africa. Therefore, I do not see how he can speak about a free enterprise system.</p>

<p>The proposed section 12A, as set out in clause 5 of the Bill, essentially makes provision for operating on business principles. We have no quarrel with that as long as it is done in a businesslike manner. However, we become frightened when these businesslike principles are coupled with profits and the profits are coupled with reasonable reserves. We wonder why so much emphasis is placed on the profits the Post Office must now suddenly show. When one runs a monopoly there is a tendency to increase charges. There <span class="col_7701-7702" refersTo="page_1181"/>is no competition to keep costs down. If charges keep on rising and one has to show a profit, who will pay for this in the end? Will it be the user of telephone services, or will it be the general taxpayer? This is what worries us.</p>

<p>We know that some of the services of the Post Office are uneconomic. We are fully aware of this, and it is only right that, for instance, the postal service should not show a profit. In a country such as this, with great distances and large numbers of post offices which are barely running economically, it is hardly possible that the postal services can show a profit. What we are worried about, however, is this: Must the other services of the Post Office carry the uneconomic services? This is what is happening and what has happened in the past. The telecommunications service, which runs at a profit, is being loaded more and more each year in order to carry the losses on these other services. It was avoided this year, and we give full credit to the management and the staff of the Post Office for that. We know that great sacrifices were made, and for this we are very grateful. We feel, however, that as costs rise and escalate, eventually charges will have to go up. Will they go up on the telecommunications side, and will the person who uses the telephone have to pay for all the other uneconomic services? The new section 2B(1)(e), as inserted by clause 3 of the Bill, empowers the Postmaster-General to determine and alter from time to time fees, rates or charges. This is worrying to us, and we wonder whether it is reasonable that the Postmaster-General may, willy-nilly, without giving notice to the general public or the users of the Post Office, increase charges.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not prepared to answer questions at this stage. Let us take the case of a business which relies to a great extent for its advertising on postal services. Such a firm may spend thousands of rand on having pamphlets printed, which they then intend to distribute through the post. Suddenly an increase in postal tariffs is sprung upon them. This is most unfair to that type of business, and I feel that it is only fair that some notice should be given. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will consider introducing into this legislation a provision in terms of which notice must be given in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of the intention of the Postmaster-General to increase certain charges.</p>

<p>I should like to refer also to the provision relating to the Savings Bank. One of the services which the Post Office operates, and which is a very profitable service, is the Savings Bank service. We welcome the proposed changes in this respect. We know that the Post Office virtually has a monopoly in savings bank services, when one compares them with the services of other institutions such as the building societies, because the Post Office can offer attractive features to investors, such as tax-free investments, which the building societies and the banks cannot offer. We have, however, complained in the past that the Post Office does not provide the facilities which these other institutions provide. They have a great advantage over these people, and we feel that they should provide better facilities.</p>

<p>Another provision in the Bill which we find particularly worrying is the new section 53(4), as inserted by clause 18. This new subsection prohibits the paying of interest on that portion of an amount invested in the Post Office which exceeds the maximum amount that one may invest in that particular type of saving. For instance, if you are allowed to invest a maximum of R10 000 in Post Office savings certificates, no interest may be paid on an investment exceeding that amount.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Speaker, I mean the hon. member for Wynberg. The hon. member&#x2019;s long term in the Provincial Council confused me.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is entirely unrealistic. I believe it is common knowledge that my politics and those of the hon. member for Bryanston are poles apart, but as far as this measure is concerned, the hon. member for Bryanston adopted an entirely understandable standpoint this evening. The hon. member adopted a positive approach to the matter. He did not accept everything in the Bill, because he raised points of criticism, and at the Committee Stage he will come back to them again. The hon. member wants certain replies from me, but at the moment I do not have sufficient time in which to answer him. However, I hope we shall be able to iron out these matters at the Committee Stage. The hon. member said that there was no reason why he and his party should not support the Second Reading of this Bill. The hon. member therefore adopted a positive approach to the measure and I appreciate that. We shall discuss the points raised by him again at a later stage.</p>

<p>What is the effect of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Wynberg? The hon. member does not want the Bill to progress further than the Second Reading. In other words, everything that is good in the Bill must be wiped out. I want to repeat that the amendment moved by the hon. member is unrealistic. The amendment maintains that the Postmaster-General is now being authorized to increase rates and recover moneys contrary to the public interest. The hon. member for Sunnyside quoted the provision which determines how the Post Office has to manage its affairs. That provision expressly states that it must be run on business principles and in the interest of all the sectors mentioned in it, even the most far-off places. How can the two standpoints be reconciled with each other? The Post Office is compelled by law to fulfil certain functions and it will have to fulfil them, or else it will be called to account in Parliament.</p>

<p>The second part of the amendment by the hon. member for Wynberg concerns steps or movements in the direction of a state corporation. I do not think he could motivate that claim even in the wildest flights of his imagination. We are dealing here with measures which, as the hon. member for Bryanston said, are calculated to enable the Post Office to provide the service we expect it to provide. That is why I say that to me, the standpoint of the PRP is more positive and acceptable than the negative standpoint of the UP. The correct standpoint would have been to deal with this Second Reading quickly in the limited time at our disposal so that we could discuss these different points further at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg said that he expected me to make a statement here about my policy for the Post Office. Where have you ever heard such foolishness? A few weeks ago <span class="col_7705-7706" refersTo="page_1183"/>I introduced the main budget of the Post Office here. That was the opportunity for me to state my standpoint as a Minister handling the portfolio for the first time. I did so. At that stage I said what I was going to do and what I envisaged doing. In fact, I did so at the start of my budget speech. Now, while we are considering our amending legislation, the hon. member asks me to begin with a statement of policy. Never in my life or in my experience in this hon. House have I ever heard such a standpoint. I am therefore not going to repeat what I said in the budget debate. I indicated at that time what my policy was and the Act lays down the guide-lines to be followed by the Post Office and by me.</p>

<p>Whereas so much has been said this evening about the profits and the reasonable reserves of the Post Office, I find it quite striking&#x2014;I want to say that it is ironical&#x2014;that in the very year in which the Post Office has achieved its highest productivity, a year which the officials of the Post Office themselves declared a productivity year, and a year in which it is in fact the only one of the three branches of the national economy which has not increased its rates, the charge should be now levelled by the Opposition that we want to make profits, and do so in such a way that the public will suffer, and that we want to retain reserves to which we are not entitled. As far as this matter is concerned there is no alteration whatsoever in the approach adopted by the Post Office. There can be no difference in its approach. The task of the Post Office as prescribed to it by law is to provide a service to the widest possible public on a business footing, in accordance with business principles. I have pointed out, with reference to the comparison with other countries drawn by the hon. member for Wynberg on the basis of the number of Post Offices they have per surface unit, that our Post Office provides services in very sparsely populated areas of the country, services on which we can make no profit whatsoever. In fact, we provide the services at a heavy loss. Because this is our task, however, we continue to provide those services, as we must. Hon. members who have complained about the closing of a few post offices must not adopt a simplistic approach to the matter. Surely there are also limits to what one can do and what one cannot do. This, too, we must take into account.</p>

<p>As far as the motive of service of the Post Office is concerned, there is no change in its policy whatsoever. We are continuing as in the past and I concede to the hon. member for Bryanston that there are still backlogs, that there are long waiting lists for telephones and that there are many other deficiencies, too. I concede this, but I say that we must see those shortcomings in perspective, too, and must acknowledge that we have made good progress. A great deal has been said about the aspects of profits. However, it is not the aim of the Post Office to profiteer. It goes without saying that the Post Office must strive to cover its costs as far as possible. However, there is no question of profiteering. The motive of service is put first, and we have to try to reconcile it with the other motive. The Franzsen Commission which investigated the financing of the Post Office made it very clear that the Post Office should strive to finance 50% of its services from its own resources and 50% from loans. If the Post Office had to borrow a mere 25% or 30% of its capital and obtain all the rest from its rates and other services, then I would say the Post Office would be acting contrary to the interests of the public, as the hon. member wanted to suggest by way of his amendment here this afternoon. However, as long as there are indications that we are moving in the direction of a 50-50 ratio&#x2014; which we have not even achieved yet&#x2014;then there is no danger of interests being prejudiced. Without this legislation before us, the Post Office could continue rendering its services for a long time, because this Bill contains measures which, for the most part, already appear in other legislation. However, many of those provisions are obsolete and there is also doubt as to the legal interpretation of certain of those measures. This has to be rectified as the hon. member for Bryanston said, in order to enable the Post Office to provide the services which it wishes to, and must, provide.</p>

<p>Section 2(2) of the Post Office Readjustment Act which was passed in 1968 and in accordance with which the Post Office still functions, enables the Post Office by implication to have reserves. This has been the interpretation since 1968. The hon. member can shake his head if he wants to. Apparently he never bothered about this before when he <span class="col_7707-7708" refersTo="page_1184"/>was in the Provincial Council. Now that he has become the chief spokesman on his side, however, he is acting very crafty.</p>

<p>I challenge the hon. member to prove that this is not so in later debates. The Auditor-General has not said that this is an incorrect interpretation. The legal advisers, too, adopted the same standpoints as the Post Office. However, the Auditor-General requested that this matter be rectified in the legislation at present before us to eliminate doubt. That is why the provision is in this Bill; not because there has been a change in policy. I repeat that, even if this measure were rejected, the Post Office would still be able to continue to do its work as in the past. However, this point will crop up again in meetings of Select Committees and in discussions in this House. It goes without saying that there is still a great deal to be said about the matter of rates and reserves, and that there are various other points, too, which have been raised, but since we are called upon to vote on the amendment this evening, I must let those aspects stand over for discussions at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Vote No. 15 and S.W.A. Vote No. 8.&#x2014; &#x201C;Social Welfare and Pensions&#x201D;:</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I ask the privilege of the half-hour. It goes without saying that this Vote is indeed a very important one, not only by virtue of the fact that it comprises the sum of R324 million, but also by virtue of the fact of the large number of people involved, people who, in many cases, have to look to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions for their livelihood and for relief in times of economic stress. It also gives us an opportunity to look at the policy of the hon. the Minister and that of his new deputy concerning the overall welfare planning in South Africa. We know that there have been some vast changes over the past few decades in respect of welfare services, particularly as a result of the industrialization of a young country such as South Africa.</p>

<p>If we look at the challenges that this country has to face during the second half of this decade, we soon realize that as a young, industrialized country, there are many aspects of social welfare that requires the urgent attention of the Government. We know that it is the policy of the Government, as it is of the Official Opposition, that we have a free enterprise economy, and consequently our welfare services and social security services have to be balanced so as to maintain a situation where free enterprise and the initiative of the individual can be assured. We have to guard against the possibility of becoming a welfare State. We on this side of the House consider this to be an important aspect in considering the policy as far as social welfare is concerned. If one looks at the situation as it is today, it becomes increasingly obvious that to maintain a balanced situation, the Government will have to give urgent attention to welfare planning on a wide and comprehensive scale so as to ensure that the country is ready to meet the demands that are made upon it as welfare services have to be rendered to an increasing number of persons. It is interesting to note that the Secretary of Social Welfare and Pensions in his latest annual report indicated the necessity to give urgent attention to the whole aspect of welfare planning. We welcome the frank manner in which this annual report was drawn up. We realize the difficulties in which he is involved, being responsible, as the head of the department, for an adequate welfare service being rendered to the people for which his department is responsible.</p>

<p>It is, however, apparent that the Government is giving attention to the overall question of welfare planning and we on this side of the House would like to see the Government expedite its inquiries and investigations to ensure that the correct planning is undertaken at this stage. It also becomes obvious, as far as the welfare services are concerned, that there are various shortcomings. We know that there is a multiplicity of welfare organizations&#x2014; something like 2 000 of them&#x2014;and in certain regional areas there is a lack of co-ordination as far as welfare services are concerned and <span class="col_7711-7712" refersTo="page_1186"/>we know that greater efforts will have to be made to ensure that there is not wasted effort in this field. It also is apparent that with the demand that is made on the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions for its professional services, such as probation officers and qualified social workers, great steps will have to be made to ensure that there is an adequate number of social workers to meet the needs. Reading the reports of various welfare organizations, it soon becomes apparent that a shortage of qualified staff is one of the inhibiting factors in providing an adequate service as far as these welfare organizations are concerned. Because of this situation, it is obvious that the Government and the department will have to intensify the use of voluntary social workers by the training of such workers by means of in-service training in the various agencies under the guidance and with the assistance of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions.</p>

<p>I am aware, as far as the educational aspects are concerned, that it is the responsibility of the hon. the Minister of National Education. However, as far as the voluntary social workers are concerned, a great deal more can be achieved with in-service training and by the assistance that can be rendered to the agencies to bring about a situation where voluntary social workers can play an even more important part in the welfare services that have to be rendered. That is why the whole question of the shortage of professional staff is of such great importance. We know that legislation that has been passed in this House from time to time requiring reports of probation officers and reports of social workers as far as criminal cases are concerned, can have a very real effect on the effective and successful rehabilitation of some of those who have fallen foul of the law. Therefore welfare planning should aim at the creation of the balanced situation which must exist in a free enterprise economy where our welfare services can be adequate to meet these needs. The part that is played by our welfare organizations in this respect is one which requires constant attention and constant review.</p>

<p>There is a section in the department dealing with the care of the aged, and I have a few words to say in regard to this particular aspect. But before doing so, I would like to refer particularly to a certain category and type of person in respect of whom it appears that steps will have to be taken by the Government&#x2014;if necessary by the introduction of legislation&#x2014; to meet their requirements. I refer here to the position of the problem aged. There was a case in Durban some months ago of a widow who was evicted from her home which was subsequently sold by auction for a sum of just over R2 000 although the rateable municipal evaluation of that property was approximately R7 000. All this was due to the fact that the widow had not paid the rates. This amounted to some R92. Consequently it was necessary for an eviction order to be issued and carried out. Subsequently it was ascertained by welfare workers that this person had not been prepared to accept the assistance and guidance that had been offered her.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the term &#x201C;problem aged&#x201D; pertains to a certain group of people who are unable to care for themselves or look after their properties and who require some sort of protection. In terms of the situation that now exists the social worker is almost powerless to assist such a person who will not be taken under the wing of any other social services and who will not be admitted to a home for the aged. If one looks at the definition of &#x201C;problem aged&#x201D;, one sees that it means a mentally ill, aged person who endangers his own life and property or that of other people, a person in respect of whom an application for certification has failed; a person dependent on alcohol or drugs who could not be committed to a rehabilitation centre or who is not accepted into any other institution or home with a view to care or treatment; a person with serious personality problems who refuses help and makes it impossible to be helped; and a person who is infirm or is incapable of planning for and maintaining himself or herself and whose future welfare is at stake, but who refuses help. It would appear that the hon. the Minister will have to give serious consideration to this particular type of person, persons who are unable to be assisted in terms of our present situation. The hon. the Minister should give consideration to the possibility of introducing legislation in terms of which a social worker should be able to assist such a person. The plight of the particular widow to whom I referred is, of course, indicative of many cases where people live alone and are struggling to exist. These people are the pioneers of this country who now, as result of inflation and <span class="col_7713-7714" refersTo="page_1187"/>economic stress, are unable to cope and require assistance.</p>

<p>Each year when the hon. the Minister of Finance presents his budget, he invariably does make a concession to this group of people and we on this side of the House are indeed grateful for those concessions as are the recipients themselves of those concessions. However, it appears to be the present policy of the Government merely to grant certain relief to certain groups of people year by year without producing any overall plan to bring about the improved conditions which are so necessary in caring for the aged in particular. That is why it is rather disappointing that, in spite of the concessions granted, the increase in the pension of R8 a month as far as Whites are concerned, is only to be effective from 1 October. These people are having a tremendous struggle to exist. This was indicated to me fairly recently by an aged person who said it was quite likely that he might not even live until 1 October to receive that extra monthly income. I think we have to find some other basis upon which to grant these increases. These increases only apply for half of the financial year. Therefore I wonder whether the hon. the Minister should not, in consultation with the hon. the Minister of Finance, find ways and means of granting these increases at an earlier date.</p>

<p>Similarly, as far as the means test is concerned, the present ceilings have been in operation since 1 October 1972. We all know how the situation has changed as far as the value of money is concerned. Yet the means test has remained unaltered. The question of narrowing the gap between the pensions paid to the Whites and to the other race groups also requires further consideration and attention on the part of the Government. I fully realize that the hon. the Minister in this instance is responsible only for the White social pensioners. Nevertheless the increases granted serve as a guide-line in respect of the pensions of the other racial groups.</p>

<p>Then there are those persons who are specifically precluded from receiving any assistance but who we feel should receive some assistance. I refer particularly to the civil pensioners and the railway pensioners who are receiving minimum pensions. If these persons&#x2019; financial position is within the means test, they are specifically precluded from receiving a social pension. However, a person who receives a pension from a private source or a private pension fund is entitled to receive a social pension if the pension which he receives from that private source is on the same level or even if it is bigger than the pension of the civil or railway pensioner. By virtue of the fact that the means test remains unaltered, we have a situation developing that because the minimum basic pension will be R32 per month as from 1 October, a greater gap will be created between those who just qualify and those who just fail to qualify. It will also mean that those persons who receive a slight increase in their private pension will in most cases be worse off by virtue of the fact that while the minimum basic pension will be R32 per month they will receive nothing because they fall outside the means test.</p>

<p>This all leads to the matter which I should like to discuss with the hon. the Minister. I refer to the investigation in connection with a contributory pension scheme because many of the problems which I have mentioned could be overcome if we could have a system whereby all persons of all races belong to a pension fund or pension schemes which will allow them to qualify for a pension when they reach their retirement age. They will not have a means test and all the other administrative difficulties that are presently involved applicable to them. We believe that a contributory pension scheme could have three advantages. The first advantage will be that more funds could become available to pay for better pensions.</p>

<p>The second advantage will be the abolition of the means test with the phasing in of a contributory pension scheme for all. The third advantage will be that the disparity could be eliminated which exists at present between the various race groups because the benefits could then be related to contributions which have been paid and the level of income to a certain minimum or maximum so that all could then receive a pension on a basis related to the level of income of the contributors. The difficulty experienced with the discriminatory basis of awarding pensions to the various race groups could then be eliminated. We should therefore like to hear from the hon. the Minister what progress has been made in this regard. We did hear in the 1974 session that he was going to have such an investigation conducted and we should now like to hear what steps have been <span class="col_7715-7716" refersTo="page_1188"/>achieved and what further steps are contemplated.</p>

<p>Having dealt with some of the persons who have reached the twilight of their life, I should now like to refer to child welfare and the breaking down of family life. We know that four commissions are provided for in terms of the National Welfare Act. One of those commissions is the Family Life Commission which has considered various aspects of family life. The latest report of the National Welfare Board refers to certain tasks undertaken by the Family Life Commission. Mention is also made of the possibility of a draft policy for family life. I believe this requires urgent attention because if one considers the situation in South Africa one sees a deteriorating situation developing. We find various aspects of child welfare work being hindered as a result of the situation developing because of the breakdown in family life. The various welfare agencies which care for children are finding not only a breakdown in family life caused by economic stress, but they also have to cope with the after-effects of a high rate of divorce and other problems such as alcoholism by one or both parents or deviate behaviour on the part of certain members of a family. All these aspects require considerable attention.</p>

<p>There is also a new syndrome developing in South Africa, that of child abuse and the death of young infants. We find that this situation is one which has received the attention of some of the welfare agencies and I refer specifically to the Durban area because I understand that this is the only area where they are endeavouring to obtain a register so as to ascertain the severity of the problem and what steps can be taken against these people. I am quite sure that the hon. the Minister must have received similar letters that I have received from indignant people who are most concerned at the fact that such light penalties are imposed in regard to cases of child abuse. We find that in some cases suspended sentences are imposed and it even happened that a mere fine of R50 was imposed notwithstanding the fact that a child was battered to death by a parent. This position is causing a great deal of concern, not only in South Africa but also overseas, as this is not something which is peculiar to South Africa. In some countries overseas, however, we do find that it is necessary for registers to be kept for cases of assault in certain instances. In America and Great Britain these registers are used to assist in field work in diagnosis, treatment, planning and prevention. It has also been found that such registers are useful in the identification of multiple abuse within the same family, or in the development of an intervention and treatment programme. They have also proved useful in providing a basis for the further definition of the problem and educating the public about the nature and the extent of the problem. One therefore sees that there are numerous factors involved.</p>

<p>We know that as a result of the economic stress in many families there are an increasing number of mothers who have to seek employment. There are also an increasing number of mothers who seek guidance and assistance at the various welfare agencies, and they have to be provided with professional, expert guidance. Other difficulties, as we are aware, are also involved. In some cases the mother is psychologically disturbed, or again the children themselves may be psychologically disturbed and could be developing symptoms that would need psychiatric treatment. These children require urgent assistance, as do the parents.</p>

<p>An increasing number of children are being admitted to children&#x2019;s homes because they are in need of care. There are about 10 000 children in the approximately 100 children&#x2019;s homes which this department is responsible for. These children&#x2019;s homes are at full capacity and it is not possible for more children to be admitted. This results in many children having to remain for lengthy periods in various places of safety, this certainly being to the detriment of those children. Therefore it is obvious that the whole question of family life should be urgently looked into and a policy for improving family conditions drawn up. We know that there are children for whom accommodation has to be found whilst their working mothers take up employment. There have consequently been many calls for additional cr&#x00E8;ches or places of care where the children of working mothers can be taken care of. I believe the department does allocate funds and provide advice and guidance in this regard. I think greater attention should be given, however, to ascertaining whether it is not possible for industry, commerce and other sectors, which employ numbers of working mothers, to also play a part in the establishment of these care centres and cr&#x00E8;ches so that the children of <span class="col_7717-7718" refersTo="page_1189"/>these working mothers may be cared for while the mothers are at work.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to indicate some of the spheres to which we on this side of the House believe the Government must give urgent attention. We have tried to indicate matters concerning policy, and in the course of this discussion the hon. the Minister will have the opportunity of putting before this Committee his and the Government&#x2019;s policy to meet some of these challenges. The situation that is now developing certainly requires the urgent attention of the hon. the Minister, the hon. the Deputy Minister and the department. They must see that the challenges are met to ensure that the welfare of the people of South Africa is maintained at a high level.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mclachlan">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. McLACHLAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member covered a fairly wide field and consequently one can hardly react to everything he said. However, I want to express my concern about one thing he said, and I hope it was not exactly what he meant. He referred to the use of voluntary female welfare workers as a result of the shortage of professional welfare workers. I hope he does not mean that the place of the professional social worker is to be undermined because in all other professions, professionalism is being stressed more and more strongly, and I believe that this is equally necessary in social work.</p>

<p>I should like to refer, too, to the report of the department which has been put at our disposal. We should have liked to have a more recent report, since the department does such a comprehensive and such a fine job and since we are aware of the dedication with which its officials carry out their task. That is why one would like to have the very latest data when the activities of this department come under discussion. In the annual report before us there is one specific paragraph in which, unfortunately, an incorrect impression has been created among outsiders. In my opinion it is necessary for attention to be drawn to this because the Press, too, has not failed to spot that specific paragraph. In referring to the importance of planning, the report refers to the welfare organizations which are being allowed to proliferate. Reference is also made to the fact that there are small groups of people who are motivated, supposedly, by welfare work and consequently are allowed to establish their own puppet kingdoms at will. Mention is also made of people who are so inspired by their social work that for the sake of their own egos, they refuse to join forces in the interests of social work.</p>

<p>I know that these are hard words and that they do perhaps apply to the exceptions. However one must be careful not to make a rule of the exceptions in this case. Since it is possible that the impression has been created among outsiders that these words may have been intended as a dig at the voluntary welfare organizations, I, as a member of the National Welfare Board and of its commissions for a number of years, should like to attest to the fact that the department has at all times given its utmost co-operation, and expressed its confidence in, those voluntary welfare organizations. On the other hand, I can also attest to the way in which those welfare organizations have co-operated with the National Welfare Board at various levels when the Board has requested their co-operation, particularly with regard to co-ordination.</p>

<p>The impression has been created&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Umbilo also referred to this in passing&#x2014;that there are thousands of welfare organizations. At the moment there are 2 054 registered welfare organizations. Four years ago there were 2 144 registered welfare organizations. Consequently there has been a substantial drop in the number of registered organizations, and not an unreasonable increase. The fact is that many efforts are being made, by the department&#x2019;s regional offices and the regional welfare councils, and by the National Welfare Board, efforts aimed at bringing about co-ordination, particularly when there are people who want to establish an organization, people who really lack a field in which to operate because other bodies are already performing those specific activities.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the impression is created among the public that there is an unhealthy development in this sphere, I want to express my confidence that the hon. the Minister will give us the assurance that what is stated here in the report is not meant in a derogatory way, but is only meant to emphasize the fact of planning. One of the channels through which the department may effect co-ordination is to be found in the department&#x2019;s circular No. 29 of 1966. This circular provides that when a welfare organization is established, the board of directors of that organization will consist of members of the population group which that <span class="col_7719-7720" refersTo="page_1190"/>organization wishes to serve. It has occurred in the past that a White organization has been established but that it has operated exclusively among non-Whites. Furthermore, all the different welfare organizations have often caused a great deal of confusion among the various population groups, particularly with regard to the practical implementation of the activities of the organizations.</p>

<p>Since the policy of this department was laid down in 1966, we can attest to the greatest co-operation we have had from the various organizations. Organizations the boards of directors of which are composed chiefly of Whites, for example, are allowed to establish sub-committees for the other population groups, viz. Indians, Coloureds and Bantu, and in this way, provision is made for the contingency of its being impracticable to establish separate organizations for each of the various population groups. Mention has been made of the more than 2 000 existing welfare organizations, but we must take note of the fact that these organizations do in fact represent the four main population groups, the Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu. This includes South West African statistics and in fact, therefore, we have five provinces. Sometimes we divide this task at the provincial level and this necessarily causes a degree of overlapping. However, I want to give the assurance&#x2014;we have proof of this&#x2014;that in spite of the exceptions and in spite of the occasions on which the co-operation has been somewhat defective, in general we have a fine spirit of co-operation. We would be sorry if the public, which puts millions of rands at the disposal of voluntary welfare services, were perhaps to gain the impression that they could not support these organizations without hesitation or with more goodwill. I want to break a lance for them and trust that the inference drawn from this report is incorrect. I want to express the hope, too, that the time is almost at hand when the various departments concerned with the various population groups will draw a definite dividing line between the various welfare registrations. The time has come for each department to accept responsibility for the welfare organizations under its jurisdiction and even for them to be able to undertake the registration thereof. The foundations have been laid in the present legislation and we trust that in the new legislation, attention will be given to this.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to break a lance for the quadriplegics. I do not know how many of them there are, where they are or what their circumstances are, but we are under the impression that not enough provision is being made for these people. These people are paralysed in their arms and legs and probably led a normal life until an accident deprived them of the use of their legs and arms in one fell swoop. I have reason to believe that notwithstanding the good work being done by our medical practitioners, notwithstanding the major and outstanding task being performed by some of our hospitals and the work done by various welfare organizations, there is nevertheless a large group of people in this category who should be brought to the attention of the hon. the Minister.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must confess that I am a little surprised to find myself speaking at this stage, but seeing that no one else wants to take part in this debate, I should like to bring a number of matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I should like to make a couple of brief references before I come to the main thrust of my speech. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that we appreciated the opportunity to visit some of the various institutions which fall under his direction and control. I particularly want to refer to the outstanding work the department did, in conjunction with other departments, in the caring for refugees. To the officials of the department I should like to say that we appreciate the work they are doing and their readiness to respond to the hundreds and thousands of inquiries that are made.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo has already made reference to the increase given to social pensioners in the budget. I merely want to underline and stress all the points he made. One does not have to argue at great length even to convince the hon. the Minister that of all the people who are in a bad situation at the moment, the aged of our country come to mind first. They and others on fixed incomes are the ones suffering most from the ravages of inflation and the erosion of the value of money. Although one appreciates the increase granted to pensioners, one has also to point out that this is hardly enough to meet the situation. Once again we have to raise the question of the delay between the budget and the actual <span class="col_7721-7722" refersTo="page_1191"/>implementation of the increase. One is aware that there is a computer, that there are many arrangements which have to be made and that there are thousands of pensioners involved. But I am quite sure that it is not beyond the resources of the hon. the Minister and his department to find a way around this. It does seem unreasonable that the aged should have to wait until October before they get the increase which has been announced. The fact of the matter is that there are hundreds and thousands of people in South Africa who cannot afford to retire because of the pensions to which they will be eligible and because of the pensions that fall due to them under the social pension system.</p>

<p>I should also like to stress and underline a further point made by the hon. member for Umbilo, and that is that the means test, which inevitably throws up all kinds of anomalies, must surely be reviewed this year. I do not believe that any legitimate argument can be raised against the need for a review. I hope the hon. the Minister will reply and give encouragement to the thousands of people outside who are affected directly by this.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the widening of the pension gap as between old people of the various race groups. One notes that the amount now is R72 for White pensioners, R38,50 for Coloured and Indian pensioners and R18,50 for African pensioners. This cannot be defended, and one hopes that moving towards the closing of this gap will be accelerated and that it will be done away with altogether in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the question of a national contributory pension scheme. We have heard the various comments the hon. the Minister has made outside the House, comments which I believe only emphasize the need for urgency in this matter. Last year during the debate of this Vote we referred to the need for this. In his reply the hon. the Minister said that once the preliminary investigation had been made, a Select Committee would be set up to look into the whole question. Many months have elapsed since that time, and I hope that there will therefore be an announcement by the hon. the Minister of the appointment of a Select Committee so as to bring this matter to finality. If my figures are right, 66&#x0025;&#x2014;and I think I am now quoting a figure mentioned by the hon. the Minister himself&#x2014;of economically active people who have no pension cover. This is the present situation, and this only emphasizes the urgency of resolving this question of a national contributory scheme. I understand further that a minimum of 30 000 companies provide no pension benefits whatsoever. Reference has been made over the years, and again last year, to the lack of transferability, which creates real problems and direct wastage, to the inadequacy of pensions relative to pre-retirement salaries, and to the fact that pension schemes are in many instances not compulsory.</p>

<p>Various arguments have been advanced against such a national contributory scheme. It has been suggested that the State itself should not be involved in this matter. I believe that this is wrong, and that the State ought to be involved, not so much in terms of making a contribution, but rather in terms of being the midwife through which the coming into being of such a national contributory scheme can be achieved. It has also been suggested that a national scheme of this kind could lead to deferred taxation and that there are problems when it comes to collecting all the contributions, particularly from the lower paid group of workers. On the other hand, however, I believe that the coming into being of such a scheme would eliminate the means test which penalizes the thrifty and encourages the spendthrift, to put it in the words of Mr. Altman, that it would eliminate the race discrimination which exists at present in this field, that it would solve the problem of transferability when employees change their jobs, that it would ease the burden on the State, and that such a compulsory pension plan would ensure that the maximum number of people would have some provision for their post-retirement years. This would in fact assist the State enormously, but much more important, perhaps&#x2014;or at least as important&#x2014;is that it would assist and encourage and in fact make compulsory at least some measure of provision for those people who reach their retirement years.

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>I say I am amazed because I was only supposed to enter the debate much later, and therefore I am very grateful for the opportunity of speaking now. Sir, it is quite clear that the hon. members opposite realize that I am talking sense. I shall therefore do my best to continue along those lines.</p>

<p>One of the major questions which we have looked at over the years is the care of the aged&#x2014;and I speak now not specifically of pensions. The Secretary of the department some time ago was reported in the Press as having a master plan to help the aged. Unless it has escaped my attention, there has not been a report of any follow-up to that. The Secretary did, however, go on to talk about &#x201C;going to where the needy aged live and to draw up in-depth studies of what is needed, enabling regional welfare boards to play a much more dynamic role in the welfare services of the community&#x201D;. This, I believe, is a very important statement, and I do hope that the hon. the Minister will tell us a little more about this master plan. It is certainly long overdue. Those who visit the various old-age institutions, and perhaps more especially have links with organizations which visit the aged people who are not in institutions, but are living in single rooms or living in small flats in the heart of our cities, will realize the desperate need for some direct overall plan to assist the aged in these very difficult times.</p>

<p>Sir, the other question which I want to put to the hon. the Minister relates to a report in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 10 May 1976. That is a very serious matter. It focuses attention on Cape Town but is not confined to Cape Town only. This concerns what has been called the oldest profession in the world. I refer to prostitution and the booming of venereal disease. Whilst I appreciate that the Department of Health would obviously have direct responsibility, it is also, I believe, the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare to look into this matter. What concerns me most is that from these investigations which are reported in the Press, investigations in which I was involved in another capacity some years ago, one finds that young girls of 14, 15 and 16 years of age frequent certain clubs in the city or hang around the docks in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban, and probably East London as well. This is becoming a very serious social problem and I would like to know that the department is taking this seriously and is trying to do something about it. The police, when interviewed on this matter, made the point that their hands were tied and that very often the clubs which acted as the magnet for both the prostitutes and the customers had no licence as such and therefore the restrictions by way of control were not nearly as great as they ought to be. One hopes therefore that the department will give attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The other matter which I want to raise with the hon. the Minister concerns tax concessions on donations to welfare organizations. Here, of course, the hon. the Minister of Finance is directly involved and responsible. But I recall a debate which I think took place between the previous Deputy Minister and Mr. Justice J. H. Steyn on this question. I am convinced that the social welfare of our country, whether it be the department itself or whether it be one or more of the over 2 000 organizations which exist, stand to benefit directly if there could be some form of tax concession on donations to these various welfare organizations. One appreciates the difficulty in maintaining the free enterprise system on the one hand and to keep rigidly away from the Welfare State on the other hand, but I am convinced that a great number of private entrepreneurs would be more generous in their donations to deserving welfare organizations if there were some tax concessions. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister and his department have given any further thought to this and whether we can expect any change of policy in this respect.</p>

<p>The last point I want to raise is one that was brought to the attention of this House by way of a question to the hon. the Minister by the hon. member for Yeoville. The question concerned the moving away from race discrimination in the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and was put to the hon. the Minister during May. In his reply the hon. the Minister pointed out that the only posts that were open to Blacks, Coloureds and Indians in his department were for messengers and labourers. One appreciates that the department, by law, gives its time, concern and consideration to the White group only, but it does, nevertheless, seem quite remarkable that this discrimination does exist. I understand that even although non-White messengers and <span class="col_7725-7726" refersTo="page_1193"/>labourers are employed, they are not paid the rate for the jobs. One would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comments in regard to this matter. I hope very much that he will reply.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would like to stress again that one of the biggest problems facing the aged citizens of our country today is the fact that so many of them have been caught out by the rapid increase in the rate of inflation with the result that their pensions, which in many cases come from a private source such as a private company, cannot keep pace with the rate of inflation. If we are going to build for the future and if we want to put a stop to this&#x2014;victimization not in the sense that people are deliberately made victims, but that they become the victim of economic trends&#x2014;then one of the best ways to do this is the national contributory scheme. We hope very much that we will hear from the hon. the Minister that either a Select Committee will be appointed in the immediate future or that some other means will be created whereby further action can be brought about in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pinelands touched on a number of subjects and devoted much of his time to a plea for a national contributory pension scheme. The hon. member could just as well have spent his time reading Hansard. If he had done so, he would have seen that hon. members have discussed this subject at length and that a private motion has even been moved on this subject. In any event, the hon. the Minister has, after all, announced that an investigation is to be instituted in this regard and one therefore wonders what more the hon. member wants. Furthermore the hon. member for Umbilo has in the past championed this cause far better than the hon. member did today.</p>

<p>However, I want to confine myself to a different subject. It is a problem which is causing us a great deal of concern and is assuming vast proportions, viz. neglect and maltreatment of children. Looking at the latest report of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, one notes that on 31 December 1973 there were 6 105 children in the 100 registered children&#x2019;s homes under the supervision of the department. Apart from this there are the 17 schools of industries with 2 105 pupils and two reform schools with 170 pupils. These data are to be found in the report of the Department of National Education. This gives a total of 8 380 children who do not enjoy the happiness of a parental home. However, one only becomes aware of the true extent of the problem when one faces the fact that in the year 1974-&#x2019;75, 2 787 children were found to be in need of care, 791 of whom were committed to children&#x2019;s homes and 1 029 of whom were placed with step-parents. One feels sorry for those children who are deprived of the privilege of a parental home and the love which this involves, although I believe that many of them are in fact better off than they were in the homes from which they were taken.</p>

<p>This brings me to the children who are still in the parental homes where we find maltreatment of children. One would have expected that children who were still in their parental homes would receive from their parents at least that love and care which one finds even in the animal world. A great deal of publicity has been given to this problem. We, as responsible and civilized people, are also filled with disgust at what we have read and seen. I think we owe the SABC a debt of gratitude for the way in which they have brought this corrosive cancer to the attention of the public by way of television. I think that all of us were probably also shocked to hear that over the past five years, 63 children have been beaten to death by their parents, while there are thousands of defenceless children who are maltreated and mentally crippled by irresponsible parents without this being brought to the attention of the authorities. It is probably not an easy matter to find a solution to this problem but I do think that where such cases are brought to the attention of the authorities, heavier punishments should be imposed as a deterrent. I do not want to criticize our courts, but I think that all of us were shocked recently to hear that a parent who had beaten his child to death and was charged with murder was fined R50 for the death of his own defenceless little child. On the other hand, we know that in a case of cattle theft the punishment is imprisonment without the option of a fine. A minimum fine is laid down for the shooting of a buck. Now I ask: Where is our perspective if imprisonment without the option of a fine is imposed for the theft of a fowl whereas the fine of a mere R50 is imposed in the case of a parent who beats his child to death?</p>

<p>However I think that our biggest problem is <span class="col_7727-7728" refersTo="page_1194"/>to bring those thousands of cases of maltreatment of children to the attention of the authorities. When a complaint is submitted to the Police, they investigate it and a charge can be laid. However the problem is to bring such cases to their attention. Neighbours, who can in most cases be the best informants, are usually hesitant to get involved in a matter of this nature. I think that our medical practitioners are probably in the best position to identify maltreatment of children. However they are prohibited by law from providing information about their patients to other parties. In my opinion there must be a change in this regard. I do not believe we want to compel the doctors to make known information about their patients, but in the case of a crime being committed, where a parent maltreats his child, as we have seen on television, I believe that the medical practitioners have a moral obligation to report it, as is the case with any other citizen. In the case of child maltreatment, the medical practitioner who is unwilling to make it known himself could possibly report it to his colleague, the district surgeon, or to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, to enable them to investigate the matter further. That is why I should like to make an appeal to our medical practitioners today to assist us in eliminating this evil.</p>

<p>I believe, too, that child maltreatment is a psycho-social problem and that it should be dealt with in just the same way as any other social problem like alcoholism, drugs and so on. Very sound&#x2014;and successful&#x2014;research has already been carried out in regard to alcoholism, drugs, diseases and even insect pests. I wonder whether more research could not be carried out at this stage with regard to this evil, viz. child maltreatment. If we have an association for the prevention of cruelty to animals in virtually every town, more could probably be done to combat the problem of maltreatment of children, too. In the department&#x2019;s latest report, mention is made of the fact that an investigation is being instituted into the desirability of establishing family courts in South Africa similar to those in certain Western countries. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister what progress has been made with this investigation, viz. the establishment with family courts. I think that as is mentioned in that report, of all the functions mentioned as being entrusted to these specific courts, priority should be given to maltreatment of children as one of the most important functions. I know it is not going to be easy to solve this major problem, but by bringing this evil to the attention of the public to a greater extent and affording the necessary protection to the public, the social workers and our medical practitioners, so that the guilty parties may be apprehended, I believe we will make a great deal of progress in combating and totally eliminating this evil.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Boksburg made a very constructive contribution, particularly when he referred to the neglect and ill-treatment of children. This is an evil which is very much on the increase in our big cities. If there is something to which attention has to be given, it is probably the neglect and ill-treatment of children, particularly because the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions plays a major part in the care of our children. The services rendered by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions cover a very wide field. Only when one has made a study of all the activities of the department does one realize the great extent of the services of the department. If one looks at the Budget one observes, too, that after Defence and Bantu Administration and Development the largest amount of money has been allotted to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, viz. the amount of R323 918 000. This demonstrates to us the extent of the work of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions.</p>

<p>I, too, wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff for the extremely competent way in which they are mastering the work of the department. I am thinking not only of the head office in Pretoria, but also of the staff of the Port Elizabeth regional office where assistance and particularly good services are being rendered. Among the most important services which the department is rendering to us are undoubtedly social auxiliary services such as social pensions and grants, as well as subsidies. When I refer to subsidies I just want to refer to the grants which are being paid annually to elderly persons. It is interesting to note that at present old-age pensions are being paid to 123 839 persons. The amount involved is R85 million. In addition there are 16 000 war veterans, to whom more than R12 336 000 is being paid annually. Over and <span class="col_7729-7730" refersTo="page_1195"/>above the social services there are also the extremely important social welfare services, which, <i>inter alia,</i> include rehabilitation services, the care of the handicapped, the care of the aged, child-care and research in regard to auxiliary services, etc.</p>

<p>I want to pause for a moment to consider the care of the aged. Hon. members opposite have always been in the habit of accusing the Government, during the discussion of this Vote, of not doing enough for the aged, and saying that the aged are being neglected. We know of course that they do this for political gain, and do not themselves believe what they say. However, the facts prove the opposite, and I find it a pity that some hon. members drag the question of the care of the aged into politics, for it is a matter for which everyone has sympathy.</p>

<p>It is in fact this Government which has always had an open hand and heart for our aged persons. When we took over in 1948 our elderly people were receiving a pension of only R10 per month, in comparison with the R72 which they will receive as from October. This is an indication of what is being done for our elderly people. We have repeatedly emphasized that one can never do enough for our elderly people. It is we on this side of the House who are trying to make the lives of our elderly people as comfortable as possible, but at the same time we are realistic when we make representations to the hon. the Minister for financial relief. After all, the State has to obtain the necessary funds from the citizens of this country, and we know that when taxes are increased, it is hon. members opposite who criticize such steps. We know that social pensions have, without exception, been constantly increased during the past 10 or 11 years. This fact is in itself sufficient reply to criticism coming from the hon. members on the opposite side. Conveniently, reference is always made only to old-age pensions, as though that were all we were doing for our elderly people. No mention is made of all the other services which we are providing for the aged, services which are equally essential and important.</p>

<p>I want to refer here to two of the many improvements which have been effected since 1972. The means test was raised from R4 000 to R9 800. The free income of a person was raised from R192 to R504. The means test was extended considerably so that persons who have assets in excess of R22 400 are today able to receive their full pension, while those who have assets exceeding R34 000 are still able to receive the minimum of R24 per month. These considerable improvements undoubtedly prove that ways and means are constantly being found to help our elderly people. The services which the State is providing to improve the living conditions of the aged, cover a very wide field.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to certain aspects of these services. I think the aspect of the care of the aged with which the most progress has been made in recent years, is accommodation. First of all, in this regard, I want to refer in particular to housing for certain elderly people who are no longer able to look after themselves. I am referring here to the question of institutional care. I also want to refer to the provision of housing in the form of special dwellings or flatlets for elderly persons, in which they are able to look after themselves and run their own home. In South Africa, in proportion to the total number of White elderly persons, there are more homes for the aged than in most other developed countries in the world. On 31 December 1974 there were 241 subsidized homes for the aged under the control of welfare organizations. Those homes for the aged were able to accommodate a total of 13 441 inhabitants from the sub-economic income group and 2 080 inhabitants from the economic income group. Apart from the existing homes for the aged the department has already approved the construction of a further 63 homes for the aged. These homes for the aged are all at present at some or other stage of planning or construction, and a few have already been completed. Those new homes for the aged will provide accommodation for a further 8 428 elderly persons. Approval has also been granted for extensions to 47 existing homes for the aged in order to provide accommodation for an additional 1 405 elderly persons; for the most part infirm aged persons.</p>

<p>The following subsidies will be paid to homes for the aged with effect from 1 October this year: An additional R7 per month for each ordinary aged person who is accommodated in an old-age home; R38 per month to each <span class="col_7731-7732" refersTo="page_1196"/>infirm aged person; from R62,50 per month to each infirm aged person to whom a regular nursing service is made available; and R80 per month to each extremely infirm and chronically indisposed aged person. Free medical services are also made available to aged persons, and aged persons who are nursed at home, also receive a grant. I should like to request the hon. the Minister to reconsider the present grant of R10 per month, which is being paid to aged persons who are bedridden or who are no longer able to care for themselves.

<p>Mr. Chairman, on this occasion I should like to express a few ideas in regard to social relief, a grant which is applicable to those who turn to the State for assistance in times of emergency. Before doing so, however, I first want to mention a local matter to the hon. the Minister. I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth North, and I also want to avail myself of the opportunity to convey my cordial thanks and appreciation to the regional representative of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and his staff in Port Elizabeth for the competent services they have rendered to my constituency in the interests of the voters whom I am privileged to represent here. I want to thank the staff of the department in Port Elizabeth, as well as in Uitenhage, for the brilliant work they have done; sometimes under difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>The branch office in Uitenhage has undoubtedly served a useful purpose and has definitely justified its existence. Uitenhage is on its way to becoming an industrial giant, and the White population is increasing by leaps and bounds. As a result the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is having to expand its activities daily over a wide field. At present 1 160 social pensions are being p&#x00E1;id to Whites in Uitenhage. This is irrefutable proof that the branch office is serving its purpose. However, there is one deficiency which I wish, of necessity, to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. This is in fact that Uitenhage does not have the services of a full-time professional officer for social services. This task is at present being performed by officers of the regional office in Port Elizabeth. I am aware that those officers are working under great pressure, as a result of a pressing staff shortage, and also because of their many duties and owing to the shortage of staff in general. I am saying this on the strength of the fact that during the period 1 February 1975 to 31 January 1976, a total of 1 250 interviews were conducted in Uitenhage by professional officers of the Port Elizabeth office.</p>

<p>During the same period a total of 165 professional reports were compiled. For the sake of fairness it should be mentioned in this respect that generous use was made of the assistance of the local Christelike Maatskaplike Raad. The CMR in Uitenhage is also unable to keep up the pace, and consequently it is imperative that a full-time professional officer be assigned to the local branch office. I would therefore appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would be so kind as to give serious attention to my request. It is a foregone conclusion&#x2014;I think the department will agree with me&#x2014;that the establishment at the branch office in Uitenhage will have to be augmented in the near future. I am convinced that the appointment of a full-time professional officer will provide the immediate solution. I should kindly like to refer the hon. the Minister to the memorandum on social relief which was drawn up by his department in 1975. In that memorandum I find two instructions which determine how these grants are applicable and when they should be applied. I am going to quote the instructions to the hon. the Minister, and I should be pleased if he would give his attention to them. The first instruction on page 4 and 5 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit behoort in die eerste plek die taak van die kerk te wees om sy behoeftige lidmaat self te versorg. Daar moet dus vooraf met die kerk geskakel word voor noodhulp verleen word.</block>

<p>The problem I experience here is that a rather protracted procedure has to be adopted before any actual financial assistance is in sight and before the applicant concerned is assisted, regardless of his church affiliation. This state of affairs has a frustrating effect on the applicant because the family already finds itself in difficult circumstances. The second requirement which occurs in the memorandum, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Met die oog op menslike neigings moet maatskaplike noodhulp nie aantreklik <span class="col_7733-7734" refersTo="page_1197"/>gemaak word nie. &#x2019;n Minimum be-staansvereiste behoort voorsien te word en die ondersteuning moet nie so wees dat dit die begunstigde aanmoedig om &#x2019;n ontvanger van liefdadigheid te bly nie.</block>

<p>I have no fault to find with this. However, this standpoint of the department may be interpreted in two ways. As soon as more than the minimum subsistence requirements are provided, the applicant is encouraged to remain a receiver of charity, but as soon as the minimum subsistence requirements are complied with, a want of the bare necessities undoubtedly sets in if we take the present cost of living basis into consideration. This has been my experience in my constituency.</p>

<p>A matter which therefore causes me concern, is the scales which are applicable in respect of the payment of social relief. On 1 April 1973 it was R2,10 per week in respect of a person above the age of ten years, and R1,80 per week in respect of a person below the age of ten years. I do not know why the age of ten years plays a part here. On 1 April 1976 these scales were adjusted, and at present it amounts to R2,60 per week in respect of a person above the age of ten years, and R2,25 per week in respect of a person below that age. I find these amounts completely inadequate for the purpose for which they are being utilized and I want to advocate a drastic increase of these amounts. The grant in itself is of a temporary nature and is only allocated in very exceptional cases; hence the designation &#x201C;relief&#x201D;. Nor is it a right which may be demanded from the State. This grant is allocated primarily for the purpose of buying food and providing the applicant&#x2019;s primary necessities of life. In such cases the beneficiary, without exception, is entirely dependent on the State. I think that in many cases there is a failure to realize that the person concerned is entirely dependent on the State in this temporary period during which it is the duty of the State to care for him. In many cases the persons concerned have already applied for a social pension, but are unable to fend for themselves before the pension is granted. I find it completely unrealistic to expect that an adult can be fed, in the physical sense, on R2,60 per week, and a child below the age of ten, on R2,25 per week. This is the position as far as the individuals are concerned. When we are dealing with a family which is, owing to unforeseen circumstances, compelled to make use of this emergency aid, the picture is even more sombre.</p>

<p>There are many of my voters who are compelled by necessity to avail themselves of this aid, and consequently I am speaking from experience. I have personally come across cases where warrants were issued by the department to a grocer to supply the applicant with the necessary foodstuffs to the amount of R2,60 per week. I was shocked to see what food the applicant received for R2,60, and for a week, too. Mindful of the fact that a person&#x2019;s application for a social pension sometimes takes months before finality is reached&#x2014;I am not saying that this is so in all cases, but in some cases it is&#x2014;it is asking too much to expect of the person in question to keep body and soul together on R2,60 per week.</p>

<p>Personally I am opposed to a welfare State, and I know that this is also the policy of the present Government. However, when the White voter finds himself in financial distress, the Government of the day has to accept responsibility in such a way that it rebounds to the credit of the country. It is not my intention that emergency aid should become an everyday occurrence. I realize that it can also be abused. However, if the department finds that the applicant qualifies for a grant&#x2014;and personally I have confidence in the discretion of the officials of the department&#x2014;the grants should be of such a nature that the beneficiaries are able to subsist in so far as their food requirements are concerned. It should not be necessary for them to look to other people for assistance. It should not be necessary for them to turn to the church for assistance regardless of what his church affiliation is. As I have already said, assistance from the church is an impossible task, for as soon as an applicant is not a regular church-goer, the assistance on the part of the church is in many cases doubtful. If a person is an active or semi-active member of some church or other, the church council first has to decide on the proposed assistance in the financial sphere. By the time the Church council has taken a decision, the financial position of the applicant has deteriorated even further to the detriment of himself and his family.</p>

<p>I want to request that the amount for application in terms of social relief schemes in respect of the regional office at Port Elizabeth be increased so that the needs of the branch <span class="col_7735-7736" refersTo="page_1198"/>office in Uitenhage can be met. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a little while ago whilst attending a hearing of the Rent Board one of the ladies giving evidence told me something which upset me very much. She said that if one were an old person and one had a home, then one should never complain because if one did complain one would be evicted and one would have nowhere to go. This is very true, and we know that these people have nowhere else to go. It is amazing what they have to put up with because of this. Many landlords impose all sorts of restrictions on these poor old people. They are, for instance, not allowed to use electrical equipment. In many cases they are not allowed to have visitors or keep pets. If the landlords want to get rid of these old people, they apply all sorts of pressures on them to make them go. For instance, they apply to the Rent Board for increased rents and impose all kinds of measures which make life quite impossible for these old people. This is not the position of one single old person, but it is the position of thousands of aged people and pensioners who are now being hit by the rising rents and the increasing shortage of accommodation at a reasonable rental. This is a major problem in cities such as Durban where, for example, 7% of the population is over 65 years of age. In the smaller towns along the coast the percentage is as high as 15%. We are told that in Durban, for instance, over 1 000 out of 40 000 odd aged people and pensioners, are having severe accommodation problems. If one thinks that in the year 2000 there will be twice as many of these aged people with these problems, one wonders what is being done to improve the position and to provide accommodation for these people. We must plan and act now if we intend providing accommodation for the next generation of old people of whom we may be members.</p>

<p>We feel that there is a desperate need for housing at rentals not exceeding R30 to R40 per month, because that is about all a person whose income is between R70 and R80 per month can afford. Housing is of far greater value to the aged than money itself. The most important thing for them is to have a roof over their heads and a room to sleep in. Food is secondary. These people will starve and suffer anything as long as they can pay their rent. We feel that, because of the rising costs, such as the cost of electricity, the cost of water, the cost of sewerage services, rates and taxes, etc., which are affecting all of us, something should be done to help these people. Even those who own their own properties, who are affected in the same way as we are, and who cannot keep up with the burden of rates and taxes to which they are being subjected, should be assisted. The local authorities, apart from providing this cheap accommodation, should also, in our opinion, provide some measure of rates relief to pensioners and retired persons. It is, of course, impossible for the local authorities to continue to do this without some help from the Government. The housing which is provided for aged persons should also not just be ordinary housing; it should be housing specially designed for old people. The old people themselves are not very fond of old-age homes. This is something which, I suppose, we have all encountered. They look upon an old-age home as something akin to a boarding school hostel and of course none of us want to spend the last days of our lives in a boarding school hostel atmosphere.</p>

<p>Apart from the adverse effect on aged persons, there is also the question of the cost involved. We are told that it costs between R60 and R80 per month per person to run an old-age home. In the case of homes for the frail aged, the costs are very much higher, and range between R145 and R165 per month per person. We have been told by TAFTA, an organization which helps the aged in Durban, that if these people are kept in their own homes, they can be cared for as little as R20 a month. This includes two hours of help per day by persons who come in to help them with their chores, as well as one hot meal per day, served by the meals-on-wheels organization. This is a large difference in price. A system is required whereby we can assist these people to keep their own homes for as long as possible. In this way we will allow them their independence and enable them to remain in their own neighbourhoods amongst their own friends, with all their belongings around them. This is most important to them from a psychological point of view. We picture a cluster type of housing, designed for old people, as the ideal answer to this problem.</p>

<p>I have in mind such things as hand-rails in the passages, ramps instead of staircases, etc., which are specially designed for their needs. <span class="col_7737-7738" refersTo="page_1199"/>These houses should be in the centre of the neighbourhood, in the centre of each community. These people should not be isolated from their friends, from transport, from shops, from hospitals, from churches and from places of entertainment, and canteen and medical facilities should also be readily available. Such houses should be included in the initial planning of every township development in South Africa. This will furnish personal security as well as a vital form of protection for these old people. We know that there is an increasing campaign of violence against old people living in isolated areas. Every day we read in the newspapers of old people being attacked and robbed in circumstances where they are some distance from their nearest neighbour. Something should be done to provide these people with housing in built-up areas.</p>

<p>I also feel that telephones should be afforded to these people. They should be given priority and they should be provided with telephone services at a nominal rental. The Department of Social Welfare and Pensions should subsidize such services, because the telephone is the only link these people have with a view to safety and protection. It is also very important that when the Rent Board sees fit to increase rentals, such rentals should not be increased retrospectively. At the hearing at which I was present, rentals were increased by R1,50 a month. This may not seem so terrible in the case of people who have incomes of between R80 and R100 a month, but when such increases are made retrospective for six to eight months, it is a different story, and this should not be allowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am dealing with homes for the aged and, if I may say so, these are matters which the hon. the Minister could take up with his colleagues. After all, he gets the money from the Treasury. He should, for instance, persuade the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications that these services should be subsidized. I call for rates relief, which is also something which this Minister can of course activate and see to it that it is provided, because it will help these people to keep their homes. Sir, the hon. the Minister may ask where all this money must come from. This is the very first thing he says. Where is he to find money for houses? It is not the duty of his department. Where is the money to come from for the subsidization of rates and for increased pensions and allowances and now you still want telephone subsidies? Sir, he should get this money from the Treasury. It should come from the Treasury, because every taxpayer in South Africa should pay towards the care of the aged. After all, his own parents may be involved. There is too much of this in South Africa, that we do not meet our responsibilities as far as our old people are concerned.</p>

The hon. the Minister may say a lottery is immoral, but I want to tell the hon. the Minister that morals have changed a great deal over the last few years. Sir, you only have to look at TV or some of the pictures in the newspapers, or some of the plays one sees today, to see what a large change there has been in moral standards. One need only look at <i>Rapport</i> on a Sunday. I wonder who encourages immorality more than the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions or the Receiver of Revenue. They encourage people to live in sin, because if they do not get married, they are allowed to keep their pensions or need not pay certain taxes. Sir, I see nothing wrong in this Minister encouraging people to buy lottery tickets as long as the proceeds go towards helping to provide for the aged.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether the hon. member for South Coast lived before 1948, because then he would have been able to draw a comparison between what the UP did for the aged and the indigent people during its regime and what this Government is doing at present for the indigent people.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised quite a number of complaints here. For instance, he suggested that group housing in particular should be provided for aged persons. I do not know whether he has visited all these excellent <span class="col_7739-7740" refersTo="page_1200"/>housing schemes and has spoken to some of the aged. If one does this, one will find the strange phenomenon that, while some of the aged persons who are being housed there cannot speak highly enough of how pleasant it is to stay there and of the excellent housing which has been made available to them, others living next door complain and say that they feel trapped there. One does come across cases of this nature. If one makes a few inquiries, one finds that those elderly people who, for some good reason or other were unable to save something for themselves and who are now being cared for by the State, are the grateful people. They will tell you that the aged persons have never had it so good as is the case at present under this Government. However, when one visits another aged person in that same group housing, an aged person who is dissatisfied, and puts a few questions to him, one subsequently discovers that he has shared out his property and his possessions among his children and that the children have discarded him. Those people who have been accustomed to a good living, those who have been well-to-do people, are the people who expect the same from the State. I want to tell the hon. member for South Coast that we should be careful when considering care of the aged. Care of the aged is something everyone of us as well as the State should undertake. One cannot but pay tribute to the various welfare organizations and institutions for great sacrifices they make. One cannot but express gratitude to children who are still taking care of their parents in their own homes. But we should guard against going too far as far as welfare work is concerned.</p>

<p>There are two sides to the issue. There are those to whom assistance has to be rendered and there are those who should put their hands into their own pockets and say: Here you are; give it to those who need it. We should try to maintain that balance. We can only do as much as the available money allows us to do. I want to tell you, Sir, that I have studied this report and that I have come to the conclusion that I cannot but express my gratitude and my high appreciation for the suggestions contained in this report, for the comprehensive way in which it provides us with all the particulars. I want to emphasize again that welfare work is going ahead full pace if we take into consideration that allowances and pensions were paid to only 275 000 persons in 1965 while 440 000 persons received benefits during the year under review.</p>

<p>Since there are such a large number of these people and since the hon. member for South Coast pleaded for housing, I want to suggest that it is possible to provide cheaper housing to many of these people. We should not only look at the pensions and allowances which are being paid to these people; we should also look at what is being spent by other departments as well as voluntary organizations. Among this large number of beneficiaries there must be people whose circumstances are of such a nature that they can be placed in rural towns where many houses are standing empty and where space is available in hostels and, in some cases, also in nursing homes. I do not say this in order to isolate these people, neither do I say this in order to place these people in remote areas in the country areas, but I am saying this because I feel that these possibilities may be investigated. In his report the Secretary for Social Welfare and Pensions refers to an investigation into certain aspects of welfare work, and to my mind this suggestion is another aspect of welfare work which is worth investigating.</p>

<p>For example, when considering settlements, one feels grateful for the fact that these settlements do exist. One thinks particularly of Ganspan, Sonop, Karatara and Charlesville. If people could be placed under certain circumstances at these places, it would also be possible for some of these 440 000 people to be placed in depopulated rural towns where cheap housing is available and where such houses are situated on large plots with plenty of water. I have in mind the little town in the Western Transvaal where I was born and where a large hostel is standing empty at the moment. There are three doctors in that little town&#x2014;two private practitioners and a district surgeon. There are such towns where some of these people could be settled and it would be a good thing if some of the local authorities could provide the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions with particulars of the housing which is available in their towns. This would promote the settlement of such people since the department would then be familiar with the circumstances under which various people could be settled in such towns.</p>

<p>One may possibly also consider the settlement at Sonop, which is situated in the constituency of my colleague, the hon. <span class="col_7741-7742" refersTo="page_1201"/>member for Brits. At Sonop R2,3 million is being spent at the moment on the replacement of housing. I have no objection to that. I think the more of these people we can place on our settlements, the better. For that reason I want to express my appreciation towards the De Beers Company which donated the small, former mining town of Charlesville to the department for the settlement of people there. I do not doubt for one moment that the department, when investigating this matter, will find that certain of these people will fit in quite well in the depopulated rural towns. This would boost both the churches and the schools in these towns where there is a tendency for everything to collapse.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal with the question of the civil and the social pensioners because I think these deserve the attention of the hon. the Minister and of the House. However, before doing so, I want to direct a plea to the hon. the Minister once again on behalf of the war veterans of the First World War. We all know that in respect of the veterans of the Anglo-Boer War of whom there are still 674, no means test applies at all. In respect of the Rebellion of 1906 and later rebellions, inclusive of World War I, the total number of war veterans at the moment is approximately 4 500. The annual report of the department makes it clear that the number of war veterans is decreasing. Although reference is made to the fact that the number may increase as a result of recent events, I want to say that the additions will probably be well taken care of under other legislation which will probably come before the House. However, in regard to those war veterans who have to rely on social pensions, I want to direct a strong plea to the hon. the Minister that the means test be removed altogether and that they therefore be put into the same category with the veterans of the Anglo-Boer War. As I have said, the numbers are diminishing yearly. In fact, I believe that over the next decade, if not less, they will diminish at a very much faster rate than has been the case hitherto. I sincerely hope the hon. the Minister will give some attention to this. I hope he will see whether some plan cannot be devised to place them in the same category as the veterans of the Anglo-Boer War.</p>

<p>I do not wish to repeat what has already been put very strongly by other members on this side of the House regarding the social pensioner. In the report reference is made to the fact that the pension of the social pensioner has been increased by approximately 50% over a certain period, the period under review, I think it says&#x2014;that is to say, over the last three, four or five years. Although that may be the case, I should like to say that the cost of living has probably more than doubled in the same period. Therefore, although reference is constantly made to the fact that the pensions have now been increased by a further 10,5%, the fact remains that this does not keep up with the cost of living. This is a very important defect in the whole policy regarding our social pensions. If we go about identifying the persons who need assistance from the State, if we feel it is necessary in principle that such people should receive help from the State, the help that is subsequently given must be reasonably adequate. A previous speaker on the Government side has already stressed the inadequacy of other types of assistance such as the assistance given to children, families, etc. I do not want to go into that. However, I would like to emphasize the fact that although it cannot be completely adequate, it has to have some reasonable modicum of adequacy if we are to give real assistance and relieve the plight of the social pensioner. Therefore I hope that the hon. the Minister will reconsider the whole system, not the means test itself, but rather increasing, by means of a system of indexing with regard to the cost of living, the pension of the social pensioner instead of offering him an arbitrary figure which it is hoped will foot the bill and perhaps meet the situation. I think that arbitrary decisions of this nature do not help those who receive it, nor does it relieve those who give it of their responsibility.</p>

<p>I should like to deal more specifically with the civil pensioner who is also in a difficult position. The hon. the Minister may know that at a conference he recently attended and where a paper was read as a contribution to the discussions on the contributory pension scheme, an actuary, in delivering a paper, made the following statement and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The limits of the pension will be increased with increases in the consumer price index. Every pension payment will be increased each year in line with increases in the consumer price index and the accrued <span class="col_7743-7744" refersTo="page_1202"/>pension each year will be similarly increased.</block>

<p>In other words, it is an accepted principle of actuarial thinking and actuarial assessment today that unless you take all this into account, it does not meet the situation, a real situation in the economic field in any country.</p>

<p>With regard to the present civil pensioners many of whom are pegged entirely to the amount of pension they receive, they find themselves in an impossible position because they are getting older, they are unable to engage in normal activities in so far as employment is concerned and are therefore themselves unable to relieve their difficulty. Consequently they are compelled to survive solely on the pension which they are receiving. A particular body of pensioners who number some 4 000 persons and who, I understand, are the only independent association of Afrikaans-speaking civil pensioners in the country and thus not attached to any other organization, have been in correspondence with the hon. the Minister and have received certain replies from the department. This has not proved satisfactory to them and they then wrote a further lengthy letter to the hon. the Minister in order to explain their point of view. It is particularly on their behalf that I would like to put up the points they put to the hon. the Minister. I feel that this matter should be aired in the House so that the hon. the Minister can furnish us with a reply.</p>

<p>Their first criticism is the age-old criticism from pensioners from year to year. They ask: Why, if the pension is increased at all, is it being increased from 1 October and not 1 July, i.e. the date from which the salaries of the public servants are being increased? Furthermore, to support their case as to why they should be getting a greater allowance they maintain that if the rand had retained its value from the time that they had retired, they would probably have been able to meet their obligations and would probably have been satisfied with the pension they receive. With the deterioration of the rand they find that difficult. Furthermore, they say that while they appreciate these increases, these increases have over the last decade not equalled the rise in the cost of living, but probably only one third of the actual rise in the cost of living. In response into a reply from the hon. the Minister that over the last 20 years their pensions and allowances have been increased by 178%, they maintain that the cost of living has risen by 400%, far more than what the State has been able to compensate them for.</p>

<p>When reference is made to the present-day situation in which they are suffering hardships, they point out firstly that the formula in respect of pensions in the Public Service has improved since 1966, and secondly that the retirement salaries are attuned to personnel competition with the private sector. This gives present-day pensioners much greater pensions than those unfortunates who retired 10 or 20 years ago. Demands made by the cost of living on Public Servants also warrant the granting of very much higher present-day salaries by the State. When a civil servant therefore retires today, he does so at a salary that meets present-day demands, but as time goes on&#x2014;though we hope this will not be the case&#x2014;he too may also find himself suffering from the problem of not being able to keep up with the cost of living. Pensioners in their seventies, who have been retired for some 15 or 20 years, are, however, obliged to live on pensions of R311 per month. A husband and wife would find it absolutely impossible to do so if they are to maintain any decent standard of living commensurate with the status of the individual when he retired.</p>

<p>Many suggestions have been made about where the money should come from. If the State finds that the present funds of R1&#x00BD; billion are inadequate, the State should make provision for certain annual investments. The return on such investments could more than adequately off-set what is required to bring the civil pensioner, as the years go by, to a standard of living at least commensurate with prevailing conditions.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in passing and in all sincerity I just want to express my gratitude to members of the Opposition parties for the assistance rendered to me since I have assumed this office. They have considerably facilitated matters for me as far as the preparation and discussion of legislation are concerned.</p>

<p>I now want to reply to a few matters raised here by hon. members and I am not doing so with the purposes of levelling destructive criticism of adopting a superior attitude. I am doing so with a sincere desire to offer my assistance to everyone who is interested in the <span class="col_7745-7746" refersTo="page_1203"/>affairs of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. However, I also ask that the opposite side of the House should co-operate with us at all times. We have had a variety of interesting speeches this afternoon, but I am unable to reply to all of them. The hon. the Minister will most certainly reply to them fully. However, there are one or two minor matters I can single out.</p>

<p>&#x2020;By way of examples, I should like to prove to hon. members opposite that I believe that this debate can be of immense value, not only to the hon. the Minister, myself and officials in the department, but also to everyone else concerned with this matter at the present time, if we endeavour to see the wood and not the trees. I am not referring in a derogatory sense to the speech of the hon. member for Pinelands when I say that our solution to the problem, which he correctly described as existing in Cape Town, could easily have been explained to him if he had merely come to the department and discussed the matter with us. We would have explained to him what methods we are employing to solve the problem. If he comes to the department we can jointly look for answers to problems that may be of concern to various members in his constituency. That also applies to other constituencies. I may just mention that I attended a meeting of the regional organization this morning. In their annual report they already refer to this problem in Cape Town harbour. They have given attention to the matter and, what is more, they are still doing so. They are getting the full co-operation of voluntary organizations and of the department itself.</p>

<p>*The department has a variety of tasks. I have read through the list of delegations. I do not want to repeat all the aspects here, but bearing in mind what has already been said here this afternoon, I nevertheless want to mention some of them. There are, for example, civil pensions, a national contributory pension scheme, care of the aged, the care of handicapped people, child care, family care, rehabilitation services, the combating of alcoholism and drug addiction, welfare planning, welfare relations, war pensions and civil pensions. The matters dealt with by this department are legion. To my mind everyone of us should associate himself with the gratitude and appreciation expressed towards the officials of the department, at head office as well as the regional offices. They are the people who are dealing with these matters in such a manner that it is still possible to proceed with these services. Of course, this does not mean that it is not possible to improve the organization of these activities. I am very glad to be able to say that it is evident from the report that the Secretary has undertaken, in the preceding years, the replanning and revaluation of the services rendered by the department. In this he was assisted by the hon. the Minister and the previous Deputy Minister. Hence the excellent report which has been tabled here.</p>

<p>In broad terms we can summarize it in this way that, as far as the planning of our welfare services are concerned, there is no need for us to vie with one another or to wait for the highest bid from people who want to outdo others in what is being done for our aged and our handicapped. Surely, irrespective of our political differences there is not one hon. member in this House&#x2014;and I say this in all seriousness&#x2014;who does not have a feeling of decency and who does not want to do the utmost for the aged or the debilitated person. This I can say in all honesty of all the hon. members of the Opposition. Irrespective of all the other things on which we differ, I believe that they mean it sincerely when it concerns those who are less privileged than we are. However, it is no use making the highest bid when one knows that it is an impossible one. One thing the Government has already declared itself prepared to do&#x2014;this is something I should like to see done&#x2014;is to eliminate the gap with regard to the payments made to the various population groups. Therefore, I cannot see any sense in our scoring any political points off one another in this matter. The fact of the matter is that it cannot be done at the moment. Besides other problems which exist, there are also practical problems. Surely, it is no use pleading for something which is impracticable.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast went into great detail about housing which has to be provided at R30 per month. The hon. member&#x2014;and I do not mean this in a sarcastic way&#x2014;and all other people with a great deal of money, are free to erect houses and to rent them out at R30 per month, surely, this cannot be done. After all, the economic laws have to be taken into consideration. Therefore, if the <span class="col_7747-7748" refersTo="page_1204"/>Government were to pay subsidies &#x2026; Perhaps the hon. member at the back over there&#x2014;the hon. young member for Pinetown&#x2014;who is still ignorant of these matters, would give me some of his attention and not always try to adopt a superior and sarcastic attitude. This only detracts from a debate. I believe that he has received advice from many people. Perhaps the older hon. members, for example the hon. member for Rosettenville, should tell that young member that he should start behaving himself in this House. [Interjections.] If we were to display a little decency in debates of this nature, something constructive might flow from them, but then that hon. young member should please learn to contain himself. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to the real issues of this debate. We are dealing with serious matters, unless that hon. member regards it as being ridiculous to discuss the aged and less privileged people. If that is the case, he may go and laugh outside. In any case, then he would not be disturbing us.</p>

<p>In the first place we must realize that the State does have a duty to care for people under certain circumstances. However, to my mind we should be sufficiently honest with one another to admit that the Whites can sometimes learn from the Bantu as far as care of the aged is concerned. This I experienced among the Bantu peoples. Those of you who are familiar with the Bantu know that, despite their poverty, they find it hard to neglect their aged relatives. The aged are being cared for as long as their children are in any way in a position to do so. This I do not mean in a derogatory sense towards the Whites, but I believe that there are many Whites who are too much inclined to regard it as the duty of the Government to take care of the members of their families whenever they lack anything.</p>

<p>I regret to say that I know of cases, shocking cases, where children have received every cent of their inheritance from their parents and the next favour they did their parents was to fill in the application forms for the State to care for their parents and for them to inherit even more.</p>

<p>It is not only aged persons who are in need of care, but also children who are maltreated and all the other cases mentioned here by hon. members. We shall also have to teach our people to save for their old age. Even in these times of affluence, we will have to make unpleasant speeches and tell people to save for their old age, and for the children to take care of their parents so that there is no need for them to turn to the State for help. All political parties will have to accept it as their responsibility to take care of those who need our assistance. I think we on this side of the House can take the liberty of saying these things because we are constantly watching the situation with a critical eye. I want to admit that there is room for improvement. According to one of the members of the Opposition a roof over one&#x2019;s head is one of the first things one wants for old age. We agree with that. We also want this for our parents and our elderly people. In the second place, the elderly people have their own necessities of life, <i>inter alia</i>, food and clothing. For this purpose we are giving them, in addition to what they have saved for themselves and received for their families, an amount with which they can acquire what is needed.</p>

<p>Another important need among our elderly people is health services. I do not think a house is the most important item, but what is indeed important, is health services and the cost of medicine. Irrespective of what is being done by the Department of Health in this regard, I think that an improvement can be effected here. I want to ask the hon. the Opposition to come forward with positive suggestions during this discussion for the overall planning in order to rectify these matters. Our regional welfare boards are doing excellent work in this connection, and the hon. member for Westdene expressed his appreciation for that. This is no more than right, because the regional welfare boards are capable of overall planning and control. I also express my appreciation to them on this score. I am looking forward to getting their cooperation in the years to come. I am also looking forward to getting the co-operation of all sides of the House in this immense task. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in their speeches the hon. members for Umbilo and Pinelands referred to the possibility of a revision of the means test. During the course of my speech I shall return to one aspect of this. In the meantime I should like to tell the hon. member for South Coast that under Nationalist rule, the Government has always seen to the interests of our old people with the <span class="col_7749-7750" refersTo="page_1205"/>greatest sympathy and compassion. One can say without fear of contradiction that this Government has already made spectacular progress, in comparison with a previous government, in respect of housing and homes for the aged and children. Indeed, spectacular progress has been made across the whole spectrum of rehabilitation services; care of the handicapped, care of the aged, child care, welfare services and professional services. We could also include the improvement in pensions. Pensions are an extremely emotional matter and there are, of course, those who are always unhappy. Some of these are possibly justified to a certain extent in being unhappy, but others are not. The Government has always been prepared to make the necessary adjustments by means of the services provided by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. This is proved by the gigantic sum of R324 million which was allotted in the Budget for this department this year. However, we are too much inclined to link the activities of this department solely to the mere payment of pensions. For the sake of convenience, we forget the vast number of other tasks performed for the sake of the aged, the handicapped, neglected children and orphans. We do not deny that there are certain people who are unhappy, because we read about their complaints in the correspondence columns of the English-language newspapers in particular. On the other hand, however, there are literally thousands of grateful people who know precisely what their position would have been were it not for the care of this department. We do not read about these people in the newspapers, but we see them every day, peacefully strolling through the streets of our cities and towns, or on visits in our old-age homes&#x2014;of which there are hundreds throughout the country&#x2014;or peacefully sitting on the steps of their own homes. There is nothing spectacular or luxurious about this, but these people experience no real want of the basis things which keep old people healthy and happy. I am not now referring to old people who are too sick to enjoy anything, nor am I speaking about people who are incapable of enjoying anything in any event. It is not the duty of the State to allow the indigent aged to live luxuriously. Everyone must see to his own luxuries.</p>

<p>I have said that the Government is prepared and always has been prepared to make the necessary adjustments in respect of services which have to be provided by this department. Due to the nature of the circumstances the Government has to cut its coat according to the cloth. The hon. member for Hercules referred to this. It is a fact.</p>

<p>To return to the means test, I should like to bring one particular aspect to the attention of the hon. the Minister with a view to the necessary adjustment if possible. I am referring to indigent aged people occupying their own houses when it comes to the means test. In this connection I want to refer to two aspects. Firstly, local authorities have as a source of income, rates on properties within their area of jurisdiction, among other things. In view of this, and also due to certain aesthetic considerations, local authorities have certain building requirements, including requirements relating to the cost of erecting dwelling houses. The result of this is that luxury residential areas are created instead of just practical dwelling units. Owing to the building requirements people are forced to erect houses to the value of R20 000, R25 000 or R30 000, and even more than that. The retirement capital of many elderly people is invested in expensive houses like this, and the houses are taken into consideration for the purposes of the means test when they apply for an old-age pension. As a hypothetical case one may point out that the total assets of a person who owns an expensive house like this, including the balance of his capital, may be above the limit of R34 000 and therefore he may not qualify for an old-age pension, while the balance of his capital does not, in point of fact, yield sufficient interest to support two people or even one person properly. Cement and bricks have always been an asset and nobody denies this.</p>

<p>However, they do not provide food, clothing or medical services to old people. I know that local authorities provide economic and sub-economic housing, one of the purposes of which is to meet the demand for housing for the aged. However, I know that they cannot begin to meet the demand. If the house to which I referred in the hypothetical case could be valued at a nominal value with a view to the means test, for example, at a maximum of R15 000, this will have two advantages. The person in my example may, in the first place, be able to qualify for an old-age pension. In the second place, it will relieve the burden of <span class="col_7751-7752" refersTo="page_1206"/>housing for local authorities, seeing that many elderly people could perhaps build their own houses and still qualify for a minimum pension.</p>

<p>In the second instance I want to refer to the example of a person who applied for an old-age pension ten years ago. He possessed and occupied a house which was valued at R15 000 at the time. Together with the balance of his capital he fell within the qualifying limit and could receive an old-age pension. His neighbour owns and occupies a similar house in the same class which would also have been valued at R15 000 ten years ago. This person may also apply for an old-age pension, but his house is now valued at R23 000. The result is that he now falls above the limit of R34 000 as a result of the valuation of his house and the balance of his capital and therefore may not qualify for the minimum pension, while in fact he is financially less well-off than his neighbour. It therefore seems fair to me to ask for an adjustment of the means test or to ask for a new basis for the valuation of houses owned and occupied by elderly people when they apply for an old-age pension. For example, we could introduce a maximum of R15 000. This would prevent many contradictions and great unhappiness.</p>

<p>There is one last matter to which I should like to refer. The hon. the Deputy Minister did in fact deal with it in full, but I think it is so important that it will do no harm if I, too, refer to it from another point of view. I am referring to the fact that parents, as the saying goes, distribute their possessions amongst their heirs before they die. It happens that parents sell their properties such as farms and other properties, to their children for a song, or perhaps give them away for nothing. As the hon. the Deputy Minister pointed out, those parents are then not properly and correctly looked after by their children. In fact they are then forced to apply for an old-age pension. Sir, I want to say that this is not fair. Indeed, I want to say that it is not honest, because it is not the duty of the State to look after the indigent parents of rich children.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think it would be as well if some people developed a new approach in respect of old-age pensions, viz. that it is a method by which the State could care for the truly <i>bona fide</i> indigent aged; it is not a way of making a few quick rand out of the State.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Umbilo referred in passing to the problem of the breaking up of families and the hon. member for Pinelands referred to the permissiveness and prostitution and the dens of vice in the harbours, etc. I should like to refer to a matter very closely connected with this, and which runs through our community like a rusty piece of barbed wire, with the damage which that causes. It is a matter about which we can never say enough and before which we must never flinch. I am referring to the old problem of alcoholism. In 1974 an international congress was held on alcoholism, where more than 400 delegates spoke on this matter. The whole matter was analysed. The causes of alcoholism were analysed. The various ways of combating it were analysed. Analyses were also made of the economic and social consequences of alcoholism, and the breaking-up of families it caused. There is one important aspect which was accepted by all these delegates, and which must also be accepted by us and by the whole country, and this is that the only way in which this problem can be approached, is on the basis of a multi-disciplinary function. The most important aspect of this is the community in which the person concerned lives. We saw wonderful results and fine examples of the rehabilitation of the alcoholic, the real addict. Last year 473 men and 126 women were referred by the State of institutions where this rehabilitation work is done. They are compelled by an order to stay there for seven or eight months. They are rehabilitated to a certain level, both physically and mentally. However, I personally had the privilege of being involved with the bodies and persons that treat these people and try to rehabilitate them and in my opinion there is no way to rehabilitate a person like this other than placing him back in his own environment, where he comes from, and then doing follow-up work. In the case of alcoholism a person like this is not fully rehabilitated before a period of at least five years has passed. This is precisely our problem, because the Department of Social Welfare does not have sufficient staff to carry out that follow-up work. This is why I say that it is so important for it to be the function of the community to be interested in these people.</p>

<p>What is the attitude of the community towards alcoholism at the moment? People trip <span class="col_7753-7754" refersTo="page_1207"/>over the alcoholic in the street, and then say, &#x201C;shame&#x201D;. The alcoholic is seen in a bar, in disarray, after the breaking-up of the family and tragedy have already taken place. The State must not then be expected to rehabilitate a person like this. It is the duty of the community itself. As far as these addicts are concerned, we have the problem that as regards the one we see in the street and consider a bar-fly or alcoholic, the State does indeed do its share, but the greatest loss of manpower, the greatest fragmentation of families and the greatest damage done to the community, is not done by that type of person, but by those that are hidden, those from the well-off classes. The community accepts alcoholism and addiction as part of the community; the addict is an accepted part of the community. If he does not behave, he is locked up for a little while. The rich man who is an alcoholic, takes leave, and when he has slept it off, he returns to the community; this is what the important man does, too. I have had the privilege of seeing advocates and doctors, who constitute the highest and best manpower in our country, in that position, but we protect them and conceal them, because &#x201C;what will people say if I have anything to do with that person?&#x201D; Therefore I once again want to pay tribute to the task of the communities that do see this matter in that light. Here I have in mind in particular the S.A. National Council for Alcoholism. There is a ray of light in this difficult position, and it is that the medal of merit of the State President was allotted to Dr. Slater who, I am sure, received that medal of merit largely due to his fine work as president of the S.A. National Council for Alcoholism. We do not expect the State to subsidize these organizations, because this is the function of the community.</p>

<p>But, Sir, if I still have a minute or two, I should also like to refer to another aspect which is closely connected with this. The crisis clinic in Johannesburg has now been in operation for three years. This clinic has dealt with 4 519 cases over the past year. As a result of the immense demand by people in a crisis situation, they have already had to double their staff, and they have a voluntary corps of 30 people who assist them in the form of psychiatrists, doctors and sociologists. I should like to ask the Minister if it would not be possible also to extend this idea of a crisis clinic, which is operating so successfully in Johannesburg now, to other densely populated parts of our country. If one sees the analysis of the type of person they deal with there, one finds it a tragedy that emotional problems resulting from frustration, from the fact that people are unable to keep pace in this materialistic world, constitute approximately 60% of the cases. The next step from there that he take to alcoholism as an escape from his responsibilities and the things in the community he cannot accept. I should greatly appreciate it if everyone of us could do his share to propagate this type of clinic and the work of these bodies as far as possible and also take an active part in it, because in this way we can only do this country a favour.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I could not have wished to have followed any other speaker as much as I will enjoy following the hon. member who has just sat down, because everything that he has said in regard to the responsibility and the problems he has referred to, I endorse wholeheartedly. While he referred particularly to the question of the crisis clinic in Johannesburg, I was going to appeal to the hon. the Minister this afternoon as a matter of priority to establish a crisis clinic in Durban. I understand that there is the clinic of this nature operating in Cape Town, but I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that the need in Durban is just as great, if not greater. My reasons for saying so are, firstly, that Durban is one of the busiest ports in the Republic. It is a premier holiday resort and it has a climate which attracts many visitors, many layabouts and many vagrants. I believe that the layabouts and vagrants particularly are in need of some service which operates continually. The crisis clinic in Johannesburg, as I understand the position, operates 24 hours a day and seven days a week because it has an emergency telephone number which people can contact in case of need.</p>

<p>What is the position in Durban at the present moment? In regard to this question I can speak from personal experience. When the office of the Department of Social Welfare closes at 5 o&#x2019;clock on Friday afternoons there is no emergency contact with the Department of Social Welfare until Monday. Also on public holidays, when the city is usually crowded with visitors, there are no means of contact in the case of urgent matters with the Department of Social Welfare. Take, for example, the <span class="col_7755-7756" refersTo="page_1208"/>question of a man with an alcohol problem and who has been released on parole. He goes to stay with relations or old friends and if he misbehaves or breaks parole, the only course of action open to the persons concerned is to call the Police. The Police are usually sympathetic, but are understaffed and are not there to deal with problems of that nature in any case. As my colleague here will bear me out, unless the man on parole is found to be drunk or disorderly in a home, it is also not possible for the Police to remove him from there without incurring possible legal complications themselves. It is therefore absolutely essential that consideration be given to the extension, as the hon. member for Brentwood has asked, of these crisis clinics.</p>

<p>I want to refer to some of the good that has been done and some of the facts that have emerged from the experience gained at the crisis clinic in Johannesburg. These matters are referred to in the latest report of the department. It is interesting to note that the largest single problem is caused by a combination of alcohol, dagga and drugs. The interesting result of the approximately 2 000 cases which were analysed, is that 12&#x0025; fall within the age group 12 to 17 years&#x2014;in other words, from Std. 5 upwards. This brings me to Cape Town, where I believe a clinic operates, but where almost a crisis situation appears to exist as far as young people are concerned. This position has come to light as a result of Press disclosures and here I believe <i>The Cape Times</i> has played a prominent part judging from a front page headline which reads: &#x201C;Police asked to help stop teenage drinkers&#x201D;. Apparently the motivation for this Press appeal came from the joint council of the S.A. Onderwysersunie and the S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Association because they were disturbed by the fact that young people, teenagers below the age of 18, were being found in these places in an intoxicated condition. The regrettable part about it is that although the police have been approached they have their problems.</p>

<p>I know that the licensees have problems, but the problems that the police have are, firstly, that they are 15&#x0025; under their established strength in White personnel alone and that they have difficulty in determining the age of sophisticated-looking teenagers. Tragically enough, they seem to get little co-operation from the parents themselves when these are informed of the unfortunate circumstances in which their own children find themselves. The attempts to curb this have stemmed from a teachers&#x2019; association which referred this matter to the police. As a result of this school principals are now being asked to notify parents concerned when the police pass certain information on to them. However, there is not only this aspect to it&#x2014;the overall incidence of drunkenness gives cause for grave concern, because I believe it is a serious problem of great magnitude. The latest police report, i.e. the report for 1974, indicates that there has been a 20&#x0025; increase in drunkenness and a 16&#x0025; increase in the incidence of drunken driving. My hon. colleague for Brentwood referred to the question of the first international conference on alcoholism and drugs, and I believe that the hon. the Minister and his department showed enterprise and initiative in organizing this conference which took place in 1974. The report that has flowed from that revealed certain disturbing aspects. I shall quote one example. On page 156 of the report Dr. N. Marks, senior consultant in the Department of Psychiatry at Groote Schuur Hospital, is quoted as saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Almost 50&#x0025; of the admissions to the psychiatric casualty ward at Groote Schuur Hospital are occasioned by alcohol.</block>

<p>In 1969 I drew the attention of the then Minister, the hon. Dr. C. Mulder, to alcohol advertisements and promotional techniques apparently directed at young people. His comment was&#x2014;I quote from Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While one man places his advertisement, and has the right to do so, it is the task of another man to educate people so as to ensure that these developments will not be abused.</block>

<p>My question to this hon. Minister is: Who is this &#x201C;other man&#x201D; to whom his predecessor referred? It cannot be the liquor interests themselves because they are naturally interested in the promotion of their products. It is certainly not the South African National Council of Alcoholism&#x2014;we know they perform wonderful redemptive work in respect of alcoholics and problem drinkers, but in terms of their own constitution, the association cannot engage itself in any activity designed to prevent, to promote or to combat the legal <span class="col_7757-7758" refersTo="page_1209"/>manufacture, sale, consumption or use of alcoholic beverages. Therefore, surely it is time that the State itself took a hard look at this situation.</p>

<p>During the coming year the Minister of Finance expects to collect R309 million from excise duties on alcoholic beverages. However, as is shown by the Vote before us, the Minister for Social Welfare and Pensions receives only a paltry fraction of that amount for channelling to welfare organizations involved in the problems of increasing alcohol consumption and in the provision of rehabilitation services.</p>

<p>As far as rehabilitation services are concerned, one reads in chapter V, page 33, of the latest report that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After thorough consideration it was decided that the department &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the department of this Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; would henceforth subsidize the whole service for all population groups.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he realizes the magnitude of this responsibility? Can he tell the Committee what resources in the way of manpower he is able to deploy for each respective population group? He must be aware of the findings of the CSIR which in its report discloses that in the Cape Peninsula the average per capita expenditure by Bantu is R5 per month on strong drink compared with a mere 50 cent on Bantu beer.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as always, the hon. member for Berea made a positive contribution. He asked very important questions to which the hon. the Minister will reply. I know that the hon. member will not take it amiss if I do not react further to the points he raised. The hon. member for Hercules correctly referred to the settlements for handicapped people and also for the aged. Therefore I should like to draw attention to the Sonop settlement for handicapped people, situated in the constituency which I represent. I should like very briefly to bring to the attention of this House the praiseworthy things which are being done there by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions.</p>

<p>During the past number of years great changes and improvements have been brought about which have practically changed completely the whole appearance of the former labour camp, which consisted of rows and rows of asbestos houses in the old days, so that today it looks completely like a thriving and attractive settlement town where handicapped people are being accommodated. During the year 1971&#x2013;&#x2019;72 the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions added a fine, modern, well-equipped hall to the settlement. That hall replaced the antiquated and unsightly timber hall. A graceful church is situated in close proximity. To a certain degree it has improved the appearance of the settlement, so that the settlers are very proud of it today. A little while ago a new post office was built, and these three buildings together really increased the aesthetic appearance of the Sonop Settlement considerably. This is no more than right, because as far as both social and upliftment work are concerned, the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions lays great stress on the aesthetic. For this reason the department takes into consideration the attractive surroundings as well as the fine buildings in order to realize the great ideal of welfare work.</p>

<p>I want to add that there is also an old-age home at the settlement, where aged and handicapped people are being accommodated. I am pleased, and I want to congratulate the department on this, that they used their own labour, namely the labour of rehabilitated people to erect the attractive hall there. By way of a modernization project they are at present converting the old age home in to a useful building. I think that the division for women is complete, and when the men&#x2019;s division has been completed, we shall be able to accommodate no less than 87 handicapped and aged people there. It will then really be a place where the aged and handicapped will be dealt with in a pleasant way and with devotion. Not only is the old-age home being renovated; what is interesting, is that they are also modernizing the kitchen in the old-age home completely. I hear that, in close collaboration with the dieticians of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, they are drawing up a diet scale there. Once all the modern domestic equipment has been purchased, the old people there will be able to enjoy meals prepared from a modern, scientific menu, and they will be able to enjoy a balanced diet. If the hon. member on the other side would also prepare his political diet in this way and serve it in <span class="col_7759-7760" refersTo="page_1210"/>such a balanced way, it would not be necessary for me to suffer from political indigestion when I listen to what he sometimes says here. But I shall leave it at that. As I said, they are modernizing the kitchen. The old age home will then be a place where our aged will be cared for in a very pleasant manner.</p>

<p>However, where I referred to this fine hall, the church, the post office and the new old age home, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the settlers are longingly looking forward to the day when a project to erect new houses there will be commenced. I know that the old asbestos houses have disappeared and that the old timber houses were subsequently erected, but at the moment those houses are in such a condition that, although they are not actually dilapidated, it will serve practically no purpose to repair them. However, after a while an embarrassing situation will develop on that settlement, and I am pleased to see in this report that the hon. the Minister in collaboration with the Department of Public Works announced that, they intend to plan for the erection of 100 new homes to replace the existing homes in the settlement. This is in the most recent report. Unfortunately, the tender date has, however, been extended. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what the new tender date is. I hear that it has been postponed until 1977, and I just want to ask that it should not be postponed any further. When the day arrives when we shall have this fine housing scheme there, together with the new buildings which are already there, Sonop will really be a fine place. I do not want to speak politically, but in the old days, when I came to the House of Assembly, in those dark years when not much attention was given to those handicapped people, Sonop was an inviting name, but to me it was rather a place of concentrated misery and of sunset. Matters are different today. Those days it was a question of social &#x201C;ill fare&#x201D; and not Social welfare. Today a completely different situation is prevailing there. I want to thank the hon. the Minister sincerely for the fact that today we have no fewer than 600 settlers, i.e. handicapped, aged people and children there. I think it was the hon. member for Umbilo who spoke about professionals. However, I think that social work as a whole is already on professional level. Today we have a great many social workers. At that settlement there is a professional approach. We know that not only must the physical needs be attended to. One also has to deal with spiritual rehabilitation and reconstruction. I find it gratifying to see that there is a social worker and that 24 families receive intensive social services. The problems are ascertained and it is not long before they are professionally solved. At that settlement many case studies and group studies take place.</p>

<p>A club for women has already been founded. The women can do needlework and tapestry work there. A club for men and boys is also being founded now. I believe that there will soon be a jukskei pitch and a bowling green. Of course, bowling is a marvellous sport. It is a sport which can be played by both young and old. At the moment I also play bowls. Would it not be wonderful if, in my old age, I could play bowls with the handicapped and aged there? All the hon. members who live in the vicinity of Brits and Pretoria and who are fond of playing bowls, must go and see what fine work has been done by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. They should just go and see what a wonderful balance is maintained between spiritual and physical reconstruction there. They should see what wonderful facilities have been established there and how spirit and body are co-ordinated. A clean pure body naturally accommodates clean, pure, noble thoughts. I want to tell the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions that it has done excellent work there. As far as I can recall the hon. Ministers of Social Welfare and Pensions also paid a visit there. This also applies to all the Deputy Ministers. No wonder that it is such a fine and excellent settlement.</p>

<p>However, I want to make a heartfelt plea and ask the hon. the Minister to pay attention to the erection of the fine buildings which are required there. Then we shall see what a fine settlement we shall have there, a settlement where the elderly people and the handicapped will find a happy home.</p>

<p><span class="col_7761-7762" refersTo="page_1211"/>The handicapped person is a person who is unable, as a result of physical and mental deficiencies, to derive sufficient income from a job or a profession to enable him to provide adequately for his own requirements. Such persons over the age of 16 years&#x2014;if they comply with further requirements as well&#x2014; qualify for disability pension benefits. It is essential, in the first place, to take cognizance of the socio-economic circumstances of these handicapped persons. Because possibilities of employment, and the opportunities for employment these involve, play a dominant and a very important role in the life of handicapped persons, cognizance must be taken of the geographical distribution and the mobility of handicapped persons. We find that 44&#x0025; of the handicapped persons live in urban areas, while 34,9&#x0025; live in towns and 21,1&#x0025; on holdings and farms. Many of those handicapped persons are still able, to a greater or lesser degree, to perform certain kinds of labour, especially in sheltered employment. Consequently we must take note of the fact that almost 45&#x0025; of the handicapped persons live in cities, where such employment opportunities are available. It is true that only a small percentage of those who receive a disability pension do in fact perform any labour for a wage&#x2014;only 6,9&#x0025;. Work is certainly the best stimulus for developing a feeling of self-respect and interest in life on the part of those handicapped persons.</p>

<p>From an investigation undertaken by the department it appeared that those who made use of sheltered employment were mostly those suffering from cerebral palsy and mental retardation, i.e. 50&#x0025;. Others were employed in the farming industry and in unskilled labour. However, it is important to note that 87&#x0025; of the handicapped persons who were wage-earners indicated that they were happy in their work. One concludes from this that these people are handicapped in the first place through not being able to be fully absorbed into the normal labour market, and that consequently they would like to be placed in some kind of employment. I believe that this is not only in order to have an additional income, but also because they would like to occupy themselves in a productive and constructive way.</p>

<p>I want to advocate that more and more opportunities should be created for those people. However, the creation of job opportunities is not only the task of the department and of the State, but also that of the private sector, which will have to contribute its share in this respect. A large percentage of the handicapped persons who were involved in the investigation proved to be able to perform wage labour again in sheltered circumstances and provided that the nature of their handicap permitted this. Less than half the people in that group of handicapped persons&#x2014;those of them who are still able to perform wage labour&#x2014;are voluntarily prepared to undertake such work. A total of 51,34&#x0025; is not prepared to perform wage labour. It also appears from the investigation that the younger group&#x2014;those between 16 and 29 years&#x2014;chiefly fall in the latter category. I suppose there are many explanations for this tendency. However, it is not easy to find a scientific explanation for this phenomenon. I am convinced, however, that if an early start is made with the provision of proper training and with the placing of people in sheltered employment, those people will increasingly and confidently enter the field of wage labour.</p>

<p>For this reason I am grateful for the fact that the department, in co-operation with its various welfare organizations, has appointed a work group to investigate matters such as the following&#x2014;and I quote from the annual report&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) The establishment of places of protective employment for the seriously handicapped in the community.</li>

<li>(2) The establishment of facilities where the working capacity of potential recipients of disability grants can be scientifically determined, which can serve to promote their rehabilitation and prepare them for employment.</li>

</ol>

<p>Once again I want to make a request which has often been made in the past, i.e. that when a building is planned, regard will be had to those people who have to make use of wheelchairs to get to their places of employment or to enter buildings. Surely it is not so difficult to include a sloping ramp next to the stairs of a building in the architect&#x2019;s design for such a building. Many handicapped persons would like to enter buildings in their wheelchairs and they are embarrassed if they have to seek help in order to move up and down the stairs. These people <span class="col_7763-7764" refersTo="page_1212"/>also like to visit public places such as museums, theatres, etc. Buildings with facilities of this nature have already been erected. I think, for example, of the Art Gallery in Pretoria, which has been converted in order to provide these facilities to such handicapped persons. Therefore I am grateful for the fact that the work group to which I have referred will give attention to this matter as well and that steps will be taken to avoid the architectural obstructions for handicapped persons in public buildings.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by conveying my thanks to the institutions which care for handicapped persons in such an unselfish way. These people render a service of love to their fellow-man which cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed. However, the need for such homes is still great, because there are only 16 such homes at the moment, accommodating approximately 700 people. For this reason one is grateful for the fact that the per capita subsidies paid by the State in respect of approved subeconomic inmates of institutions for the handicapped have again been increased and that as from 1 October 1976, it will be R58,50 per inmate for institutions which employ specialized staff. These subsidies have been increased by almost 58&#x0025; since 1971. As regards institutions in which approved sub-economic inmates are accommodated, the increase since 1971 is 63&#x0025;, and it will be R35,50 per inmate as from 1 October 1976. We are very grateful for and appreciative of the unselfish work done by the management and especially by the staff of these institutions. I want to pay tribute to those who devote their lives to this service of love to their fellow-man.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. VILONEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the sphere of activity of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions covers the whole span of life, because it affects people of all ages. In fact, we may say that it extends from the cradle to the grave, from A to Z or from the beginning to the end. To mention an example, it extends from the baby who was abandoned just after birth, to the juvenile delinquent in his puberty, to the adulthood of a person who is unable to work as a result of epilepsy or something of that nature, to the elderly people who are too old to work, those who are already on pension. Even though this work covers the whole spectrum, it is clear to me that the bottlenecks or the areas of greatest activity occur at the poles of this spectrum. The debate which has taken place here this afternoon has clearly proved again that the question at issue very often concerns children or elderly people. So the bottlenecks are at the extremes of this spectrum, and I want to express a few thoughts on these two areas today.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said this afternoon about child abuse. As a doctor, this is something which concerns me very closely, because if you come into actual contact with such cases, it is not only an interesting phenomenon, but one in which you are directly involved. The Bible tells us: &#x201C;Honour thy father and thy mother: That thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&#x201D; The Bible very definitely does not say that parents should not honour their children so that their days, often in the literal sense, may be long upon the land on which we live at the moment. I do not want to repeat all the arguments, because I think the matter has been debated in quite some detail. Yet I do want to highlight two aspects of child abuse and to voice a few thoughts in this connection.</p>

<p>I am referring to the question of heavier penalties in cases where people are convicted and to the question of whether a doctor should report these cases or not. As far as the first aspect is concerned, there are several opinions. It is well known that Dr. Yutar, the Transvaal Attorney-General, sent out a circular in which he held out the prospect of stricter action by the courts. Hon. members know that such cases are immediately referred to regional courts. A person can even be accused of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. This is the kind of action envisaged by Dr. Yutar. Strangely enough, this caused several opinions to be expressed. In <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 2 March 1976, the following report appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Die Nasionale Raad vir Kinder- en Gesinsorg verwelkom die persoonlike be-langstelling van dr. Percy Yutar, Prokureur-generaal van Transvaal, oor die tragiese verskynsel van kindermishandeling. Die raad stem egter nie met hom saam oor die waarde or regverdiging van die swaarder strawwe nie.&#x201D; So lui die verklaring van mev. Elsa Dowling, die direktrise van die raad. &#x201C;Swaarder strawwe is slegs &#x2019;n futiele poging om die gemeenskap se <span class="col_7765-7766" refersTo="page_1213"/>gewete te sus. Die ware oplossing verg &#x2019;n veel meet subjektiewe gemeenskaplike be-nadering en positiewe optrede &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>The report then goes on to say that Mrs. Dowling does not agree with Dr. Yutar at all that such people are criminals, and that people who ill-treat children are sick, etc. I want to come out very strongly in favour of heavier penalties. However, I want to make it quite clear that one advocates heavier penalties as part of a team effort which must be made to combat child abuse. Heavier penalties alone will get us nowhere. It is a question of heavier penalties together with other measures to which I shall refer.</p>

<p>Prof. Van Rooyen, professor of criminal law and procedure at the University of South Africa, puts the matter as follows, and I want to agree wholeheartedly with what he said in <i>Hoofstad</i> of 5 March 1976&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Swaarder vonnisse op sigself sal nie &#x2019;n voldoende teenmiddel wees nie. Die ouer wat sy kind mishandel, is gewoonlik in so &#x2019;n emosionele spanning dat hy nie die wet of die moontlikheid van &#x2019;n hofsaak in ag neem nie. Aan die ander kant dien die strafreg beslis &#x2019;n dissiplin&#x00EA;re doel met die vorming van die openbare moreel en mening. Hoewel die neiging na vergelding en wraak deesdae ongewild is, meen ek dat dit nogtans belangrik is in die strafreg.</block>

<p>I could not improve on that statement. I repeat that I wholeheartedly support heavier penalties, but as part of a whole, as part of a team effort.</p>

<p>This brings me to the doctors. I think the hon. member for Boksburg also referred to this. He said that people were afraid to report child abusers and that witnesses did not want to talk. He said he wanted to lay more emphasis on the fact that the doctor should report such cases. If the intention is that the doctor should report such cases to the Police, I very emphatically say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. This cannot work, and I shall tell hon. members why not. As soon as a doctor who is worth his salt&#x2014;and I assure hon. members that 99,99&#x0025; of doctors are worth their salt&#x2014;notices that his patient has been ill-treated, he does not treat only a minor injury or bum; he treates a whole family. Fortunately I have not encountered many such cases, but I do know what I am talking about. When one is faced with such a case, one has a major task. It is not just a question of applying a little ointment to a minor injury; it involves the treatment of the whole family. It involves the treatment of a father and a mother; it involves the treatment of the whole family set-up. For this reason I say that as soon as a doctor reports such a case to the police, the people will dissociate themselves from the doctor, who is usually the one who can play the most important part in solving the problem by treating the family. For this reason I believe that a doctor cannot normally report a case of child abuse to the police.</p>

<p>However, there is something which the doctor can do, and this brings me to the team effort I have referred to. The treatment of child abuse is the task of the doctor, the social worker and the minister of religion. This team must work together, joined by other people I could mention. In this respect the doctor may involve other persons in the matter, but he definitely cannot report such a case to the police. There are other aspects as well, such as ethical considerations by which a doctor is bound not to disclose to others what he knows about people. That is another aspect which is relevant here, but I shall leave it at that for the moment.</p>

<p>The other extreme of the spectrum which I mentioned is our senior citizens. What is needed? Is money all that is needed? We have spoken a good deal about money today. It has been said that our old people should get more money. I concede that money is very important. One uses it for buying food and clothes and one needs it for accommodation, but I want to make it quite clear that in my opinion, the social pension is only supplementary. It is not all that matters. It must not absolve a person of the responsibility of providing for his old age himself. Nor does it absolve the family of the responsibility of caring for the aged. It does not absolve the community of the responsibility of caring for the aged in that community. As I have said, the social pension is merely supplementary. When people talk about abolishing the means test, I want to say that it simply cannot be abolished. It is estimated that if we were to abolish it today, it would cost us R170 million immediately. However, when people talk about reconsidering the means test, I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. members for Umbilo and Parys <span class="col_7767-7768" refersTo="page_1214"/>that we must review certain aspects of that means test. But, Sir, we are not a welfare state. We cannot just abolish something like this. The country cannot afford it, and we do not want to be a welfare state.</p>

<p>Sir, I ask again: What do the aged need? They do need money, but there are other tremendously important needs. One need which these old people have is a need for love. They must be visited by our people, because they are lonely. We can give those old people as much money as we like, but if we cannot overcome the problem of loneliness, it will be of no avail. I want to add that our old people must receive priority when it comes to the allocation of telephones. The telephone is a tremendous help in such circumstances. There are welfare organizations which present gifts to our old people. Here I am thinking especially of something like a radio, or even a television set. Something of this kind can be a tremendous help in fighting that loneliness.</p>

<p>There are two other matters I should like to mention very briefly. In the first place, the hon. member for Umbilo spoke of parents who go out to work and of children who are then neglected. I believe that our old people could play a much more important role in this connection. Our old people could help us to look after our children while we are working. This would help the aged person in his loneliness and would also provide a decent education for the children. Even the financial aspect could then be considered. So my plea is that we should help elderly people in this way by involving them in families where the parents go out to work. They must not be kept apart so that the old people and the children do not get together.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to ask whether there might not be certain kinds of work which we could give to our old people in the old-age homes. I might mention a rather foolish example, which is not really so foolish when one considers it seriously. One thinks, for example, of machinery that has to be assembled. It might just be a case of parts that have to be screwed down. Perhaps our old people could be given such work. If they were to assemble machines, for example, they could be paid by the unit. It would keep them busy and take away their loneliness. They could then be employed in a productive way and earn something at the same time. However, the incomes they earn must not be deducted from their social pensions. One is glad that the State and private bodies co-operate in regard to welfare services. This is the policy and this is the way it is implemented in practice, and I think that this is a very good thing. The State contributes its share, but we all have to co-operate. Social Welfare is a matter which affects the whole nation and a task in which the whole nation must participate.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as regards the remarks of the hon. member for Krugersdorp about the means test, I want to say to him that the argument advanced by the hon. member for Umbilo over the years has not been that the means test should be abolished as such, but that the means test would in effect become abolished with the introduction of a contributory pension scheme. You cannot do the one without the other.</p>

<p>Sir, I wish to deal specifically with the question of old-age homes. I am sure everybody in the House will agree that it is desirable for families to look after their elderly, even those elderly who are ill, although in such cases not to such an extent. That is an ideal situation. Unfortunately, however, not all families are in a position to look after their elderly, particularly elderly sick people. Therefore I say that the responsibility for providing homes to accommodate elderly and elderly sick people rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government. The problem at the moment is that there are simply not enough of such institutions. What is happening is that the Government is relying on private individuals to convert existing buildings into old-age homes to accommodate the sick and the elderly people. I believe that this is not the answer at all. I believe this is a completely wrong development, and in the few minutes available to me, Mr. Chairman, I am going to try to tell the Minister the reasons why I think it is wrong.</p>

<p>First of all, with the conversion of old buildings into old-age homes, very often completely inadequate facilities for old-age homes are provided. Houses that are converted are just not suitable, more particularly in respect of the accommodation necessary for nurses, most of whom are Black nurse aids. It creates all sorts of additional social problems in the area where the conversion takes place. In addition there is often insufficient parking. It also leads to traffic congestion and what is <span class="col_7769-7770" refersTo="page_1215"/>very important, I think, is that it brings about a change in the character of an area in which old houses, very often Victorian houses, are converted into old-age homes. It is against the wishes, very often, of neighbours, people who have come to live in that area, that the character of the area becomes changed. It is harmful to small businesses in such an area. The small businessmen very often are dependent on people resident in the area to make of their businesses a success. But old-age homes buy in the cheapest bulk markets. They buy mainly from their own suppliers and the small businessmen are simply put out of business, as a result of the change in the character of the whole area. Lastly, Sir, I want to say that it is detrimental to planning by local authorities, because if I for example were to own a building, a large Victorian building, and I wished to change it into an old-age home, I would apply to the department, without the knowledge of the local authority concerned, for its registration as an old-age home. If I were to obtain that registration after an inspection by the departmental officials, I would be entitled to go into business and to receive a subsidy from the department concerned for each patient that I house in that old-age home. The local authority therefore has no control over the development of buildings or the change in character of buildings into old-age homes.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say that there is a company in South Africa, called Smith, Mitchell &amp; Co., which has gone into this business in a very big way. It has something like a hundred institutions under its control. It is in fact aggravating the situation, because after acquiring old buildings and changing their character by turning them into old-age homes it thereafter goes to the department for registration as old-age homes and receives a subsidy from the department. The department is therefore being spared to an extent the capital cost of putting up buildings. But at the same time the department is being short-sighted. It has in fact its head in the sand, because it is creating all sorts of other social problems, other problems which are the concern of this particular department. In this particular case they house all sorts of patients in the same institutions. In one institution to which I am going to refer in a minute, they not only have elderly people who are healthy, but also elderly people who are sick and elderly people who are, to say the least of it, mental. At the same time they have people of younger age groups, people who are also in that category that I would describe as retarded people. They are all together in the same institution. The reason why this company is in this business is not because of their philanthropic outlook at all. It looks at the investment possibilities. It sees an area which is run-down, an area which has had its day. It buys up buildings and changes them into old-age homes. It then gets subsidies from the Government and this gives them a decent income. They also make arrangements with pensioners whereby they acquire the rights to their pensions. They take over the pensions payable to the individual, in addition to getting a subsidy from the department and they then write for capital appreciation to take place, because the area ultimately will change as it becomes more and more run-down. So they are getting it all ways. In some ways they are indeed helping the department. That I concede. But in many other ways they are contributing to all sorts of social evils which result from the establishment of these homes in old areas which then become more and more run-down.</p>

<p>I want to give an example. There is the coastal area of Kalk Bay and Muizenberg. In the case of Muizenberg, an attempt by the local authority is being made after years and years, to replan the Muizenberg complex. Many old buildings are there. They have been turned into old-age homes. All of this is retarding the attempt by the local authority to redevelop the area, and no one can convince me that an area like Muizenberg is suitable as an area for old-age homes. It is surely one of the areas which could go ahead as a tourist resort. I think it is one of the best we have in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>That is the same argument as the Sea Point swimming-bath argument.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Sure, but you surely do not locate your old-age homes in areas which are more suitable for other purposes. And the same applies to Kalk Bay. There one Government department has advanced R1 million for the development of a small boat harbour, but instead of going ahead with the small boat harbour it is being delayed by the fact that the municipality is unable to provide <span class="col_7771-7772" refersTo="page_1216"/>access to the harbour, and another one of the reasons being that it may involve the demolition of one of the buildings that have been converted into old-age homes. There again, through the action of this particular company turning their buildings into old-age homes and receiving a subsidy from the department, the development of the area for a tourist attraction and for recreational purposes is being retarded.</p>

<p>There is therefore a contradiction in objectives between various Government departments. The Department of Planning and the Environment tries to maintain certain standards whilst the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is contributing, by means of a subsidy, to the maintenance of buildings which have been converted to a use other than that originally planned and which have accordingly changed the character of the area in which they are situated. It is not in the interest of the patients, because it is impossible to convert many of these old buildings into suitable old-age homes. The Government is not doing its duty by providing new buildings, the local authority planning for the area is being disrupted and the work of other Government departments, such as the overall planning of the Department of Planning and the Environment, is being affected. Lastly, particularly in the areas to which I have referred, namely Muizenberg and Kalk Bay, the Department of Tourism should be very much in the picture when it comes to the development of those two resorts. At one time these were very popular resorts, but they have since become run-down. The efforts of this department to promote regional tourism is also being hampered by the creation of old-age homes in the area with the assistance of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions.</p>

<p>That in effect is my argument, and I would ask the hon. the Minister to try to deal with my argument in the spirit in which I have put it forward. I have not tried to throw stones or to criticize the companies concerned. I have tried to refer to the fact that this is an unhealthy development more than anything else. I am asking the Government to give serious consideration to a crash building programme to provide old-age homes rather than to subsidize homes that have been converted for this purpose.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, after listening to the discussion of this Vote hon. members will agree with me when I say that an exceptionally wide field has been covered, that almost all the ramifications of the activities of the department have been touched upon, and that this was done in a truly positive spirit. To tell the truth, I cannot say that I gained the impression that any time during the discussions that the arguments were becoming political. I am very grateful that this was the case. I should have liked to have replied in detail to all the arguments, but I do not know whether the time allocated to me will be sufficient. If certain questions which have been put to me remain unanswered, I shall undertake, on my part, to furnish written replies to those questions.</p>

<p>I should like to begin, because I have not yet had an opportunity to do so, by conveying my congratulations to the new Deputy Minister, Mr. Janson, and thanking him for the cooperation we have already had so far; I want to express my appreciation in anticipation, too, for the co-operation which will follow in future. He is of course, by virtue of his many years of experience as a clergyman and also by virtue of the fact that his good wife is a social worker, eminently suited to this task, and I know that we have in him a source of strength of whom we will in future be able to make good use.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands said something at the outset for which I have great appreciation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;He referred to a visit by Parliamentarians to various institutions of the department and he specially mentioned a visit to one of the refugee camps. I should like to say that I am indebted to him for having placed his appreciation on record.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, people have very short memories, and I think I owe it to the department to say that the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, in co-operation of course with various other departments, really performed a Herculean task during the past year in regard to the care of refugees from Mozambique and Angola. I do not want to tire hon. members with figures, but I do want to mention that the department took care of 33 005 refugees at a total cost to the department of R640 248. I want to emphasize that the lion&#x2019;s share of this work was done by a <span class="col_7773-7774" refersTo="page_1217"/>small band of dedicated officials of the department, people who really deserve the appreciation of all of us. I have already referred to this on other occasions, and I think they are aware of it, but we owe it to them to place it on record in this hon. House as well.</p>

<p>In the course of the debate we listened to quite a number of hon. members who asked for improved and additional benefits and facilities. In this way the hon. members for Umbilo, Pinelands, Parys and Jeppe asked for the relaxation and adjustment of the means test. The hon. member for Uitenhage asked for more generous provision of social relief grants. Other hon. members, including the hon. member for South Coast, asked for better housing for the aged. The hon. member for Simonstown has just been discussing that subject. He referred to a crash programme for the housing of aged persons. In this way emphasis was to a great extent placed on the provision and furnishing of better facilities and benefits, better pensions, increased grants, etc. I understand all these things. They are permitted in the course of the activities of a member of Parliament, and it is essential that these things be advocated. It is also in the interests of the cause we are trying to serve. However, I am particularly pleased that several other members also pointed out the duties of the community and, more specifically, the duties of the relatives and children of persons requiring assistance. I am thinking here, <i>inter alia</i>, of the hon. members for Hercules, Parys and Krugersdorp, who pointed out very clearly the duty resting on the community and emphasized that one cannot shift everything onto the State as though the State were exclusively responsible for the care of indigent people, to ensure that they receive a decent pension, etc. I shall return to certain of these aspects later, and try to reply to questions which were put to me in this regard.</p>

<p>Actually I want to begin with the references which were made to the annual report of the department, and more specifically to the introduction to the report. The hon. member for Umbilo, as well as the hon. member for Westdene, referred to it. With reference to it I want to remind hon. members that when I replied for the first time as the responsible Minister to the discussion of this Vote in 1974, I made it very clear that it is the established tradition in South Africa that the State and private welfare organizations are partners in the performance of this task. With reference to the question put to me by the hon. member for Westdene, I just want to say that we are not, with what we wrote in the introduction to the annual report, contemplating any departure from that policy. The idea of partnership must continue to exist. You will recall, Mr. Chairman, that I also said at the time that our welfare policy in South Africa, however good or however defective it might be, was not a rigid policy. It is a policy which will have to be adapted and in which innovations will have to be made as we gain experience and as research proves that we were wrong in certain directions and that we have to adopt new courses. That is why I say that we should see the annual report as an attempt to stimulate our people to co-operation in order to bring about innovation and essential adjustments. What is required is to determine the needs scientifically and to plan accordingly in an effort to meet those needs. In this regard I could point out that a very interesting experiment was conducted in the Vaal Triangle last year, about which more will be published later, in which the regional welfare board, and a committee which was established and in which all interested parties were involved, went into the matter to determine what the actual needs of that region were.</p>

<p>The results achieved with that inquiry were very encouraging. In fact it also gave direction to our idea to tackle our planning with new zeal. It proved to us that if we did it in this way, there was a far greater involvement of the local community in the welfare task, that certain needs had emerged of which one had not been aware, although one lived in that vicinity, and that other needs which people had thought did exist were already being provided locally. In that way we gained new insights, and we intend proceeding along these lines in the new year. It is in view of this, too, as has already been laid down in legislation, that the period of office of the National Welfare Board and the regional welfare boards, as well as the four statutory commissions, was extended. Therefore I want to emphasize that participation by the community in welfare planning is essential and is also our objective, and that there is no departure from the policy we have been adopting up to now. As far as care of the aged is concerned, I want to reiterate in respect of the policy aspect&#x2014;I also mentioned it here in 1974&#x2014;that our <span class="col_7775-7776" refersTo="page_1218"/>policy in South Africa is that the aged are an integral part of our community and that they should be kept happy and satisfied within the community for as long as possible. We must provide services to make it possible for these people to remain in the community for as long as possible. I want to point out that at present there are already 11 service centres which are caring for no fewer than 4 644 aged persons. Three additional centres which will each be able to care for 500 aged persons, are still being envisaged. Having said this, I must also emphasize&#x2014;and more specifically with reference to what the hon. member for South Coast requested&#x2014;that institutional care for certain aged persons is indispensable. We cannot place the entire burden on the community, on the families and relatives of aged persons. There are some of them who are simply in need for institutional care. In addition, because we cannot meet all the needs, because we cannot, in a period in which Government expenditure is being pruned in an effort to fight inflation, commence a &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D;, as the hon. member for Simonstown wants, to build homes for the aged, we cannot care for all the aged persons who require institutional care in institutions. We must therefore give preference to the infirm aged. This is consequently what led to the circumstances to which the hon. member for Simonstown referred, i.e. that we are, by means of contracts which we entered into with private undertakings, enabling them to provide certain services. I think he is making a mistake when he says that the pensions received by the handicapped aged are simply being paid over to those firms.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is not correct. However, I shall return to this point later. I do not want to elaborate on it any further at present. I just want to make the policy aspect clear.</p>

<p>On the one hand we are asking for more services and facilities and better pensions, and at the same time we are being urged to maintain an equilibrium. In view of this I want to quote from a report on the situation in the USA. Mr. Caspar Weinberger, the Secretary of Health, Education and Social Welfare, had the following to say when he retired&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Economic problems have forced Americans to question generosity in a welfare state. Already millions of men, women and children are being maintained in this way, and laziness and unemployment are thus being encouraged.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say, and I quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we continue in this way, we will by the year 2000, within 25 years, be spending 51&#x0025; of the country&#x2019;s total national income on internal welfare programmes.</block>

<p>I need not indicate what the consequences of this would be. We all say that we do not want a welfare state, but at the same time we keep on asking for more. We must ask ourselves this question: When does one reach the point at which one has to say that nothing more is possible?</p>

<p>As far as the policy aspect is concerned, I shall leave the matter at those few general observations. The hon. member for Umbilo and the hon. member for Pinelands both asked why we were only increasing the social pensions as from 1 October. He asked why we could not have done this sooner, for there might be some aged persons who will never even receive it. That is probably true, but they are of course assuming that the amount which is being appropriated for this purpose would then have been available for an entire year. Here it is not a case of neglect. We did not neglect to do which we would have liked to have done. Here we have had to do what we were able to do within the framework of the present possibilities. There is of course the question of administrative problems. The hon. member for Pinelands pointed out that we are living in the age of the computer, and that it would not have been impossible to reprogramme the computers. That may be the case, but the question still remains whether South Africa can afford that expense.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to finish stating my point. Then the hon. member may ask his question. The amount involved in this R8 increase with effect from 1 October will cost the tax-payer approximately R16 million. If it had been for the entire year, the figure <span class="col_7777-7778" refersTo="page_1219"/>would have been approximately R32 million. I am now prepared to reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, of course I was not the person responsible at the time, and I am therefore not able to furnish a prepared reply. The obvious reply is apparently that money was available at the time, something which is not the case at present.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo sees the solution to many of these problems in the introduction of a national contributory scheme.</p>

<p>&#x2020; I have mentioned before that, as long as I have known the hon. member, he has been advocating a national contributory pension scheme. However, in all these years he has never been able to substantiate his claim that a scheme of this nature would make better provision for social pensioners than the existing one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>If more funds were available?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. If the hon. member adds his ifs, of course it could become possible. The point is that, in all these years, he has never been able to substantiate his claim that a scheme of the nature that he has been advocating, can ensure a better service and greater benefits to pensioners.</p>

<p>*Let that be the case, however. I have appreciation for the standpoint which the hon. member for Umbilo has held all these years. I do not want to take issue with him over it. However, he asked what progress had been with the matter. The hon. member for Pinelands asked the same question. What progress has been made with this matter? I want to repeat here briefly what I said earlier this year&#x2014;on 25 March&#x2014;on the occasion of the opening of the annual conference of the Association of Pension and Provident Funds here in Cape Town. On that occasion I said that we intended compiling a document as soon as possible setting out the standpoint and the findings of my department were with regard to the report which we were then expecting. In the meantime we have received that report. The idea is to distribute that document among all bodies in the Republic which, as far as we know, are interested in the matter, and to afford them an opportunity of making representations and commenting on the document, after having been granted sufficient time to study it. I went on to say that after the representations and comments had been received, the matter would again be considered and that a further document would be prepared in the light of the representations and comments presented; a document which would in due course be submitted to the Government, and possibly even to Parliament for consideration. No final decision has yet been reached on the form which such a submission will take or what procedure will be adopted in regard to it. One possible manner in which this matter could be dealt with would be to refer it to a Select Committee of the House of Assembly for consideration. However, I emphasized that everyone who was interested in this matter&#x2014;whether they were in favour of or opposed to the matter made no difference&#x2014;would be afforded an opportunity of stating their standpoint.</p>

<p>I am therefore grateful to be able to state publicly now that the first document which will be sent out will probably be available for distribution and comment in a month&#x2019;s time. After that I hope that the procedure which I have just set out will be able to take its course.</p>

<p>Quite a number of pleas were presented here in regard to amendments and adjustments to the means test.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Before the hon. the Minister moves away from the discussion and the reply to the question of a national contributory scheme, I want to ask him whether he has turned away now from the idea of referring this whole matter to a Select Committee of this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, not at all. I have indicated the two preliminary stages we would have to go through before referring the matter to the Government or to a Select <span class="col_7779-7780" refersTo="page_1220"/>Committee. However, I still have an open mind on that. I have not shelved it at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>When are you going to make up your mind?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall make up my mind as soon as I have studied the comment on it. Then I can decide whether there is any sense in referring it to a Select Committee or not.</p>

<p>*Several representations were made to me to adjust the means test. A relaxation of the means test may then be able to overcome problems which exist. There is one hon. member who requested that it be adjusted this very year. I think, however, that the present year would be the most inopportune time to adjust it, if it does in fact have to be done. Whom do we still wish to bring within reach of the means test? The hon. member for Port Elizabeth North said that a person may have assets to the value of R34 400 and still qualify for the means test. Where should we then set the limit if we are to start tampering with this? I think that at present the means test has very fair conditions, which are all to the benefit of the person applying for a pension.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parys asked us to reinvestigate the calculation of the municipal valuation of a house. I want to inform the hon. member that we are thinking along the lines he had in mind, i.e. to determine a fixed amount&#x2014;the hon. member mentioned R15 000, but I do not want to commit myself to an amount now&#x2014;only in the case of a house which is occupied by a pensioner. Of course the matter is fraught with pitfalls and I cannot give an effective reply to it now. But I want to assure the hon. member that the department is thinking along these lines.</p>

<p>As far as the adjustment of the means test is concerned, I want to say that we could in fact adjust it, that it is technically possible, but that it all depends on how much money South Africa is able to and wishes to appropriate for this purpose. If sufficient money were appropriated, we could effect an adjustment to or abolish the means test, and then give everyone a pension, regardless of their assets and income. However, I do not think we want that to happen. The hon. member for Jeppe asked us to abolish the means test for the ex-servicemen of 1914. That was a very fine idea. The hon. member said that there were only 4 500 of them left. However, I want to ask the hon. member what moral justification one would have for abolishing the means test for the ex-servicemen of 1914 and not for the ex-servicemen of 1939 to 1946?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The war veterans do not have a means test.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But here we are dealing with an entirely different case. There is not a second case, but in the case of the ex-servicemen of world wars there was a First World War, a Second World War, and perhaps we might even experience a Third World War. I am therefore asking what moral justification exists for abolishing the means test for one group, but not for another?</p>

<p>At this stage I should like to make an announcement in regard to minimum pensions. The hon. member for Umbilo also referred to this. Hon. members will be aware of the fact that civil pensions are calculated according to certain formulae. However, in cases where a pension calculated in terms of the applicable formula is less than R59 per month in the case of a person without dependants, or R118 in the case of a person with dependants, the respective amounts are supplemented from the Exchequer. In essence it means, therefore, that a person who receives such a supplemented pension is in part receiving a social pension. In the case of a married person it also means that the social pension to which his wife would have been entitled, is added to his minimum pension of R118. For that reason pensioners receiving minimum pensions consequently do not qualify for social pensions. The means test was extended to such an extent in 1972 that a person without dependants with an income of R984, and a married person with an income of R1 968, would still qualify for a social pension. Strictly speaking, any person who receives a minimum pension of R59 per month, i.e. R708 per annum, or R118 per month, i.e. R1 416 per annum, still falls within limits of the means test, and ought really to qualify for a social pension. However, minimum pensioners are expressly excluded from the social pension scheme, because the State is already supplementing their pensions, as was mentioned. However, they suffer in the process. Consequently it has been decided to do away with the payment of <span class="col_7781-7782" refersTo="page_1221"/>minimum pensions as from 1 October 1976. This means that a pensioner retiring on or after 1 October 1976 will receive the civil pension to which he is entitled according to the formula applicable to him. If the pension which he receives in this way, together with his other means, are then still such that he qualifies under the means test for a social pension, he will in fact be paid a social pension.</p>

<p>As an example one may take the case of a person who is entitled to a civil pension of R42 per month, according to the formula applicable to him. In addition such a person will, if he has no other means, still be able to qualify for the social pension, which will give him an income of R42 plus R64, i.e. R106 per month, as against the minimum pension of R59 per month to which he would otherwise have been entitled. This will also mean that a married person who was entitled to a civil pension of R84 per month will also be able to qualify for a social pension after 1 October 1976. If his wife has already attained the prescribed age, she will in addition be able to qualify for a social pension. In such a case their income will be R212 per month instead of the present minimum pension of R118 per month. The new concessions apply only in respect of persons who retire on or after 1 October 1976, because the civil pensions of all those who retire or have retired prior to that date, will by that time have been augmented to such an extent that they will not qualify under the means test for a social pension, solely because of the amount of their income.</p>

<p>Next I hasten to deal with a few other matters which were raised by hon. members. The ill-treatment of children was very strongly emphasized here and we had the advantage that hon. members who are themselves medical practitioners participated in the debate. In this regard I want to say in the first place that the light penalties which are imposed by the courts in cases of proven ill-treatment of children, and the complaints in that regard, are of course a matter which rests with the discretion of the courts. I cannot give a decisive answer on it this afternoon. It is a matter which hon. members may, if need be, raise again under the Justice Vote. We all know that ill-treatment of children does exist, and will probably increase, too, but the problem is the reporting of such cases. In this regard the hon. member for Krugersdorp sounded a very important note. He pointed out that the reporting of these cases and the care of those cases was not the task of a single organization, but was in fact the task of the entire community. If we want effective legislation we shall have to in some way or another make reporting such cases compulsory, without the person reporting such cases being called upon to give an accounting in court. This is, however, an extremely difficult matter to which the department is still giving its attention. We hope that we will in due course be able to shed some light on these problems we are dealing with, and that we will then be able to discuss them further. I just want to mention that the regional welfare board of Johannesburg is holding a symposium on this important matter this year. We hope that ideas will be expressed there which could be of value to us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands, referred to juvenile prostitutes at certain harbours. He referred in particular to Cape Town. I want to tell him that, as far as this matter is concerned, it goes without saying that the department is obviously co-operating very closely with the Police. As far as Cape Town is concerned, an average of one juvenile girl per month was brought to the attention of the local regional office of the department between November 1975 and 27 April 1976. Two of the six juveniles who were thus brought to the attention of the department, were left in the care of their parents as a place of safety, while the others were admitted to the local Place of Safety with a view to children&#x2019;s court proceedings. Prostitution among juveniles in Cape Town is not considered by the local regional office and the police to be a growing problem. As far as adult prostitutes are concerned, however, the situation gives rise to far greater concern. In Durban no cases of prostitution have been brought to the attention of the local regional office of the department for some considerable time. Regular visits are paid to the night clubs by the Police, and strict control is exercised over the entrance to the Durban harbour. The police deny that prostitution among juveniles at the Durban harbour gives rise to any concern. In Port Elizabeth two juvenile prostitutes were brought to the attention of the local regional office of the department during this year. During the past two years six juvenile prostitutes have been referred to the regional office. Sir, this is the <span class="col_7783-7784" refersTo="page_1222"/>problem to which one may not, of course, close one&#x2019;s eyes, and I want to give the assurance that the welfare officers and the welfare offices are, in close co-operation with the police, constantly keeping a watchful eye over this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg referred to family courts. I want to tell him that we have received a report from the Department of Justice, and that this matter is at present being studied. There are certain problems in regard to this matter, and we shall obviously not be able to proceed with it until we have obtained a general consensus in regard to the matter, i.e. from Social Welfare and the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>A great deal was said about alcoholism and it is in fact one of the problems which gives rise to concern. It was correctly said that the cause of the problem is always being sought among other people. I think it was the hon. member for Berea who said: &#x201C;Who is the other person?&#x201D; Everyone is seeking the problem elsewhere. But there is no doubt that the problem is there, is growing all the time, and is causing concern. During the international congress which was held here in Cape Town two years ago, conditions in South Africa were clearly brought to light. In the same year the 20th meeting of the International Institute for the Prevention and Treatment of Alcoholism was held in Manchester. There were 300 delegates at that conference and they came from a great many countries. Not a single country that was represented at the conference was able to report a decrease in alcoholism. From England it was reported for example that persons charged with drunken driving had increased from. 19 per 10 000 to 24 per 10 000. The percentage of teetotallers had decreased in the last ten years from 30&#x0025; to 11&#x0025;. From the USA it was reported that there were at that time between 9 million and 12 million alcoholics, as against the between 3 million and 5 million alcoholics in 1954. But the perturbing aspect was that more adolescents and women had become involved in this problem of alcoholism. In France, for example there had previously been one female alcoholic for every ten males; at that juncture the ratio was one woman for every four men. We can therefore see what the extent of this problem is, and if I am asked: &#x201C;Who is the other man?&#x201D; then I have to say that the solution obviously lies in joint action. Personally I believe, and I have also stated this in public, that the liquor trade itself has a major part to play in regard to this matter, and I have also received the assurance from certain spokesmen on behalf of the liquor trade that they are interested in assisting us.</p>

<p>The hon. member went on to refer to the wages of messengers and labourers in the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. As far as that matter is concerned, I am of course under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission. That commission establishes certain wage scales to which my department also has to adapt itself. In the other branches of the department&#x2019;s activities&#x2014;this he was quite right in conceding&#x2014;the division of work is such that my department relies primarily on Whites, and that the problem therefore does not crop up. As far as the wages of messengers and labourers are concerned, that is of course a matter which, as I have said, is the responsibility of the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene asked for some or other accommodation in respect of quadriplegics. Some time ago I happened to see the presentation of a television programme on which Miss Chantal Fouch&#x00E9;, who is at present the voluntary secretary of this struggling association, participated. The programme <span class="col_7785-7786" refersTo="page_1223"/>made a great impression on me, also because I know her and the circumstances in which she finds herself. I think the time has arrived for my department and I to ascertain the needs of these people and see what we can do in that regard.</p>

<p>The two Potgieter brothers, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth North and the hon. member for Brits, gave very fine testimonials to the activities of the department, and I am very grateful for that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brits, however, has another wound he wants me to salve. I want to assure him that 130 houses are being planned to replace the present houses at the Sonop settlement. According to the conditions of the tender construction work was to have been commenced in September 1977 and the estimated cost for the project is R1,5 million. According to the contract the project has to be completed within 24 months. The pitched-roof houses will be built according to conventional building methods, and seven different plans will be used. In this way, and also by causing the houses to front in different directions, it will be possible to accomplish a considerable variation in appearance. All except 20 of the houses will have three bedrooms; a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom and a store-room. Each house will also have a car port. I hope that is the salve for which the hon. member asked.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Uitenhage asked for a separate office of the department as well as a full-time professional officer for Uitenhage. I understand very well his endeavour to achieve a better service there. As he said, the professional officer at present comes down from Port Elizabeth, and is an official in a sub-office of the regional office which is established in Port Elizabeth. I agree with the hon. member that it would give greater satisfaction if we were able to accomplish this, but the department calculates the requirements according to the data which it receives from the Department of Statistics. According to the findings of the department, after an investigation had been instituted at Uitenhage, Uitenhage has still not reached the stage at which it has a prior claim before other places to an independent office. My department is keeping his representations in mind, however, and we shall see what is possible in future. He also referred to the scales of social relief. I referred to them and said that if it were possible the department would like to make better facilities as well as larger amounts available, but the fact that the present scales are a considerable improvement on the previous scales should at least be an indication to the hon. member of the goodwill of the department in trying to meet these needs. As circumstances change I shall reconsider the scales, but at the moment I am afraid I can do nothing about them owing to the prevailing shortage of funds.</p>

<p>I come next to the hon. members for Brentwood and Berea. They both discussed rehabilitation. The hon. member for Berea referred to a crisis clinic in Durban and pointed to the need which exists for such a clinic. The results which are being achieved in Johannesburg exceeded my wildest expectations and provided absolute proof that such clinics ought to be established at the right place and at the right time. A problem which is being experienced with this kind of clinic is that a suitable place has to be found for it. In the Cape, for example, it is no use establishing such a crisis clinic on the outskirts of Constantia. If one established such a clinic in the Cape, one has to establish it here in the very centre of the city where it is accessible to the people in the city. As far as Cape Town is concerned we are very close to the stage at which it will be possible to open such a clinic. As far as Durban is concerned, we are nowhere near realizing such an ideal. This is a new service with which it is difficult to make a start at a juncture at which one has so many financial problems as we have at present.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gezina made a very positive contribution on the care of the handicapped. He pointed out the need for us to employ handicapped persons in so far as they are able to render a service. What the hon. member said was completely in line with the view of the department after two investigations had been made in this regard. The department found that less emphasis should be placed on the handicapped, on the disability of the person, and greater emphasis on his remaining potential for rendering a service. The department is moving in that direction. This is a complete change in many respects, and is also related to many other factors. Even other departments are involved in the matter. However, we shall continue to move in the direction which the hon. member advocated.</p>

<p>I come next to the hon. member for <span class="col_7787-7788" refersTo="page_1224"/>Simonstown and I want to remind him that only last year the then hon. Deputy Minister, together with certain members of this House, visited the institutions in Kalk Bay to which he referred, without mentioning the names. The finding was that these people were being properly cared for, although difficult circumstances prevailed there. The circumstances of many of these people are such that their relatives are unable to look after them. There are some of them who are physically handicapped and who are actually the responsibility of the Department of Health. The institutions are not all institutions of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. I do not think the specific problems which are experienced when such a scheme comes into conflict with the development possibilities of an area is something which can be solved in this debate. I would prefer to discuss that aspect of the matter with the hon. member. However, I am satisfied that the care of those people, in the particular circumstances in which they find themselves, leaves nothing to be desired and that there is no question of exploitation. The company to which the hon. member referred, as well as other companies, are in my opinion performing an essential service. Obviously it is being done for a remunation, but this is however a service for which there is need. The aspects which the hon. member mentioned concerning the restrictive effect the institutions have on the development of certain areas I would prefer to discuss in private with the hon. member in order to establish whether something may be done and, if so, what may be done.</p>

The State, although it cannot possibly be held responsible for caring for all aged persons in the State homes, is performing a herculean task and making a major contribution. We could, at an appropriate time, go into the details which I have here. I do not want to take up any more of the time of this House in discussing these matters.</p>

<p>Overnight borders, which for most of us have been of no more than academic or geographic importance, dramatically entered our thoughts and the routine of our daily lives, and our sons and our dependants became actively involved on these borders. This is where our men are being killed or injured and sustain injuries which they will have to carry with them for a lifetime. By way of this Bill we are being called upon today to make arrangements for compensation for these young men of our country who in our time will have to make the sacrifices to keep us safe and to preserve our heritage intact for posterity.</p>

<p>Consequently the main objects of this Bill are to ensure the continuation and improvement of the pensions of the veterans of previous wars and to create a new dispensation for members of the Defence Force who are injured, and to make provision for the dependants of those who are killed, on military duty. It affects only members of the Citizen Force, the Commandos and the Reserve who are not members of the Permanent Force, or the S.A. <span class="col_7789-7790" refersTo="page_1225"/>Police Force or who are not public servants. Members of the Permanent Force or the Police, and public servants, will receive the compensation to which they would normally have been entitled if they had been killed or injured in the performance of their normal duties.</p>

<p>As hon. members will observe, existing pensions, grants and bonuses are being consolidated in clause 8. These consolidated pensions will be increased by 10&#x0025; with effect from 1 October 1976, as previously announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance. Unfortunately economic conditions do not allow a further increase of these pensions at this juncture. Further attention will, however, be given in the new financial year to the narrowing of the gap between consolidated pensions.</p>

<p>Pensions in terms of the new dispensation will be calculated in accordance with formulae I and II, as defined in clause 1. Important factors will from time to time be determined by the Minister by way of notice in the <i>Gazette</i>. Factor A of formula I will be fixed at R4 200 in the case of Whites with a high earning capacity, and at R3 600 in the case of Whites with a lower earning capacity. The amounts for Coloureds and Asiatics will be R2 800 and R2 400, and those for Bantu R2 100 and R1 800, respectively.</p>

<p>Factor C of formula II, in accordance with which the pensions of dependants will be calculated, will be fixed at R600 in the case of Whites, R400 in the case of Coloureds and Asiatics and R300 in the case of Bantu.</p>

<p>The pension of a person with a lower earning capacity, with a wife and three children and a pensionable disability of 70&#x0025; will therefore be calculated as follows:</p>

<p><img src="eqn1.jpg"/></p>

<p>i.e. a minimum of R350 per month.</p>

<p>A wife whose husband dies, will retain the pension which was being paid in respect of herself and her children. In addition she will receive half of her deceased husband&#x2019;s pension. In the example I have already mentioned, she therefore receives the pension of R140 per month in respect of herself and the children, as well as half of the R210 per month of her deceased husband&#x2019;s pension, i.e. a total of R245 per month.</p>

<p>The distinction between persons with a high and those with a low earning capacity is being drawn because the loss which the disability of the former causes in real terms is greater than that of the person with a lower earning capacity. The earning capacity referred to here will be defined by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> and the dividing line between a high and a lower earning capacity will be fixed at R6 000 per annum in the case of Whites, R4 000 per annum in the case of Coloureds and Asiatics and R3 000 per annum in the case of Bantu.</p>

<p>In accordance with existing practice pensions will only be paid in cases where the pensionable disability is fixed at at least 20&#x0025;. In other cases gratuities will be paid, in the case of Whites at R600 instead of R480 and R300 instead of R240, in the case of Coloureds and Asiatics at R400 instead of R240 and R200 instead of R120, and in the case of Bantu at R300 instead of R120 and R150 instead of R60.</p>

<p>The payment of gratuities which are paid in terms of the existing dispensation to widows upon the death of their husbands or upon their remarriage are being stopped because the pensions which will be paid to them in future, considered over the long-term, will provide them with better benefits.</p>

<p>The practice of recalculating pensions as though the pensionable disability of the person concerned were fixed at 100&#x0025; when he was receiving treatment in a hospital or institution or undergoing training, is also being done away with. In its place a daily remuneration of R3 in the case of Whites, R2 in the case of Coloureds and Asiatics and R1,50 in the case of Bantu is being paid. The new procedure will facilitate administration and may in many respects be even more beneficial than the present procedure.</p>

<p>The remainder of the Bill deals primarily with procedures which, in so far as that is necessary, may be discussed during the Committee Stage. Nevertheless I want to add that the Bill was submitted to the Services organizations, viz. the S.A. Legion and the MOTHS, and discussed with representatives of those organizations. I also had the privilege of discussing the Bill in broad outline with representatives of the Opposition parties, and I want to thank them for their co-operation. I think that I may freely state that we have the support of the Services organizations for the Bill, although I do not want to suggest in this <span class="col_7791-7792" refersTo="page_1226"/>way that they would not perhaps like to see further improvements to it. However, that is something for the future, and both organizations are aware that my door is open to further negotiations, if necessary.</p>

<p>The new dispensation will be applied to all new cases which have arisen since 1 July 1975 and therefore all those who have been affected by incidents on the border since that time need have no fear that they will not benefit from the new dispensation.</p>

<p>However, this Bill should not simply be seen as the measure which, in cold, real terms determines what compensation will be paid for any loss that has been suffered. It is of course an appreciable improvement on existing measures in the present connection. However, it is also far more than that. It is also a demonstration of our thanks and appreciation for the willingness of our young people to make sacrifices, of our young people who demonstrated so effectively of what calibre they were, and that South Africa could safely be entrusted to their hands. We are proud of them and want them to know that although we can never really compensate them in financial terms for the sacrifices they are making, this Bill is nevertheless also intended to convey to them the gratitude and appreciation of a thankful nation that knows its future is in good hands. We also want to tell them that this Bill does not conclude the book in which we record our gratitude and appreciation and our esteem for their willingness to make sacrifices, but that it has, on the contrary, been deliberately designed in such a way as to open, and to keep open, the door to accelerated adjustments, wherever and whenever necessary.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I think it is necessary, however, to repeat that it is not possible to compensate any of our men or their dependants fully for the sacrifices made by them in the defence of our country and its peoples. This Bill is not trying to do that. It is but a demonstration of our gratitude and appreciation for invaluable services rendered in the course of duty and in the course of getting and keeping ourselves prepared for the demands of a future which no one can fully predict.</p>

<p>Let us also get one thing clear. This Bill does not purport to be a preparation for armed conflict. On the contrary, it is not our desire to be involved in any violent confrontation, and we shall certainly do everything in our power to avoid any such confrontation. But alas, the price for peace and security remains now, as in the past, for us as for any other nation on earth, one of eternal vigilance, and we have no option but to prepare ourselves for whatever sacrifices the future might demand.</p>

<p>It is only sensible to expect that young men may, in the process of training or in the execution of their duties, be injured or killed. I would venture to suggest that no one in his sound and sober senses would deny them and their dependants such compensation as the circumstances may demand.</p>

<p>If that is the price we have to pay for peace and security, let us gladly pay the price, for it is certainly an investment we cannot afford to delay. And let all of us, of all parties in this House, and all the people in South Africa work together for the maintenance of peace, thereby limiting appeals and applications in terms of this Bill, to an absolute minimum. No one can compensate in money for the loss of life of a loved one. Let us rather work for the maintenance of peace and make it possible for us to live in peace with all people. I see this Bill as an investment in the future peace and security of this country and all its peoples. That, I submit, is what, in truth, this Bill deals with. Let there be no misunderstanding on this point.</p>

<p>*I move the Second Reading of this Bill with the prayer that we may be spared the sacrifices for which provision is being made here and in the confidence that this hon. House will accept it in a spirit which will serve as a support to our young men.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House would like to associate ourselves immediately with the tribute paid by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions to the magnificent service rendered by our young men in defence of their country. I believe that all of us are indeed proud of these young men who are carrying out their duties with distinction, and it is only right and just that this House should&#x2014;as it is doing today&#x2014;take into account the various contingencies that might arise, especially in cases where lives are lost, in order to ensure that there is adequate provision for the widows and dependants of those men. Similarly, those who suffer physical disablement and who have for the rest of their lives to bear such <span class="col_7793-7794" refersTo="page_1227"/>disablement, should also receive appropriate compensation and benefits for the sacrifices made by them in the interests of their country. We on this side of the House are indeed proud of the fact that those men are able to receive compensation as provided for in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>At this stage, I believe it is appropriate to look at the history of compensation and benefits to people in military service, because, as one can see in clause 24 of this Bill, the Special War Pensions Act, 1962 (Act No. 35 of 1962), as well as the War Pensions Act, 1967 (Act. No. 82 of 1967), are to be repealed. This is important because it is going to create a new situation, a new basis of compensation, a new entitlement as far as widows and dependants and disabled persons are concerned. One will see that, with the repeal of the two Acts mentioned, a change is coming about by virtue of the fact that the 1962 legislation, the Special War Pensions Act, made provision for compensation to those who had received injuries and to the dependants of those who had lost their lives during and prior to the First World War. If one looks at the history one finds that it was necessary in 1942, at the height of the Second World War, to bring about improved benefits and compensation for those who had suffered injuries. Consequently, the War Pensions Act of 1942, which was repealed by the 1967 Act, provided for the widows and dependants, as well as for those who had been disabled during that war. We now reach another stage. This legislation is to come into effect as from 1 July 1975. By reason of its retrospective effect it will mean that many of the young men who have suffered physical disability and the widows and dependants of those who have made the supreme sacrifice, will be able to benefit by the improved situation provided for in terms of this Bill. For these reasons we on this side of the House support the Second Reading of this Bill. We support it in principle, by virtue of the fact that it improves the situation and repeals two Acts which have become, in present day terms, not sufficiently adequate to meet the needs as they now arise.</p>

<p>Consequently, we believe that the Second Reading of this Bill deserves the full support of all sides of this House. We do have certain reservations with regard to certain overall aspects of this Bill. We also have certain queries which we would like to raise in connection with various clauses of this Bill. At this stage, however, I would like to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for his courtesy in discussing with us some of these provisions prior to the introduction of the Bill in this House, and also for placing at our disposal the senior members of his staff who were able to give us advice and guidance on some of its provisions. This is indeed necessary, because if one reads the Bill, at first glance one is immediately confronted with a formula in clause 1 of the Bill whereby a person who is more than 20&#x0025; and up to 100&#x0025; disabled, is to receive certain compensation. On page 5 of the Bill one finds formula II, formula III and formula IV. If one looks at it, it looks like an algebra sum. Fortunately, the hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated to the House this afternoon what the amounts involved are, so that one can ascertain the factors in the calculation of the various formulae. We are indeed pleased to hear of the improved basis of the compensation that is to be paid. The hon. the Deputy Minister indicated that the figures which he quoted would be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and that we would then be able to ascertain all these figures applicable to the various formulae in clause 1 of the Bill. I hope that at a later stage, when the Bill has found its way on to the Statute Book, the department will see its way clear to issuing an information brochure or something similar, as has been done in the past, concerning the war disablement pensions which are provided for in terms of the Bill, because it is important for the people concerned to be aware of their entitlement.</p>

<p>We know that organizations such as the S.A. Legion and the Moths play a very important role in looking after the interests of widows, dependants and servicemen as far as their entitlement is concerned in terms of legislation of this nature. At this stage we should like to pay tribute to those organizations for the magnificent work they have done and are continuing to do in giving advice to these people and assisting them in making appeals, for which provision is made in terms of the Bill, to the appeal tribunal as well as to a medical appeal board. Invaluable work is being done in this regard by these organizations. If young widows or servicemen have to claim benefits in terms of legislation such as this, it is important that they should have the advantage of such advice. At the same time, I <span class="col_7795-7796" refersTo="page_1228"/>think it would be advantageous and would help the morale of our people to see what is being done. When this Bill is finalized, therefore, I believe that a brochure should be produced so that the people can be fully aware of their entitlement.</p>

<p>If one looks at the provisions for the compensation that is to be paid, on the basis of the formulae and the figures that the hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated, one is pleased to see a narrowing of the gap as far as compensation paid to the various race groups is concerned. However, it is unfortunate that this principle is being perpetuated, in view of the fact that we are moving away from discrimination. One should try to find ways and means of not enshrining in our legislation such provisions as are contained in clauses I and 3, in terms of which there is a differentiation between population groups and the amount that is to be awarded to these people. If one looks at figures relating to the compensation that has been paid in terms of the Acts that are now to be repealed, which are provided in the House from time to time, one will see that there are 19 261 people who are presently receiving war pensions or war disablement pensions. Of these 19 261 people, 14 519 are Whites, 2 855 are Coloured and Indian and 1 887 are Bantu. These figures include those people who receive war disablement pensions, widows&#x2019; benefits and dependants&#x2019; benefits. The basis upon which their benefits were calculated, in terms of the Acts that are to be repealed, was according to a ratio of 4:2:1 as far as the Whites, Coloureds and Indians and Bantu are concerned. In terms of the figures that the hon. the Minister has given here this afternoon, this ratio is to be narrowed. The figures he quoted are to be based on pre-disablement potential earning capacities of R6 000 in the case of Whites, R4 000 in the case of Coloureds and Indians and R3 000 in the case of Bantu.</p>

<p>These figures which the hon. the Deputy Minister has mentioned this afternoon show that the gap is to be narrowed. The actual effect will be that the Coloureds and Indians will receive approximately two-thirds of what the Whites will receive and that the Bantu will receive half of what the Whites will receive. Although this narrowing of the gap is welcomed, it is felt that there should be a better basis upon which to calculate these figures, without necessarily bringing in the question of the various races concerned. One must bear in mind that there are an increasing number of people other than Whites, who are now playing a part in the Defence Force. Consequently, it must be ensured that these people realize what their entitlement is, and we feel that it should be possible to base this to a greater extent on the potential earning capacity of members concerned, rather than linking it to the question of race. Here we have a scale of benefits in mind which would be more or less in line with the principle that is adopted in some of our labour legislation in respect of, for example, unemployment insurance benefits. The benefits which are paid in terms of that legislation are related to the level of income and there is no question of race as far as those benefits are concerned. That principle could be extended to this type of legislation without necessarily incurring any additional expenditure, but merely on the predisablement potential earning capacity of the members concerned so as to ascertain what benefits they would receive in relation to the potential earning capacity of the members. That is why we intend moving an amendment in the Committee Stage to try to achieve this object, to ensure that this legislation to be passed in this House in the year 1976 should not necessarily contain provisions whereby the population group is taken into account specifically in terms of the Bill and put into legislation. This would move away from this basis of calculation, and we hope that the hon. the Minister and the Government concerned will find ways and means in the future of also assisting those who are presently receiving pensions on the old basis and who will have the consolidation taking place in terms of clause 8 of the Bill, as well as those who have had to survive on a very small military or disablement pension, by narrowing the gap between the various amounts of compensation paid.</p>

<p>The provisions as far as benefits are concerned, are indeed welcome. We know it is important that these people should receive the improved benefits as soon as possible. We do not wish to delay the Bill unduly, but there are certain other matters we should like to raise in the Committee Stage. The other thing which to my mind should be mentioned during the Second Reading is the position of the older pensioners who are receiving compensation in terms of the previous basis of calculation and <span class="col_7797-7798" refersTo="page_1229"/>whose pensions are to be consolidated to ensure that they also feel that they will receive some benefits. I know that the hon. the Minister referred in his budget speech to the position of military pensioners. He said that the matter would be reviewed and that there would be an increase of 10&#x0025; granted to these people as from 1 October 1976.</p>

<p>With these words we should like to see the hon. the Deputy Minister give further consideration to the aspect of the benefits paid. We should like to see certain other details of the Bill further clarified during the Committee Stage to ensure that the House has a full comprehension and understanding of this important Bill. This Bill is indeed a milestone in the payment of compensation so as to see that these people are provided for, especially on a monetary basis. I also think that the public at large are anxious to see legislation of this nature find its way expeditiously into the Statute Book. We have, indeed, found that there are many organizations endeavouring today to raise funds from the public. They are experiencing a tremendous response to their efforts to assist servicemen. This is especially the case in regard to the rehabilitation of servicemen and other matters of this nature. The Border Fund and various other funds have been established to assist our young people today.</p>

<p>With these words we on this side of the House fully support the Second Reading of the Bill as far as the principle of granting better recognition on a more equitable basis is concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with gratitude that one takes cognizance of the fact that the Official Opposition supports the proposed Bill. I should also like to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister and the department on the Bill. The Bill is certainly not perfect, but if one looks at it objectively, one comes to the conclusion that it represents a substantial improvement on the existing position. At present the position is such that it is often very difficult, for example, to determine exactly what is to be paid to a widow or dependant of an injured person, and to the injured person himself. The variety of allowances paid under the present War Pensions Act which vary from a clothing allowance and an attendant&#x2019;s allowance to an educational allowance with an added bonus, has often made it very difficult, administratively speaking, to control the allocation of pensions properly. The single lump sum which is payable from now on will facilitate and certainly expedite matters from the point of view of the department which has to administer the legislation. I should like to emphasize the word &#x201C;expedite&#x201D;, because often it is of vital importance to a widow and children in trouble that the matter be dealt with without delay. In my opinion, the fact that the amounts payable in future, whether by way of gratuity or pension, are announced in the <i>Gazette</i> from time to time, represents another major improvement. The advantages this involves are obvious. In the first place, this will prevent the Acts concerned having to be amended from year to year. In the second place, I believe that this will give the system greater flexibility, so that should it appear during the parliamentary recess that funds are available, the hon. the Minister will be in a position to effect improvements by way of an announcement in the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>As far as the envisaged amounts mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister are concerned, I should like to draw a few comparisons between the existing position and what is now being proposed. According to the old dispensation, a member of the Defence Force without dependants who has been 100&#x0025; disabled will receive R91,80 per month.</p>
