<p>as chairman, brought up the second report of the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders, as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Your committee, having had under consideration the question of the procedure in relation to the annual Pensions (Supplementary) Bill, begs to recommend that for the future all resolutions of this House embodying recommendations made by any select committee that may be appointed by it for the consideration of petitions for, or minutes in respect of, pensions, grants, gratuities or other pensionable benefits not authorized by law, and intended to be included during the current session in the Schedule to a special Pensions Bill, shall be transmitted to the Senate for concurrence. Should the Senate disagree with any recommendation or recommendations contained in any such resolution, such recommendation or recommendations shall not be included in the Schedule to such special Pensions Bill, but, should this House think fit, any such recommendation or recommendations may be embodied by it in a separate Bill, which, if passed by this House, shall be transmitted to the Senate for concurrence as in the case of any other Bill: Provided that the foregoing provisions shall not apply in connection with any pension, grant, gratuity or other pensionable benefit approved by this House in respect of any parliamentary officer or employee.</li>

<li>(2) Your committee further recommends that, with a view to facilitating the consideration by members of Bills, a brief explanatory memorandum in both official languages may, if the member in charge of a Bill so desires, be prefixed to the Bill as printed for the first time after introduction, but such memorandum must not be argumentative.</li>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>When we reported progress on Monday evening, I had just indicated our plans for having training squadrons, and had pointed out to the House the advantages we hoped would accrue from that. I go on to deal with our plans with regard to the whole commando system, commandos in general. Just as in the other formations, so in this, our plans involve greater degrees of responsibility upon the unit commander. As in the active citizen force so here, a great deal depends upon the energy, ability and enthusiasm of the commanding officer and officers in all these formations. I would like in this connection, to mention one thing which has impressed me very forcibly, and which I do not think is realized by the bulk of the citizens in South Africa, and that is the very great amount of time and self-sacrificing work put in by officers of active citizen force units and by officers of the commando system. People do not realize&#x2014;they would realize it soon enough in time of danger&#x2014;the great amount of hard work put in purely out of public spirit by these officers. With regard to commandos, what we propose is this. Hitherto commandos have received &#x00A3;50 a year to cover travelling, subsistence <span class="col_2879-2880" refersTo="page_0392"/>and transport. With the endeavour to place upon it more responsibility for training, administration and such quartermaster work as has to be done, we propose to raise it to &#x00A3;60, and to pay &#x00A3;24 to the adjutants in the ordinary commando and &#x00A3;50 in those commandos in which training squadrons are instituted. I have discussed this matter with those best able to give me competent advice and they, believe it will be satisfactory. In order to encourage the work of rifle associations in general, we are increasing the range grant from 1s. 6d. per member to 3s. per competent member. By the latter we mean a member who puts in two official shoots or one official shoot and one wapenskou. Personally, I should prefer to make it three official shoots and two wapenskous. But I think the wisest plan is the one we have adopted, with the hope that we, in time, may be able to tighten that up when they see that we are trying to encourage them. We also provide for two days&#x2019; wapenskou a year. The department will supply tent equipment, and will supply ration allowance at the rate of 5s. a day for officers and 4s. for other ranks. We are also providing cash prizes to the extent of &#x00A3;5 per 100 men for shooting at these wapenskous. With regard to rifles, what we are aiming at is that every rifle association shall have 10 per cent. on loan for the benefit of those who have not got rifles. We are putting aside &#x00A3;14,500 on the estimates, and in two or three years I feel we shall have the rifle associations supplied in this way. I am just going to deal briefly with the rifle question. We have had almost insistent requests to supply every man in the commandos with rifles free. We have considered this very carefully. There have been two suggestions ; one that they should have these free, and the other that they should be allowed to buy them by instalments. With regard to the latter question, that was raised a year ago. I went into the matter very closely. We circularized all the district staff officers for their opinions, and I have consulted quite a number of authorities, and the conclusion the Government have come to is that it is impossible for us to comply with that request. The effect will be that to begin with if you carry it out you will have very greatly to increase your clerical staff and inspection. A considerable increase of your clerical staff would be required to keep track of the way in which the instalments were being paid ; and, secondly, you would have a very large number of cases of men falling behind in their arrears. That was our experience in 1913, and as soon as the Government takes measures against such persons you have an outcry that here a man wants to defend his country, and the Government is prosecuting him. We have come to the conclusion that the measure is not justified by the situation, and is not one which we can defend to this committee or the country. Then there is the question of free rifles. Every member of the Defence Rifle Association can apply for a rifle from us at cost price. He can get a long rifle for &#x00A3;6 13s. 9d., for which he would have to pay more in the shops, and the short service rifle, which is our service rifle for the whole of the troops, he can get for &#x00A3;5 8s. 9d. I feel confident, from enquiries I have made, that there are few men who cannot afford to buy a rifle at &#x00A3;5 8s. 9d., which is the cost price. Over and above that, we are trying to get up to that point of 10 per cent. rifles on loan, and that is, according to the commandants I have consulted and who, I am perfectly certain, are tendering me proper and sound advice, quite sufficient for these men who come up to the butts to shoot who cannot afford to have their own rifles. I hope hon. members will assist the Government by showing to their constituents that this desire for every man to be armed and have his rifle by him is one which is not only not necessitated by the circumstances of the country, but one the results of which they would be the first to complain about when the costs appeared on these estimates. We consider we are doing all really required by the circumstances by the provision we have made for the Defence Rifle Association. We have enrolled in the Defence Rifle Association 157,000 in 143 commandos and 163 ungrouped rifle associations. We further provide a course at the military college for a number of officers from the commandos who volunteer to go for instruction. Again, in that particular department, the committee must be prepared at some future time possibly for an increase of expenditure; in point of fact, we are asking for an increase for that college this year. That more or less disposes of the adult training of the population. I am now coming to the cadets. The change we are making there is that we are calling upon cadet officers to take again more responsibility for the training and looking after of the cadet detachments. Hitherto we have had more instructors than to-day going round the cadet detachments. As it is, we have unattached instructors who will be available for this duty, but we want to throw more responsibility on the cadet officers, and we are paying to cadet officers an allowance of &#x00A3;24 per annum; that is, the officer who is acting as adjutant and quartermaster of a detachment of 200 of less, increasing up to a maximum of &#x00A3;48 in respect of a detachment of 300 or 350 cadets, We are also giving a clothing grant of 10s. a year, instead of the old uniform allowance. I think that was &#x00A3;1 7s. 6d., which was supposed to last each cadet for three years, and we are making provision, not for camps, but for week-end bivouacs.</p>

<p>We have two yearly courses in the college for cadet officers.

I know there will be criticism under this plan, which is not new. In the old days in the Cape Province, it was to have two instructors for the whole province.</p>

<p>I am not going to hide behind that fact. In Durban during the war they had no instructors at all and they got on very well. The whole machine is going well. Don&#x2019;t let the committee run away with the idea that we are taking something away and giving nothing in return. In this district here a number of schools are devoting the grants I have mentioned to the engagement of an instructor, who was recently in our service. I am pretty confident that our judgment is right, and that the hon. member&#x2019;s fear is unfounded. A number of schools are combining together, and possibly it will be improved training rather than worse training. We also have not only here, but in Johannesburg and elsewhere, three unattached instructors, and we can make very considerable use of those. We are far from starving the cadet movement ; in point of fact, the vote this year is &#x00A3;14,000 more for cadet instruction than last year. No doubt hon. members opposite will criticise this plan of ours, and say you are throwing away a good thing and you are going to deteriorate. But the greater interest and responsibility which they take in the schools will not only keep the cadets up to standard but improve them. I want to pay tribute to the efficiency in shooting. The cadets of South Africa in that inter-dominion and imperial competition which has been instituted have twice won the Imperial challenge shield and this year the King&#x2019;s trophy, upon which they are very much to be congratulated. It certainly shows that rifle shooting in South Africa, which is rather traditional with us, is not going to suffer at the hands of the rising generation. Before sitting down, I will deal with the question of the disposal of the artillery. I alluded to it earlier in my remarks on Monday. We propose to have one battery in the Free State, in two sections. The two sections will be on the same line of railway so that the officer commanding the battery can conveniently inspect the detached sections as he desires. And pace, the dismal forebodings uttered, I am quite satisfied that it will not result in any deterioration in our military efficiency. Another battery we propose to distribute, and there the plans are not so complete, but there will be one section in the Eastern Transvaal and one in Northern Natal. Again we will hope that they will be on one line of railway and able to concentrate. The whole brigade will come together for training once a year, and I feel confident that we shall be able to make much more use of our artillery by training our citizen batteries than by brigading them at Roberts Heights and, so to say, hidden from the public eye there. Referring to the citizen batteries, in the original plan there were six or seven provided for, but we only had one, and I am sure hon. gentlemen opposite and other hon. members, who know something of the performances of that citizen battery, will agree that it was behind no other battery in efficiency and usefulness. I think we cannot do better than encourage that movement, and I feel it will, so to speak, spread the feeling throughout the country of these armed forces belonging to the whole country, and not being simply hidden away in one particular corner of it. Then I come to the naval vote. There is no change there, except that on account of the &#x201C;Protea&#x201D; having to carry out survey operations further from port, and having to use dearer coal, there is a slight increase there which is practically for coal. In regard to the R. N.V.R., that is slightly increased&#x2014;outnumber provided for is 760. I know I shall have criticisms from hon. gentlemen opposite that we ought to be making a greater effort in the direction of naval defence. One thing we have to be clear about. We may have the most laudable aims and ambitions, and I am not going to deny that in future South Africa will have to develop more of her sea going possibilities, but it is no use blinking the fact that we have as much hay on our fork as we can carry, and that that is something which we must leave to a future date. We must develop our sea-sense as opportunity offers. Coastal defence has been confined to this coastal defence that existed. The Committee of Imperial Defence is giving attention to the whole of these matters and, under the circumstances, I prefer to wait until we get more information and advice before making any proposals.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I have always held that our contribution should be to develop our own naval defence. I am perfectly candid. I do not, myself, feel that the effort we are making is anything like one would like, and to those naval experts&#x2014;with whom I have every sympathy&#x2014; I merely point out that we have to walk before we can run, and have to bide our time. Then, in regard to other parts of the vote, in headquarters administration there is a slight increase. They are normal increases. Cost of cash in lieu of rations has enabled us to reduce our supply vote. The only change I have made at headquarters of any importance is the institution of the military board there&#x2014;the same institution as prevails in the other dominions. That is set up by regulation, and consists of the Minister as president, the chief of general staff, the adjutant-general, the quartermaster-general, the director of air services and the financial undersecretary, a board in which we discuss matters of general policy connected with defence and administrative matters from time to time. It is an innovation and a good one. It does not derogate in the least from the authority of the chief of the general staff, and I am satisfied it will be of the greatest assistance to me and to any succeeding Minister, and also to the service itself, by keeping the heads, the chief army officers, in thoroughly close contact with <span class="col_2883-2884" refersTo="page_0394"/>the schemes of organization and general discussion of military affairs. The quartermaster-general&#x2019;s department remains in the same position. In the general administration there may be room for smaller economies when we get into our new building, but I think if the committee were aware of the wretched sort of rabbit-warren buildings in which the defence headquarters has been housed, they would not think the greatest possible economy in office work is obtainable, but when we get into our new building there may be opportunities here and there of economizing. In regard to medical service there is a slight decrease due to the abolition of one or two posts. I want to ask the hon. member for Pretoria (South) (Dr. van Broekhuizen)&#x2014;I gathered from his remarks that Roberts Heights hospital was a terrible thing, but I must entirely disagree with him. It is an admirably-run hospital.</p>

<p>I cannot give that at the moment, but there are continual courses throughout the year, and we are as full as we can be for every course. When we tried to fit in another course we found the calendar for the year did not allow it. I can assure the committee that the greatest possible use is being made of that college. I do not think we can expect any economy there. Hon. members must not place too great hopes on economizing at the college. I think that completes what I want to lay before the committee as to facts. I just want to deal with one or two accessory points. In making all these arrangements we have had to retrench a certain number of officers and men. We have retrenched 25 officers and 105 other ranks, and transferred to the police 139 riflemen and N.C.O.&#x2019;s. It is a painful necessity, but I felt that the real need of the country was a most efficient military organization, with money spent in the most justifiable way, and with our plans we had to do it, and it has been done. We have done it in as fair a way as we could, and I feel it will be for the benefit of the whole service to carry out the whole of the alterations we have made. There is no satisfaction whatever obtainable if it is on a scale beyond that which you can afford. It must have been most unsatisfactory to all ranks to feel during the last few years that they were continually scamped and denied in things that were necessary for their efficient working. I know there will be some criticism of these plans ; we are all desirous of arriving at the best possible solution. Under the circumstances I believe the plans I have sketched are those most in accordance with the needs of the country and the limits of our financial resources. One of the criticisms will be: &#x201C;Where will we get staff-officers, having abolished our regiments&#x003F;&#x201D; My answer is to begin with that two squadrons of C.M.R. were not in any sense a sufficient regiment for that purpose, and further that we cannot afford to keep up an expensive regiment for no other purpose than training officers. We shall have to train our officers and to depend, as we have before, on the efficiency and hard work the men put in to make the best of the available training. There is another line of criticism which I don&#x2019;t think is helpful and which does really more harm than good, and that is criticism based on the suspicion that we are not &#x201C;playing the game.&#x201D; I have had complaints that in retrenching the instructors we have retrenched only the Bilingual ones. That is absolutely contrary to the fact. Our retrenchments were based on suitability, and a larger proportion of unilingual than bilingual men were retrenched.</p>

<p>How did you get them before&#x003F; You had not your regimental officers in those days&#x2014;you trained them. I ask hon. members not to criticize these matters and not to adopt an attitude towards the defence force which really might have justification if all our officers were engaged in running a party political game. I can assure hon. members on all sides of the House that, coming into office after the long predominance of hon. members opposite, I have found nothing in the spirit of the officers I have had to deal with but a real desire to help and to improve the defence efficiency of the country. It is most unfair to assume that because officers happen to have been known to have certain political proclivities that they are always going to carry those opinions into their ordinary professional duty, which is trying to work for the efficiency of the defence force. As far as I can judge they are really endeavouring to do so. They would not be doing their duty if, when a proposal of mine were put before them, they did not represent to me quite candidly their views, even although they were quite opposite to mine, but that is what I want, and I take the responsibility for any changes made in the service. I have received, and am receiving, from the officers of the defence force nothing but the most loyal service, and they are increasing the efficiency of the force to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>My challenge is absolutely bona fide. In spite of the fact that the Minister has anticipated criticism and answered it, and is apparently deprecating further criticism, I am afraid I must indulge in a little. I wish sincerely to congratulate the Minister on his new departure in presenting his Estimates. As far as I know this is the first time a Minister has prefaced the discussion of his Estimates by an explanatory statement regarding the finances of his department, and it is a precedent which I hope will be followed. I am glad the Minister of Finance is here, because there are a few points he would be well-advised to pay attention to. When we vote money for the Public Service it is in exchange for services, which should form a definite entry on the other side of the ledger. But it is not so here. We have not in the defence Estimates practically any information to enable us to discern what we are getting for this expenditure. If we vote &#x00A3;895,000 to provide an army, we ought to know definitely what size army we are getting and it ought to be expressed in units. An army consists of definite units, but there is no information whatever to show what our army consists of or what the strength of it is.</p>

<p>The Citizen Army, of course. We rely for our defence on our citizen forces, and we ought to know what their strength is. It is not disclosed in the estimates. I would invite the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the manner in which the Australian military estimates are presented to their Houses of Parliament. There you will find definitely and precisely the number of men being trained, they are even divided into ranks, so that the country has a very clear and definite idea not only of the amount of money which is voted, but of the services that the country is getting in return for that expenditure. I hope that the Minister of Finance will see that the public is definitely informed of these matters. One of the most interesting items is that the central administration part of the Australian services costs &#x00A3;28,000. compared with ours costing &#x00A3;53,000.</p>

<speech by="#byron">

<from>&#x2020;Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BYRON</person>:</from>

<p>No doubt adjustments have to be made, but the figure is striking, and it is worth while looking into. Again, it undoubtedly is the case that the Defence Department, above all others, is being strangled with red tape. It must inevitably develop into a sort of bureaucratic institution where there are a large number of individuals, if I may say so, completely out of touch with the actualities not even in touch with troops, and whose tendency is to develop bureaucratic methods and to run the whole force by regulation, referring everything as far as possible to headquarters and allowing little or no initiative at all. I have here a copy of the regulations of the defence force. They are formidable in number and weight, but, if you come to examine them in detail you will fina that they are even more formidable still. We have a series of regulations with corrections and interpolations which I would defy anyone but an expert in the Defence Department to make head or tail of. No wonder that the headquarters staff is vastly overloaded with officials, or ratner has a very large number of officials. Amongst the reforms that are wanted is certainly a devolution of responsibility to a greater extent in that department than is perhaps possible, or even permissible, in any other department of State. The Minister has told us that the Defence Department exists for preparation for defence in case of war. It is not right to expend one pound or one penny unless it has some connection with preparation for war. Would the Minister suggest that this is part of the preparation for war&#x003F; I would like to ask the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) how he would like to run his establishment with a series of regulations of this sort with innumerable corrections and interpolations. A system of this kind leads to multiplicity of useless work, and to discouragement of initiative. In war you have officers put in responsible positions, responsible not only for the conduct of operations and the safety of their men, but also responsible for the expenditure of a good deal of money. What training do they get in that direction&#x003F; They have no training whatever. It develops a laziness of mind when everything is done by regulation. It is a bad preparation for war when we know that the most wasteful expenditure of money takes place chiefly because the officers entrusted with those great powers have had no training in these matters and no encouragement to develop initiative and self-reliance in such matters.</p>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s chief difficulties, I hope, are largely based on the fact that the public are very ill-informed about the Defence Force. I do not want to take advantage of any loose phrasing of his, but it seems to me that there is a little bit of loose thinking. I am unable to follow his reasoning as to the possible dangers that may or may not be presented to South Africa. He said that there was no possibility, as far as could be foreseen, of invasion from outside.</p>

<p>Oh, no. What I meant, obviously, was that, of course, <span class="col_2887-2888" refersTo="page_0396"/>there may be all kinds of possibilities, but I said that within the reasonable limits of probability there did not seem to be any reason to defend ourselves against any sudden invasion by a first-class power from the sea.</p>

<speech by="#byron">

<from>&#x2020;Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BYRON</person>:</from>

<p>I am going by the newspaper reports. The minister, as reported, said something quite different. He was reported as indicating to the committee that our country need not be afraid of any sea invasion of our coast, even if there was an emergency. That disposes of external aggression. He went on to say that as to our land borders, whatever 25 years might bring forth in regard to central Africa, there need be no apprehension of invasion. What do we want a Defence Force for, if we are safe from internal and external trouble&#x003F; The Minister, I ought in justice to add, went on further to say that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are, however, certain dangers we must provide for.</block>

<p>Those dangers were not specified, and I find no great fault with the Minister for not specifying them. I believe the Minister and other public speakers will not do wrong if they draw the attention of the public to this&#x2014;that possessions of any sort need protection in the most civilized community, whether the possessions of a State or the possessions of an individual, and the more valuable the possessions, the more likely they are to be coveted and attacked, and the greater, therefore, the necessity for adequate protection of them. It is absolutely necessary that, having great responsibilities and great possessions, we should take adequate means to protect them. He, therefore, should urge that, while it is a laudable ambition to be self-reliant and so on, the ambition must not rest with saying so or thinking so. We must act. It is well recognized that self-government always carries with it the responsibility of self-defence, of local self-defence. I do not think that the Minister&#x2019;s optimism about external aggression being out of the question is wholly justified. One does not want to look for trouble, but we know that future wars are as certain as anything else, as certain, for instance, as death to an individual. They will occur ; they always have occurred. Let us hope they are far distant, but we must necessarily take precautions in time in order to avoid the worst results of them. There is another matter that the public ought to understand, and that is that the nature of modern wars has changed. Within the lifetime of some of us, and certainly for centuries before, when nations had a disagreement and resorted to the arbitrament of arms to settle their disputes, it was largely a war between two comparatively small bodies of professional soldiers on each side. We have changed all that. It is curious to think that we have reverted to tribal methods now in our wars. When we know that when countries are at war the whole adult population are engaged, surely that ought to modify our arrangements for the future, and that is further confirmed by the fact that we, in South Africa, a white population of 1,600,000. are controlling a vast territory and incidentally controlling a large number of our fellow-men, and it has been laid down in practice&#x2014;and I hope always will be the case&#x2014;that whatever our disputes, whatever our national emergency, we will not seek to settle it by training any of our native population to arms. It is recognized as a principle for good or evil&#x2014;I think for good&#x2014;that our native population will not be expected to take any part under arms in the defence of their country. That throws an even greater responsibility on the white population, who have to carry the whole burden. Having those possibilities, we are led to the fact that we must have universal training as far as possible, subject, of course, to such modifications as finance demands. I address myself with great confidence to this committee, because there are a vast number of members of this committee who have been on active service themselves. It does not matter what uniform they wore, or on which side they fought, they necessarily have come back with some very definite and, I hope, correct ideas about war, and preparation for war, and above all, the necessity of training the individuals who take part in war. No sane person ever admires or desires offensive warfare. The whole function of a defence force should be to preserve our land and liberty intact, and to enable us to go on progressing peacefully, in the way we intend to go, without serious interruption from outside. I regret to say I am unable to follow the Minister&#x2019;s reasoning or his attitude with regard to these new proposals. I would once more remind him of the terms of the report of the Lukin Commission. In the late General Lukin we had one of the greatest and best soldiers South Africa has produced, to whom we are indebted not only for his military exploits, but also for the wonderful example he provided to his men ; and I have never come across an officer who had the unswerving devotion of his men as he had. Apart from his personal qualities, it is generally admitted that he was a very sound soldier. I have never seen his considered views on any matter seriously contested. When he writes in his report, which was signed by two other members, that&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not think perhaps we will dispute as to who is responsible. I am endeavouring to make this non-party and non-political. However, when we see a Government in one, two or three strokes&#x2014;it does not matter ultimately&#x2014;sweeping away the foundations of the permanent force, it does not say much for the stability of the edifice that has to be built up. I am still at a loss to know where the supply of staff officers and instructors is to come from, unless they are imported <span class="col_2889-2890" refersTo="page_0397"/>from outside. I hope there will always be that interchange, not only in the defence department, but other departments, but I think it ought to be accepted as a principle in the defence service, as in the railway service, that we should try and build up our own staff and instructors from within our own borders as far as possible. If you sweep away the necessary machinery, it augurs very badly for the future. I cannot see the necessity on any ground whatever, least of all economy, for the latest stroke of the Minister. We think, in the preservation of our permanent force, we are doing a great service to the country. We would, for instance, in our rank and file provide a fine means for recruiting our police. I think, by putting a large number of men through the permanent force, we should produce, after their three or five years&#x2019; service, a number of men who would be simply invaluable. In addition, in times of emergency you would have large reserves of these well-trained men who would rejoin the forces for military service. Where are we to get our instructors from&#x003F; Does the Minister think seriously that the large number of instructors required for the defence force is provided by men sitting down with books and perhaps playing with tin soldiers on a level board&#x003F; Surely that is what it amounts to. No, if they are going to train men to be soldiers, they must be soldiers themselves, and they must have belonged to definite units which have been well organized. Otherwise, how are they to acquire the information and instruction they propose to convey to others&#x003F; With regard to our staff, where are our staff officers to come from&#x003F; How can you expect enterprising young fellows to join our permanent force, small as it is, if it is obviously to be not only a blind alley occupation, but also one from which they are liable to be summarily ejected on the shortest notice owing to some financial stringency or re-organization and so forth&#x003F; We must endeavour to attract a considerable number of our finest and best young men for the performance of these important duties. They must have that prolonged training which would enable them to perform such intricate and essential duties. I cannot see that you can make a staff officer by taking a man from a bank or a lawyer&#x2019;s office, who perhaps has never worn a uniform before, and expect him to follow the very intricate course of training necessary to become a good staff officer. I think that is a very bad and retrograde step. I am not at all convinced by the details of the Minister&#x2019;s commando system. He regrets, as I do, that so little use was made of the unsurpassed material we have for soldiers in the country districts of this province, in the Orange Free State, and in the Transvaal. It has apparently never been possible to give full effect to the excellent qualities these men have, or to help them to develop and train into efficient soldiers. The pity of it goes on still, as the commando system proposed by the Minister will not, in my judgment, meet the position. Will any member, particularly those who have been on active service, consider the Minister&#x2019;s statement seriously when he said in reply to an interpolation by the light hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We think that four full days of rifle and musketry and two days of wapenskou in the year will be a great step in advance of what exists now in the country.</block>

<p>Surely it is terrifying to think that these fine young men are supposed to be soldiers with that amount of training. I would like to read what a very distinguished American general said on this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Government is the murderer of its citizens which sends men to the field uniformed and untaught where they are to meet men mechanized by education and disciplined for battle.</block>

<p>That is what the Minister proposes to do. Four days&#x2019; rifle practice is not training; it is practice ; and a couple of days&#x2019; wapenskou is not sufficient to turn them into soldiers. It requires a great deal more to make a soldier than the art of pulling a trigger correctly or even hitting the mark. That part of the scheme gives one much misgiving. I appreciate the fact that there are to be training squadrons, which are a little better than nothing, but very little for all practical purposes. I would like to give the Minister an instance. An officer of high rank had to withdraw his men from a position in the East African campaign. He was as stout-hearted as a lion, but he simply did not know the A. B. C. of the job he had to perform in face of the enemy. He had his men in line, and had to withdraw. He actually told his men to withdraw man by man from the flanks, and they were shot down like rabbits. This officer had a splendid personality, and was a man of intellect, but he was not trained in that function of human endeavour, and he made a mess of it. If that takes place on a small scale, what is likely to take place on a large scale when you have officers put in responsible commands, handling large bodies of troops, and perhaps they have never had the opportunity of seeing even as much as a brigade under arms at one time. This system of command is one that must be carefully looked into. I would like to give the Minister a few suggestions as to this. If our defence force exists for war, and no other purpose, we must contemplate war at some time. That means the exercise of command, large or small, by individual officers. What opportunity are we giving even the senior officers for the handling of men&#x003F; We are giving them none. That ought to be remedied. I suggest in each military district there should be two officers, a titular commanding officer and a second-in-command, so to speak, carefully selected. They would, of course, be experienced officers of the defence force as far as possible. Their experience and their known aptitude for that kind of work should be considered. They should be given every opportunity, not only in our local camps, but elsewhere, of seeing troops handled. It would be a wise expenditure for these officers to see troops exercised in British India or Switzerland, but preferably in the British dominions. There are, as it happens, <span class="col_2891-2892" refersTo="page_0398"/>many men in South Africa who have a natural aptitude for command, or that portion of the military art. I won&#x2019;t mention names, but they will readily occur to hon. members who are listening to me. These men are to be found still, and are quite different from a staff officer who has to possess other qualities which must be developed by patient work and study through a series of years. It is still possible to get a satisfactory result from commanding officers who have an aptitude for command. This scheme would dispose, to some extent, of a crying drawback. What military future is there before an officer of the citizen force who has put zealous years into the training of his men, and who has retired under the four years&#x2019; rule&#x003F; The information and the knowledge these men have would be invaluable for the State. They ought to be given an opportunity of perfecting or improving their knowledge for handling men. It is as hopeless to expect any officer to handle men without actual practice, as to expect a gifted musician to play without actual practice on his instrument. Hon. members will agree with me that if we decide upon having an army at all, we must take over a reasonable means of having that army firmly based on sound principles and, above all, disciplined in all its ranks. It is impossible to conduct operations with half-trained men, and I would say to the Minister it is not quite right or fair to suggest to the public that, although the air force may deal with the situation in the way the Minister stated, he is in a position now to put 10,000 men in the field, all properly mobilized and equipped.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BYRON</person>:</from>

<p>It is impossible to get an additional 15,000 men which the Minister proposes. You can get 10,000 individuals, and another 15,000 individuals. You can take the voters&#x2019; roll and muster them as we do on election day&#x2014;but they are not soldiers. You may put rifles in their hands, but they are not soldiers&#x2014;they are individuals. It is misleading to the public to read the figures given by the Minister, and it is not right to say that he can put 10,000 trained men in the field, and then another 15,000. As a military machine that would be practically useless, and if the Minister would refrain from giving misleading information of that sort to the public, he would be doing a good service to his department. I still maintain that, until he has a sound cadet system throughout the country, we cannot build up a military force. The cadet system has this merit&#x2014;it has many merits&#x2014;that, first of all, it will be highly inexpensive ; it will need no further legislation, and that also is an advantage, and it will be easily put into operation. If hon. members have followed me, they will agree with me that, in this country, some form of universal service is necessary, or highly desirable. Is it right that, in South Africa, only one boy out of four is a member of a cadet corps&#x003F; The State pays practically for all the education in this country, and it has a right to insist upon military training as a duty of the citizen as well as his ability to read and write, and it is just possible that the ability to handle a rifle and to take his place in the ranks of an organized unit may, at a particular juncture, be as important to the State as the ability to read, write and figure. The advantages are so well-known that it is not necessary to enumerate them. It is a disquieting fact, as I pointed out the other day, that the physique of our people is in a very bad way indeed, and is not what it should be. Out of every 1,000 men who apply to the recruiting sergeant or recruiting officer for the permanent force, who are accepted&#x2014;we have no knowledge of the rejections&#x2014;but of those who are accepted as likely to make good soldiers, 500 are immediately rejected by local medical practitioners. The remaining 500, when sent to Pretoria, have their numbers cut into two, and only 250 pass the doctor. This is a very serious matter. Under the cadet system, at all events, these disabilities may not be so pronounced perhaps, and in the early stages will be brought to light and may be cured. Many of the ills which hamper men afterwards, may be prevented by judicious training and exercise. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. It is of course very difficult, in the absence of a departmental report, to make observations with regard to the re-organization of defence forces, but if I judge from the speeches of the hon. the Minister at Port Elizabeth, and the outline given in this House, there seems to me to be neither aim nor object in the re-organization, and on that account I must to a large extent, agree with the hon. member who has just sat down (Brig.-Gen. Byron). It gives one the impression, if one may judge from the outline, that the pruning knife has been applied rather spasmodically, without due regard to efficiency or system. The first point to which I would invite the Minister&#x2019;s attention is that the organization is still suffering from the same complaint as before&#x2014;and this complaint has drawn criticism, not alone from all parts of the Union, but from members of this House&#x2014;and that is, that it is top-heavy&#x2014;too heavy in the head, and too weak in the body. It was therefore, rightly anticipated that economy would be effected in this direction, but to our surprise we now find, if I am correct in my figures, that only 25 officers were retrenched <span class="col_2893-2894" refersTo="page_0399"/>and about 105 of other ranks excluding the S.A.M.R.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Now we feel that here the Minister is touching the very heart of efficiency, a touch felt right throughout the country, because these instructors are, after all, the live wires of the whole organization, and I do not see that we can do without them, if there is any intention of introducing the required efficiency and discipline in our defence organization in so far as our cadet and commando systems are concerned. Apart from this cut in the lower ranks of the force, the estimated expenditure for headquarters is considerably higher this year than for the previous year, so that, while we are seeking to economize, by a reduction in our instructional staff, the expenditure as far as the headquarters staff is concerned, is higher. Our old complaint, therefore, that the force is top-heavy has been overlooked. Taking the figures which the Minister has given us this afternoon the headquarters administration is now heavier than ever before both numerically and financially. In regard to the district staff, if the reduction of 15 military districts to six is for the sake of economy I can only say, from the little experience I have had of defence matters, that that economy is wrong; in fact I can only say it is false economy because there again the Minister has gone to the very heart of the whole organization. The force must have a certain number of wheels for efficiency and if you remove one wheel the whole is affected. That this will affect our organization as far as military efficiency and supervision is concerned I feel sure, and it might have been wiser, if it were found that the military districts were not of such importance as was anticipated when the organization was commenced, that it was perhaps better to say the system was wrong and to replace it by another. If that were done and we were to accept the commando system, by having the Union demarcated into command areas and the officers in command of such areas with a full staff of competent instructors were responsible for the organization and discipline it would be infinitely better. I think we would then have something nearer efficiency. But by doing away with the military districts as now constituted and concentrating the work on bigger centres proficiency and supervision must inevitably suffer. I think the Minister has acknowledged that we are practically falling back and that the training will be quite insufficient for our young men. In regard to the expenditure on defence rifle associations and cadets I consider this is entirely inadequate to give anything in the nature of efficiency. Yet these defence rifle associations or commandos are and always will be the alpha and omega of our whole defence machine. We have no other units to call on to defend our rights and therefore whatever machinery we may bring into being should be machinery that will deal efficiently with our commando and cadet systems There are at present about 160,000 members of defence rifle associations and out of this &#x00A3;895,000 say &#x00A3;900,000 on the Estimates, as far as I can make out, only &#x00A3;112,000 is set aside for the commandos, and according to a note on the Estimates this works out at about 16s. 7d. per registered unit. What can we expect for this small expenditure for such a large body of men. I feel always that in dealing with matters of this kind as the re-organization of our forces, we should have our attention concentrated on the machine that will be used should eventualities require us to do so, and that is our commando. Therefore I feel that the amount on the Estimates is quite inadequate to expect anything in the nature of proficiency from our commandos. This deplorable state of affairs, if I might call it so, is most dispiriting to our agile and willing citizens and I fear if we are to continue along these lines then all interest in our defence rifle associations will be lost and eventually also in our cadets organization and our whole defence organization will boil down to nothing. I think we should do more in the way of arousing national enthusiasm and to bring something about which is more in the nature of a national army. After all, a national army is the cheapest in the world. As to the cadets, the Minister knows that is my sore point. I quite agree with the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) as to the time and money that should be devoted to our cadet organization. What disappoints me in the re-organization is that our cadets in future will be left in the hands of unprofessional instructors, and I think that this is wrong because the cadet is the material out of which we are going to build up the machine for the future and therefore it is necessary that the cadet organization and training should receive the undivided attention of the Minister. If the cadets are to be left in the hands of unprofessional instructors, I am afraid we are going to neglect them to such an extent that they will eventually not be turned out to be such a useful part of our defence machine as is expected. If it is the intention of the Minister to extend the cadet organization and if it is to be left in the hands of the schoolmasters only I feel it is like building a large number of schools and filling them with children without teachers. By having professional instructors one does not only get uniform instruction but when these cadets in later years are called up for active service they win understand one another, they will know where to go, what to do and how to do it. Surely since the promulgation of the Defence Act there has been ample time and opportunity both in war and peace to determine whether the training methods adopted are good or bad. Every military expert will admit now that the training of our forces is inadequate and will fail them when <span class="col_2895-2896" refersTo="page_0400"/>called upon to do their duty for the defence of the country. The consensus of opinion therefore is we should be no longer tethered to a fallacious policy whereby four-ntths of our youths are allowed to grow up without any military education. A policy which is directly responsible for an ever-increasing deterioration of the militant capacity of an erstwhile soldierly and vigilant people. The taxpayer is prepared to contribute his share towards the maintenance of a national army, but at the same time finds no delight in paying for what we have at the present time. The taxpayer is willing to pay provided he gets something in return for what he pays, and I feel that throughout the country, if we are to follow the lines of this reorganization, we are going to lose that interest which we have had up to the present, and which is so indispensable for a national army. This reorganization, whereby our young men in the rural districts are left untrained and without any idea of their national obligations, is wrong. I therefore make an appeal to the Minister not to devote all his time and attention to the present, but to prepare for what the future may demand from us ; to make a fresh start right now by laying the foundation of a national army. For that, after all, is the vital part of our national existence. I might remind the Minister that national existence is not merely a haphazard passage of the people from an unknown beginning to an unknown end. It is not merely an erratic phantasm of dreams that has fallen upon the sleeping consciousness of a fictitious world beyond the law of time and evolution. It is a part of life itself governed by the same definite and unalterable laws. Ever since the first dawn of national existence, nations were built not by statesmen who, for want of courage, followed the road of least resistance and practised economy at the expense of armaments, but by architects who were generals ; by masons who were soldiers; by trowels that were swords ; and out of the stones that were the ruins of decadent states. If we follow the annals of history from the beginning up to now, we will find this has been the case all over the world with the rise and fall of nations. There is not a nation that has not been born out of the womb of war, and greater the labour and pain in their delivery, the greater the victory&#x2014; the greater the nation. We must not allow decadence to permeate our militant capacity. We must follow the maxim that to be prepared in time of peace is a good guarantee for success in war, unless we wish to perish on the same field on which we have risen. There are those who argue that while South Africa is enjoying the protection of one of the most powerful navies in the world, there is no need to elaborate on our present feeble attempt at national defence, but no true patriot can argue like that. We cannot tolerate that, for, apart from the internal and external dangers that threaten our western civilization, there is a wider field of operations in which South Africa is called upon to do her share. If every member of the commonwealth of nations were to act up to such pitiful arguments, then I am afraid the end of that commonwealth is well within sight. We cannot disregard the natural law of self-preservation unless we wish to court disaster. If from the earliest times nations preferred to perish, rather than profit by the lessons of those who went down before them, there is no reason why we&#x2014;having wiser counsels at our disposal&#x2014;should follow the road to destruction. I cannot agree with the Minister that we have only to deal with normal dangers. I think our duty extends much further than that. We have a national duty, and that is self-preservation. As far as normal dangers are concerned, we can leave those to the police force, which is quite competent to deal with them. The responsibility South Africa seeks to assume by widening the scope of its operations industrially and politically are vast, and intimately affect the nations of the world in their struggle for the potentialities of power. These are not without their attendant dangers; dangers equally great, if not greater than the responsibilities, will have to be faced when the alarms of war are sounded to defend our present defenceless possessions. With the military machine at present at our disposal, I do not see how it can be done. This may, however, be in our favour that we are rather fortunate in having a large man-power with practical experience, which we can place in the field with effect, but ten or fifteen years later these men will no longer be available, and then we shall have the young men of today, of which four-fifths are growing up without any idea of their national obligations. Unless the Minister provides for a cadet system whereby we can educate them to be good soldiers and citizens, he would be guilty of an omission for which posterity will not forgive him. A war in which South Africa may be called upon to defend herself will not be determined by naval but by land battles, and the success of those operations will depend on the quickness with which an equipped army can be placed in the field. At the beginning of hostilities the prime factors will be the securing of such points of vantage as will command every sector of importance for the operations of the campaign. Unless we have a sufficient number of men who are trained, and a larger number of men to do that training than we have at present, this factor in successful warfare will be nullified. That there is lots of room for improvement in our present organization goes without saying, and I hope the Minister will not rely too much on the fact that Great Britain was able, during the great war, to put a large army into the field in a very short time. Great Britain paid a very big price in Belgium and Flanders for its unpreparedness, and I hope the day will not dawn for South Africa when we shall have to pay in like manner. Germany&#x2019;s great advantage was that she could, in a very short period, place nearly the whole of her manhood, not only equipped, but well trained, in the fighting line. That is a preparedness of which we cannot boast to-day. If the Allies had been equipped and armed in the same way a <span class="col_2897-2898" refersTo="page_0401"/>Germany was, the great war would have lasted months instead of years. In South Africa the handful of republican men could never have done what they did if they had not been well organized and armed. We have all this experience, yet we do not profit by it. I appeal to the Minister to consider the question of an effective cadets system very seriously. We would like them to be brought up to be useful citizens in every walk of life. The citizens of the Union are beginning to realize that the time has come when they should no longer look to extraneous help to defend their rights. They want to do this themselves ; what they want and have been clamouring for is a good system of training and an effective organization. If we are to switch over now from professional instructors to schoolmasters, it will take years before we reach the stage when schoolmasters will be able to give efficient instruction to cadets. It is quite possible that in another year the Minister may be looking for the instructors he has discharged. They have excellent training, and are as competent as any military instructors in the world.</p>

<p>This subject of defence is one which in time of peace very few people are inclined to take an intelligent interest in. When war is imminent, of course, we are all very alive to the necessity for the soldier and to the expenditure of money to unlimited amounts for the protection of the country. The history of South Africa shows us that we have never, during my lifetime, at any rate&#x2014;and I have been in this country longer than probably half the members on the other side of the House&#x2014;we have never gone more than ten years without a fight of some description or another, a war of a more or less serious character. If there is one country in the world that should always be prepared for emergency it is this Union of South Africa. Now the scheme propounded by the Minister and elaborated in great detail, can be described in a very few words as providing for this country with primarily a paper army. Apart from the few trained regiments&#x2014;and they are few, and not by any means over-encouraged&#x2014;to be found in Natal, the Transvaal and the Cape, the bulk of the defence force, which it is dependent upon, will be untrained men. Four days&#x2019; rifle shooting with a couple of days inspection of arms is no training for a soldier, and I would commend to the Minister, in embarking upon a policy of this sort, which is, after all, going to cost a considerable amount of money, to consider the history of those people in other parts of the world and in other times who have depended upon untrained levies in times of emergency. If there is one analogous case illustrated in history which, I think, South Africa might take to heart and consider carefully it is the experience of America during the Civil war in the sixties. There you had the north pouring into the field troops, uniformed and armed, of course, but absolutely untrained, and I would commend to the personal study of the Minister the book written by General Henderson and known as &#x201C;Stonewall Jackson,&#x201D; and to study particularly the battle of &#x201C;Bull Rim.&#x201D; We know the disaster that followed as a result of turning these untrained men into battle, or depending upon troops of that description. They are not only useless ; they are a positive danger to their side. What is our first line of defence as I gather from the speech of the Minister&#x003F; The first line appears to be our air force. That practically, apart from the Cape Garrison Artillery, is the only standing army we have got. He had a small striking force of a couple of hundred men in the S.A.M.R. who were always kept in a high state of efficiency and utilized primarily as training squadrons. They were also a small nucleus for quick action on a small scale. But the Minister has parted with that force and handed it over to the Minister of Justice who, I have no doubt, will proceed at once to form a small striking force of his own, because if there is one thing that is required in this, country it is a mobile force in the hands of a commanding officer or general which he can quickly use on an emergency. That force, instead of being in the hands of the Minister of Justice, should have remained in the hands of the Minister of Defence. The Minister of Defence has parted with it in order that his vote may be cut down, and that some semblance of economy, which has been forced upon him I have no doubt, may be shown on paper as a saving oh the army. He has got rid of the officers. Those officers were highly trained men. More than that, he has got rid of the instructors&#x2014;about 34 of them, at any rate. If there is one body of men which a staff lays great store by, it is an efficient staff of warrant officer and N.C.O. instructors. It is a great pity that these men should have been got rid of. Behind the air force comes a scattered force of artillery. I have not yet heard from the Minister as to where he intends to dispose of his guns, but I understand that they are to be dotted about the country and used as training centres for citizen artillerymen. A good deal depends upon where he places these guns. Behind that force there is practically nothing. Then comes the citizen army, which, as I say, consists of a few brained regiments in Natal, the Transvaal and the Cape. The whole of this policy is based on the assumption that South. Africa is liable to no outside attack, that whatever enemies or whatever potential enemies may arise will be enemies within our own border. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I think I may say without fear of contradiction, that I have taken, and do take, a great interest in the defence force of the Union. There are very many generals in this country&#x2014;I am only a colonel &#x2014; but what I lack in rank I, perhaps, may make up in experience. No one begrudges expenditure on the defence force. What we are concerned about more than anything else is how the money is spent. I do think in regard to the cadets that it was a mistake&#x2014;I said so before and I say so again to-day&#x2014;that the Minister has commenced economizing at the wrong end. I noticed from the Minister&#x2019;s speech that he intends paying the adjutants of the different commandos, but there is no provision made for adjutants of the active citizen force regiments, <span class="col_2899-2900" refersTo="page_0402"/>who do much more work, some of them, and more useful work than some of the officers at Roberts Heights.

The total vote for cadets is &#x00A3;35,000 for the current year, and there is provision for only one part-time drill instructor. I think it is tinkering with the thing. The first-class drill instructor must be born. I have never yet come across a good amateur drill instructor in the whole of my experience. If you deprive the cadets of the professional drill instructor, you might just as well take away the alphabet books and the arithmetic books from the youngsters. If the Minister will make enquiries, he will find that all the very best regiments that attended the camp at Potchefstroom last year were those that had experienced officers, men who served in the war, and also first-class drill instructors. If you take away these drill instructors from the defence forces of this country you will be raising the whole of the force on a weak foundation.</p>

<p>I do not intend pursuing the same method as the hon. member for East London (Brig.-Gen. Byron) and the hon. member for Marico (Mr. J. J. Pienaar). They criticized various points from a detached standpoint. Unfortunately, I have not had the privilege of a military training like my hon. friends, but I want to place my finger on a few weak spots that I see from a practical standpoint. All my experience is practical, as I have had no training. I cannot show, like the hon. member for East London, how you must retire your army to prevent losses. I had to use my common sense and learn by practical experience to make losses as light as possible. From a practical standpoint, however, I regard the defence force as top-heavy and compare it to a tree which is too heavy on top and must be thinned out. If the tree is to grow you must thin it, otherwise it will die. I am glad the Minister has commenced the thinning out, but sorry he has not completed it. It is wrong to do too little and to cut the wrong branches. That is what I see in the retrenchment of the Minister. The great thing was to thin out, so that it should be proportional and bear proportionally the burden demanded of it, and the Minister should have commenced from the top. That is the difficulty. He commenced with reorganization, and I am not quite satisfied with it. Some years ago, when the old Government was in power and since this Minister has occupied the post, we had people on this side of the House getting up and saying that the Minister should retrench a good deal in his department, and that he should see that the department was made as efficient as possible. Now I am sorry that the Minister has apparently gone wrong, and has not gone the whole length. He knew that there would be criticism, then why did he not completely reorganize, so as to place the thing upon a sound basis&#x003F; I do not know who advised the Minister, but understand that Col. du Toit was asked to make recommendations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONROY</person>:</from>

<p>Then I will leave the point. Further, I just wish to go into the expense of the defence force and make a comparison between the cost of the headquarters and the headquarters of the police in Pretoria. The permanent force consists of 1,993 white men, and for that there is a financial department containing 42 persons that cost annually &#x00A3;19,319. The police force, consisting of 10,000 men, use a staff of 75 men for paying out salaries and only costs &#x00A3;25,745 a year. Defence headquarters at Pretoria comprise 375 officers and other ranks, and 193 natives, and cost &#x00A3;133,795. Police headquarters comprise 131 officers and other ranks, and natives and cost &#x00A3;49,755. We, therefore, see that defence headquarters in Pretoria with 437 officers and other ranks are larger than the police headquarters, and expend more by a sum of &#x00A3;84,039. This amazing difference is instructive. I do not quote the figures because we think that not enough or too much is spent on defence, but our grievance is that most of the money is used at headquarters, etc., and that, in time of need, we shall not get value for our money. I now come to staff officers. The Minister must tell me if I am wrong, but here also I ask him whether he thinks we are getting value&#x003F; According to my information, staff officers get about &#x00A3;1,200 a year, plus travelling expenses. I think they get 1s. per mile travelled.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ANDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister a question with regard to the clothing grant to the cadets. What control is exercised over that expenditure&#x003F; I want to give information of a transaction which took place in my district some time back when equipment was purchased by the officer commanding cadets from an Asiatic storekeeper. The Ladysmith Chamber of Commerce took this up, and endeavoured to get information from the Minister.</p>

<p><span class="col_2901-2902" refersTo="page_0403"/>After many unsuccessful attempts to get information from the Minister&#x2019;s subordinates. I tabled a question in this House as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On what date was the last purchase made in Ladysmith, Natal, of smrts and ties for the Ladysmith Government school cadets and what was the price paid.</block>

<p>To which the Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Government has made no purchase of shirts or ties at Ladysmith, Natal. The transaction referred to would appear to have been one between the officer commanding the Ladysmith Government school cadets and a local merchant.</block>

<p>Later I called at the Minister&#x2019;s office hoping to obtain information there. The Minister was out, but I saw one of his clerks who informed me that this order was placed with the Asiatic because his price was the lowest quoted. I want to say to the Minister that, if that is the explanation it is a very lame one, and one which the Minister will find it difficult to substantiate in this House. The purchase was made apparently without any consideration of the price at all, and I can substantiate what I say by papers which I have in my possession, which show that no other quotation was obtained. The officer commanding the cadets made a bee-line to the Asiatic storekeeper when he required those shirts. No tenders were called or quotations asked for. It is therefore not competent for the department to say the purchase was made from the Asiatic because they could obtain the goods at a cheaper price. I would like to ask the Minister why the department&#x2019;s requirements were purchased from an Asiatic at all&#x003F; The Asiatic is not the man to whom the Minister would appeal if the country were in danger. Why not give some consideration to those who at considerable sacrifice to themselves in time fit themselves for military duty. The Asiatic is not required to perform any military services. He remains safe and snug in his store in time of war, accumulating wealth, which he uses for the economic destruction of his European competitor. I think it is a disgrace that when a little material advantage might be given to those men who are required to make such sacrifices they should be ignored in favour of those who are not so required. The Chamber of Commerce have been trying for twelve months to get details of this transaction, without success. As I have said, I made an effort in the House, early in the session, to obtain information from the Minister, but it seems he is just as disinclined to make any disclosure as his subordinates&#x003F; I can only say that it would appear that the Minister is making common cause with his subordinates to keep the particulars of this transaction from the public, and I am sorry to have to say that. I have a letter here in which the Minister repudiated all knowledge of the transaction, and I therefore acquit him of any participation in the transaction, but I do not acquit him of making common cause with his subordinates in trying to keep this matter from the public. The correspondence shows that this purchase was not made to save a few paltry pence or shillings, but apparently for some other reason. The first letter on the subject was written by the Chamber of Commerce on the 5th March, 1925, directly to the Minister. The communication was acknowledged and then on the 18th March the Quartermaster-General wrote saying nothing was known of the transaction and asking for further information on the subject. The Chamber of Commerce then wrote the district staff officer in Maritzburg on the 9th April, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>I think I can reply to the hon. member right away. Not guilty, my lord. The position is this. I have not tried to hide anything from the House or the hon. member. The answer given by me was quite correct. The Government had not been purchasing any shirts or ties in Ladysmith. We hand over to the officer commanding so much per cadet for him to buy shirts and ties, and as long as they are bought our responsibility is finished. He apparently bought them from an Asiatic store. I should think public opinion in Ladysmith might possibly have an influence on him.</p>

<p>The way in which that public money is disbursed in a case like that is as we are doing it.

We never do lay down any directions as to where the officers should purchase them. That is the whole story. There was nothing to hide. It was the ordinary way of doing things. That cadet detachment officer went out and bought where he could get them best. We do not follow the matter up further than making the grant and seeing that he buys.</p>

I am not quite sure that we do start from such very different standpoints, but if you analyse his remarks, he belongs to the category of the soldier-critic, who would like, as a soldier, to see a very complete state of preparedness in the country for dangers which undoubtedly are within the bounds of possibility, but are not dangers which we should, as prudent persons, look upon ourselves as sudden dangers to be guarded against.

I do not think the hon. member has any real right to attack me on the subject, for we are increasing their numbers every year and are trying to encourage the movement. He suggested that the estimates should give more information as to the numbers of the various units, and I will bear that suggestion in mind. As to his comment that our system does not provide sufficient training and responsibility for officers, his ideas and mine are on all fours. However, the changes I am making are designed to improve and extend the facilities for training. As to the alterations of regulations, even the British War Office finds it necessary continually to alter its regulations.

<p>As a soldier I agree with him, but you have to cut your coat according to your cloth, and only Continental countries&#x2014;and that before the great war&#x2014;have ever attempted to put that idea into practice. If you fix your aim too high, there is considerable disgruntlement about expenditure, and you have to fix your aim on a reasonably practical object, and that is what I am trying to do. We try to do our best to give as much training as we can, but South Africa cannot afford to have a large standing army to do its fighting for her. The whole object of my plan is to provide for as large a number of men such practical training as it is possible to impart, so that when war comes they will require comparatively little additional training in order to enable them to take the field. I agree with the hon. member when he spoke of the necessity of citizen force officers having opportunities of handling larger bodies of troops. The active citizen forces are trained to a very reasonable degree of efficiency. I do not say they are as good as men who devote their whole time to military duties, but for citizen troops they show exceedingly well, and a comparatively short period will enable them to be licked into shape. With the reserves we can call to the colours, we can put 10,000 men in the field in probably about 96 hours. It is most unfair to describe the mounted regiments and the commandos as a mob armed with muskets. The hon. member thinks it desirable to have formations amounting to 20,000 men up to the standards he contemplates, but that is beyond our mark. What I am aiming at is to perfect a scheme so as to have something really efficient to mobilize. The delay in the publication of the departmental report is due to delay in translation and printing. As to instructors, I am afraid we must agree to differ. We have retained a sufficient number to serve all the purposes of the plans we have laid down, and should we want more we still have the Cape Garrison Artillery and the citizens&#x2019; forces to recruit from. We have been able to build up this corps of instructors. I do not see myself any difficulty, and the competent advice which I have taken leads me to believe that we shall have no practical difficulty in that respect. The hon. member for Marico (Mr. J. J. Pienaar) spoke as if we were falling back upon target practice and no training at all. I rather take exception to that from my hon. friend, because, in point of fact, we are going away from a position in which nothing at all was being done, and we are now providing training for 8,000 young men, and as to the four days a year which the hon. member scoffs at, what do the active citizen force get in non-continuous training&#x003F; They get ten days in their first year, six in their second, and three in their third. He also spoke about four-fifths of our young citizens growing up without any instruction. We have about 16,000 young men registering each year when they come to the age of 17, and between the active citizen force and the other squadrons we aim at having 16,000 trained for four years, which provides for 4,000 boys a year out of the 16,000 registering. That is a very great step in advance of last year, and therefore. I think we should be commended for getting along in the right direction without greatly adding to the expenditure, rather than criticized. The suggestion was made by the hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris) that we were spending some absurd sum, &#x00A3;35,000, only, on cadets. As a matter of fact, the expenditure we have on the Estimates is &#x00A3;45,300. The two hon. members have criticized us for having in this retrenchment, retrenched, as they said, at the wrong end. I do not know that 25 officers to 248 men is so very unfair a proportion in a retrenchment like this. The hon. member for Hoopstad (Mr. Conroy) spoke of my machine being &#x201C;top-heavy.&#x201D; and is disappointed at my pruning knife not having been more used at the ton. I am sure that if the hon. member were in my place, and carried out the investigations that I did, he would find that we are not top-heavy, and that the <span class="col_2905-2906" refersTo="page_0405"/>administrative brains and force that we use are no more than you require for the proper conduct of our defence, and I would warn hon. members and this committee about making those comparisons between the headquarters of the police force and the headquarters of the defence force. We are exercising all reasonable economy, but I am being continually confronted with this practice of giving the number of police on service and saying that the administration of that number costs so much, and then coming to the permanent men in our service, and saying that the administration of this in the defence department costs so much more than the police. They leave out the fact that all the work in connection with our citizen force and commando forces also falls on the headquarters administration.</p>

<p>I would like to say a word upon a subject which was dismissed by the Minister in his address this afternoon in a somewhat apologetic way. That is in connection with the question of naval defence. This matter was discussed last year, and a concrete suggestion had already been made that we should show the necessity of doing something more in the way of making naval defence adequate by asking the British Government to lend us a cruiser and to maintain it here. I should have thought that practically to all hon. members opposite, who are so fond of talking about &#x201C;South Africa first,&#x201D; and &#x201C;South Africa alone,&#x201D; it would have been apparent that something more should be done to maintain the position of South Africa on the question of naval defence. So far as I can see, the total amount provided is under the head of H on Vote 19. It provides for 230 men, or rather less, including coloured people, and a comparatively small expenditure. There are one or two minesweepers, which doubtless do useful work, and people employed on them. I am aware that under the arrangement which was made by the late Government, when the British Government handed over a large quantity of defence assets, this Government undertook to carry out certain works. I understand certain works have been carried out in Simonstown, and are in process of construction. It is very difficult to find out exactly what the cost of these works is, and, so far as I can see, there is no mention of it on the Estimates.</p>

<p>Another thing difficult to see is what proportion the expenditure upon these works bears to the amount of money received indirectly from the British Government. I do not know where that information is to be obtained. I put down some questions on the paper which doubtless the Minister will be good enough to answer at the proper time. If he could tell us more or less how this fund stands, what is the value of the works and of the material, ships and so forth, taken over from the British Government, what the cost of upkeep has been to us, and what money we have obtained by the sale of ground and in other ways, then we could form a proper opinion as to whether we are really doing something reasonably in proportion to the assistance we have received from the British Government. I do not know what we are spending, nor what is the value of the assets we have taken over, and it would be very material if we could have that information. I do not say the Minister is to blame that we do not spend much more, because I quite recognize that public feeling in the country has not been sufficiently alive to the importance of the matter to afford the Minister the necessary inducement to get more money than appears on the Estimates. Personally, I think there are Other matters on which we could spend less money in order that we could spend more money on this particular object. It was stated last year that about &#x00A3;160,000 a year would be necessary for the upkeep of a British cruiser if it were loaned to us. If that were done, it would be of great advantage. We have a training ship which does good work, and if we could send them on to a regular cruiser, that would be an excellent thing ; we should be providing them with an outlet and a career, and we should be doing something to show that it is up to us to take a reasonable share in naval defence. I know there are people who say there is no urgent need for this defence, but the only reason there is no urgent need is that we depend entirely on the goodwill of the British Government. I am not altogether inclined to give the Minister credit for haying exerted himself very much in this direction, but it would help if we could have the information I have just mentioned in order that we may see whether we are really carrying out our bargain.</p>

<p>When my time expired, I was pointing out to the Minister what the various staff offices cost. According to the estimates and other information I possess, a staff officer costs &#x00A3;1,200 a year in salary alone, besides travelling expenses calculated at 1s. a mile when he travels in the district. Then the staff officer has a captain as adjutant, who serves as private secretary and gets &#x00A3;800 a year. Then there is a quartermaster lieutenant who, I am told, gets &#x00A3;600 a year, and he is the person with the great responsibility in every staff office. The staff officer is there to Sign cheques&#x2014;</p>

<p>The quartermaster-lieutenant is responsible for every penny, for the, sale of cartridges and rifles, according to my information, He is the responsible man in the office. Then there is the instructor&#x2019;s staff of five men who are paid &#x00A3;35 a month, which makes a total <span class="col_2907-2908" refersTo="page_0406"/>of &#x00A3;2,100 for the instruction staff. Further, there is a magazine master at &#x00A3;25 a month. That is &#x00A3;300 a year, and two clerks at &#x00A3;300 a year each, that is &#x00A3;500 a year, and a typist at &#x00A3;150 a year and two other persons at &#x00A3;456 the two, and a messenger at &#x00A3;48 a year. The total for the staff is, therefore, &#x00A3;5,984 in salaries alone, apart from travelling allowances to the staff officer. According to my information, the pay-and quartermaster is the man who bears all the responsibility. Now I ask, if the chief work the staff officer has to do is to sign cheques and to go about in his district forming rifle associations, and if the greatest responsibility does not rest on his shoulders, why is he not retrenched&#x003F; As to the organization of the rifle associations, it is surely the commandants and field coronets who are responsible.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONROY</person>:</from>

<p>If I am out in one or two staff officers, it does not change the position. The expenditure connected with each office remains the same. I hope the Minister followed me. If I am possibly out in one or two staff officers, then he must not use that in his reply to camouflage the position. My chief point is the expenditure connected with the various staff offices, and where I am wrong I hope the Minister will enlighten me. I have mentioned figures to show that I think there can be retrenchment in the salaries of the officers, that the defence force can be made cheaper and more effective, and that we could get more value for our money than is the case to-day. There is no war, and we are not expecting one, but as the Minister said, we must be prepared for contingencies if war should come contrary to our expectations. According to our present system, as the hon. member for Marico (Mr. J. J. Pienaar) said, the great majority of our fighting burghers do not get the training they ought to have. That is my great complaint. Those of us who have had any military experience know that fighting burghers and soldiers who cannot use a rifle are no good in the fighting line. It is a great grievance that when the fighting burghers are called up to defend the country, they are hopelessly unfit, because they do not know how to handle a rifle. That brings me to the question of armament. I have tried for two years to make the Minister understand how necessary it is for the people to be armed. I agree that the financial burden which will be caused is too heavy, and is not justified with a small population. I hoped, however, that he would adopt a scheme which was put before him, from all sides gradually and in course of time to arm about 5,000 or 6,000 citizens a year so that, at the end of about eight or ten years, we should have an armed force of 50,000 men or more. I had hoped that the Minister would adopt that scheme. Recently I thought we had converted him to our point of view and that he would take steps in that direction, but the Minister has finally said this afternoon that he cannot do so. We also proposed to the Minister that if a man could not pay for his rifle, and belonged to a rifle association, he must get his rifle on the instalment system. We do not ask for a gratis issue. The man can, e.g., pay off &#x00A3;2 and the balance over a period, say, 10s. every three months until the full amount is paid. The Minister said that this would necessitate too much bookkeeping, and that it would be costly, and he could not adopt it. In my turn, I said that every commandant and officer of a rifle association knew his men well, and the officers said they were willing to do the work involved. If the Minister thinks the system will cost too much on account of bookkeeping, I can assure him the officers of the rifle associations, who are doing their work without any payment (the Minister will possibly see that in the past they received &#x00A3;50) will also be able to do that work. The &#x00A3;50 a year which the commandants got was very little in comparison with the work they did.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ANDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I want to come back to this question of the purchase by the department of 150 shirts from the Asiatic. I am not going to allow myself to be put off by the plea of not guilty which was entered by the Minister. He says this is a matter over which he has no control. Let me remind him that the officer who made that purchase is an officer in his department, and the matter involves expenditure of public money, and the sooner the Minister makes it his business to exercise some control over such expenditure the better for this country. I want to show that the attitude which the Minister is taking up this evening is a complete change of front, that before he Knew that this matter was likely to come before this House his attitude was a different one. It was only when I tabled a question in this House early in the session that he took up this attitude. A letter was addressed by the Ladysmith Chamber of Commerce to Colonel Giles, district staff officer, who passed it on the officer commanding the cadets, who replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As I am responsible to the district staff officer only. &#x2026; I do not deem it necessary to reply to your letter.</block>

<p>That was the attitude adopted by his subordinate and it has been impossible to get any information. This matter has already got into the public press, and the Minister has been severely criticized. I hope, in his own interests, that he will make a full disclosure. On the 14th May the Chamber of Commerce wrote a further letter addressed to the quartermaster-general in regard to this purchase of shirts. Further correspondence passed. Another letter came from the quartermaster-general in which he stated that the matter was still receiving attention and then a letter dated 12th June was addressed to the chairman of the Ladysmith Chamber of Commerce and this is the one on which I base my statement that the Minister has to-day taken up a totally different attitude from what he did previously. This <span class="col_2909-2910" refersTo="page_0407"/>letter states that the shirts although purchased from a local Asiatic dealer were not obtained at a higher price than that quoted by Europeans. The O.C. did not take the trouble to get quotations from the European storekeepers, so it is inconceivable how it can be said the price was not higher. How can the Minister reconcile this letter with the attitude he takes to-day. I know the Minister has one tender from a European among the papers and I want to explain how that tender came to be there. On the 27th of January, 1926, it appears that a traveller called on one of the European stores and informed an assistant that an Asiatic had been asked to quote for the Defence department 150 shirts and the assistant in the store immediately went to the officer commanding the cadets and asked if he might be allowed to quote. He got an evasive answer but eventually took upon himself to tender at landed cost plus 6d. each. The O.C. did not even ask to see the sample. That is the explanation of the tender. The shirts purchased from the Asiatic were got from a Durban wholesale house. The O.C. was asked whether the tender had been accepted and he said he was still going into the matter. A letter appeared in the &#x201C;Natal Witness&#x201D; addressed to the editor, and I think the Minister&#x2019;s attention should be called to this letter which I will read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir,&#x2014;We in Natal have heard so much of the evils of employing and buying from Asiatics to the detriment of ourselves and our children, that it really becomes necessary for us to bring to public notice cases done with a complete absence of justification, especially when done by a Government Department or by a member of a Government Department authorized to do so.</block>

<block name="quote">A great many people remember how Colonel Creswell endeavoured to get the Mines of Johannesburg worked entirely by white labour, and although this was many years ago, one would think his principle reflected in the effort would still hold good even though he now be Minister of Defence. In Ladysmith lately a purchase of over 100 shirts was made on behalf of the Ladysmith Boys&#x2019; School Cadets from a local Asiatic storekeeper. No doubt the official had excellent reasons for placing the order with an Asiatic in preference to a European, but what does the Defence Department think of it, and does Colonel Creswell countenance this sort of thing. I hardly think it possible. In any case, should this letter catch the eye of any of his friends there are hopes that he may make it his business to have a thorough investigation on points such as these:&#x2014;Who were asked for tenders&#x003F; How&#x003F; What were the prices&#x003F; And on what grounds was the Asiatic&#x2019;s price accepted&#x003F;</block>

<block name="quote">I hear that the Chamber of Commerce has taken this matter up, and rightly so, as there are firms in Ladysmith with wholesale houses in Durban, and others who do direct importing, who knew nothing of a tender for the Cadet shirts ; and, furthermore, it is certain that the same shirt could have been obtained at the same price as given by the Asiatic, if not cheaper, had a tender been called for in the usual orthodox Government manner.&#x2014; Yours, etc.&#x2014;A Parent.</block>

<p>I ask the Minister now to let the Ladysmith Chamber of Commerce know what the Asiatic charged for those shirts. He has the file in his possession. I would like the Minister to explain also why the officer commanding these cadets&#x2014;an officer of the Minister&#x2019;s department &#x2014;went direct to an Asiatic store to make the purchase and disregarded the Europeans entirely.

<p>We feel that the Minister is attempting to treat the population of the outside districts better in connection with defence matters, and as representative of a country district I feel that that is necessary. The hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) recently said something with which I entirely agree, viz.: that young men in the country districts should not only learn to ride, but also how to handle a rifle. I feel that it is necessary to give them a chance to learn in me defence force how to handle a rifle, and I am glad that an attempt is to be made to teach the young fellows between 18 and 21 years how to handle weapons, and to put them under discipline. We feel that they should not only learn how to handle a rifle but that they should also undergo discipline. That is indispensable. Another thing which the people feel is dissatisfaction with the defence force in its present state. When we insisted on a commission of enquiry into our defence system, the Minister was hesitating. Now, however, that the enquiry has taken place, everyone feels that it was necessary when we consider their recommendations and conclusions. A thing we found fault with, however, is that an officer of the department was secretary of the commission, and much of the dissatisfaction in the defence force is attributable to that. No one will deny that there is dissatisfaction, because we know that in one year 350 of the men at Roberts Heights resigned and went to look for work on the railways. They were willing to go and work there with pick and shovel. That shows that there had been victimization. At the commencement of the defence force promises were made by the late Gen. Beyers, the then commandant-general, and by the then Minister of Defence (the hon. member for Standerton). They promised the men who joined that they would be promoted in future to commissioned rank. What is the result&#x003F; The men who joined in the hope that they would some day become officers are to-day in the streets. And what is to become of them&#x003F; They are to-day practically professional soldiers, men who know the defence force from A to Z. I am not posing as a military expert. Many of them in the past were the unfortunates of our people. South Africa has in the past been the graveyard of the reputation of many a military expert. The Anglo-Boer war taught us on the Boer side that we had men who at first were ordinary burghers, but who became historical characters. I can mention Generals Botha, De Wet and Beyers, who were promoted from the ranks, and at the end of the war occupied <span class="col_2911-2912" refersTo="page_0408"/>the highest posts. Unfortunately it is a fact that we have military experts to-day who will find in South Africa a churchyard for their reputations. I want to warn the Minister against the people who say that they are military experts. The result of non-fulfilment of the promise regarding promotion is that we have not got the services of people who are capable of teaching our young men how to behave as soldiers, and who know the defence force from A to Z. There is something wrong with the organization if these men cannot be used in the service of the population, especially in the cadet system. I believe in the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The friend who points out my faults is worthy of my confidence.</block>

<p>I do not believe in the man who only flatters me, but the man who tells me when I go wrong. I hope the Minister and the military people will take this in the spirit intended. We want every son of the soil to be proud of our defence force, which should be an honour to our people. If we cannot get that, I am afraid the future will be a sad one. I should be sorry if the Minister thinks we want to find fault. The reason why we are criticizing him is that we are looking for the best for the defence force for every officer and for every man. The position to-day is that we are trying to retrench and reorganize, and we are gradually giving the defence force a Swelled head instead of legs to walk on. Everything is now centralized in head quarters at Pretoria, and that is wrong. The hon. member for Hope Town (Mr. Conroy) has referred to the position. I have the figures here. What is the trouble&#x003F; I have a letter about the evidence given before the commission of enquiry by men and officers, and the following statement is made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Does the Minister of Defence think we are fools, hatched under turkeys&#x003F; Our evidence before the commission of enquiry proved that many commissions are given by favouritism, but owing to that evidence our lives are made a hell.</block>

<p>I tried to show this afternoon where we think the Minister has gone wrong with his reorganization, and urged that he should retrench in the higher ranks. I tried to show that the class now being retrenched are required for an efficient service. I now come to the Cape Peninsula, where We have the engineer corps. Now I have received certain information which I gave to the Minister recently, and asked him to enquire whether it was correct. I have not yet received his reply and, therefore, I want to give my information to the House and hope the Minister will reply. I was informed that the head of the engineer corps engaged so-called artizans&#x2014; people who are not proper tradesmen, most of whom have never handled any tools&#x2014;to do clerical work. According to the estimates they get 45s. a day; though employed as clerks. Is that so&#x003F; I think Major Bolton is in command of the engineer corps. I am not certain, but I was given his name and told that he employs old soldier pensioners as artizans, while there are sufficient proper tradesmen to do the work. There is another point I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. At the conclusion of the seamen&#x2019;s strike, the Minister of the Interior gave instructions that they were to be deported unless they could prove that they would be given work for at least three months. Now I learn that five or six of the strikers have been employed as artizans, that this is the work of Major Bolton, and that he has guaranteed to the Minister or the immigration authorities that five or six of these men would be employed in his department. What, however, makes the matter more serious is that five or six old hands have been dismissed to make room for the strikers. I have given my information to the Minister and asked him to make enquiries, and I should now like to know what the result is. I learn that the chief of the general staff went to the Castle and to other places to hold inspections, and that he would also enquire into this matter. My information, however, is that the chief of the general staff walked through the Castle and visited other places at Wynberg without doing so. I should like to know what information he has given to the Minister as the result of his investigation, and if that is the investigation which the Minister ordered. The complaint is serious, and I appeal to the Minister to go thoroughly into it and if possible to make personal enquiries. I do not strongly oppose the strikers being employed, but if there are enough energetic artizans in this country they should have preference. According to my information, there were no vacancies, and Major Bolton dismissed five or six men to find room for the strikers. I now return to the reorganization scheme. I am glad he made a commencement with it, but I should like to know in the first place who advised him&#x003F; A commission was appointed to make enquiry into existing grievances, and the proof has been given over and over again that persons who gave evidence before the enquiry commission suffered. There is, e.g., Sergeant du Toit, who was at Roberts Heights, and has been discharged. People think he was discharged because he acted as election agent of the Nationalist party during the last election. I do not know if that is true, but I know that two-thirds of the highly-paid officers in the permanent force are all supporters of the South African party, and acted as election agents during the recent election. Sergeant du Toit was the only matriculated man in the Ordnance Department at Roberts Heights and the only properly qualified bilingual man in that department. Now I ask the Minister if he thinks he will get proper information if he leaves it to senior officers to advise hint as to who should be discharged&#x003F; It goes without Saying that I could not complain about the devil to his grandmother; officers will shield each other. In that way the Minister will not get a contented force. I mention these facts, not because <span class="col_2913-2914" refersTo="page_0409"/>I have a personal grievance against the Minister, but because I aim precisely at what he aims at, and that is a contented force.</p>

<p>The last speaker&#x2019;s discourse was very interesting. He speaks like an embryo commandant-general. I was surprised at the reply given by the Minister of Defence to the very interesting and illuminating speech of my hon. friend the member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson). It was very strange to hear such a reply from a white labour protagonist, and there was really no reason for the Minister give such a &#x201C;shirty&#x201D; reply. I find that, under sub-vote J, the Minister has diminished the horse allowance by &#x00A3;1,300. What does that mean&#x003F; We know that our mounted regiments take a pride in maintaining the standard of horses which they ride, and they rely a good deal on the horse allowance for that purpose, Does the Minister want to see a downward grade in regard to the standard of horses&#x003F; I think it is false economy to reduce this allowance. As regards sub-vote K, the Minister was expounding this afternoon what he was going to do with regard to the commandoes. I see here that, under item 1, rifle ranges is reduced by the amount of &#x00A3;3,300. What does that mean&#x003F; How is this efficient practice to be carried on&#x003F; How are the young recruits to be taught rifle shooting if the ranges are to be restricted&#x003F; Last session I raised a question with the Minister, and he promised to consider the matter, and apparently he is still considering it. The question was for him to arrange to have a supply of rifles in Natal. We are peculiarly situated in Natal. We are surrounded by a very large native population who, like the proverbial Irishmen, are very fond of recreation in the form of faction fights. There will come a time probably when this conflagration will be so great that it will take more than the police to quell it. History has a peculiar Way of repeating itself. In the past, as you know, We have had such a conflagration, which cost Natal a million of money. If such a thing occurred again; what an absurd position the people of Natal would be in, with all the rifles locked up in Pretoria! Such centralization is wicked. To-day the people in Natal do not feel secure with all this seditious propaganda going about among the natives, and we know it is the young bloods who are getting out-of hand. I hope this evening the Minister will definitely promise me to have a supply of rifles and ammunition in Natal.</p>

<p>I am impressed with what the Minister has said with regard to the air force; and I am equally impressed with the underlying principle of his statement; which, if I have Understood him correctly, indicates that he intends to give this country the best means of defence at a minimum cost. South Africa has been placed at a mean disadvantage regarding her defences. Nature has provided, us with a very long line of seaboard to defend, and a very vast area of country over which the limited population of a million and a half is scattered into small communities ; and in the event of war it will mean that the lines of communication Will not only be very difficult to maintain, but will be cumbersome, which, from the military point of view, is a distinct disadvantage. But, sir, I venture to say that with all these disadvantages science has come to our; aid, and has presented us with the most; effective weapon of offence and defence that we could have, that is, the aeroplane. And, as if by compensation, Nature has added to this gift by giving South Africa the most admirable conditions for developing this arm of the service. It remains for South Africa to proceed, and to see that we do develop this service on a sound basis. The Minister, in the course of his statement, which gave me great pleasure, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I feel confident that the air force will become more and more important every year.</block>

<p>I go further than that, and I say that before very long the air force will be the most important arm of the defence of South Africa, and, in saying so, I am not looking into the far distant future, but the near future. One quite realizes (from a purely military aspect) that to develop this form of defence is impossible as far as this country is concerned, because our financial resources will not permit of it. But I do submit that we could develop it on sounder lines than we are doing to-day. I propose to submit to this committee a method we can adopt in order, to use a classic phrase, &#x201C;to make the best of a bad job." But before doing so, I would like to associate myself entirely with the Minister in his eulogy of the South African air force; it is a magnificent force, deserving the country&#x2019;s commendation. I do not think we can ever fully appreciate the good work achieved by this small band of officers at Pretoria in developing the force to the importance it has reached to-day. In order to get a right perspective, it is necessary first of all to consider what are the essentials in the composition of an air force. You have machines and you have personnel ; these are the two biggest factors in the building up of an air force. It is most desirable, in fact it is imperative, that you should select the correct types of machine. There are two types of machine which it is essential that South Africa should possess. First of all, the heavy type, capable of a carrying load of about 2,000 lbs, When you have long distances to cover, when your lines of communication are lengthy, you must have machines capable of Carrying heavy loads. In addition, sir, the position might easily arise where you get your scattered community cut off from communications. During the late war the air force played a very important part in this respect. That is) a factor, I submit, which must be taken very seriously into consideration. You must also have the type of fast scout of the type of the S.E.5, which the South African air force possess W-day. When you consider all the proper equipment that is necessary, one readily appreciates that this country cannot afford it. In considering the personnel, the greatest, factor is the quality of men available, and here I associate myself With what the Minister has said, namely, that we have the finest possible <span class="col_2915-2916" refersTo="page_0410"/>material that any country possesses to-day. I would refer the committee to the mention of the South African air force made by Wing-Commander Tulford recently. He referred to the flying men of South Africa as of the finest quality possible. I do think that, at any rate on this basis, we can easily build up a very efficient air force. There are many other considerations. From a military point of view, there is a great difference of opinion as to what is essential in regard to training. I submit the most essential factor in producing a good flying man is continual flying. The Minister last session stated, in reference to the air mail service we had between Durban and Cape Town, that his advisers had informed him that that experience was of no value from a military point of view. I beg to differ from him, because they had the advantage of continual flying over a route which they became intensely familiar with. When it comes to specialized branches of the air force, such as machine-gunning, aerial bombing and photography, I realize that it is specialized training that is required, but the essential thing is that the pilot should be able to handle his machine efficiently. We now come to the consideration of the cost of maintaining an air force. The biggest factor is the maintenance of machines and equipment. Depreciation is a very important factor, and the cost of training is equally so. You also have the question of your workshops necessary to keep your squadrons in fully efficient flying order. But all this work, we must bear in mind, is necessarily unproductive as far as the country is concerned. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>At the time we were urging the enquiry into the condition of the defence force, the newspapers said that we wanted to make a Sunday School of it. That is not our intention, but there are many improvements that should be made. It will be in the interests of the defence force to have a few less bars at Roberts Heights. That is desirable in the interests of the young people there. They come from various parts of the country, and they get into temptation. We hope there will be a reduction in the number of bars, as in the number of police. I should like to quote the figures we find in the Estimates. We see that the headquarters staff consists of 135 men. This embraces the general department, the financial department, the department of the general staff and of the adjutant-general. It cost the country this year &#x00A3;53,860. Last year there were 137 people in it, and the cost was &#x00A3;50,990. That is only for salaries. Then there are the maintenance and transport costs. As we see, the number of persons in the department has been reduced by two, but the expenditure increased by &#x00A3;2,870. The item is a little misleading, because the quartermaster-general ought also to come under it, as he also belongs to the head administration. His department this year will contain 45 persons who will receive in salaries and allowances &#x00A3;13,253. Last year the department consisted of 46 persons, at a cost of &#x00A3;13,303. The number of persons was reduced by one, the expenditure increased by &#x00A3;50. The engineering corps ought to come under the vote for the quartermaster-general, and not under that of held artillery, because the field artillery is a fighting unit. Under that head we find 24 white men and 43 natives, and the expenditure is &#x00A3;7,406. The Ordnance Department should also not be under field artillery ; that department contains 16 white men and 29 natives, and the cost is &#x00A3;5,765, plus the costs of maintenance, transport, uniform, etc. Last year there were 64 white men and a certain number of natives, and the salaries were &#x00A3;7,978. What is the position to-day&#x003F; I made enquiries recently about the barracks in Pretoria. Some of the corrugated iron buildings had been condemned by the municipal inspectors, yet the poor non-commissioned officers have to live there. They have no private life. The buildings adjoin each other, and so do the gardens, and there can be no question of private family life. When we go into the figures, we find there are altogether in the head office at Pretoria 135 officers and other ranks, that cost the country &#x00A3;58,795. Then there are 45 officers and other ranks in the headquarters of the quartermaster-general, 24 officers and other ranks, and 43 natives in the engineering corps, 16 officers and other ranks and 29 natives in the ordinance, and 155 officers and other ranks and 121 natives in the department of war necessaries and other services, who draw &#x00A3;75,000. Altogether the headquarters comprise 375 officers and other ranks and 193 natives, costing the country &#x00A3;133,795. Then I ask what is the idea, what is the ideal&#x003F; We are economizing on instructors, but keeping a magnificent and strong headquarters in Pretoria. The Minister will say that the object is that if anything should happen in the country, it can be dealt with by headquarters. What is the position, however&#x003F; What is attained if the officers do not constantly remain in touch with the men How can they get the men under their influence&#x003F; Is that an ideal defence force&#x003F; It seems to me sometimes that the intention is to have a large headquarters with people wearing magnificent and splendid uniforms, and that it is a department which must surround the Minister of War, a sort of War Lord, and be altogether dazzling. We have no Minister of War, but a Minister of Defence, and in the days when difficulties may come, he should not be surrounded by a magnificent staff. It may be nice, but it is all camouflage. Our soldiers must, become like Cromwell&#x2019;s Ironsides. I ask whether we ought not rather to have a large number of instructors who come into touch with the men and who know how to treat them, rather than all this pomp and circumstance&#x003F; I know what the Minister will reply if I say anything about hospitals. When I go to Roberts Heights to inspect, no preliminaries are arranged, but when the Minister goes the carpets are brought out and all sorts of other things done, so that he inspects everything beautifully in order and spick and span. When we come as ordinary <span class="col_2917-2918" refersTo="page_0411"/>citizens, nobody takes any notice, and then we find what the actual position is.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that. But when we go into things we feel that the reorganization which really ought to take place is not that which the Minister and his advisers are carrying out. There should be reorganization in many other directions as well. I feel that there are difficulties. The hon. member for Hoopstad (Mr. Conroy) has spoken about the past, but I do not wish to do so. I heartily trust that, although in the past the defence force was used for political purposes, that time is behind us, and we shall see that we get the best men with experience and knowledge. Let ns, however, not forget to be careful how we treat the people. I know there are men who have been put on the streets owing to reorganization, and who have bitterness in their hearts and no future for themselves or their children. They go into the country with bitter feelings, and all sorts of things are mentioned by which people in the country are hurt. The people on the countryside will not get rifles, and to 10 per cent. the issue will be gratis. It should be more, and I hope we shall be able to supply rifles to 20 per cent. of the people gratis. I know the Minister will say that the taxpayer cannot stand it. I say we should rather abolish the magnificent uniforms and try to supply the citizens with arms and to teach them how to use them. We are surrounded by a powerful native population and we should especially think of the people living on the borders. A few years ago I saw in the Cape Peninsula how the Ethiopians were exciting the coloured people, and when I got to Zoutpansberg, I found that the same men, American negroes, were organizing the natives and preaching the doctrine&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Africa for the black man and away with the whites.</block>

<p>It is necessary that we should be able to protect, especially the outside districts, so that women and children can be safe. The Minister said that if action had suddenly to be taken, the police would have to do it. Then it is time to strengthen the police if the defence force is unable to do that. The police should do it.</p>

<p>I am not an authority on military matters, nor have I received the training in military science that some hon. members have. We find there is a fairly large number of them, but I think that, as the defence force and the reorganization schemes of the Minister are being attacked, I, as a member of the Government, am just as responsible as is the Minister of Defence. I feel that, to a certain extent the Minister is being attacked in a way which I do not think is quite fair. The Government is always prepared to receive fair criticism regarding the action of any Minister, but we should like to see criticism supported by facts. The hon. members for Pretoria (South) (Dr. van Broekhuizen) and Hoopstad (Mr. Conroy) have made a fairly strong attack. I am very glad that it has been done in a good spirit and with a view of assisting the Government so that the defence force can be put on a sound basis. I hope, however, that hon. members will not take it amiss of me if I point out certain unfairness in their criticism. I know that the hon. member for Pretoria (South) takes a great interest in the defence of the country. It is the duty of every citizen to take an interest in it, but I think he was a little unfair to-day in connection with Roberts Heights. The hon. member said that the witnesses at the enquiry commission on the defence force had to suffer on account of their evidence. I know that the hon. member for Pretoria (South) made the statement at the congress of the Nationalist party. I then told the Minister of Defence of it, and he wrote a letter to the hon. member asking him to mention a concrete case and that he would investigate it, and that if there was an officer who had behaved so unfairly towards people who had given evidence that officer would be immediately reprimanded. Did the hon. member for Pretoria (South) mention any concrete cases&#x003F; Members of Parliament are responsible people. Statements made here do not remain in Parliament, but go outside, and people get the impression that terribly unfair things are done at Roberts Heights. The hon. member for Pretoria (South) criticized an official of the defence force being secretary of the enquiry commission. Let me at once say that it is customary to appoint an official of the department concerned as secretary to a commission of enquiry. I, therefore, see nothing wrong in it. Now I come to the penalizing of people who gave evidence. The hon. member for Hoopstad (Mr. Conroy) mentioned the name du Toit. What happened in that case&#x003F; Sergeant du Toit, after the commission of enquiry, was promoted&#x2014;I will not say in connection with the enquiry, but in any case he was promoted. What happened further&#x003F;</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, there it is. Sergeant du Toit was actually promoted and what else happened&#x003F; In connection with the reorganization, Sergeant du Toit himself asked to be discharged and to enjoy the privileges connected therewith. I do not say this to offend the hon. member for Hoopstad, but the matter must not be put in a wrong light with the public ; therefore, I think that it is unfair to attack the Minister of Defence in connection with Sergeant du Toit. He was treated quite correctly. The hon. member for Hoopstad further compared the cost of the headquarters of the defence force with that of the police force. He thinks that a terribly large sum of money is being wasted, <span class="col_2919-2920" refersTo="page_0412"/>and that the Minister should not retrench from the bottom, but from the top. That depends on the way the estimates ore prepared. Under the defence vote the Minister and his whole staff appeared. That is a fairly large amount ; and, for that reason, it is not fair to compare the two departments. The hon. member should not include the Minister&#x2019;s department in his comparison. He further referred to the staff headquarters, and especially to the salaries. On page 70 of the estimates the hon. member will notice that, as regards staff officers, only six of the fifteen remain over. That is just where the hon. member complains there should be more economy. The hon. member for Hoopstad said five members of the force were discharged and five strikers put in their places. I have made enquiry and that is not the case. Where my hon. friends wanted more economy is precisely the place where the Minister of Defence has retrenched. There are to-day only six district staff officers, and their salary is 45s. per day. The headquarters staff is responsible for 175,000 men belonging to 142 commandos. This afternoon the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) said in connection with the cadet system that only one-eighth of the boys receive cadet training. The Minister, however, said that the hon. member had included all the school children. One surely cannot expect that children from their seventh year when they start their schooling shall be trained as cadets. The hon. member also included all the girls. I do not think that we have advanced so far that we can also make cadets of them, and one cannot expect it in the case of boys between seven and twelve years. I think that a very large part of school-going children get cadet training, because there are 42,000 cadets today. I welcome it that so many of them are getting a proper training. Now it is also said that we are discharging the best people from the defence force, viz., the instructors, and that we are permitting irresponsible people who have had no military training to give the children their military training. Hon. members are afraid that the latter in time of war will not render service, and that there will, therefore, be the lack of officers. That is no reason, if the teachers have had a military training in a military school, for saying that the change of instructors is not justified. I do not think that it is fair towards the teachers, who are willing to assist the defence force and to organize the children. What the Minister of Defence has done was to improve the organization. &#x00A3;80,000 was put on the estimates for rifle associations and the people can therefore be better organized than in the past. The new organization is also calculated to get the defence force on a better footing. Although the Government is trying to improve the defence force, and is responsible for the reorganization, the Minister of Defence is to-day attacked on all sides. If the attacks were based on facts, I Would not say a word. If the Minister had not acted fairly then I, too, would not remain silent, but I think he is being criticized for things he is not responsible for. There are to-day only six district staff officers. If hon. members had first made enquiries and asked for information at the headquarters of the defence force, they would not have taken up such an attitude. Before they spoke of discharge from the service, they should, first of all, have properly investigated the matter. Why do hon. members say such things&#x003F; It is not fair for them to do so if they have not first made enquiries. I will not take up the time of the House further, because this discussion on the defence vote has already lasted longer than any other vote on the estimates.</p>

<p>The Minister began his very illuminating and interesting statement by saying there were no politics now at Roberts Heights, and he was the best judge of that.

<p>I wish my constituents were as easily convinced as he is. If peace reigns at Roberts Heights it is because of the drastic things that have been done in the reconstruction and reorganization of the forces, I congratulate the hon. gentleman upon having wholeheartedly turned his attention to reform that was very much needed, and I would congratulate him still further if I knew that all political elements had disappeared. I would ask him to remember that the motto and slogan of our friends on the other side is that there are no politics with the South African party. It is all pure patriotism! I would be very glad indeed if we could take politics out of existence as far as the Civil Service is concerned, and the defence and police forces. The whole atmosphere here has been charged with a war spirit, and always overhanging us is this warning of further and furious fighting. We are told that the war that we are to expect is to be waged with gas. Remembering our resources in this direction I think we might look with confidence to the future, and the great part we may play in it. There are, we are told, two schools of thought. On the one hand we have the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) who represents the warrior class, and he wants us to be armed fully and prepared for the enemy at any cost.</p>

There is still with the Minister of Defence a love of militarism and all that goes with it&#x2014;so ornamental, so pretty, and so expensive&#x2014;and in the whole of his reconstruction proposals we see that while on the one hand there is a trend towards the commando system, to please our Nationalist friends here; on the other hand he is building up a little coterie of unadulterated militarism which this country does not want.</p>

<p>There is the so-called advisory board, and indeed right through there is still this claim to militarism. My recollections go back to the famous Frontier Armed and Mounted Police, and I wonder what Sir Walter Currie would have had to say of the &#x201C;brass hat brigade&#x201D; system. I only speak on the subject as a humble private in war (unpaid) in the presence of distinguished military authorities like the hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris) and the member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron). Speaking merely as a South African, I ask of this million of money which we spend on defence, how much is vital&#x003F; I would prefer it spent mainly on police protection. We should have the Canadian frontier police as an ideal. I do not despise the new air force, which should be kept up to the highest degree of efficiency, and also the artillery, but so far as the other soldiery are concerned I fail to see what is wrong in making a policeman, who can serve the public and preserve order, and be a military man as well when the time comes. If we look at our mounted police, what better do we want, so far as their whole equipment and turnout and efficiency is concerned&#x003F; We have to go further in reconstruction until we come to a simpler form and getting more for our money than under this present pro-military system. The Labour party declared a preference for a police system rather than a military system.</p>

Everywhere we hear the cry&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Give us more police protection.</block>

<p>At great cost this militarism is kept in order for a day that never arrives. We have seen in this country when the day of necessary defence has arrived, and force was wanted, the burger system in the Transvaal&#x2014;there are men in this hall who know of its simplicity, and made their reputations under it. I have seen it worked in the town in which I lived, when at midday word came in that the frontier was ablaze and farms being burnt, in the Gaika war. News was received in King William&#x2019;s Town, and before two o&#x2019;clock, 400 men, armed and equipped in their own proper way, rode out to the salvation of the farmers. You can have all this now, at moderate expense, and without all this tremendous militarism. I see there is provision made for &#x00A3;28,000 for the South African Military College.

Bring an instance &#x2014;bring me a concrete case. So far, everything I have investigated has been very much like the case of Sergeant du Toit.

When did I say that&#x003F; What is there in our rules preventing any man entering the force&#x003F; The college trains officers for the defence force, the burger force and the cadets.

That is not fair to these men. Then he says &#x201C;We say.&#x201D; Does he speak for the Labour party&#x003F; I also have some sort of knowledge of what the Labour party thinks on these matters, and most matters. I think it is grossly unfair to a number of men who are doing their duty to the best of their ability to be continually assailing them&#x2014;on public platforms and here&#x2014;with vague charges of favouritism which are unsubstantiated. <span class="col_2923-2924" refersTo="page_0414"/>My hon. friend (Mr. Conroy) says it had been reported to him that five of the seamen who went on strike had been engaged by the Engineering Corps, and that five men had been dismissed to make room for them. I sent for the officer commanding the unit, and found that no one was turned out to make room for strikers, and that no ex-strikers had been taken on. That is exactly the sort of story that is carried from mouth to mouth. If hon. members, when they hear these tales, will bring them to me, I will investigate them. It is also reported that certain ex-imperial officers engaged as artizans are doing clerical work. I suppose the foundation of the story is that when the unit was formed, five years ago, a warrant officer and a non-commissioned officer of the Royal Engineers were engaged, and still belong to the force. One is acting as sergeant-major, and the other as quartermaster. In forming the corps, naturally they would employ men who are not only artizans, but military engineers.</p>

The burghers to-day are for the most part unarmed. We have not, like other countries, a large defence force to defend the country in time of need. Our defence to a great extent depends on the citizens. The citizens, however, are unarmed to-day.

<p>To continue what I was saying. The principal items of expenditure for an air force are the maintenance of machines and equipment and the training of the personnel. If we had the force available the ideal disposition would be to have depots at various strategic points, instead of the force being centralized as it is now. Unfortunately we cannot afford a sufficiently strong force to occupy the strategic points. The ideal disposition&#x2014;from a purely military aspect&#x2014;would be to have units at Pretoria, Durban, and along the coast line, for the air force will play a very important part in coastal defence. There should also be a depot at a place like Bloemfontein. The country, however, cannot afford to do this to-day. My suggestion therefore&#x2014;and it is deserving of the serious consideration of the Government&#x2014;is that the Government should extensively develop its civil air service. I do not mean that we should reduce our present air force, but we could revise the expenditure in such a way that with the addition of say &#x00A3;40,000 we could afford to develop our civil aviation service. We have recently had the advice and opinion of notable airmen, and their view is that South Africa lends itself to the development of civil aviation and that the development of civil aviation will mean a national insurance from a defence point of view. In taking this into consideration, I think we ought to consider this matter very seriously, and whether it is not possible that the Government can see its way clear to add &#x00A3;40,000 or &#x00A3;50,000 to the Defence Vote, for the development of civil aviation. If the Government did so it is natural that the defence authorities should lay down certain rules and regulations concerning the type of aircraft to be used and the training they considered necessary that the personnel should undergo in order to establish an effective reserve. Take the British navy to-day. Look at the tremendous reserve of man power and the tremendous reserve of actual ships that Great Britain has, simply because she subsidises and develops the various merchant services in the empire. We could afford to do that in respect of our aviation. We could develop our civil aviation services immediately at a very small cost to the country, a matter, as I have said before, of &#x00A3;40,000 or &#x00A3;50,000. We would have men continually flying over the routes and getting an intimate knowledge of the conditions of the country and the lie of the land, which is, I claim, so essential from a military point of view. Before the company operating those services can make a profit they have to make allowances for depreciation and the refitting of their services as far as equipment is concerned. That also would come out of the &#x00A3;50,000 which the Government could devote to the development of civil aviation ; but to-day the air force is in the unfortunate position that it is limited in its development owing to the fact that they have not got the money to spend on it commensurate with the needs of the country. I do <span class="col_2925-2926" refersTo="page_0415"/>suggest that the Minister should very seriously consider whether he would entertain a scheme of this description, and if he would entertain a scheme of this description I feel convinced that it would be of very material benefit to this country that he should obtain the views of those who have had experience overseas in developing various services in Europe. Another point which I think should be brought before the Minister and the committee, is the fact that in developing civil aviation you are spending money which will be beneficial to the commercial community. If you went to the country and said you were going to spend &#x00A3;50,000 on the development of civil aviation as an adjunct to defence and in return give a service from Johannesburg to Cape Town, to Durban and possibly Walvis Bay, I am satisfied that you would get the country to support you. The question of putting up a subsidy of &#x00A3;8,000 is a mere flea-bite. It was done to show the desire of those in authority to develop aviation. We want to make ourselves as self-reliant as we can. Here is an opportunity at a comparatively small expense to make South Africa the premier aerial country in the world, and I commend for the Government&#x2019;s consideration the suggestion I have laid before it this evening.</p>

<p>I wish to raise one point, and that is in connection with the medical facilities provided for the members of the permanent staff. The men on the permanent staff to-day have to make use of the district surgeons. They have no choice in the matter of doctors. Complaints have reached me personally from some of these men that they usually go to other doctors, and that for personal or other reasons they have no confidence in the district surgeon. The result is that they have to pay. I have raised that point in connection with the railway service. In some of the departments of the civil service facilities have been granted to the public servants to obtain the services of other doctors. In the Department of the Interior, I believe, the panel system has been introduced. I would urge upon the Minister of Defence to tackle this matter and see whether he cannot give any satisfaction to these men, because I can assure him that there is an amount of dissatisfaction, and dissatisfaction which can be clearly explained. I hope the Minister will see whether he cannot follow the policy which has been laid down by a department like the Department of the Interior.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>I regret that the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) is not in his place, as he gave us a very illuminating account of mistakes made by unpractised soldiers in the field. If there were time, I could give him some marvellous illustrations of the mistakes made by military men in the field in our own time&#x2014;mistakes that were very costly indeed. I would draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to figures given to me by his own department. Hundreds of men have preferred to pay &#x00A3;15 to get out of the defence force, in which they meant to spend their lives, and get away home. By the dozen they have come to me in Pretoria and said they could not stick it any longer. I am glad that the Minister has now only one portfolio, so that he may devote himself entirely to this administrative question, and I hope that, under his reconstruction scheme, he will not have men paying out their hardly-got money to be allowed to leave the defence force. I got into some trouble with a section of my constituents by referring to Roberts Heights as &#x201C;rotten.&#x201D; I was not so referring to it in a social sense. Half the buildings would be better burned down, as unfit for occupation. In regard to the hospital, there should be very better accommodation. It is a veritable tinder-box. If I read some letters I have received as to the married quarters, it would surprise the Minister. Three corporals were recently punished for finding bugs in their beds. All Roberts Heights rocked with laughter&#x2014;the whole place is bug-ridden. For nearly eighteen months the Minister has been in power and the conditions at Roberts Heights are little better to-day than they were when he took office ; in regard to the quarters generally. I admit there have been improvements, and possibly it is the restrictive hand of the Minister of Finance which prevents necessary reconstruction, in which case I hope the Minister of Defence will show bravery and fitness for his high office by bringing strong military pressure to bear upon his Cabinet colleague. Hon. members have a duty to their constituents, and Roberts Heights falls in my constituency. We are convinced from our investigations of complaints that the hon. member for Pretoria (North) (Dr. van Broekhuizen) and myself are speaking the truth and are justified in bringing forward proper representations, however distasteful they may be to those in power.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN BROEKHUIZEN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say that I am really sorry that our criticism has been received as it has been to-night. The only reason we criticized is because we are friends. If we may not criticize I am sorry. The Minister of Agriculture said that I am responsible for what I said. Certainly. I regard myself as responsible for every word I said. That retaliation has taken place is without doubt. I am convinced that most of the non-commissioned officers and men who have left the service are people who gave evidence before the enquiry commission. It is very strange to me that it is possible for the people who gave evidence to say so. I did not say a word about politics. I have before me the Defence Enquiry Commission&#x2019;s report, and the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) has to-day praised the chairman of the commission, General Lukin, who is no longer alive to-day, as one of the most capable officers he has known. Allow me to quote what the commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How far the lack of promotion of individual officers in the force is attributable to political influence it is difficult to state, because definite evidence about the political feelings of the persons concerned is not easily obtained. Certain officers of the Active Citizen Force were promoted to high position in the Permanent Force for services in connection with the suppression of the 1914 Rebellion, and during the 1914-1918 war. The conclusion <span class="col_2927-2928" refersTo="page_0416"/>that political considerations had something to do with this promotion can hardly be controverted.</block>

<p>That is the statement of an officer who is admitted by the whole House to be a man of irreproachable conduct, who would not say anything that was not correct. I will not go further into the matter, but that is here in the report. I have read a letter to hon. members in which the writer refers to the taking of revenge. They were not my own words, but the words of someone else who had to suffer on that account. Then we are told that we must be responsible for what we say. I repeat that I will take responsibility for my words, and repeat what I said at the commencement, that I make these observations for the benefit of the defence force, because I take an interest in it. I want to have a defence force of which every Afrikander can be proud, and in which promotion does not take place on account of political influence, but on account of knowledge and experience, and in which a man will be promoted to the post he is entitled to. That is all I ask. It has also been said that the secretary of a commission is always appointed out of the department. Recently, in the case of the Police Commission, the secretary was not taken from the police, but from the Department of Justice ; therefore, I do not see the reason why, when a commission is appointed, the man who makes a statement before the commission shall not be guaranteed against persecution. Every officer knows that if a soldier gives evidence against some officer or other, the life of that soldier will be made a hell in the regiment. That is why it is impossible to give the names of the victims. That is a fact we cannot get past. I will not say any more, because I have said what I wanted to. The figures I have quoted are taken from the estimates and are correct. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, I want to close by saying that I heartily trust the Minister of Defence will do everything in his power to make the defence force what it ought to be, and that no promotion will take place through fear or favour or for political purposes, but by virtue of efficiency. I trust that the population of the countryside will be better armed, because, although a commencement has been made, much more can be done in that direction, and that gradually we shall see that the defence force will not merely have a swelled head, but legs to walk with, so that it will be a blessing to the country and the people.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>No doubt there was a great deal of dissatisfaction in the past about the defence force. There was the grievance that too much of the money for the defence force was spent in salaries in the offices, while rifle associations, etc., did not receive enough attention, and were neglected in a disgraceful way. I do not want to go into general matters but to point out a few particular things. We find in the Estimates that the salaries and allowances have been reduced by &#x00A3;58,000. I am thankful for that. I am glad that the money which was used in the offices is less. Then we see that the amount for the citizen forces and cadets has been increased by &#x00A3;79,000. I am also glad of that. What, however, I specially want to urge is more assistance in wapenshaws because wapenshaws organized by commandants are of great use. If, however, say 500 people take part then it is no good supplying 3,000 blind cartridges. I am glad that more has been put on the Estimates for rifle associations, but want to urge especially that wapenshaws should be encouraged by providing properly for the necessary outfit. We must encourage them as much as possible. In my experience they are most beneficial.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. F. TOM NAUD&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I should also like to say a few words. I am certain that the Minister of Defence does not appreciate the terribly great demand there is by the population of the countryside for arms. I am certain that if the Minister went more to the outside districts and came into personal touch with the people there he would understand why it is so necessary to assist them. It is easy to say that in the case of trouble people in the northern Transvaal for instance will be able to be armed within a few days, but the supply of rifles within a few days will not assist the people, because then they will already have been murdered. The people live there surrounded by a large number of natives. The man who risks his life to make the country habitable and goes far into the interior to make his living amongst the natives, deserves good treatment. There are some of them who are actually poor and cannot buy rifles, and when they ask to be supplied with rifles they are not encouraged. They are not asking for an impossible thing, they only ask it so that they can do their duty to the State, and when they ask for rifles on the hire purchase system I really cannot follow the argument why they should not get the rifles on easy terms. It has been said that the system has been tried in the past and been a failure. Why was it a failure&#x003F; Other departments&#x2014;the Departments of Lands and of Agriculture&#x2014;trust the farmers there with large sums of money, so that they can practically buy their cattle on the hire purchase system and the money is repaid although I admit that now and again there is difficulty. The people ask for the cattle to enrich themselves, and then they are assisted; but where they ask for arms not only to protect themselves but the State then difficulties are put in the way of repayment on easy terms. I cannot understand the reason and explain it clearly to the people. If they say that the Minister is unsympathetic I have remained quiet, because that is the only explanation I can give to the people who are situate in such difficult circumstances. I hope the Minister will come himself to the outside districts to see the conditions there and then he will understand the position. It is easy to talk if one has only knowledge of the conditions in the larger towns, but the Minister has not yet been there, and if he came there then he would appreciate the difficulties of the people. It is said that the rifle associations will be given one rifle gratis for every ten <span class="col_2929-2930" refersTo="page_0417"/>members so that those who do not possess rifles can still get rifle practice. A farmer who has his own rifle is not anxious to take it to the range because everyone wants to use it. It would be the same with the 10 per cent. rifles. A man has to know his rifle very well because that is the only way in which he can use it properly. He should also feel that it is his own property. I do not know where the practice comes in with the rifles. A man must know his rifle and how he should shoot with it when the wind blows or when the rifle is inclined to shoot right, left, high or low. Therefore I do not see that the rifles will assist the people in shooting properly. A man should possess his own rifle and be proud of it. The people are willing to pay if they are only given tune. I do not see why after a man has paid off &#x00A3;2 on his rifle it cannot be arranged for the commandants to collect the rest of the debt, even if a few pounds are lost it will not be too much, especially when one remembers that there are thousands of pounds available for animals and land. If the Minister has the required sympathy he should see that the people get rifles on easy terms. I know that he is sympathetic and wants the people to have rifles. But he has not yet shown that he is ready to do something for the poor man who also would like to have a rifle.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to bring to the Minister intended doing the dissatisfaction in the Free State on account of the burghers not being armed. When I explained what the Minister intended doing the dissatisfaction disappeared to a great extent. As for my district, however, there are about 65 per cent. who can buy arms if they are obtainable at cost price. The great difficulty however is the other 35 per cent. I think the Government will do well if it increased the 10 per cent. that are to be supplied with the rifles to 25 per cent. I would, however, suggest that the Minister should try to supply rifles on the instalment system. Allow the people&#x2014;we can make the experiment with 10 per cent.&#x2014;to pay a few sovereigns cash and the rest in instalments. We can then see how it works and if the Government does not lose it can be extended. This will not mean extra expense to the Government. Then I want to ask if it is not possible to make some provision or other for burghers to get arms from the Government at places in the villages as, e.g., the magistrate&#x2019;s office or the police station. It is a great trouble to fetch a rifle from headquarters. I hope the Minister will give his attention to this.</p>

<p>I think that the Minister was a little too severe on the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) and the hon. member for Pretoria District (South) (Dr. van Broekhuizen), particularly in connection with their complaint on the question of victimization, because we know perfectly well that even in connection with industrial matters people have found themselves dismissed on account of their political and trade union views. We know how difficult, it is for them to establish a case of victimization, although one may be morally certain that they are cases of victimization. And if it is difficult for them, one can realize how much more difficult it is to prove to the satisfaction of a Minister that a man in the defence force has been victimized because he has given evidence before a commission. I hope the Minister will take that into consideration and not so lightly dismiss the complaints made in connection with these matters.</p>

<p>I believe particular cases have been mentioned. It was general talk in Pretoria after the last commission was appointed and took evidence that men were being victimized and I think the Minister would be well-advised, if he has not already done so, to get about himself and find out how things are doing instead of being dependent on his chief officials for information. The best evidence one can adduce is that men are paying money to get out of the defence force, so there must be some discontent in the defence force. I should like to ask the Minister something in connection with mine-sweeping on page 68. As a layman I always understood that mine-sweeping was something carried out in time of war. It is something like &#x00A3;8,000 and I would like to know what service is being done in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>It is absolutely essential, if the defence scheme is soundly based and solidly supported, it must be by public opinion, and I do not know whether the Minister proposes to convert public opinion or defer to it. Perhaps it will be a mixture of the two. It is not quite clear to us whether the Minister is leading public opinion or simply being pushed from behind into the scheme of re-organization, but perhaps he will take into consideration some of the representations which have been made affecting his proposals. His problem may be reduced to this. He has devolving on him to take such measures of reasonable security as the finances of the country can stand without undue interference with the individual or the country&#x2019;s progress. Again I say he cannot obtain any reasonable standard of efficiency unless he begins to build up from the bottom. I see <span class="col_2931-2932" refersTo="page_0418"/>no reason or difficulty whatever in adopting universal cadet training. The advantages are enormous to the individual and the State. For one thing, undoubtedly it would be found that cadet training would improve the health.</p>

<p>I do not see his particular difficulty. He cannot base it on the ground of expense. On page 51 the cost is given as only &#x00A3;1 1s. 7d. per unit. I do not see on that ground that he can possibly refrain from putting this scheme into operation. It is necessary, so far as health statistics are concerned, that a cadet scheme should be established. Other countries go to no end of trouble in adopting such measures for health and development as Swedish exercises. Later in life these exercises are undertaken reluctantly. Bodily exercise is beneficial to health only if it is accompanied by a mental attitude of enjoyment. I see no reason why that should not accompany cadet training. It will develop character too, and that is a very important part of the training of a young man for after life and if he has a sense of discipline and duty received from cadet training, these form the main requirements not only of good citizenship but of individual success in after life. Why forego these great advantages apart from the military aspect which I have already alluded to.</p>

<p>Not nearly fast enough and not extensively enough. I put it to the Minister. As we have in our legislation adopted the principle of universal training but for financial reasons are not able to put into effect on the lines laid down in the statute book why not carry out the spirit of that universal training when you can do so, and have the financial means made available to him&#x003F; We know a good deal of the unpopularity of the defence force among the growing men arises from the fact that late in life they are called on to do rather irksome things. It is as irksome to them as for a boy of 18, who has never learned to read and write, to painfully have to make pothooks and so on. That ought to be taken into consideration. Consider the value to the existing units of having trained cadets. I have here a letter from one of the most successful commanding officers of an infantry battalion.

<p>I was just about to read a communication from a commanding officer, who says that the abolition of the training of cadets is a fatal mistake, as from his experience of the last two drafts of men, the marked difference between these men trained in cadet detachments and those untrained, was most noticeable. Let me explain what a universal system of cadet training would mean. This year just under 20,000 boys will attain the age of 14 years. The whole of that number cannot join cadet units for various reasons&#x2014; physical disability will account for a great many, and the locality of their residences will also prevent many boys joining cadet units&#x2014; but, allowing that only 10,000 are trained every year, in ten years&#x2019; time we should have upwards of 50,000 ex-cadets of 19 years and over. They would be trained men, although not complete soldiers. We should also have 50,000 boys serving as cadets.</p>

<p>The system of cadet training is very incomplete. The chief difficulty will be found, not with the boys themselves, but with their parents. I have heard the word &#x201C;militarism&#x201D; used this evening. I do not think there is the least danger of the spread of militarism in this country. If you are going to cut out everything that encourages a war-like spirit, you must scrap all South African and other history. I appeal to the Minister to simplify his regulations. I am glad to notice his declaration of the purpose for which the defence force exists, and that is for war, and I hope he will have that written up in large letters in every office in his department. A certain unit had a band which was entitled to a certain payment for extra work. The account was made out by the band sergeant, signed by the bandmaster and adjutant, initialled by the commanding officer, and sent to the district staff officer, who forwarded it to headquarters. Some very accurate official in the Finance Department went through the extension of the figures, and found a mistake of 3d. So the document was sent back through these various channels for the alteration to be initialled, and twenty sets of initials were on the account before it was finally passed for payment. This is important as showing how the spirit of preparation for war exists in the Defence Department. I think some very definite reorganization must be necessary in that branch of the administration. When we remember that, in times of war, commanding officers will have to be entrusted with the expenditure <span class="col_2933-2934" refersTo="page_0419"/>of vast sums of money, and they, having had no training in military finance, we shall have results such as we saw during the last war. In view of the special circumstances of the defence force, some recasting of the accounting arrangements is absolutely necessary, and commanding officers must be given a free hand.</p>

<p>Now that the storm on those benches has died down I may be allowed to make a few remarks on the reorganization scheme as it has been put before us by the Minister of Defence. I wish to express my appreciation of the full and fair statement which was made to us by the Minister and especially the fair spirit in which his statement was made, but I am bound to express my disappointment with the details of that scheme. I wish to raise a few points of criticism in no party spirit at all, but I think that the Minister is on wrong lines and the results to which he has come are a danger to the future defence of this country. I do not know why the Minister should have come to those results. It may be that he has been pushed by the forces behind him. I know that the Minister has been for a long time subjected to very severe pressure and to what I consider unfair criticism on the part of his friends. And if I criticise his reorganization scheme to-night it will not be on the lines of the criticism which has been directed against him by his own friends. It is possible that the Minister has been pushed by the forces behind him farther than his own judgment has approved. It may also be that he has had a laudable desire to show some practical economies in his department. Economy is good and I am an economist, but I do not think it is fair that one department like that of railways should show an increase of &#x00A3;3,000,000 in one year and that the Minister of Defence should come forward as a counter-balance with an economy of &#x00A3;16,000.</p>

<p>That is a false point of view. To look upon an essential insurance like defence as an unproductive service is a very great mistake. You are running the risk of a colossal loss in future if you make a mistake in regard to defence. I would urge hon. members to bear in mind that it is not merely a question of economy that we are dealing with. We are concerned with the honour of this country ; we are concerned with the status of this country. We talk about equality, we talk about our equal nationhood among other nations of the world, but that, of course, places certain obligations upon us. It is no use talking that unless you are prepared to shoulder the proper burdens. I have taken up the position for years now that our defence scheme should, within reason, be more or less in harmony with the status of this country. In regard to naval defence, the Minister says that the conditions are such in the world that for a long time to come we need not expect an attack by any first-class power by sea. That is not the real point, because it is not a case even of attack by a first-class power. If a 20th class power were to attack us by sea or threaten us by sea we would be entirely helpless. There are deeper issues at stake than economy. It is a question of honour and of our status. And if this country wants to hold up its head in the world it ought also in all fairness to be prepared to maintain a fair and reasonable defence force and defence system to uphold its honour and status in the world. The Minister says that the defence scheme before the war went too far, that it was a scheme which in its ultimate effects would have been beyond the capacity of this country and, now that the war is over and there is no imminent danger of trouble in the world there is no justification for so large a scheme as I then laid before the country. Even assuming that that is so, we have still to look at the reorganization proposal of the Minister in his present scheme to see whether it is sound and whether it is feasible, and whether under that scheme we can look forward with a certain feeling of safety to the future defence of this country. And I must frankly say I have not that feeling. If I look at this scheme in all fairness and I ask myself whether in years to come I should like to be responsible for the defence of this country under this scheme, I should hesitate very much to say yes. I will tell the committee why. Two things are essential in any defence system. In the first place you must make certain of discipline and that your arrangements are such as to lead to a disciplined force. It need not be a big force, it need not be 50,000 men, but you must have a disciplined force. In the second place the training of your officers is a matter of first-class importance. It is no use sending a mob into the field. Unless your officers are properly trained, you are simply sending your men to slaughter. When you apply these two tests to the scheme of the Minister, I think you can see the weakness at once. Take the case of officers. I put the question to the Minister: How is he, in future, going to find his officers&#x003F; How is he going to train his officers&#x003F; The scheme which I had originally under the Defence Act provided for the proper training of officers ; there was a permanent force in connection with which it was possible to train them. If you want to train officers, it is of no use merely having a class lectured by instructors ; you won&#x2019;t get them in that way. I ask myself how are the staff officers of the future going to be trained&#x003F; <span class="col_2935-2936" refersTo="page_0420"/>What is the training they are going to get&#x003F; If I look at this scheme they are only going to a school where they will be lectured by military instructors.</p>

<p>If the Minister will be patient, I will come to that. I am explaining to him that the scheme we had originally was a balanced scheme. It made provision for the proper training of officers. They did not go merely to a school, and attend lectures, but also had a proper training. You cannot make an officer by merely lecturing to him ; you cannot in that way get the sort of man you would entrust an army to in the field. Can you have properly trained officers under this scheme of the Minister&#x003F; They cannot be properly trained. There is no force from which and with which and in association with which they can learn the practical business of training. There is not a single one left. The Minister says that we were left with 200 ; that is where I blame him. The position is very simple. We were under the gravest compulsion to economize in the last few years, and we had to retrench, and to weaken the permanent force beyond what was safe, and we were finally left with this bare skeleton of 200 men. Nobody defended it. I never defended it. But see what the Minister has done. The compulsion has passed away. We are not in times when year after year the Government is forced with heavy deficits. Those times are past ; at least, for the present. [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smuts">

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>In New Zealand, I believe, it is the same. Our defence arrangements were largely based upon the Swiss system and the Australian system. We had before us the report of Lord Kitchener in regard to the working of the Australian system. I put it to hon. members&#x2014;this House is full of men who have borne the brunt of war&#x2014;and I ask them, is it not a fair and legitimate criticism on my part to say that, under this scheme, no officers can be properly trained&#x003F; It is simply impossible. There is no means of training them. They might be trained with the police perhaps ; otherwise they cannot be trained. Take again the point of discipline. We all know what the weakness of the old system was. The Minister says he is going back to the commando system. I have a great feeling of regard for the old commando system. Three years of my own life I spent under that system. We lost the Boer war because of the commando system. The position was simply that, with the best military material in the world, we did not have in the Boer army that modicum of training and organization which would have turned that most valuable material into a real engine of war ; and the result was what we know. Now I have criticized the Minister before. I have said that no proper use is being made of the young men on the veld and in the countryside, and they are practically excluded from this scheme. He says that he is doing the same thing as I have done; and, in a sense, that is true. The difference is, again, we were driven by hard necessity and by reasons of overpowering economy to cut down the force and to delay the training of the defence units in the countryside until there were better times. The better times have come, and the Minister, instead of resuming the system we had before, and giving a fair reasonable training to the young men on the veld, says he is going to rely on the commando system; and, in connection with that, he says there will ultimately be 40 squadrons of 200 men each, who will get four days&#x2019; training per annum. I appeal to all members of the committee, apart from all party considerations &#x2014;will that be of any use whatever&#x003F; Four days&#x2019; training of these young men with a rifle and horse, and two days&#x2019; wapenskou where they shoot at a range&#x003F; Is that training&#x003F; Is that organization&#x003F; Are you in that way to get any organized force at all from the young men of the veld&#x003F; I am sure you are going to get nothing at all. The defence force of the future, with which we may have to face a serious situation, will consist of officers who have not been properly trained, who have never had the opportunity of being properly trained, and of men who have had four days&#x2019; training and two days&#x2019; wapenskou. In my opinion, a scheme like this will never be the defence of this country. It will pay this country to keep up the true military spirit in this country&#x2014;not the soldier spirit, but the spirit of citizen defence. It may be all peace in the world and apparently fair sailing and fair weather. We never know for long what the position may be in this continent and in this land of ours. I think the Minister has gone too far. He has abolished instructors, and even the cadets will not get proper training. They will get training from their schoolmasters, and that is not a proper training at all. This economy is very poor economy indeed, and will lead to very expensive results in future. With regard to the other forces, all instructors are cut down. The Minister has had practical <span class="col_2937-2938" refersTo="page_0421"/>war experience, has been in the field, and knows what these considerations mean that I am urging to-night, and I would ask him, even at the expense of increasing his vote, to retrace his steps. We should have our defence force arranged on a basis so that we can feel we are reasonably safe for the future. The Minister may talk about an army of 10,000 men, but that army will have no trained officers, and will be without discipline, and that being so I think it is unfair to ask the country to rely on a force like that for its defence in future. I have made these remarks because I feel strongly on this matter, not from a party point of view at all. I can understand that there may be difference of judgment on many of these matters, but it is perfectly clear that this system is unsafe and is going to be a danger to our future security. The time will come when we shall be tested. We have been tested before. We shall then find it is all wrong, and that our whole new system is wrong and is no real security and insurance to this country. We have at present this great advantage that South Africa is full of men who have had great war experience. We have them both in the towns and in the countryside, so for a number of years you are reasonably safe, as you will be able to call on enormous reserves of men with military experience in this country. But the time will come when we will not have one single man with practical experience, not one veteran of the old school, and we will be left with the young men of the future with four or six days&#x2019; training in the training squadrons, and officers who have been through the course of lectures in the military school at Roberts Heights. I ask any hon. member with experience in this House whether he will entrust the future safety and honour of South Africa to a force of that kind. I think we are making a gross mistake, and will soon find it necessary to retrace our steps on the arrangements the Minister is making now and make far more adequate provision for the future defence of this country.</p>

<p>The forces behind me strongly urged the undoubted fact that under the system I inherited from the previous Government not one single young man in the country districts was getting any military training at all.

<p>I mean the permanent force. It was the training school for officers. It never was a training school. This is what we had. Two squadrons of South African Mounted Rifles, 200 Field Artillery, 3 Batteries Garrison Artillery, and a small enginering corps. I have abolished the S.A.M.R. which, from a military point of view, have no place in the scheme of things. Either you depend on a citizen army, or upon the nucleus of a standing army for your officers. Clearly the standing army as a recruiting ground for officers was never in the picture. The idea of this little detachment of riflemen was not that of a training school for officers but of a force ready to move to any place at once. So far as the permanent forces I inherited are concerned, we still have the field artillery and the garrison artillery and the engineers, then the criticism of placing the artillery or two batteries in detachments of a section each. Don&#x2019;t the artillery work in sections very often&#x003F; All those I have consulted do not anticipate any necessary deterioration in the standerd of efficiency of the artillery.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Does the right hon. member seriously suggest that, in his scheme, he was going to train officers in the small body of the permanent force I have abolished&#x003F; We shall train the officers in the training squadrons, and we shall have to rely on the development of the military spirit and enthusiasm of those officers, as we have to rely on those qualities in the active citizen force. If we were looking at the matter from an ideal point of view, we would certainly like to have a considerable regiment, as they have in Canada, trained up to a very high state of efficiency and serving as an example for all citizen forces. In Australia they have a very small permanent force, I think only one or two batteries of artillery, and rely entirely on the organization of their, citizen force, and the same thing in New Zealand. I differ entirely from my hon. <span class="col_2939-2940" refersTo="page_0422"/>friend, who in reality had neither a citizen army nor a defence force, but a small permanent force which in a state of war would sink into insignificance compared with the big citizen forces. When we speak of a South African army, we mean a citizen army, and we have to develop it. The steps these estimates embody are a very great advance towards the training of our citizen army, compared with the system I inherited from the right hon. gentleman. That is our view, and despite the fears of hon. members opposite as to cadets, I have sufficient confidence in the working out of these schemes to be perfectly sure that, as they develop, it will be found that we are on the right lines in following a policy that we can develop within our means and not taking as our basis a machine which is so costly that we have to spend so much money on it that we have no funds left with which to train the citizen soldier. I do not think I can add any more. Time will show. I am not speaking in any flippant sense. I say it because I am convinced that our arrangements are now on lines where we can develop along lines consonant with our needs and consonant with our financial resources, and on lines where we are spending the bulk of our money on the fighting soldier end of the machine, and not so much money on the machinery of organization. I must reply to my hon. friend&#x2019;s question about the shirts. I am very sorry I cannot tell him the price of the shirts, but I shall certainly telegraph to Pretoria and get him the information about the price of the shirts.</p>

<p>I dare say that by tomorrow afternoon the Minister will have the information about the shirts, so that we may hope that before he closes his vote this information will be available. In many cases it has been felt that it would have been to the advantage of East Griqualand if it had been attached to Natal, and I think in the matter of the defence question, it would have been particularly in our interests if that had been the case. When the Minister attempted to reduce the strength of some of the Natal regiments, it was made very plain to him from that province that it was hands off those regiments. We in the Transkeian territories had one regiment, and one only, the T.M.R. I would point out to the Minister that in the Transkeian territories we have getting on towards one half of the population of the Cape Province. Last year the Minister announced his intention of disbanding that regiment. We asked him for reasons and suggested to him that it would be advisable to keep that regiment on. He told us it was inefficient and uneconomical, and that he considered that the T.M.R. should be disbanded. He says that the regiment has been inefficient, and I say that that is entirely the fault of his own department.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I must correct the hon. member. To say that a regiment is inefficient is rather a slur upon the officers and men of that regiment. What I said was that having regard to the conditions under which it existed, it would probably be unavailable in time of trouble, and that it was spread over too large a territory for it to come together for a proper regimental training.</p>

<p>I say the Department did not make the slightest attempt to bring that regiment together for the training that the Minister thinks of.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister knows very well that if a squadron of that sort is to be of any value it must be a mobile squadron. There was no opportunity given for mounted drill of any description whatever. There was never a musketry instructor appointed. The O.C. of a squadron himself said to me recently&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is heartbreaking work trying to do anything to hold this regiment together. In face of the utter lack of interest on the part of the Department, it is just as well to let the whole thing go.</block>

<p>When the Minister proposed to disband that regiment he said he was taking steps to organize the defence rifle association so as to be an effective force to take the place of that regiment. That was a year ago. What does he say to-day&#x003F; He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am now taking stock of the position.</block>

<p>After having disbanded the only force we had in the territories with the exception of about 70 police he says he is taking stock of the position. Talk about Nero fiddling when Rome was burning! We at least hoped we would get some share in the new disposition of the small permanent force. We at least hoped that one battery of artillery would be stationed at Umtata. &#x201C;If there is going to be trouble in these districts it is going to be easier to let the Border go &#x201D;&#x2014;it is in that spirit that the defence of the territories is being organized. Organization there is none. You call them rifle associations. The commandant lives out in the country, and if they are warned you have to notify him to get the men together. You have no means of doing so. When you have got to him it is his job to notify all his men. How long is that going to take&#x003F; There is no organization for the supply of horses at all. The rule is that every new recruit is supposed to have 25 rounds of ammunition supplied to him in a sealed packet which he has to retain intact in case of emergency. During the past two years the Minister has not issued a single packet of ammunition to any man who has joined the defence rifle association, and the majority of them have not a single round. Commissariat organization simply does not exist. The men have got to find everything themselves, and by that time any emergency which arises will either be over, or it will have spread beyond the possibility of extinguishing it. I take <span class="col_2941-2942" refersTo="page_0423"/>it that, more especially in those territories, arms are essentially a requirement. If these defence rifle associations are to be of any use whatsoever, you must arm them. In the territories 50 men were given two rifles. I do not know whether the Minister expected them to stand in line, pass the rifles on from one to the other, or use knuckle dusters. Fifty men to march to war and two rifles! [time limit.]</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to add a few words to what my hon. friend has said who has just spoken (Mr. Gilson). In the old Cape days, 25 years ago, when I was a young man, and when we did not have half the population in the Transkei that we have to-day, we had a most efficient force. We had 3 or 4 mounted regiments, and our young men were extremely keen on becoming members of those forces, but to-day, for some extraordinary reason, the Minister says it is not an economic force, and he cannot train these men properly, as</p>

<block name="quote">They are scattered over such a large extent of country that he cannot bring them together.</block>

<p>The Minister should see that the young men living there are trained as they were in the old Cape days. Is there any reason why they should not be&#x003F; I appeal to the Prime Minister, who has been through these territories and knows the conditions there, and who promised last session that before the T.M.R. were disbanded he would look into the matter. Is it not possible to utilise the man power that exists in the Territories and formulate some plan by which we can defend ourselves in the Territories in the time of trouble&#x003F; We have a million natives there, as my hon. friend has said, and we have half-a-million Basutos on the other side. The Minister says there is no danger from without and no danger on our borders. Let us face the danger candidly, and say what danger does exist exists in our midst. We, on the border, have no defence whatever, except a mobile squadron of 50 men. I appeal to the hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) who knows the position to support me. Is it right that the young men should not be forced to do their duty&#x003F; I maintain that the Minister and the Government have neglected their duty, and have not provided sufficient defence for that part of the country. I agree with my friend that every young man should have a rifle. We have no ammunition, and we cannot get rifles.</p>

<p>Surely the Minister is not going to argue that it is the duty of all the young men of the Transkei to buy rifles to defend themselves. If is rather the duty of the Government to provide rifles. At the outbreak of the war all the young men of the Transkei went to Port Elizabeth to the training camp there. Only ten days after we arrived at Port Elizabeth there was an outbreak among the natives in the Mount Fletcher district, and shops were burnt down. Many of us were at the bioscope, and a notice was flashed on the screens ordering all Transkeian men to return to camp, and we marched back at 10 o&#x2019;clock, and by 2 o&#x2019;clock that night 150 of us were entrained. Why were the Transkeian men ordered back&#x003F; Because everyone of us had been trained. We were all men who could ride, who had had experience in the Transkeian territories, and the authorities knew that we would be the most useful force under the circumstances.
