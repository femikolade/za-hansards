<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STALS</person>:</from>

<p>It is far from my mind to start any debate which may lead to any feeling of friction or any unpleasant relationship between this House and the Senate, but I raise my objection to paragraph (1) of this report purely on grounds of principle and I hope that any discussion which may follow will be purely on the merits of the Committee&#x2019;s recommendation. My objection to the acceptance of the report is based mainly on two grounds. The first is that the House is called upon to accept a resolution from the Committee which makes, I may say, a very radical change in the accepted practice as to the rights and privileges of this House as far as pensions are concerned. Secondly, I wish to raise the objection that I regard this House not only as entitled to discuss, but that it must have an opportunity of fully discussing the merits of the case, so that when it accepts the recommendations of the Committee it must do so with open eyes, and I maintain that this opportunity will not be given to this House by the recommendation submitted by the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. Therefore I regard the resolution of the Committee as making a revolutionary change in the accepted practice. Then, of course, I put to the House and myself the actual principle involved in this resolution. I should like to quote it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your Committee having had under consideration the question of the procedure in relation to the, annual Pensions (Supplementary) Bill, begs to recommend that for the future all resolutions of this House embodying recommendations made by any select committee that may be appointed by it for the consideration of petitions for, or minutes in respect of, pensions, grants, gratuities or other pensionable benefits not authorized by law &#x2026; shall be transmitted to the Senate for concurrence. &#x2026;</block>

<p>It seems to me quite justifiable to draw the conclusion from this resolution that we are laying down an entirely new practice as far as the views of this House are concerned with regard to its privileges. It seems to me to be quite a new position and to start a practice which to my mind is quite revolutionary. The practice in the old Cape House of Assembly was that the House should have full and complete control of all financial matters, and that practice was adopted by the Union House of Assembly up to 1912, when a modification was made by the Public Service and Pensions Act, That Act provided that recommendations of the Select Committee on Pensions should be approved of by this House and then forwarded to the Senate, and if they met with their approval then no further step was taken, but in 1912, by Clause 17, the procedure was altered and subsequently that section was substituted by section 76 of the Act of 1923, whereby the old practice in which it received the force of law by resolution has been supplanted by this section, by which a recommendation cannot be valid unless it has had statutory sanction. This has been the practice practically up to last year, when the same difficulty arose over one particular recommendation for pensions, and then it was submitted to Mr. Speaker&#x2019;s ruling, and I find that in the minutes of the 3rd of July, 1925, the following ruling is given by Mr. Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think it has always been considered by this House that a Pension Bill must be regarded as one of the Bills in which the <span class="col_3069-3070" refersTo="page_0487"/>Senate is not entitled to make any alteration. &#x2026; It seems to me this is a Bill which falls under section 60 of the South Africa Act and the Senate has not the power to make the amendment which it proposes.</block>

<p>That view was confirmed the next day by this House in a message submitted by Mr. Speaker to the Senate. Something very radical must have taken place since then for this House to have adopted a new principle. My first objection is this, that the majority of us did not realize the significance of this recommendation, and none of us ever realized that such a radical change would be recommended to this House. I furthermore aver that the majority of members did not realize the significance of the recommendation until they saw the report in the minutes of the next day, and I believe that even now a number of members will not have noticed the revolutionary change suggested unless it has been specially brought to their notice. My first objection, then, is this, that this House, in being asked to accept such a momentous change in what has been regarded as an explicit privilege, should have had a better opportunity of discussing this before it could accept it as the practice for the future. I wish to appeal to hon. members, if we differ on the principle, that we postpone further consideration of the matter until an opportune time can be set down for full discussion. I feel that unless we can get the assurance of the Government or the House that the matter can be postponed I must proceed to my second objection. My second objection is on the ground of principle. We accept and maintain that the ruling of Mr. Speaker last session was entirely within the provisions of section 60 of the South Africa Act. We further maintain that this is quite in accordance with the practice of the past. Section 60 of the South Africa Act states&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Bills appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall originate only in the House of Assembly, but a Bill shall not be taken to appropriate revenue for moneys or to impose taxation by reason only of its containing provision for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties.</li>

<li>(2)The Senate may not amend any Bills so far as they impose taxation or appropriate revenue or moneys for the services of the Government.</li>

</ol>

<p>I wish to read the clause in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, section 53, which is almost in the same terms as section 60 of the South Africa Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Proposed laws appropriating revenue or money or imposing taxation shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or money, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provision for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other penalties, or for the demand or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law. The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or money for the ordinary annual services of Government.</block>

<p>Sub-section 2 of section 1 of the English Parliament Act states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A money bill means a public bill which in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the consolidated fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan, or the repayment thereof, or subordinate matters incidental to those subjects, or any of them.</block>

<p>I realize that a certain amount of doubt can arise from the terms of section 60&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Appropriate revenues for the service of the Government.</block>

<p>A certain amount of doubt and difference of opinion may arise from these words, &#x201C;the service of the Government,&#x201D; but it is going too far to lay special stress on a few words of doubtful meaning ; then, prior to these, we have words very concise and clear in their meaning, that is, &#x201C;appropriate revenue.&#x201D; The question centres round the words, &#x201C;appropriate revenue.&#x201D; I would like to hear the opinion of any hon. member whether the granting of a pension on the recommendation of the committee, and when this House has approved of this recommendation, is not appropriating revenue. There is no question at all that this appropriation must come from the consolidated revenue fund. It seems to me that if we have any doubt in our minds as to the meaning of the words, and if we are at all anxious to arrive at a reasonable and rational understanding of the privileges and powers of this House, we may compare the provisions of our own statutes with the provisions found in other constitutions or Acts of Parliament. I have taken the trouble to read the English Parliament Act, and I wish to quote sub-section 2 of section 1, dealing with the same question of finance, where it is specifically laid down where the House of Commons has control. It specifically mentions supply. It is quite evident that the British House of Commons have secured for themselves the sole and exclusive right to deal with the moneys and finances of the country, and there can be no doubt of the meaning of that Act. For that reason, I hold that though our section 60 of the South Africa Act may not be as explicit as we may want it, the practice of the past, and the practice of Speakers like yourself, sir, has laid down that the procedure is correct, and if we have any doubt, we may safely refer to the Parliament Act of 1911. This subject was also broached in 1912 in this House, when Mr. Speaker Molteno <span class="col_3071-3072" refersTo="page_0488"/>gave his ruling in words not exactly the same as your own, but words intended to convey exactly the same meaning. I think they are words which bear out the ruling of last session. Apart from the authorities I have quoted, I may say further that I have the highest authority for maintaining the principle enunciated by yourself, Mr. Speaker, and the highest authorities have confirmed your ruling&#x2014;we have authorities both inside and outside to confirm your ruling. I maintain that if this House accepts the resolution of the standing committee, we are on the threshold of further developments. We cannot abide by the acceptance of this resolution, because it implies a distribution of the power and a division of the responsibility of this House as far as finance is concerned. There can be no question about the soundness of the principle that in a bicameral system only the Chamber directly responsible to the people shall be responsible to the country, the electors and the taxpayers for the distribution of moneys.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I feel that some of the rights which this House had are affected by the motion. I will go into the origin of the matter. Certain cases came before the Select Committee on Pensions, and the same person, the chairman of the select committee, who has just made objections, did the same thing in one of the unfortunate cases arising out of the rebellion. We know that later on condonation was given in all the strikes to people who took part in them. Most cases were settled, but not this one. As a result a petition was filed. The then member for Boshof, who was chairman of the committee, was, I understand, not quite satisfied when the petition was approved by select committee, and when it came before the House he made certain observations, as the result of which the House rejected the petition. Subsequently it came up again, and the select committee unanimously accepted it because the members felt that it was one of the outstanding cases. Many other cases had already been settled, and there was a small amount involved, the same amount that the previous select committee had voted. In the Senate the same objection was made by the hon. member. Now it is asked that an amendment be made. I want to tell the Prime Minister that it is difficult to get members to serve on the select committee. When members have done their work and the House adopts the recommendations, I think it is not right for the Senate to make alterations.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>The objection we have on this side exists because we have to do with a matter which looks as if it was going to make worse something which appears already to be in an unsound state. There is in these days a kind of disease&#x2014;or fashion&#x2014;in the country which is called appendicitis. It originates presumably because that part of the body no longer functions as it formerly did. I hope I shall not be blamed if I say that the impression made on me by the difficulties we have lately had with regard to legislation is that our legislation is suffering from appendicitis. During the past two years we have had a number of attacks. If the motion is adopted it will only make things worse and not improve the position. I make no reflection on the other place, but we know what difficulties have arisen as a result of the powers given to that body. It has the power to stultify the wish of the people, and when an attempt is made to extend their powers we should try to defeat it. It is not clear to me that the motion does not amend the Constitution. If it does I think it ought to be effected in another way. If it cannot be done differently, it would be better to refer it to a select committee to obtain information which is not now available to the House. Documents and memoranda could be put before a select committee and so enable it to go thoroughly into the matter, and to give us a report clearing it up more. I hope the Prime Minister will not insist on the motion being passed now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#krige">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say a few words about the motion because I desire to explain why I am in favour of it. Let me tell the hon. member for Hope Town (Dr. Stals) that I am glad he has made such a study of this important point. It would be a good thing if members took more interest in points of practice coming before the House. I can compliment the hon. member on the trouble he has taken. Up to 1912 we had no amendment of such a Bill in the Senate. We went to the Senate with mere resolutions as now proposed, and the Senate had the right to amend the resolution in detail or to reject any of the proposals. Then the House introduced a change in practice. The House stated that in future all pensions would be granted by legislation. Up to 1912 it was only done by resolution of the House, approved by the Senate. In 1912 the system was altered, and the result was that we drafted a Bill with a schedule which contained all the proposals for pensions and gratuities. Hon. members will see at once that the Senate to a certain extent felt then that some of its privileges were being taken away, privileges which it had had in practice up to then. What is the Parliamentary position&#x003F; The Prime Minister will adduce this strong argument. In the Parliamentary sense every proposal for a pension or gratuity stands on its own legs, and the Senate can fairly ask that every such proposal should be dealt with in a separate Bill. It was to facilitate parliamentary machinery that all pensions and gratuities were included in one schedule. In the strict parliamentary sense that is not right as regards the Senate, because it is deprived of the privilege of judging each pension or gratuity separately on its merits. If the pensions are brought forward by means of a schedule to a Bill, then the Senate has to reject the whole Bill, and cannot treat one of the gratuities separately. Parliamentary practice <span class="col_3073-3074" refersTo="page_0489"/>requires that if, e.g., we want to grant 100 pensions a year, then 100 Bills ought to be introduced, and constitutionally the Senate can fairly demand that. To make it easier for the House and to enable the two Houses to cooperate the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders conceived the idea of not sending each pension in a separate Bill to the Senate, but the motion to a certain extent reverts to the position before 1912, because the resolutions of the House are sent to the Senate and dealt with piecemeal, and the Senate has the right to amend them. The resolutions upon which the Senate agrees with this House are then included in the Bill, which contains all the grants agreed to by the two Houses. If there are grants which the Senate is not prepared to make, it is left to the Government to introduce a separate Bill for the cases to which the Senate does not agree. We give the House the right of dealing with and deciding about every pension. I would be the last man to abandon any rights which this House possesses under section 60 of the Constitution, and I should not like to see this House giving up any of its rights in financial matters, but as to the privileges of the House under the Constitution this motion will not encroach on them. The motion only aims at an amendment of practice.</p>

<speech by="#sampson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SAMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>We are not justified in extending the powers of the Senate at the present time, and I believe the country at large would much prefer to see the powers of the Senate restricted. The Senate is not functioning in a proper way and has not justified its existence. Sometimes pensions are very highly contentious, and if pension recommendations had to be transmitted to the Senate there would be more contentions than ever. We had better remain as we are instead of tinkering with our rules.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Committee on Standing Rules and Orders has carefully considered this, with full knowledge of the difficulties, and with full appreciation of the various sides of the matter. After everything had been considered I thought this motion should be brought before the House. Now I want to say to the hon. member for Hope Town (Dr. Stals) that I believe when he speaks of the constitutional position of this House we all agree with him, I do not think there is any doubt about it. All we are concerned with today, and all the committee was concerned with, is how far it is desirable to meet the Senate in connection with the difficulty which that body felt in dealing with pensions submitted by this House for their approval. Since 1912 the constitutional position has been assailable, but with the position, as hon. members will see from the motion, there is no intention to interfere. This motion does not encroach upon it. It only tries to remove the difficulty which has arisen between the Senate and the House of Assembly by a kind of &#x201C;give and take&#x201D;&#x2014;not the sacrifice of privileges&#x2014;and what is here proposed is simply that the House of Assembly says: We are going to follow a slightly different procedure from heretofore, viz.: we will, before the pensions get to the final stage in this House, submit them to the Senate for approval. We then leave it to the Senate to agree to the grant of the pensions, either all or one or other of them, and where they disapprove of any, we say to ourselves that we are surrendering to the Senate the formal right we have, but we are in future simply going to include the pensions of which the Senate disapproves in a separate Bill. If the House at any time finds that this procedure does not work well, then there is no reason why we cannot revert to the practice which we have followed hitherto. Thus with regard to privileges there can be no question of the surrender of any, but merely that the Committee has taken up a standpoint differing from that held possibly by certain hon. members of this House. Of course, if we wish to regard the Senate as an enemy to be fought, then we should not do what is here proposed, but I say it would be a fatal thing for this House as well as for the Senate to start with that assumption. It would be fatal to create such mutually hostile relations. It may be right or wrong, but the Senate exists, and it is the duty of all of us to see that the two bodies co-operate as well as possible. I agree with the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) that we must acknowledge that the Senate&#x2019;s complaint is reasonable. According to the letter of the law, we may say that we are right, and I maintain that, but that there is something hard and unreasonable in it no one can deny. We continue with existing conditions with reference to financial matters. As correctly stated by the hon. member for Caledon, the position is that if, e.g. 500 petitions are filed for the grant of pensions and are approved, each one practically stands by itself as an independent unit, and has nothing to do with the others. Although the law only gives the Senate the right to approve of the whole, we must admit that it is unreasonable to insist and to say to the Senate: You must not criticize much unless you wish to reject all the 500 pensions. That is practically what happens to-day. Now the Senate says that we cannot expect it to reject 499 of the 500 pensions people ought to get because it is opposed to the grant of one. Therefore we are suggesting an amendment in the practice, and we can see whether it will work better and bring about co-operation between the two bodies as long as they exist. I think if we feel that, we cannot but say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us meet the Senate.</block>

<p>If it appears later that this does not work well, there is always time to revert to the present position. In the circumstances I hope the House will approve of the motion. It is open to everyone in the House, members of the Government, as well as hon. members on both sides, to vote as they please, as it is not a party matter. Whether hon. members or even Ministers vote with or against me will make no difference, but I think this resolution will be in the interest, firstly, of settling a doubtful point which has existed for some time, and, secondly, it will be in the interest <span class="col_3075-3076" refersTo="page_0490"/>of good co-operation between the two bodies in the future.</p>

<p>I find in the abridged annual report of the Department of Defence, at June, 1925, on page 18, under the heading Stores, that the aggregate value of store received and issued was &#x00A3;721,166, the receipts amounting to &#x00A3;355,551. I cannot find any figures corresponding to that in this Vote. My point is this, that there should at all events be a foot-note showing exactly how much money it was proposed to expend each year in the form of stores. It is not clear to me whether this is in addition to the vote of last year ; it ought to be made clear. If so, the total cost of defence last year, instead of being under a million, would be a million and a quarter. It is very desirable that the estimates should show with sufficient exactness the amount of money being expended annually for defence.</p>

<p>The more this matter is studied the more apparent it becomes that the unsatisfactory position is to a large extent due to the fact that a large number of senior non-commissioned officers have left the service, and their places have been filled by younger and less experienced men. It is the more noticeable in the departmental corps, where the majority of non-commissioned officers have little or no regimental experience. That is what we have been saying for several days past, that you cannot get proper instructors unless they have had regimental experience. If we find in the permanent force the condition is such that the Adjutant-General has to make this very serious statement, it bodes very badly for the future. We have been pleading year in and year out that, without discipline you cannot have an army; you cannot have a proper system of defence, and the country is relying not on troops, but on a mob. If they have not been able to get non-commissioned officers with all the machinery at their command, who will instil and maintain discipline in the regular troops, it is hard to expect that such inefficiency will produce efficiency in the citizen forces in the future with the rather poor quality of instructors that will necessarily be forthcoming. We are yearly at a disadvantage in having to discuss a vote when the information pertaining to the matter under discussion is usually two years old, but I am grateful to have been able to get a copy <span class="col_3077-3078" refersTo="page_0491"/>of this abridged annual report up to June, 1925. The report further states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Difficulty is being experienced in getting the necessary number of men to keep the units of the South African permanent force up to strength.</block>

<p>Members of the permanent force are paid at a higher rate than any other soldiers in the world. Hardly a year passes without some scheme or other for reorganization being put into effect, pulling up things by the roots that were only organized the year before &#x2014;no wonder that things are in a very unsatisfactory state, and are likely to consinue so&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The educational standard was satisfactory, and men with junior certificates and matriculation certificates continued to present themselves for enlistment.</block>

<p>It is evident there is a considerable number of high-class recruits forthcoming, but apparently they do not stay. This is the casualty list for the year:&#x2014;Deaths, 6; discharges, either through time expired or, more probably, through men purchasing their discharges, 319 ; desertions, 16&#x2014;that is a very considerable number in a country like this&#x2014;or a total casualty list of 342. I think I have said enough to show that all is not well with the permanent force, and I am persuaded that things will be much worse if the Minister carries out his scheme of reorganization. I ask him once more to pause about his action with regard to the artillery. I do not know what expert advised him that he could get efficiency from sections of artillery scattered all over the country, but whoever that expert is, I think the consensus of opinion would be against him. Why not carry it further&#x003F; Why not split them up into single guns&#x003F; Then, of course, you would obviously reduce it to an absurdity. But only a little less absurd is the proposal of the Minister. To Split the artillery up into sections will accentuate the evil that this report alludes to. You will not maintain the high standard of efficiency. Men will degenerate into gun-polishers and harness-cleaners. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>When the House adjourned, I held the floor, and I thought it was the practice for the hon. member who held the floor to carry on. I was discussing the question of the defence of the native territories. I was pointing out that the Mount Fletcher trouble which took place some years back was entirely suppressed by 150 men of the Transkei, men who at that time were training at Port Elizabeth. We arrived at a very serious stage. There was practically a state of siege prevailing. I believe that in the report of Col. Stanford, who was sent up as a commissioner to enquire into the matter, it is stated that the conditions were extremely serious. At that time all the S.A.M.R. had left the territories, and we had no local defence of any sort; and had we not arrived in the nick of time, the position would have been more than serious. As it was, it cost the country nearly &#x00A3;100,000, and had our arrival been delayed for a longer period the expense would have been considerably greater. I maintain that if it is necessary to keep three or four mounted regiments in Natal, it is just as necessary that we in the Transkei should have similar protection. I agree with the Minister that the T.M.R. may not be an economic unit, but I do say that 100 trained men in the Transkei would, in time of trouble, be worth 10,000 trained men in Cape Town, and even if it does cost more to train men in the country, it is the duty of the Government to see that all native areas are protected. Such is as much in the interests of the natives as of the Europeans. I do not wish to suggest that the natives will cause trouble&#x2014; I do not think they will&#x2014;but the whole basis of the Minister&#x2019;s scheme is to be prepared for such trouble. I say, without any hesitation, that it is impossible to put 10,000 men in the field in the Transkei in the time stated by the Minister. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that there was a general feeling of unrest right through the country, and an outbreak occurred amongst the natives, say, at Matatiele, where is the Minister for Defence going to get his 10,000 from to proceed there&#x003F; Does he mean to suggest that the men from Natal, from the eastern borders of the Free State, or from the Eastern Province, all areas in which a similar unrest exists ; does he suggest that these men will leave their homes and families unprotected to come to our aid and assistance&#x003F; Of course they would not. We would not expect them to come. If serious trouble did arise, it would be a case of every man for himself&#x2014;every village, every town for itself. That will be the position for the first two or three weeks, and it is the duty of Parliament to see that every little area has its own protection when the crucial time comes. I appeal to the Minister of Agriculture&#x2014;does he not feel that such is the correct position&#x003F; We in the native territories realize the position we are in. We are prepared to protect ourselves, but the Minister should see that we are prepared. Before the great war we had a battery in the Transkei ; I have seen it in training, and have seen natives on the hills watching its evolutions, and it had a tremendous moral effect on the natives. Why should the Minister take that away from us and have two batteries in the Free State&#x003F; Why not have one in the territories&#x003F; Will the Minister tell the committee why, while we managed to maintain a mounted regiment many years ago, it is impossible to-day&#x003F; This &#x00A3;16,000 Saved on the defence vote is going to be saved at the expense of the T.M.R., and at the expense of the defence We have had in the past. The Minister may say &#x201C;Form your rifle club. " We have had them, but they have never been satisfactory in the territories. In time of trouble the men who are most required are mounted men, and the Minister must realize that one mounted man in the territories is worth 100 men in Cape Town, or far from the seat of trouble. As a premium for insurance, a mounted force is the most economic unit. It is absolutely essential that there should be protection, not only for the Transkei, but for <span class="col_3079-3080" refersTo="page_0492"/>every native area. As I said before, I do not wish to suggest that the natives will cause trouble&#x2014;I think they are too sensible&#x2014;and while we treat them fairly and with justice, they will be prepared at all times to help us.</p>

<p>I think everyone will agree that the Minister of Defence should be criticized on his reorganization proposals. On looking at the estimates, it is difficult for anyone to find out the exact position of our existing defence force. We see that certain reductions have taken place in ordinary expenditure, but beyond that we have difficulty in forming a conclusion Last year, when the House was prorogued, speeches were made stating that the Minister of Defence was going to create a defence force which would satisfy everybody. This year the Minister says he has consulted nobody with regard to this reorganization, and that is where he made a mistake. If he had consulted people well acquainted with the conditions of the country, it would not have been necessary for us to criticize to day. This is a very Important matter. We must not forget that the greatest responsibility rests on the citizens of the country. The Minister&#x2019;s reorganization is such that he holds the population responsible for the defence of the country in times of trouble, and they are not professional soldiers. What is the organization he is creating&#x003F; He has told us that the country is divided into forty commandos of 200 men each. Are they to be composed of members of rifle associations, or of people who have to undergo a certain training every year&#x003F; Do those commandos form the first line of defence&#x003F; We assume that if troubles arise there will be a certain force which can immediately strike. Is that the forty com mandos&#x003F; The permanent force has been abolished or so much reduced that it is hopeless in the first instance to rely on it. The force still consists of four columns, one in each province, and what can we do with four batteries spread over the whole country&#x003F; Therefore, the citizens will be called up in the first instance, and will have to bear the brunt, but they have to buy their own rifles and provide their own uniforms, as the Minister only provides at wapenshaws. Will this give satisfaction&#x003F; Is it right to proceed from the assumption that the more shots a man fires the better the soldier&#x003F; Let me tell the Minister that a soldier cannot be made in that way. Even with the best material, no soldier can be made by merely firing at ranges. I had sons who went to South-West Africa when the trouble came, who could shoot well, and knew how to handle a rifle, but when one of them mounted the horse with a rifle, he fell right over it. What are we going to do with people whom we cannot put on a horse, and who, when once on, cannot dismount again, because the rifle gives them trouble&#x003F; All this had to be learned according to the old system, which the Minister has abolished. A soldier must understand discipline and learn obedience and everything that is taught soldiers in other countries, so that we can have an efficient force. What is the Minister going to do with untrained commandos of citizens&#x003F; I say that the feeling which outweighs all others is that if the Minister intends to put the defence of the country on the shoulders of the citizen, he should have acted very differently. The feeling of dissatisfaction is growing, and people say that there should be a permanent force which can receive the first attack and can strike the first blow when necessary. The feeling exists that the citizens should not be called up for all sorts of little troubles and native insurrections and strikes, but that there should be a permanent force which the Government can use, and which can be quickly mobilized. People are prepared to pay for that, but the Minister is making a mistake if he puts the whole defence on the shoulders of farmer commandos. As for the cadet system, I agree with the Minister, but I am opposed to the abolition of the travelling inspector and to the training of the children by teachers. The teachers have to go for fourteen days to Roberts Heights and follow a certain course to learn how to turn to the right and left-about. What can we expect from a fourteen-day course&#x003F; It is impossible to train people and make them efficient in that time. Those people are to become officers to drill children. Will they afterwards take the field as officers&#x003F; Those who can only turn to the right and left are made responsible for the education of our boys into soldiers. I go further. The system may be useful to children in the towns and villages, but what of the countryside&#x003F; They live in many cases far from school, and it is impossible for them to train. Firstly, because they cannot find time for the exercises, and secondly, because they have to travel far to get to the school, and are then not fit to do the exercises. The organization of the Minister is hopeless. It is, as the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) has said: From year to year what has been built up in previous years is broken down, and the muddling keeps on. This year the Minister goes so far that he has only the staff left. The expenditure on the staff is further increased, but the foundation on which the staff should rest disappears. When the time comes that the commandos are required, it will appear that the whole organization is a paper one.</p>

<p>I have just glanced through this report from the Defence Department&#x2014;it is the first opportunity I have had of seeing it&#x2014;and it seems to be the ambition of the Minister to have a thoroughly reorganized defence force, on paper, at least once every twelve months. The last reorganization took place on the 25th June, 1925 ; the next, I note, <span class="col_3081-3082" refersTo="page_0493"/>is to take place on the 30th June, 1926, and so on. I suppose now as a result of the last reorganization we are informed in the report that the South African Field Artillery was to be brigaded, and a headquarters staff provided. The brigade of field artillery and the brigade of S.A.M.R. were to be organized into a field force under a single command, and the officer commanding the field force also acted as officer commanding the troops at Roberts Heights. I think that is a small, but admirable, organization, and what one would have expected any intelligent staff to have adopted with the very limited material and means at their disposal. But that is to be entirely done away with ; why, I cannot understand. Here, also, I note is a very serious reference to the lack of discipline in the permanent force. Now, if there is one spot in the South African army where you would expect to see discipline it would be in the permanent force. If there is a lack of discipline, you have to look for the cause, and you find in nine cases out of ten that it reflects on a bad staff organization; a lack of training, and a lack of suitable men to see that the discipline of the army is maintained ; to see that the officers have full knowledge of military law. And here, again, we are told there is a great lack of knowledge of military law and of regimental experience. Now that brings me to a question which I put to the Minister last session, as to the system by which officers had been selected for staff appointments, and particularly in regard to their being sent to Camberley for training. Of course, the Minister did not answer that question although I gave him a month to prepare his reply, and I am perfectly certain he never will answer it. It reflects anything but credit on those responsible, and it is not to be wondered at that, when officers are selected in an utterly slovenly manner having an entire lack of military experience and training. In one instance, a sergeant, without any regimental experience whatever, being given commissioned rank in order to qualify him as a student at the staff college at Camberley&#x2014;</p>

<p>It matters nothing to me by whom it was done, but you sent men with this lack of fundamental knowledge to receive the highest scientific military instruction in the world. It is most irritating for the people at home, although they do their very utmost to make inefficient officers welcome, and save themselves no trouble to make their training as practical as possible under the circumstances. Then, after their two years&#x2019; training, you bring them here, and there is nothing for them to do but sit in an office and drive a pen. Now you have, in this country at the present moment, an officer specially sent out from the War Office general staff to bring about some sort of liaison between the South African troops and the Imperial army. The idea is that, if possible, touch should be maintained between those men who have had this training at home, and are carrying into effect in this country the instructions they have received. It is useless sending them to Camberley unless they have some practical means of applying the instruction which they have received up to that stage. It is purely theoretical instruction, so far as men without previous experience are concerned. Australia, New Zealand and Canada also send their officers to Camberley, but they arrange an exchange between these officers and Imperial officers for a period of years, so that they have an opportunity of working with troops and putting their theoretical instruction into practical use. I put the suggestion to the Minister that he should discuss this matter with the staff officer I have referred to, who is at present in this country. Of course, if we turn it down, we shall be the losers, but we should not miss this opportunity, if it can possibly be avoided.</p>

<p>I would like the Minister to give us a little more information in regard to rifle associations. I should like to know what amount of free ammunition is to be issued to the country rifle associations. I am sorry to say that the young countryman to-day is not as good a shot with the rifle as his father was. The Minister lays great stress on these rifle associations, and therefore these young fellows should be made efficient by a free issue of ammunition. Those who can afford it are buying their rifles, and where they cannot afford it five per cent. of the rifles are loaned to them. In time of emergency the Minister is relying on these commandos and they would be the first on the spot, being mounted men ; but they get no horse allowance or any other privileges, and I think the least the Government can do is to give them a liberal supply of free ammunition, so that they can make themselves efficient. Then I come to a question which I raised previously in the House. Surrounded as we are in Natal with thousands of natives continually having faction fights, we ought to have a sufficient supply of rifles there. If an emergency arises in Natal, where are these rifle associations going to get their rifles from&#x003F; Are they to wait until the rifles come from Pretoria, I hope the Minister will reply in regard to this. Will the Minister tell us why there is a reduction of &#x00A3;3,000 on rifle ranges&#x003F; Is that consistent with the great importance the Minister attaches to these rifle associations&#x003F;</p>

<p>I think that more interest is taken in defence matters in the Eastern Province and Natal because the people, living as they do among a prepondering native population, realize the potentialities and possibilities of trouble more than those living on the high veld. A great deal has been said in favour of the commando system, but I would point out that the commando system is of very little use in Natal or the Eastern Province. During the Natal rebellion in 1906 there were two incidents which I might tell the House to show the inefficiency of the commando system. The officer in charge of a commando refused to order his troops into the low veld, saying that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the lives of these children had been entrusted to him by their parents, and he was not going to take them down,</block>

<p><span class="col_3083-3084" refersTo="page_0494"/>and a squadron of the Natal Mounted Rifles had to do the job. The men on commando would have gone, but not having been drilled together they did not have that reliance on each other which otherwise they would have had. Another instance occurred at the same time. Colonel Leuchars had to camp on the banks of the Tugela ; he had three squadrons of his own regiment and a commando. He formed a square camp and put the commando on the rear flank and in the morning he was attacked by the Zulus. The men were ordered to lie down behind their saddles, but the men of the commando stood up with the reins of their horses over their arms, thus offering a better mark to the Zulus, some of whom had rifles. Several casualties occurred. The men of the commando not having had the benefit of the training the mounted rifles had did not have the confidence in themselves or their officers that their comrades of the mounted rifles had. In my own district there are under 1,500 Europeans, but there are 53,000 natives. It would be a very great benefit if we could have an adequate supply of rifles and ammunition in charge of the commanding officer of each regiment. We can mobilize very rapidly in Natal, and we are ready to jump on the fire whenever it breaks out. We never know when the day will come when the agitation which is being stirred up among the natives will come to a head, but so long as we treat the natives justly I do not think we shall have any trouble. Nevertheless the Zulu when his blood is up sees red, and he might do things in not blood which would be very regrettable.</p>

<p>It seems to me as if the Minister is being urged, especially by Natal members to arm the people. I think it is the duty of Natal, especially as it is such a prominent province, to see that the people put their hands in their pockets and buy their rifles. They can be got very cheaply. That is what every citizen who has the interests of the State at heart Should do. We insist on economy in the House but if the Government had to arm every citizen it would run into a considerable amount, It seems to me as if there is a grudge against the high veld, where it is said that the people there do not have the same danger as Natal, but let me tell hon. members from Natal that when danger comes the high veld does its duty just as well as Natal. I am sorry to comment on what the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) said on. Thursday in the House. He said that the commando system was the cause of our losing the Anglo-Boer War. I am surprised to hear that from the hon. member because he also was an officer of the Boer Forces at the time. The experience of those who took part in the war is that no war can be carried on without the commando system. We had disciplined forces against us, and nevertheless we defended ourselves well for three years. In my opinion the commando system is the only method to be followed in this country to make fighting possible. Of course discipline is required as well, and if we had had more it would have been better. We can be satisfied with what was done, and if we had had the officers at the commencement that we had at the end of the war things would have been entirely different. Therefore I am glad that the Minister of Defence has reverted to the commando system. That is what the farmers on the countryside Want, and I think anyone with sound commonsense will agree that it is the only way in which a success-can be made of the system of defence. The officers, however, must be the right people. In this respect I must criticize the Minister because the persons appointed were not always the right men. He will find that he must have the right people as officers, because the Afrikander is a wonderful person. If he does not like his officer he will not fight. The Afrikander wants officers that he Can respect and not officers that will send him into danger and stop out of it themselves. I therefore hope that the Minister will see that the officers appointed shall be persons that the citizens want.</p>

<p>I would ask the Minister&#x2019;s very serious attention to the situation at Durban, which has now the largest graving dock in the southern hemisphere and the second largest in the world. It cost &#x00A3;2,400,000, and it is absolutely indispensable-in time of war that it should be available. At Durban, too, before very long, a power station is to be erected which it is estimated will cost about &#x00A3;2,000,000. That station intended to supply municipal requirements and the power for the electrified railway from Durban to Maritzburg. The aggregate value of these two undertakings will not be less than from &#x00A3;4,000,000 to &#x00A3;5,000,000, and their destruction would paralyze all the east coast of the Union as regards land transport, while the navy would be seriously handicapped if it could not use the dock.

This matter to which I am referring is a serious one, and I would ask hon. members to visualize the effect of the power station at Durban being put out of action. There is another point. I see that the Minister is allowing adjutants &#x00A3;50 a year, and commanding officers of commandos &#x00A3;60 a year, or &#x00A3;110 in all. The public services they are expected to perform, as laid down, are to have a rifle practice of four days a year, and a wapenskou of two days a year. Is that the maximum or the minimum&#x003F;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BYRON</person>:</from>

<p>I am quite serious. The adjutant and the commanding officer of these commandos, who will have to give a minimum amount of their time compared to the adjutants and commanding officers of other units, are to receive, one &#x00A3;50 and the other &#x00A3;60, while the commanding officer of an infantry battalion, who puts in a great many hours per week, and probably every week, and his adjutant, who puts in a considerable number of hours per day, gets no allowance whatever. From what I know of the commanding officers and adjutants of the citizen units, they do not want these allowances for their emoluments at all. I am sure that in every case the allowance would be devoted to a regimental fund, because they know that a regiment cannot be established and maintained and kept in the condition which they would like, unless regimental institutions of various sorts are established, and there is thus developed that regimental spirit, which is a powerful aid to discipline and to efficiency in the field. Naturally, it is very puzzling to know why the Minister has made such a distinction between the two. I do not begrudge these officers of the commandos their money, but, if they deserve that remuneration or allowance, surely the adjutants or commanding officers of your ordinary citizen units deserve it even more. If the Minister will look at the map, he will see a large and populous territory called the Transkei, thickly populated with natives&#x2014;and splendidly enhanced fellows they are. But we must remember, and I repeat, that if the Government of which the Minister is a member is going in for a policy of repression among the natives, there will be repercussions. Order may have to be kept, and where are the nearest troops&#x003F; Durban on the one side, and East London on the other, a very long distance away. The Transkeian Mounted Rifles have been disbanded, but no corresponding increase has been made in the district. I do not expect the Minister to go back upon the decision he has come to, but I would suggest, to him that he can save his face, and perhaps add to the safety of the district and efficiency of the regiment by increasing the establishment of the Kaffrarian Rifles, which is at present 300. There are 8,000 registered voters in and around East London, and there are well-known factors by which you can determine the number of men available for military-service from the number of adults. It is certain that there are about 2,000 men of suitable age for military service in that district, and yet there is a miserable establishment of only 300. An increase of the establishment will add to the efficiency of the regiment, and to the peace and safety of that district.</p>

<p>It is very clear to me that the feeling on the countryside is that the citizens are practically unarmed. The feeling on that point is very strong. I think that a country like South Africa should arm the citizens. I am glad to say that the rifle associations are very popular, and that people are joining them as much as possible. The Minister will agree that the object of the rifle associations is to teach our boys to handle a rifle, and to become good shots. The Minister will know that if a man has to use a borrowed rifle at the range, he cannot possibly become a good shot. I know it is difficult to arm all the citizens, and the Minister will possibly say that the citizens can get their rifles cheap. I, however, appeal to him to assist the citizens, and if they cannot get the rifles gratis, they should be given time to pay the amount off by instalments. I can assure him that if he does so, it will have good results. The Minister is being urged to do this on all sides. He ought to be convinced that the public outside are dissatisfied because they are practically unarmed. When anything happens, the citizens have to take the field, because the rifle associations exist in the interests of the State. If trouble comes, they must serve the State in defending the country. If that is the case, then it is the duty of the Government to see that the rifle associations are well armed in the event of there being trouble. I can say that they are being depended on. Where are the rifles to come from in times of trouble&#x003F; I know the feeling exists in my constituency that more facilities should be given to the citizens to get arms. That can easily he done, because the officers are prepared to he sureties for the citizens who buy rifles. If a citizen deposits a certain amount for his rifle, then the Government still has the rifle as security for the unpaid portion: and further, the officers know the men, and are prepared to give security on their behalf. Various other hon. members have also mentioned this point, but as feelings run high in my constituency. I cannot let this opportunity pass without making my voice heard.</p>

<p>I only want to say a few words. I was pleased at the speech of the last speaker, because he said that the <span class="col_3087-3088" refersTo="page_0496"/>rifle associations were now very popular. In the days when this side of the House was taking an interest in them, we had a great deal of opposition. Had it not been for that, the system would have been much more advanced.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>&#x2020;*Lt.-Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. S. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Your leaders said that the people were not to join the rifle associations. As one gets older one can always learn more, and to-day my hon. friend opposite sees how necessary the rifle associations are, and I am glad he has reached that length. I nevertheless differ on certain points from the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. M. L. Malan). He advocates the arming of all the citizens in the country districts. I have always said, and I repeat to-day, that it is impossible for the Government to arm the whole male portion of the population. I am in favour of the members of the rifle associations being armed. They were established long ago, and to-day building is still going on the old foundations, and I am glad of it. It is not necessary for the citizens to join the associations, but they are at liberty to do so. Those who joined the associations ought to be armed. This can be easily done by the Government. To furnish 10 per cent. of the rifles to rifle associations is insuflicient. I hope the Minister will listen, because I want to tell him that the system is a good one, but that it is not adequate. The people ought to be attracted into the rifle association, and it ought to be made a pleasure to them. If the citizens can get their own rifles, it will be a good thing, because when a man has his own rifle he will be proud of it and look after it well. Borrowed rifles are not too well looked after, and if a man has to shoot with a rusty rifle, he does not do very well, and the second time he is not keen to go to the range. Those who voluntarily join the rifle associations ought to get more rifles, even if security has to be given to assist the people. The thing should be made attractive, and the people should be assisted. The Minister is neglecting those people a great deal. As a result of the reorganization of the defence system, the whole burden will press on the citizen force. The police force will have its hands too full. The permanent force will be too small, and therefore the citizen force will have to be resorted to. The citizens ought therefore to be trained. I should like to ask the Minister why the citizens are so neglected&#x003F; They now get a certain number of rifle practices every year, and the range allowance has now been raised from 1s. 6d. to 3s. a man, but the number of cartridges has been reduced. When the citizens go to the range, they want practice. In my constituency, each burgher only gets four cartridges. It discourages a man to ride for two hours to the range, and then to only fire four shots. The people ought to get sufficient cartridges, so that it will be worth their while to go to the rifle practices. I want the Minister to bear in mind what I am now suggesting, even if it costs more. It is not a bad thing. The people are quite willing to join the associations, but they must be assisted. If the Minister makes the rifle practices attractive by providing rifles and cartridges, the system will be successful.</p>

<p>The hon. member must take the wad out of his ears, and then he will in future follow what is said. We are glad that the Minister has increased the issue of rifles on loan, but as the hon. member for Bethal has said, if there is only one rifle for every ten men, then it means that, if there are ten needy citizens belonging to a rifle association, it is discouraging for the people to fire with one rifle, and they cannot get proper practice. In former days the sons of the Afrikander people began to learn how to use the rifle when they commenced to ride. It is characteristic of the Afrikanders to be masters of a horse and of a gun. Under present circumstances the boys do not get this privilege. I understand that the Government cannot afford to arm all the people. I do not ask that the rifles should be given free to the people, but if the Government are in earnest about arming citizens belonging to rifle associations, they will sell the rifles to burghers on the instalment system. At the commencement of the session I thought the Minister would make a concession. The Government need not lose a penny and as the hon. member for Heilbron has said, the officers of every rifle association are prepared to be sureties <span class="col_3089-3090" refersTo="page_0497"/>for their citizens, until all the instalments due on the rifles have been paid off. The State will not lose anything and, in the end, every citizen will be armed. Any one of us, who has a little knowledge and experience of active service, knows that a soldier&#x2014;let me rather say citizen, because the people in our country detest the word soldier&#x2014;that a citizen, who is put into the field in war time, is no good if he cannot handle a rifle.</p>

<p>That is so. Now I ask the Minister what he is going to do in case we have war or trouble, and he has to call up people who do not understand how to handle a rifle. What is the good of such a man, and why are hundreds of thousands of pounds being spent on defence in peace time when, if war comes, the army cannot be used&#x003F; For this reason I hope that the Minister will seriously consider whether he cannot carry out the armament scheme. I do not say that it should be done on a large scale immediately, but if every year about six thousand men are armed then, in ten years, we-shall have a whole army armed, and the citizen force will be much more serviceable than it is to-day.</p>

<p>When I was interrupted I was making a few remarks about the necessity of increasing the establishment of the Kaffrarian Rifles. I have a communication from a constituent, who writes me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are those who anticipate that the native question &#x2026; will give rise to agitation and perhaps disturbance ;</block>

<p>and my correspondent goes on to emphasize that they feel unprotected in that district, and would have some difficulty in dealing with any disturbance that might arise. The Minister is, perhaps, not aware that the Kaffrarian Rifles, which has an establishment of 300, has a detached company in King William&#x2019;s Town, which considerably reduces the number for parade in East London. I do urge the Minister to give this question his consideration on the ground of efficiency, safety and to promote a feeling of confidence amongst the inhabitants of that particular area. Under the head, medical service, we find that, out of a total of 1,622 applications to enter the permanent force, only 235 were attested. I have a right to complain of the slack and slovenly way in which the information is presented. The presumption is that the doctors had no cognisance of the number that applied until the number came into their hands. An enormous percentage of the young men of this country must be physically unfit. We have more detailed information with regard to the citizen forces. I should say that the medical examination for the permanent force is strict and stringent, and the men who are examined are to be equal to carrying out the duty of a soldier in this country under any circumstances whatever. But, in the words of the medical authorities themselves, there is a relatively low physical standard for the active citizen forces, and Cape Town has a bad pre-eminence in the number of rejects: 28.67 per cent. were found to be permanently unfit for any sort of service in the defence force, and 2.37 per cent. were found temporarily unfit, or a total of 31 per cent. Cape Town is the worst. In Port Elizabeth 21.86 per cent. were found to be permanently unfit, and 6.9 per cent. temporarily unfit. I can congratulate Pietermaritzburg, which had only 6.32 per cent. permanently unfit, and 1.73 per cent. temporarily unfit.</p>

<speech by="#byron">

<from>&#x2020;Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BYRON</person>:</from>

<p>East London is bad, too, but not as bad as Cape Town. 18.54 per cent. were permanently and 4.03 per Cent. temporarily unfit; in Durban 14.15 per cent. were found to be permanently unfit, and 3.86 per Cent. temporarily unfit. Now these figures are startling and disquieting. From my own experience I would like to tell the Minister how it works out. During the East African campaign I received a draft of 650 men, and on my own responsibility I rejected over 200 before we left Zomba, and I can tell the Minister that these recruits&#x2014;gallant spirits as they were &#x2014;were physically almost impossible. The 200 were suffering from all kinds of disease, from insanity to hammer-toe. These were men who had to go into action at once on arrival at the scene of hostilities, and of the balance only a very small number had handled or fired a rifle. We were getting to the end of the war, and we were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">scraping the bottom of the pot</block>

<p>as it were. It is positively a crime to send men into the field, and to send them into action, who have not even handled a rifle; and something of the same kind will happen again, unless we have a better organization of the defence force. I am glad to see that, with regard to the cadets, the headquarters staff has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question of the institution of compulsory cadet training must receive serious consideration in the near future.</block>

<p>That is the professional view, if I may so put it. I hope the Minister will give all these matters his serious attention. We are getting on&#x2014;I am optimistic&#x2014;we are improving. In the old days, when one raised the question of the defence force, someone raised the cry of &#x201C;racialist,&#x201D; and the debate was switched off. There is a tendency for the Minister to answer that this is the cry of the professional soldier, who wants an ideal standard, and who is quite right from his point of view&#x2014;but we need not pay much attention to these points of view&#x2014; they are good ideals, but we cannot work up to them. One does not need to be a professional soldier to see the benefits of the compulsory cadet system. His own professional soldiers have so advised him. One does not need to be a professional soldier to know that discipline is necessary in the men who have to enforce and teach discipline to the forces ; or to see the disadvantage of having men suffering from insanity and hammer-toe taking part in serious <span class="col_3091-3092" refersTo="page_0498"/>operations on active service. I think this discussion has been very considerably free from racial considerations. We are getting on, and I hope the Minister, in his reply, will show that he realizes that the country is in earnest about this matter, and that these defects and drawbacks to which we have called attention are real and serious, and that he will give us, on this side, the credit of not making party advantage out of the subject. We are prepared to support him in any reasonable steps he takes towards efficiency, but these continual reorganizations take the heart out of the men, and prevent eligible men from joining the defence force as a career, and do not tend to the good of the defence force. His own staff say that they&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">create a feeling of uncertainty among the forces ;</block>

<p>that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">settled conditions are essential to the wellbeing of the forces ;</block>

<p>that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">no body of men can be contented which is in fear of constant reorganization</block>

<p>and so on. I hope this debate will be productive of thought leading to action, and I hope the action will not be on the lines that we took such exception to, but that the Minister will see that some of his proposals are very retrograde indeed, and if he is to maintain the efficiency of the forces he must re-cast them to some extent.</p>

<p>Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for my hon. friend to give us a statement on the policy of the Government in connection with the naval works at Simons Town over and above the &#x00A3;71,000 which now appears under the Minister&#x2019;s vote, because I think it will appear self-evident to everybody that under existing conditions this amount is extremely inadequate for carrying on coastal defence. Taking the vote as it here appears, I think it works out for the European population at about 10d. per head, and if you take the whole population, including natives, it works out at something like 2&#x00BD;d. I have not worked it out adequately. If you take the total ocean-borne trade of this country with the old country both ways, I should think it would represent an insurance of about .15 or .16 per cent. The Minister has told us that we need not be apprehensive that the British navy is going to be wiped off the seas just yet or that our coasts are in danger of bombardment. Why&#x003F; Not for anything this country is doing. The Minister was only justified in making that statement because he knew the people of Great Britain were under taking this burden not alone for the protection of their own trade but the protection of every portion of the commonwealth of nations of which we form a part, and surely when we hear so much of South Africa first and South Africa alone, the time has come when our self-respect should show us that we ought to be prepared to pay a little more for the upkeep of this service which alone allows us to sleep at night.

<p>If the hon. member will ask his advisers they will be able to tell him that it is considerably over a sovereign, even with the reduced naval vote ; that is per head of the population of Great Britain. Under the circumstances, for this country to pay 2&#x00BD;d., is a very inadequate contribution, especially as the Minister has pointed out that we can be perfectly easy in our minds because the British navy is protecting our coasts and oversea trade and commerce. I should have thought that with the views held by hon. members opposite, they should have been only too anxious, as a self-respecting people, to pay an adequate share. When you consider what New Zealand and Australia are doing, I should have thought the time has come when my hon. friend should realize that as we are desirous of taking over as much of our coast defence as possible, we should be able to do what Australia has done and have one cruiser in which our men could be thoroughly trained. If it is considered that this vote is adequate, when you take into consideration the volume of our trade and general revenue, then I say unhesitatingly that it is not to the credit or the dignity of this country that we are doing so little in connection with naval defence, and I hope the Minister will give us the reasons why this vote is so small. I think it was in 1907 that Sir James Rose-Innes, who was then a member of this House, got a resolution passed unanimously in this House&#x2014;when you only had the Cape to consider&#x2014;that the contribution should be &#x00A3;85,000 a year. Natal also gave over &#x00A3;30,000, whereas now we give only &#x00A3;71,000. Under these circumstances I ask the Government to consider whether it will not be more becoming to our dignity, and considering the great increase in our trade, whether we should not pay a little more for the protection the British navy is according us.</p>

We are speaking of permanent formations. And of these Australia&#x2019;s permanent forces are: field artillery, 1 nucleus body of 2 officers and 63 men ; garrison artillery, 10 batteries of 24 officers and 428 men; and there is an engineer and a service corps, the total force numbering 39 officers and 755 men. Well, we have just about the same. Going on these lines, apparently hon. members opposite would increase our standing army. We, however, take a totally different view, and are going on the same lines as Australia. When we speak of a standing army we mean a citizen army, and we are going to devote the bulk of the money to the development of our citizen army.

We take the machine as we find it, and we have lopped off what is unnecessary to the machine, and devoted the money to the citizen forces. I want to return to the point regarding the training of officers. So far as active citizen force officers, the South African permanent force, as originally conceived, was not a force for the training of officers at all. The active citizen force officers are receiving the same training, and on the same lines as they have ever received since that force was instituted by hon. members opposite.

<p>Because we have not a sufficient number of regimental formations. I have to pay attention to professional opinion which I think is sound, and I have no qualms whatever about being able to get a sufficient supply of well-trained instructors. In regard to discipline, that will depend entirely upon the degree of training you can give to your citizen force. In comparison with past years, we are doing more in that regard. I appreciate perfectly that you must increase your training and that is the reason why we are devoting larger sums in that direction and arranging yearly camps. The hon. member (Brig.-Gen. Byron) spoke about the Quartermaster-General&#x2019;s stores and read a paragraph from the report that the turnover was &#x00A3;771,000. In that turnover is included every issue from the Quartermaster-General&#x2019;s stores. The issues from the stores appear in their relative places in every single division of this Vote. The hon. member was strongly opposed to my proposal for splitting the artillery up into sections. I am afraid I must agree to differ from the hon. member in regard to that question. I am confident that the purpose we have to serve will be well served. The hon. member also spoke of the situation at Durban and painted a tremendous picture of the defenceless position of Durban in case of attack. I would point out that the whole matter of coast defences, as he knows, is the subject of investigation by another body. The question of fixed defences as against other forms of defence is to-day in the melting-pot. <span class="col_3095-3096" refersTo="page_0500"/>With regard to the allowances to adjutants and commandants of commandoes, the hon. member thought it was grossly unfair to make these allowances while no such allowance was made to the commanders and adjutants of A.C.F. units. This is simply an allowance for travelling and subsistence. Commandants have to travel over a large area. A.C.F. officers get free tram and train fares. This money is really very well spent, and is in recompense for outlay. The hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) has asked why we cannot have a regiment there as well as in Natal. It was only by increasing the area of recruiting for one of the Natal regiments that it was possible to maintain it as a regiment and have the requisite number of youths coming forward. In Tembuland our registrations of youth are not sufficient to keep it up really as a unit. The conclusion I have come to is that as a unit of the A.C.F. we are not justified in keeping it up. The hon. member for Witwatersberg (Lt.-Col. N. J. Pretorius) asked me in reference to the training squadrons of the commandoes. I spoke of the training squadrons in 40 commandoes. That is these squadrons will be organized in 40 commandoes selected from the commandoes that exist. In those we propose to have these training squadrons for the young men. The training we shall provide is better than nothing at all, and it certainly is a step in advance, which, although it may cost money, is a very necessary step in advance. The hon. member also spoke of the burghers wanting arms. I think it legitimate for hon. members over here to raise that cry, but I think there is hardly any justification for hon. members opposite raising it.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell you. Because you were very silent on it all the time your own friends were in power. We understand the sentiment, but the Government say that the position is not such, the dangers to the country are not such, that it is necessary to have every man armed in the countryside. The measures we are taking, we believe&#x2014;and the Government have carefully considered the whole thing&#x2014;are such as the real defence needs of the country demand, and we do not feel justified in giving way to the pressure being put upon us to supply every man in the rifle associations with a rifle. It is no use at all for us to think that we are serving the country, and even serving the defence of the country, by devoting resources to unnecessary developments of defence arrangements, which might go into channels really to develop the manhood of the country, which is really our ultimate defence. I want again to emphasize, and I repudiate altogether what the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) said the other day, that we are destroying the permanent force of this country and that our permanent regimental formations are altogether incomparable with what Australia and New Zealand have. I say the figures show that the regimental permanent formations in Australia are hardly a whit more than ours, and in New Zealand it is a good deal less. The training we are giving the Active Citizen Force units is identical with the training which has been in vogue ever since they were instituted twelve years ago. So far as staff officers and the necessity for military training and so on, are concerned, it is interesting to notice that out of the forty odd staff officers whom I inherited I think there were twelve whose training had been in permanent formations. So we have to take the material we have and the resources we can afford, and by careful attention and by the enthusiasm of the people in such formations as we have, to try and make the defence of South Africa as efficient as we can within the means at our disposal. I doubt very much whether some of the things said this afternoon and the other afternoon are really helpful in enlisting on the side of the formations, of the organization we have, that enthusiasm, both in town and country districts, upon which so much depends, when so much of your effort depends upon voluntary sacrifice of time to give to defence matters of this country. I think I have now dealt with every point.</p>

With regard to the officer we sent over last year for two years, he is spending his first year attached to brigade and divisional staffs, getting training in practical work, and finishing up with one year at the staff college. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s contention may be summed up in one word, if I understand him aright&#x2014;the value of practical association with the regimental brigade of staff officers. As far as my opportunities will allow me, that is what I was trying to ensure in making this arrangement, and I will see how far it can be developed.

<p>The policy of administration falls under the Minister of the Interior in regard to certain societies which it is to the country&#x2019;s interest to support ; and the policy of the Government in supporting certain societies to the neglect of others. I would like the committee to understand that an appeal was made by the Geological Society of South Africa to the Minister, who finally wrote, on Dec. 12th last, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of increase of votes due to other commitments, he regrets that he does not see his way to persuade the Treasury to increase the vote to the Geological Society for the ensuing year.</block>

<p>The Treasury is really the tree I would like to bark up. The Government knows we owe much to the mineral resources of the country. The output last year included 41 millions from gold, &#x00A3;166,000 from silver, &#x00A3;170,000 osmoirridium ; diamonds, 8 millions; coal, nearly 4 millions ; copper, &#x00A3;495,000 ; tin, &#x00A3;298,000 ; and other minerals, &#x00A3;272,000 ; or close upon &#x00A3;60,000,000 from the production of minerals in this country. It is an astonishing thing that a Ministry which, I take it, considers itself businesslike, turns down the South African Geological Society and wastes money in some other directions, when if there is one country-in the world where geological investigations <span class="col_3099-3100" refersTo="page_0502"/>should be encouraged, it is South Africa. It might be an inducement to the Government if the Geological Society could publish its proceedings in Afrikaans. I have no doubt that if its transactions were published in Afrikaans, there would have been no question of maintaining the grant given by the previous Government, which was &#x00A3;240 a year, and which, owing to very misplaced economy, was cut down to &#x00A3;60. That does not cover the cost of publication of the valuable papers of its members. When it comes to a geological society, it is very difficult indeed to publish proceedings in Afrikaans, but I know if that could be done I would not need to appeal to this House. We find among other societies receiving grants in aid, that that for ethnological research gets &#x00A3;700, and the Imperial Institute Mineral Resources Bureau &#x00A3;1,200 a year. That is an overseas institution. The Royal Society of South Africa gets &#x00A3;300. If our poor Geological Society could only call itself &#x201C;Royal&#x201D; I suppose the amount would be granted by the Minister of Finance. Then the South African Society for the advancement of science gets &#x00A3;250. That is a notable society. I have here a very instructive appeal from them. They appeal to me on the grounds, among other things, genetics and eugenics, and I am asked to co-operate with them in the investigation of instances of transmission of family peculiarities. I think this House would be a very good place to start on. They refer to the inheritance of clearly marked characteristics appearing in families, and I take it that economy in the family of the Minister of Finance is one of the things I would have to follow up. I am going to see what I can do to meet this appeal from the South African society, especially in regard to the study of heredity, in members of the Opposition. Then the National Council of Child Welfare gets &#x00A3;250 ; the South African Studbook Association &#x00A3;200. Sport must be encouraged at any cost. I am sorry the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Sir Wm. Macintosh) is not here as we come to the South African Poultry Association, &#x00A3;266. He is anxious we should know that it is the healthiest chickens which scratch for themselves, and that is what we want to do in this country, in regard to the further discovery of mineral wealth. Then there is the South African Agricultural Union. &#x00A3;450, which I certainly do not growl at, and the Imperial Institute of Agriculture in Rome, &#x00A3;256. There is the fascinating word " Imperial&#x201D; again, which, perhaps, has caught on with the Government. Then there is the Imperial Bureau of Mycology, &#x00A3;150, and the Imperial Entomological Bureau, &#x00A3;700. There is the botanical survey of the Union, &#x00A3;2,600. Why is the Minister willing to give that amount for botanical survey while he only gives &#x00A3;60 a year to the Geological Society, and yet it is the geology of this country on which we have based our success. Ministers consider this &#x201C;a business Ministry.&#x201D; It is the most unbusinesslike, in this connection, one could imagine. Then we have other societies, including the National Society of Mental Hygiene, &#x00A3;250. That certainly appeals to one. When we cannot find more than &#x00A3;60 a year for our Geological Society, it is time we subscribed to the Society of Mental Hygiene. There is something wrong with our brain power.</p>

<p>Well, it was the last Government which cut this society down to &#x00A3;60 from a mistaken idea of economy. I am only sorry this Government has emulated their bad example.

I think I have said enough to show that we, who support the Government to the fullest extent, can also come to them and say plainly: What is it you are thinking about&#x003F; I admit Ministers are in the hands of their Minister of Finance, and no country can be more successful that its Minister of Finance permits it to be. I personally waited on the Minister, who declined to accede to the request for &#x00A3;180 for the society, though he has returned &#x00A3;180,000 a year to mining companies by abolition of the Transvaal employers&#x2019; tax. The Minister has no money; he has estimated for a deficit and is &#x201C;on the rocks.&#x201D; Very well, if he thinks that the people are going to be satisfied with that explanation, he is very much mistaken. The time will come, as it came to the last Government, when the Ministry will regret that it did not embrace opportunities for developing our country in every possible way, and encouraging societies such as this, for which I appeal.</p>

<p>Yes, it is the education of certain feeble-minded children. The position is such to-day that the institutions for mentally disordered people come under the Minister of the Interior. I am now thinking of the class of feeble-minded who are on the border line not idiots or dull-witted, or children who are under normal. I mean children who fall on the line, who are boundary cases. Children who sometimes go on to the normal side and sometimes to the abnormal side. These children are still able to receive a certain kind of education, something can still be made of them. By practical education, they can still be made useful. Fortunately, there is such an institution to-day, but the institution strangely enough comes under the head &#x201C;Mentally disordered persons.&#x201D; It is the Alexandra institution. It does praiseworthy work, and I can recommend hon. members to visit it. As for education, I want to point out that, in an institution <span class="col_3101-3102" refersTo="page_0503"/>for feeble-minded at Witrand, near Potchefstroom, such children are also admitted. The children to whom I refer are in the same institution as mentally disordered people. The children actually live and are educated apart, but they come under the same institution.</p>

<speech by="#fick">

<from>&#x2020;*The Rev. Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FICK</person>:</from>

<p>Before the adjournment this afternoon I remarked that the training children received at the school of the Wit-rand institution was not effective. I did not say that the training was not good. It is good as far as it goes, but it is not effective because I think that the teachers such children should have ought to be more practical. The training should be more in manual work and trades, as is the case at the Alexandra institution. When we notice what provision is made for this class of child, then we see it is not yet half enough. I consider that we have two thousand of this class of children for whom provision should be made in separate institutions. It will of course cost more, but I think the institutions will to a great extent be self-supporting. Trades can be learned. Furniture-making ; wagon-making ; boot-making ; clothes-making ; (in which girls can also participate) spinning and weaving, knitting, etc. Children cannot only be sufficiently prepared there for what is required in the "institutions but also for other Government institutions, and I think that although the public to-day object to certain industrial schools competing with local tradesmen they will make no objection if work made in these institutions is offered to the public at periodical sales, so that the public also have an opportunity of directly contributing to the cost of those institutions. Then I think the work done for the child on the line between normal and abnormal ought to come under the Department of Education. It is teaching work and the best class of teacher is required for that child. If the children are looked after something can still be made of them. A normal child can get through the world with little education, but a child of that class is entirely dependent on the practical training that he gets. If he does not get it then he is quite useless to society, and therefore I think that money spent on that kind of child is very usefully spent. It will be difficult to put all the children in the institutions. I do not think that it would be best to enlarge the Alexandra institution. I think there should be a similar institution in the north. It is difficult to move the children from the south to the north and vice versa, and I want to suggest that those institutions should also give agricultural education. I think that class of child can do something in agriculture, and that agriculture can also to a large extent provide for the needs of those institutions. It would be difficult to get all that class of children together into one institution, because the children referred to can be sub-divided into three classes. There are, e.g. children who are physically less favoured, who are weak and consideration should be given whether if is not a fact, and to what extent, that among the feebleminded there are many children who have been physically neglected. The second group consists of children who are mentally worse equipped. The third group are moral degenerates. It would be difficult to put the last group with the other two. Badness is a contagious disease and yet we cannot abandon those degenerate children. I say therefore that for the children who are border cases, whether they are physically, mentally or morally backward, the best possible work we can do in the country is necessary. We shall then be able to give them another opportunity in life and money spent in such an institution is in my opinion spent quite economically. I hope the Minister will not feel insulted in my moving a reduction of his salary. He knows that it was in order to bring the matter to his notice, and that there is no such thing in my mind as to move a motion of no confidence in him. The matter I have brought to his notice is one I have some experience of, and we must do everything to assist the children. If in no other way then they must remain in the institutions and can stand there on their own feet and do something which benefits the general public.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister must be quite relieved that further reductions of his salary cannot now be moved. I should like once again to refer to a report of a commission appointed by the Government, the members of which were all notable persons, Dr. Peringuey, Mrs. Bolus, F. E. Cartwright, Prof. Compton, Prof. Moss and Prof. Thoday. This report was submitted to the Government in 1921 and except for small increases given to Kirstenbosch on the estimates last year and this year, very little has been done in the matter, in this report the whole matter of the work at Kirstenbosch and the requirements of Kirstenbosch for the future is gone into, and on page 8 reference is made to the plants of the Karoo. I wish to refer to what is therein stated, so give the following extract&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Meanwhile thousands of specimens representing the unique and astonishingly succulent and bulbous flora of the Karoo and other arid districts, languish in tins or formal beds in the nursery. It is a matter of the greatest urgency to get the Karoo garden into condition for the reception of these plants, but money is not available. And what is more, when established the garden will need the most careful and skilled maintenance&#x2014;as much as or more than any other section of the work. The results will be worth while from every point of view. With the accessory Karoo garden at Whitehills, we have a great opportunity for the study of these characteristically South African plants&#x2014;a study now left to Kew and La Mortola.</block>

<p>We have in our Karoo a very vast garden of important medicinal plants. Something is known of the buchu. Lately experiments have been made in regard to this plant. We know something of the aloe and we know that as far <span class="col_3103-3104" refersTo="page_0504"/>as the belladonna, a native plant of South Africa, is concerned, the Americans have given a good deal of attention to it and have established a vast industry and, I believe, a paying industry. We know that the cultivation of these medicinal plants is very difficult in any climate, except such a one as ours. At White-hills near Matjesfontein a Karoo garden has been established. In that garden we now have well over 10,000 specimens, representing about 5,000 varieties, and a very large number of these varieties are of medicinal value. I want to suggest to the Minister that something should be done in regard to having those plants very carefully examined, and that all necessary investigation into their medicinal and economic value should now be taken in hand. In many parts of the country these plants are used medicinally, and very successfully, but the time has arrived when we must have a thorough organized study of the value of the plants. The medical faculty at the Cape Town University, through the Professor of Pharmacology, is co-operating with the Government department here. The chemical laboratory at Johannesburg on the other hand is not making use of the medical faculty at the Witwatersrand University. At Onderstepoort experiments with plants are carried out, but they there confine their energies to plants poisonous to stock. What we want is investigation of the plants that are of real value to human beings. Besides medicinal plants there are numberless herbs containing aromatic and essential oils. These are being investigated by the Imperial Institute in London. They should be investigated here. A large number of our succulents are of great value as stock food. That is something of very great value to this country and deserving of investigation. The prickly pear and the aloe have been proved to be of value in that stock can be kept alive on these without water for many months, but there are many plants of even greater value about which transport riders could tell us much. We have a wealth of flora which unlike our mines would become more valuable as time went on if only we knew something about their properties. Unfortunately we have cultivated the habit of giving consideration only to that which is likely to show early profit. We are often met with the reply that these are costly matters and as there can be no immediate return research cannot be undertaken, but may I remind the Minister that Germany spent vast sums in research work, and at the end she was handsomely repaid. Consider the vast industry built up in regard to analine dyes. Germany gained the monopoly and it paid her handsomely. We have the basis to work on in this country and we are doing nothing. One man only need be appointed as a start and allowed to make enquiry throughout the country. Let him follow up these enquiries and investigate the plants and see what can be done. He might start his investigations in the Karoo. Right up to 1914 we were satisfied that we were getting along swimmingly. We then found we were cut off from the rest of the world and appreciated for the first time our dependence upon foreign sources for our supply of crude drugs. We made some investigations, but it was so late as to be of very little value to the country. We can start to investigate now in a small way, and others will come along and take up the study, and they will find eventually it is a study of very great value to the country. The herbal remedies that were used in our youth are now almost forgotten. Before we lose all that valuable information I would urge the Minister to appoint someone to investigate as to what the plants are and what their uses are, and from that we can build up a vast mass of useful information.

In the first place, whether he thinks the vote &#x201C;Commissioner of Mental Hygiene&#x201D; should come under the Interior&#x003F; The provision for mental and feebleminded hospitals now comes under the correct vote. I want actually to say a few words about the following vote, &#x201C;psychiatrist,&#x201D; a post which was created last year. Now we see that the estimated increase of weak-minded and mentally disordered people is 1,000. If their numbers increase so, should not the vote be increased&#x003F; And if the number of cases of these unhappy people increases so much year after year, there must be a reason for it. We should like to know what class is increasing so much, and what the reason for it is. In the report of the meeting of the Public Health Board, a resolution is mentioned in which the Health Board emphasizes an enquiry in connection with mental development in South Africa. A psychiatrist has been appointed to investigate the position regarding mental disorders and feeble-mindedness in our country. Besides this, we have the obvious circumstances of so many sub-normal people growing up, and it is not only a matter of mentality, but also of physical development, and it seems to me that the matter touched upon by the Public Health Board is of great importance to our people, and I should like to ask the Minister whether steps have already been taken to give effect to the recommendations of the board, or whether there is an intention to do so.</p>

<p>I should like to raise a few matters affecting the public service. I would like the Minister to tell us whether he will give us an opportunity to discuss the question of the restoration of the fifth report salary scales. It is through his department that this comes, and I hope he will give us a statement as to whether an opportunity is going to be given to discuss this important matter. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the unsatisfactory position in which the advisory council rests at the present time. Last November the Government agreed that the existing consultation should be improved. The council passed this resolution in April, 1926&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That council having received the Minister&#x2019;s letter, resolves not to proceed with the present agenda until it has had an opportunity <span class="col_3105-3106" refersTo="page_0505"/>of considering the proposals to be made by the Minister.</block>

<p>There is a conference of public servants sitting in Cape Town, and I think it would be well for the Minister to tell us when these proposals, which have been germinating since November last, will come to fruition. This council is a one-sided council, whereas what they want is some form of Whitley council, which has been so successful in England. Once the Government agreed to have this joint consultative body, the Government would find that much of the discussion that takes place in this House with regard to public servants would not take place at all, because the machinery would be sufficient to ventilate their grievances. I also want to call attention to the differentiation which still takes place in regard to local allowances between married and single officers. The Minister wrote, inter alia, to the following effect in June last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have laid before the Cabinet the question of the differentiation of the local allowances between public servants and railway and harbour servants respectively. The Cabinet agrees that a differentiation as now existing between co-ordinate branches of the Government service cannot be justified. &#x2026;Steps will therefore be taken in due course to bring local allowances through all branches of the service into conformity with the others.</block>

<p>This differentiation between married and single officers is not justified, as has been proved by the evidence given before various committees, and I hope the Government will see their way to do away with it. These are very important matters, and have been causing a good deal of discontent. In conclusion, I wish to deal with a circular which the Prime Minister and the hon. members for Heidelberg (Mr. de Wet) and Losberg (Mr. Brits) and myself have received, in which the public servants of Vereeniging point out that the cost of living there is higher than on the Reef, and ask that the cost of living allowances for Vereeniging be raised to that of the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>I want on this occasion to make a strong appeal to the Minister and ask him what the Government intends doing with reference to agricultural schools on the countryside. Last year, when trade and industrial schools were taken over from the provincial councils, there was great expectation in the country that the subject of education on the countryside would be tackled, and provision would be made to give the country children fitting education. We see that &#x00A3;5,000,000 has been spent on education. We are thankful, but would like to know how much of the money is spent on behalf of the country child. Our whole school system aims at the training of professional men. Primary education exists to prepare for secondary education, but no more than 15 per cent. of children go to the secondary schools. The secondary schools exist to prepare children for the universities, and possibly only four or five per cent. of the children go to the universities. What will become of the children on the countryside&#x003F; We are thankful to have the universities, but we must not forget the necessitous condition of the countryside. We are spending millions to-day on people to get them back to the farms, and to enable them to make a living on small farms. Those people have had no training to farm on a small basis. I insist most strongly that a commencement should be made with education on the countryside which will fit our sons and daughters for life on the countryside. We know the tendency of our young people is to go to the villages. That is to a great extent to look for pleasure and change. But that is not the only reason. To that must be added the difficulty of making a proper living on the farms, and this creates the desire to go to the villages because they can make a few pounds more easily there. The country, however, is longing for another and better system of education to train our sons and daughters so that they can farm scientifically on a small piece of ground and make a proper living. If we further look at the agricultural trade and industrial schools and see how they are distributed, then we see how the western Free State has been neglected. There are certain parts of the country which are suited to agriculture, and other parts more suited to cattle-breeding. In the western Free State, in the north-west, we find not a single school which meets the need in this respect. I hope the Minister will give attention to it, and will especially meet the north-western portion and provide an agricultural school in the Boshof district. I now come to another point. It will perhaps be said that I am narrow or old-fashioned in talking about it, but I do not mind. I see that &#x00A3;311,000 is spent on universities. They are institutions which the public look up to a great deal, places where our sons and daughters are trained, and which must set the tone for our people, institutions which the people are prepared to support, because they know that our sons and daughters are trained there for higher appointments. Now I saw a letter last week from a young student at Oxford who writes on behalf of the South African students. The letter causes a little anxiety. It treats of the doctrines at the university. I cannot discuss science, but I am afraid that the teaching of science is to-day causing the pure Bible teaching to disappear from the universities. I do not wish to say too much about it, but my feeling is that, in the Act of 1917 on the University of Cape Town, as well as that of Stellenbosch, provide that when a professor is appointed, his religious beliefs may not be enquired into. The question arises with me whether we have not sufficient competent men who hold sound views. If the universities are not institutions to be depended upon to maintain the pure Bible teaching, then I feel that there is something wrong. I hope the Minister will go into the matter. I have spoken to a young friend of university training about the matter, and I feel that there is something wrong, according to his explanation of the application of science. When we remember that what is taught to-day is possibly <span class="col_3107-3108" refersTo="page_0506"/>thrown over in 25 years and considered old-fashioned, then I ask why our young people should be taught science which teaches a departure from biblical doctrine&#x003F; I am afraid this is occurring. My young friend told me that a professor at the Cape Town University asked, e.g., what harm there was in saying scientifically that man possibly descended from an ape. However much I may think of science, I must still say that I have not yet found that science can change a horse into an ox, or a sheep into a goat. Development may take place in the same line, but one race cannot change into another. I am prepared to believe in the possibility that man has developed from the ape if the professors can say when the ape acquired a soul.</p>

<p>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to sub-head (c) and subhead (d), more particularly to (d). We all recognize the importance of the census returns and how necessary it is that the returns should be as correct as possible. As regards sub-head (d), I feel that these returns are useless, or worse than useless, in fact, they are misleading, for they are not made up in as correct and proper a manner as possible. Under (d)&#x2014;births, marriages and deaths&#x2014;I wish to draw the attention of the Minister particularly to the country districts, where these returns have to be given in by farmers. My experience is that they are given in a perfunctory and haphazard fashion. Could the Minister inform the Committee what laws and regulations govern the registration of births and deaths&#x003F; I feel convinced that the returns which must later on go into the census office are not of the value they should be for the particular purpose. Can the Minister not arrange that the farmers have a direct appeal made to them to help the police officials to make the returns as correct as possible&#x003F;</p>

<p>I would like to say a few words with reference to our archives, to bring the present condition under the Minister&#x2019;s notice. A few days ago I said something about our history and then many hon. members laughed, but history does not lie, it tells the truth. As things are to-day, however, many of our archives are being lost. Recently, e.g., it was discovered that the documents containing the Retief-Dingaan Treaty were lost. Some of us can still remember having seen it, but now it has disappeared. I ask the Minister if the time has not come for a few young people to be sent to Europe to study the archives system. To-day we have a chief archivist, and Sir George Cory has recently been appointed to make historical research. They enquire into the sources of our history and that is right. But I can assure the Minister that I went recently to Graaff-Reinet to enquire into some historical facts and I discovered the document I was looking for under a lot of dirt. There is great danger of documents becoming lost. When one looks into Church archives you find the same thing. I think some effort should be made to put them right as well. What about the State&#x003F; Are there inspectors who go about to see that documents are preserved&#x003F; When one goes to the Hague you see how the old documents are preserved, and the great care which is taken to prevent any of them getting lost. Our young land also possesses many documents, but formerly particular attention was not given to them, and many of them were preserved by the Church. They are to-day being lost. If we have not the people here to look after the matter then we can find one or two who can arrange the documents and in the meantime a few young men can be sent to Europe and trained in keeping archives. I can assure the Minister that Mr. Gustav Preller who is making a detailed historical study of the sources of our history says that he holds the same opinion that I do. The position to-day is a sad one. Therefore I should like the Minister to look into it and at least to have an enquiry made into the condition of the archives. I go often into the archives, e.g., and can easily remove documents to my house and keep them there and nothing at all would be known about it. That is my experience with regard to the archives. Then I want to mention another point, viz.: the condition of our libraries. I feel that here too there is much to be desired. We know as Ruskin says that books are the kings and queens of our life. They are the treasure chambers in which we can dig. I can speak from experience of the Pretoria Library and undoubtedly the conditions are not good there. The Minister must bring about a change. I cannot speak about the Cape Town Library, but Pretoria needs a librarian who understands matters and has been trained in his profession. Therefore I trust that the Minister will try to put the matter right, because I feel that there are many points in the history of our country which can still be gone into, as, e.g., that of the Voortrekkers, of the British Settlers and of our things in the past. The documents ought to be preserved in future for these points to be gone into. What was the position in the past&#x003F; How has history been twisted&#x003F; What untruths published. It will be possible to write history in the future if the documents are preserved. I hope the Minister will take my words to heart and will see that the necessary money is made available for the purpose.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) has mentioned the matter, and I hope that the Minister will not regard it as the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Even if it is so I hope the Minister will give attention to it. We know how in the past very little attention was given to the National flowers of the country, and how they are now sought, after, and have already become world famous for their beauty and quantity. When we come to our plants we find that it is just as important, or still more so, especially for anyone living in the Karoo. In times of drought one can see how stock can live on it, and very little of it, on certain farms. One comes to the conclusion then that the plants must have great nourishing power. The stock keeps in good condition <span class="col_3109-3110" refersTo="page_0507"/>on the plants, provided they get sufficient water. We take trouble to import certain kind of plants from other countries, but I think that if we made a study of our own plants and bushes we shall find that they are better than the imported ones. Take, e.g., the &#x201C;gannabos.&#x201D; In times of drought the cattle can live on the little buds of these bushes. If we cultivate these bushes to find out what their qualities are then we should protect them better and still further develop them in the country. This enquiry comes under the Minister of the Interior, and that is why I am mentioning it. One finds, however, that some bushes in the Karoo cause a sickness among the stock because they are poisonous, but we do not yet know all the poisonous plants, and we are in darkness about the matter. As for the medical qualities of bushes, the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) spoke the truth. It is time to make a commencement because the old people who have used the bushes as medicines&#x2014;and even the natives and old Hottentots &#x2014;are disappearing. They can give us great and valuable enlightenment. When one lives in the Karoo you often see a certain plant which is used in bad cases of blood poisoning and another again for fever. One finds that the doctors very often do not approve of the treatment, but we, who have had experience, know the value of the remedies. They are, however, still too little known. I am sorry that the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) could not complete his speech, because I should like to have heard more of it. I hope the Minister of the Interior will go into the matter and make a commencement with the investigation of our plants so that we can know more about their qualities as medicine, and as foodstuffs and of the possibilities of poisoning.</p>

<p>I want to support the appeal made by the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) that the Minister will give the House an opportunity of discussing the question of the fifth report scales. There is a great deal of unrest in the public service, and it would be a good thing, so far as the Minister&#x2019;s own department is concerned, if the matter were discussed in the House. If hon. members are of opinion that the members of the public service are too highly paid, they should say so, and we will know where we are. There is no doubt, however, that the lower grades of the service are very badly paid, and I hope the Minister will go out of his way to give the House an opportunity of discussing this very vexed question. In these days of strikes, when everyone is horror stricken at the idea of a strike, perhaps it will be a surprise to hon. members to know that there is a strike on at present in South Africa.</p>

<p>There is no need to be alarmed many peaceable citizens, and were &#x201C;The Postal and Telegraph Herald &#x2014;for May, which says that the public service advisory council has gone on strike because it considers that, as it is constituted at present, it cannot do useful service, and wants its scope of action enlarged. I want the Minister to make a statement as to whether he intends to give this advisory council extended powers, which will enable the strike to be called off. Personally, I should prefer a proper Whitley Council, and I am certain that some day the Government of this country will adopt the Whitley Council idea. Then there is this question of differentiation between single and married men in regard to local allowances. This is a very undesirable principle and, from a trade union point of view, a very dangerous one, for it really means that you have two rates of pay for the same work, and in these days of so-called economy, and application of business principles, there is always a danger of the more expensive servant being got rid of, so I would prefer to see the Government level up the public servants to the railway servants, rather than do as it has suggested&#x2014;level down railway servants to the public servants&#x2019; scale.</p>

<p>I want to raise a point about the Census Department, which has made very rapid progress during the last few years, and has been doing most valuable work. We have now, for the first time, a department which is trying to collect information on all the various aspects of our industrial and social life. But there is one point which strikes me as indicating that the department is no longer functioning as a scientific statistical department, but is becoming a branch of the propaganda department of the Government, particularly in regard to the question of the relations between the white and coloured people. The department published some statistics in regard to that matter which I can only think were issued in order to make the European population&#x2019;s flesh creep. They were founded on figures which were subsequently admitted by the department itself, to be unreliable. The census figures for 1911 in regard to the native population, were not such as to justify the conclusions being drawn from them which were broadcast through the press with huge headlines which, no doubt, alarmed many peaceable citizens, and were known by the department to be absolutely unreliable. The late Director of Census, who is now Secretary for Labour, stated before the Economic Commission that, out of the 18,000 girls and boys who leave school annually, one-half could not find employment. He was compelled to admit that that statement was wholly and absolutely misleading. The Census Department knew that, or ought to have known that, and I wish to know why the statement was made.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ministers sometimes make misleading statements, and when they are pulled up they say: &#x201C;I did not make it as Minister, but as leader of the National or Labour party.&#x201D; An official makes statements purporting to be founded on statistics for which he is responsible, and when he is pulled up ne says &#x201C;I did not make this <span class="col_3111-3112" refersTo="page_0508"/>statement as Director of Census, but I made it because I thought the people ought to be warned.&#x201D; If you are going to have a statistical department that people can rely upon, it ought to state facts, and allow the propaganda to be made by Ministers when they go about the country. Let the department build up a reputation for saying nothing which cannot be borne out by ascertained facts. The department seems to have a false idea of its function, which is not to stampede the people in support of the Government&#x2019;s policy. Let the department stick to publishing facts and leave us poor purblind politicians to draw conclusions there-from.</p>

<p>I just wish to remind the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) that when the official made the statement it was not meant as a statement in his capacity as Census officer only, because he was then already an official in the Department of Labour. The hon. member for Yeoville makes it appear as if the Census Department is responsible for the statements made by an official of another department. I should also like to support the request of the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) that the Minister should have an enquiry made into the medical value of herbs and plants. When the Voortrekkers had their reverse in Natal, and all their lagers and wagons were burnt, they probably began to look about to see how they could assist themselves. Many remedies were then got from plants of which we to-day have but little knowledge. I am thinking of plants which are of medical value to human beings as well as animals. When Dr. Louis Leipoldt, a few years ago, while still Inspector of Schools, gave a lecture to us in the low veld, and spoke about malaria, he mentioned in a few words to the people who are often far distant from medical assistance, a few plants and trees which could be used in the treatment of malaria, Even fruit, such as the paw, which contains much pepsin. Many of those shrubs that he mentioned have great medical value for people and also for stock. An enquiry, such as that recommended by the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) would be of great value to our country. Then I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the difference of treatment of officials with regard to climatic allowances. I just want to make a comparison between various officials in one district in the low veld. The magistrate gets 2s. per day climatic allowance. Another official in the same department gets 1s. 6d. Another official not far from there, a local justice of the Peace, and an official in the post office, 1s. 6d. In the same village officials in the prison service get 1s. and others in the same department 6d. In the police force, in the same town, an officer gets &#x00A3;5 a month allowance, detectives 6d. a day, other men 1s. and some 6d. a day, while officials doing clerical work in the same town get nothing. On the other hand, the officials of the Railway Department all get climatic allowances. Not that I want to take the allowances away from anyone, but I just want to point out that officials in the same position in various departments are treated so differently. Officials, who work out of doors, sometimes get nothing, while officials, who work indoors, and thus do not travel about in the unhealthy climate, get an allowance. Officials in the Department of Native Affairs, e.g., get no allowance. They are officials who go about the whole of the low veld to collect the hut tax from the natives. In Barberton, e.g., they go through the whole low veld in winter and mostly sleep in tents and they are, therefore, more exposed to malaria than people who do clerical work in prison buildings or those of other departments. It is unfair, and there is not only a difference between officials in different departments, but a difference between officials in the same department. I hope all the officials in the low veld in the Transvaal will get allowances.</p>

<p>There are three or four matters I would like to draw attention to, which at first sight may seem directly to affect Cape Town, but are really of very wide national importance as well. Our archives are partly housed in the basement of this building, and partly accommodated in the South African Public Library. Both buildings are unsuitable for the purpose. We require a modern building to which students could come and in which people can have ready access to these priceless treasures, and thus assist to build up a national pride in all things connected with the history of this country by knowledge of the facts&#x2014;a knowledge which in many respects would remove misunderstandings. I am glad to see in connection with one little effort that I made a couple of years ago that the National and Historical Monuments Commission has apparently been doing very good work indeed. I for one do urge upon the Minister that as soon as possible we should have in Cape Town a suitable, proper, up-to-date building for the housing of the archives. I believe they have got one in Bloemfontein which has either been opened or will be opened soon. I am very glad of that. But we ought to have, in the mother city also, a building in which the archives could be housed, which could serve, for instance, as a home to which archives could be brought from various parts like Graaff-Reinet, Swellendam and other places to a common centre. Another matter to which I would like to refer is the question of Kirstenbosch. I am quite in accord, as I expect every man in this House is, with the remarks made by the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) in connection with the desirability of investigating our own natural herbs and plants in this country. Kirstenbosch is of course, an ideal place for experimental plant work of all kinds and, while one is glad to see a sum of &#x00A3;1,750 on the estimates, I think that the Government would be acting really economically if they increased the vote for Kirstenbosch for the purpose of enabling research and experimental work to be done there to a far greater extent than is possible now. I would also refer to the question of the art gallery, a long-standing question which has been hung up for years on <span class="col_3113-3114" refersTo="page_0509"/>account of financial conditions. During the last couple of years conditions have improved so much that some time ago one of the members of the Ministry, now the Minister of Labour, when waited upon by a deputation in Cape Town, made a promise that the art gallery would be proceeded with. That art gallery is really a debt due to Cape Town, a debt based upon the obligations of the Government in connection with the sale of properties in what was then New Street and is now Queen Victoria Street, to Government many years ago, I press that again from the national aspect as much as or even more than from the purely local aspect. Here again we have a number of treasures entirely inaccessible to the public, exposed to great danger and risk, and in bad housing conditions. For the new art gallery we have a site not far from this building. I believe the foundations have been laid, but we have got no further. I do ask the Minister of the Interior to make a statement as to what is to be done in connection with the art gallery. The fourth institution, again a national one, that I press for consideration for is the South African museum. Here again for many years past is an institution which has been necessarily starved for want of accommodation in which to house and display the exhibits. Here we have also something which is not merely local, but is really and truly a national institution in the best sense. It is a South African museum and deserves every encouragement. I do ask the Minister to give his earnest attention to these four things, because every one of them is of the utmost importance to the life of the nation as a whole.</p>

<p>I hope the Minister will not bother himself much about the attack of the hon. member for Yeoville on the Census Department. If it is true that Mr. Cousins possibly was guilty of exaggeration then the hon. member is more so when he says that the Census Department had degenerated into a propaganda department. I think that Mr. Cousins has mentioned the fact in his reports. The hon. member said that the reports about the natives were not trustworthy and that they were only got approximately. I admit that that is possibly so, but it is possible that one can guess approximately. It is certain that Mr. Cousins has done a good deal for our country and people by drawing attention to two facts. He may perhaps have exaggerated, but they were very important facts, and if he had not so much emphasized them we should possibly not have looked them in the face. They were the tremendous increase in the relation between natives and whites, and that a large number of our boys were growing up without work. Mr. Cousins did a good thing for our country and people. What I actually should have done is to ask the Minister of the Interior whether he knows of the fact that the Free State Museum only gets &#x00A3;1,000 a year while the Pietermaritzburg Museum gets &#x00A3;1,650. The Transvaal Museum gets &#x00A3;5,830, and the South African Museum in Cape Town &#x00A3;6,200. The Bloemfontein Museum is very important and means a great deal to us to-day in more than one way, but yet the allowance is only &#x00A3;1,000. I do not know whether the fault is with the Minister of the Interior or whether the Minister of Finance is to blame. While I want to draw the attention of the Minister to our museum, I want to point out that it is high time the Minister gave his attention to the problems of museums. The Minister is doing a great work in remedying the disorder prevailing in his department. We have had the appointment of the Hospital Commission, and although the Minister has not carried out the report it still helps us to see the matter in its true light. The Minister is busy everywhere in the matter of education. I hope that he will also give his attention to the museums. I think the public view with regard to museums is wrong because it is thought that they are a place for taking children for pleasure or to visit when one goes to a town or village and has nothing else to do. That is a wrong view of the matter because they ought to be places which in the first instance, aim at instructing the people in the scientific meanings of things. We ought to have a collection of objects there which can be useful to students in natural science and other departments. We find now that the various museums mix different things up in disorder and it is very difficult for students to prosecute their studies and then possibly to find that what they want is in Cape Town, Pretoria, Johannesburg, Pietermaritzburg and Bloemfontein. This is time that we concentrated more in the direction that one museum should follow one line and the other another, so that the scientific value of the museums may be increased for us. To make the museums in our country effective there ought to be means available for people to do research work. At Senekal, in the Free State, an expert made a discovery, but funds were not available to properly study it, to make a proper investigation, and send it to a museum. Money is required for research work and for study purposes, and the museums could also provide for the requirements of the general public. I hope the Minister will try to restore order in this respect. I also want to say something in connection with higher education, but I will leave that until that Vote is under discussion.</p>

<p>I wish to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice the recently published figures in regard to immigration and emigration, as these figures are sufficiently startling to rouse South Africa to the very serious position into which we are drifting. They show that for the month of February, 1926, there has been an increase or net gain if it can be called a gain, of foreign subjects in South Africa to the number of 166, of whom 140 are from southern and eastern Europe. Of these particular individuals 105 are Lithuanians. &#x201C;Die Burger&#x201D; has, I think, very wittily named them Lithuanian Afrikanders. I am unable to give any further information about their origin than that they are described in the return as Lithuanians. For <span class="col_3115-3116" refersTo="page_0510"/>the same period we have 325 domiciled South Africans leaving our shores, having expressed their intention not to return. We have, throughout that month, 290 British-born arrivals and 292 British-born departures, or a loss of 2 on the month. I am quite sure there is not a single South African, unless, perhaps, I except the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) and possibly the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge), but will regret the position which these figures disclose. There is no South African who wishes well for South Africa who does not regard this position with the gravest concern. I am quite aware that the Minister cannot legislate in advance of public feeling, but public feeling on this question is coming to the rescue, and in every corner of this country I venture to say that public feeling is about to demand that legislation shall be introduced to put an end to the admission of undesirable aliens. I have realized that public feeling needs to be further stirred, and in that connection I should like to suggest that the Minister should include in his estimates an item for the spreading of knowledge throughout South Africa of the type of Lithuanian Afrikander that we are receiving on these shores from week to week. I venture to suggest that the Minister should bring the bioscope to his aid in that respect. He should vote some money for the filming of these Lithuanian Afrikanders as they step ashore, each having been provided with the required sum of &#x00A3;50, and I am quite sure that if the Minister would go a little further and pay a royalty for the reproduction of these pictures on every bioscope screen in South Africa every week, he could be guaranteed an agitation which would surprise him, an agitation that would transcend in intensity the anti-convict agitation of 1849. It is because South Africa does not apprehend the kind of person who is being landed on these shores that we have not had such an agitation.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have seen them, and I do not want to see any more of them coming in. I feel that the time has arrived when South Africa should know the kind of immigrant we are receiving, without remonstrance, without any sort of effective restriction&#x2014;beyond this futile restriction of their being provided with &#x00A3;50. which is easily got over; but South Africa should know the type of immigrant coming to these shores, who is outnumbering every other class we are receiving at the present moment. We are at present voting &#x00A3;30,000 for the repatriation of Asiatics, and I venture to say the time will come when we shall be willing to vote a bigger sum than that to get rid of our Lithuanian Afrikanders. It is somewhat of a contrast to turn from this state of affairs to the state of affairs that exists in America. A recent statement by Dr. Harry Laughlin, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, was submitted to a committee of the House of Representatives on immigration and naturalization, and that document reveals the fact that one great democracy is determined to pursue a scientific and enlightened policy on racial questions, putting: in the forefront no longer the sentimental idea that America is the natural asylum for all the unfortunates of the world, nor even the economic object of developing the resources of the country as soon as possible, but the biological ideal of securing that the United States shall be peopled by the best stock of the old world, and those only. That is an ideal which I would commend to the Minister, and I hope he will be able to translate it into practice at no distant date. The position in America is that in July, 1927, there will be a reduction by 150,000 of the aliens who have hitherto been admissible to that country ; and we may naturally expect that these people, finding that America will not receive them, will turn their attention to South Africa, or, in any case, a large number of them will. I hope by that time the Minister will have carefully considered the position, and will have seen fit to introduce measures to deal suitably with the situation which is likely to arise in consequence of the position in America. We have, in addition, the effect of certain American laws providing for the expulsion of about 1,000,000 undesirable aliens from America. America makes no bones about this subject. They pass an Act headed in plain type&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Act to limit alien immigration,</block>

<p>and I hope we shall take the same sensible view, and that we shall base our quota system, as America has done in recent years, on the census of 1890, and only allow a percentage of the stocks represented in the country on that date, with the object of excluding those on the American basis who do not prove the most desirable and suitable immigrants. Dr. Laughlin describes the new quota system in America as one which is framed to avoid giving offence to the less favoured nations, while securing a great preponderance to north-western Europe, which is made to include Sweden, Germany and France.

<p>I support the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) in his appeal to discuss the rates of pay of public servants. I have received a telegram from the Public Service Association at Pretoria, stating that at a combined meeting of public servants and members of the railway organization at Pretoria, discontent was expressed at the failure of the Government to restore the scales of pay recommended by the Graham Commission ; failure of the Government to grant a joint council ; and failure to abolish differential pay between married and single officers. This was adopted by a very large and important meeting. I feel sure the Government will listen to the appeal of the hon. member, and to the representations which have been made. My object having been obtained, I now ask permission to withdraw my amendment for reduction of the Minister&#x2019;s salary.</p>

<p>I do not want to ask the Minister anything about Albanians, Lithuanians, or any other &#x201C;-anians,&#x201D; but to put some questions with regard to items which appear on the Estimates. There is &#x00A3;650 set down for the Lourenco Marques agency. Is this in connection with the Railway Department&#x003F; What are the duties of the official there&#x003F; For registration expenses &#x00A3;17,000 is set down this year, as against &#x00A3;6,000 last year. Is that parliamentary registration&#x003F; I would also like to join with the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) in connection with his remarks about the archives of this country. For many years past we have been told of the great value we possess in our archives. They are housed in the most undesirable place under extraordinary conditions, and it is something like ten years since it was suggested, and almost agreed to, that a suitable building should be put up for housing all these historical documents. I think that is a matter which ought to receive the attention of Parliament, that the archives of the country should be gathered together and properly housed in a national building. I see that our chief archivist is paid &#x00A3;900 a year, and, knowing him as he is known to us in this country, I say he is worth more than that. I speak with some personal knowledge, and I know we have an excellent man in our chief archivist. Under deportation expenses I see &#x00A3;2,500 was set down last year, and a similar sum for the current year. I would like to ask the Minister how much was expended on that vote, and how&#x003F; Reference has already been made to the repatriation of Asiatics ; &#x00A3;25,000 was voted last year, and is increased to &#x00A3;30,000 on this year&#x2019;s Estimates. In the course of the session, the Minister has referred to this vote. Will he tell us how much has been expended, and how many Asiatics have been repatriated&#x003F; There is a matter I have raised for the past few years. The South African Public Library gets a grant of &#x00A3;2,500, and the Government Library at Pretoria one of &#x00A3;1,500. Both of these have been increased, and the grants previously paid have been taken away from the Bloemfontein Library and the Natal Society Pietermaritzburg Library, which are also national&#x2014;I know that is certainly the case with the Natal Society. I think that is a great pity. It has been said, why should not the provinces make a grant, but the grant in aid of these two libraries was continued up till 1920-&#x2019;21, or eleven years after Union. In the stringent times after the war, everything that could necessarily or easily be lopped off was lopped off, and the grant to these two national libraries was taken away. I appeal to the Minister to see whether these grants cannot be restored to these libraries which are doing such excellent work. I have the greatest sympathy for the local patriotism of the hon. member for Rondebosch, but I cannot follow him in some of the arguments which he puts forward in endeavouring to get increased grants for institutions round the Cape&#x2014;</p>

<p>With regard to the National Botanical Gardens, &#x00A3;2,450 was voted last year. I do not think that the work that has been done there is commensurate with the money voted. I know there are botanical gardens in other parts of the country doing excellent work more cheaply. Take the art gallery and the Michaelis gallery. You have the richest community of the Union in the Cape Peninsula, and they ought to do more for local institutions. The hon. member for Winburg (Dr. van der Merwe) has extolled the splendid work done at Bloemfontein museum. I would direct attention to the provincial museum at Pietermaritzburg, which possesses-the finest collection in its mammal hall of the fauna of the country. I ask the Minister, in connection with the Natal Society in Pietermaritzburg, the society recognized as the national institute of the province, and the national museum in Pietermaritzburg, that these should receive his fullest consideration.</p>

<p>I wish to follow the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) and the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Snow) in asking the Minister what steps have been taken to improve the consultation between the Public Service Commission and the Advisory Council. I notice from the report of the Public Service Commission that the Advisory Council met on two occasions last year, and from paragraph 45 of the report I notice that they made two proposals, namely, the establishment of an Appeal Board and that a joint council should be set up. The reply to these representations was that these proposals had been very seriously considered by the Cabinet, who found it impossible to meet the wishes of the associations in this respect, and that while the present machinery must continue to exist much could be done to improve the consultation between the Advisory Council and the Public Service Commission, and that the necessary steps to this end were being further considered by the Government. I wish to know what steps the Government have taken, for undoubtedly the Public Service have had good reason to be dissatisfied with the functioning of their Advisory Council. The second point I wish to raise is in regard to the method employed by the Department of Census in collecting criminal statistics. The Minister could very easily save the Police department considerable time and trouble and a considerable amount of money. In the course of our investigations on the Police Commission we found that the Department of Census required a monthly return of criminal statistics from every post commander in the country. These same statistics are at the same time required for police purposes to be sent to the Criminal Statistical Bureau at Pretoria, resulting in an obvious duplication of this work. Surely the Census Department, by sending a messenger across a few yards of street to the criminal bureau in Pretoria, could get all the information they require and so spare the police this trying and unnecessary work. I would ask the Minister, if he has not had his attention drawn to this point previously, to make some enquiries <span class="col_3119-3120" refersTo="page_0512"/>and see whether his department cannot obtain all the information they require from the criminal bureau without requiring the police force to be put to this tremendous trouble throughout the country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) has indulged in his usual &#x201C;hymn of hate&#x201D; against the Lithuanians. We ought by this time to treat it with contempt. We hear nothing new, but the reason why I do take notice of it is that his remarks are not only resented by the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) and myself, but by the whole Jewish community throughout South Africa. They resent these insults because they are all Jewish immigrants that are referred to, and all his asseverations that he is not referring to them are not believed, and a man who can come forward time after time with the same half-digested facts is unworthy to represent any important constituency. Let him name a single case of one of the men referred to who has passed through the immigration office who has done anything against the honour of their nation. He cannot possibly know that, or he would not talk such balderdash in this House. I have a letter written recently by a Cape Town doctor. He has lived among these people for some twenty-five years and writes very highly of them. If the hon. member had taken the trouble to attend the opening of the new Jewish synagogue at Worcester recently and had heard what was said about the same people by the mayor or what is said of them by mealie-farmers in the Transvaal or the potato farmers in the Free State or the fruit farmers in the Ceres district, it would be different, but the hon. member does not know and he talks about the&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lithuanian Afrikander.</block>

<p>Let him remain in this country another 50 years and he will never become an Afrikander. I do not see why it should be humorous to refer to a &#x201C;Lithuanian Afrikander.&#x201D; What is the fact&#x003F; As we learned on select committees, particularly the Medical Committee, these men are only here a few years and they talk Dutch like those born in this country. Does my hon. friend speak a word of Dutch in spite of the long period he has been in this country&#x003F; It is a compliment to call these men Lithuanian Afrikanders. But his whole campaign is based on misrepresentation of facts. Let him pay more attention to facts and cease this absurd propaganda he has indulged in. Can he show that a single one of these Lithuanian immigrants has proved unworthy ; or has offended seriously against the laws&#x003F; That would be the way to deal with the matter. But because he calls them Lithuanians he thinks he is finished with them. Some of these men are far better than the hon. member ; have far better intellects and far better manners and are better in every respect. He spoke about a bioscope. I think a better place to refer to would be a circus when you see the hon. member struggling through his newspaper cuttings&#x2014;</p>

<p>If he did not intend to refer us to a bioscope I will not refer him to a circus, but to see him struggling through his portfolio of newspaper cuttings on every subject under the sun is a moving picture. Every year he trots out this story of what is done in America. What is the use of talking about America with its teeming millions and comparing it with South Africa&#x003F; Why does not the hon. member devote some of these wonderful talents of his to keeping people in South Africa&#x003F; What has he done to keep a single immigrant from leaving South Africa&#x003F; The Lithuanian comes to us and is allowed to land, while the people he wants to remain leave the country. Why did not the hon. member when his Government was in power take steps to prevent immigrants leaving South Africa&#x003F; His argument, as I have previously shown, rests on the entire misconception of an officer in the statistical department who, because a certain address had been given in London came to the conclusion that hundreds of these people had been sent out by a charity organization. That argument I have exploded on a previous occasion. I have a list of the 705 persons the hon. member refers to; 306 of them were under 21 years of age and 186 were between 21 and 30 years of age. The hon. member is trying to frighten the House with a gogga. The hon. members who sit on that side of the House listening to the hon. member for Illovo issuing this poison gas year after year regarding people who have done no harm, must share the responsibility with him. If by this time they do not realize that these insults against the Jewish race were resented at the last election they like the Bourbons learn nothing and forget nothing. This is the second time the hon. member has delivered these insults, this session, against a section of the community, and his party has to repudiate what he said or we must take it that he does represent more than himself. The Jewish people of South Africa are getting tired of this. They come here under the laws and settle down, and then it is left to the hon. member to insult them without a single member over there resenting the fact though he is generally believed to refer to Jewish immigrants. Either the hon. member for Illovo is speaking for himself or he is not. And if hon. members sit silent under the unworthy attacks on people quite as honourable as he is, and many of them better, they must share in the responsibility. Sixty thousand people in South Africa resent these unworthy attacks which are made without a vestige of foundation.</p>

<p>I should like to call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the disquieting child mortality figures among our white population.</p>

<p><span class="col_3121-3122" refersTo="page_0513"/>It appears that each year we lose 87 out of a 1,000 children. There are every year 3,000 children who do not become a year old. If active steps are taken in this matter, we shall at least save 1,500 out of the 3,000 children, and that will mean a tremendous amount to South Africa. The number of births is only 2 per cent. more than the deaths, which is a sad state of affairs. Therefore, we ought to do everything in our power to reduce the mortality figures. There are not exactly many marriages to-day, and when they do take place the families are small. It looks as if the people are beginning to believe in the "Koranna" policy to only have one child in the house. The Child Welfare Society is doing good work, and should be supported. Mrs. MacDonald goes about the country in the interests of the society and she does not even get a free pass on the railway. I hope the Minister will use his influence to get her that, because she is doing important work. I see &#x00A3;1,000 is given to the Lady Buxton Home. I am glad of that, and I hope that the Minister will do more in this respect. We spend a lot of money on immigration, but our first duty is to look after the population we already have. If half of the children who die annually can be saved, then our population in twenty years will be increased by 30,000, and that will mean a tremendous amount. If we were to use the &#x00A3;1,000,000 which the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) wants to spend on immigration, in the interests of our population, then conditions will be much improved. Then I also want to call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to venereal diseases. I have not got the figures unfortunately for this year, but last year the condition was very bad. According to the report of the chairman of the Health Committee, one out of every five people in Cape Town has that disease. This is an alarming position, and the Minister should take steps. I understand the disease is more general among the natives and coloured people, but many of the white population are also affected. Last year the district surgeon said that 70,000 cases had been treated in the hospitals by the various doctors. How many cases are not unknown&#x003F; One can say that there are 100,000 suffering from it. That is a condition which cannot continue, because there is great danger of contagion. I think the doctors ought to report the cases they know of which are not being treated. Under the existing law, however, they cannot do so, and, therefore, I think it would be wise to amend the law. I hope the Minister will give his attention to these two matters, viz., the startling child mortality and venereal disease.</p>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>The public servants deserve consideration, because they have been specifically excluded from having recourse to the Wage Act, and there is no machinery to enable them to state their case and to obtain redress. The Government should take into consideration the establishment of some machinery, whereby these grievances can be removed, and unless that is done we cannot expect to have a very contented public service. I would not have touched upon the remarks of the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) except for this fact that there is always the danger that, although he is probably expressing his own opinions, by reason of the position which, somehow or other, he finds himself in, people may imagine that he is expressing the opinion of many others in connection with the matter. He has suggested to the Minister that he should spend some money in bioscoping these Lithuanian immigrants as they arrive in this country. I would add this further suggestion that, if the Minister accepts the proposal, he should have the hon. member for Illovo on the same picture, and then people would see his features, and I do not think they would pay much attention to the object he has in view. I would add another suggestion, and it is this: Haying bioscoped these immigrants on their arrival, provision should also be made to film them a few years afterwards, when I venture to say that the public would realize that they have secured very valuable citizens in this country. Another point I would make is to the Minister of Agriculture. From reports that one gets continuously, including reports from officials in the Agricultural Department, it is obvious that more and more of these immigrants, who are considered so futile and so useless, in fact, so dangerous to the country, are going on to the land, and not only going on to the land, but proving highly satisfactory and highly successful. If the Minister of Agriculture took a census, he would find that there is a continually growing number of members of the Jewish race who are going on to the land, and making a tremendous success of it. Only a few weeks ago, one of the officials of the Department of Agriculture, lecturing at Potchefstroom, expressed his regret that when the British farmers were visiting South Africa, the arrangements did not include a visit to a certain farm run by a Mr. Lazarus, a Lithuanian immigrant. He showed how on that particular farm in the Transvaal run by Mr. Lazarus, the mealie crop was far in excess of the average crop in this country. On that farm the work was being done by 100 Europeans. In regard to the question of Akrikanderizing these immigrants, personally I must say I feel very seriously about it. I believe we should try and adopt the policy that for something like 100 years was carried out in America, of welcoming all immigrants, and giving them the fullest opportunities in this country. In America what happened was that, wherever they came from, the immigrants became Americanized, and after two or three years&#x2019; residence they were proud of their association with the country of the stars and stripes. I believe these immigrants to this country do become Afrikander in spirit and in outlook.</p>

<p>I join with the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander), the hon. member for Pretoria East (Mr. Giovanetti) and others in asking the Minister to meet representatives more frequently in regard to discussions on conditions in the public service. I believe a good deal of discontent is due to different local allowances in different parts of the Union. Living is cheaper in some districts where an allowance is given than in other districts where there is no such allowance. If he would meet members of the public service and discuss these matters, I think he would find they would be prepared to do without the allowances if there was equal pay in the different parts. It would go a good way towards removing the discontent that exists. I am perfectly convinced that public servants throughout the country would appreciate a move in this direction, and I hope the Minister will consider it. The great want in the services is opportunity for frankly discussing the position from time to time regarding pay and grading and promotion. Something is wanting on the lines somewhat of the Whitley councils, bringing together employees and Ministers in various departments. Mutual interests would then be considered, and agreements arrived at in a friendly way, doing away with friction and misunderstanding.</p>

<p>I am perfectly good currency, thank you&#x2014;rather too good, perhaps, to be driven out. The hon. member has told us, I think he has told the old story before&#x2014; he has almost worn it threadbare&#x2014;about the potato king and the mealie king, but he has not told us of any others who have engaged in primary production. We know that the majority of these people are not engaged in primary production. A very large number come to this country and take up such occupations as the middleman, trader, yeast seller, hotel-keeper, bar-keeper, canteen-keeper, eating-housekeeper, and occupations of that sort which are already overstaffed. We have no particular need for people who are engaged in those occupations, and we can certainly do quite well without the class of immigrant coming from Lithuania. We want primary producers, and the law of America gives a preference quota to the primary producer. It is quite clear on that point. We have heard from the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge), who is an eminent authority on the native question, of course, how the introduction of these people would help us with the native question. In America anarchists and Bolsheviks are not admitted, and there is no doubt that a large proportion of the people who come to this country are of this particular belief. We can well do without them, and I know of no Europeans who are less likely to have a beneficial influence on the natives than the particular immigrants I speak of. It is within my experience that these particular people demean themselves with the natives for the sake of a little gain, and they have no idea of the proper relative position that should be occupied by the white man and the native in this country. They do an infinite amount of harm, possibly without knowing it, but that is no reason why we should admit people so misguided. The hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander), in the frenzy that seemed to possess him at the moment, told us of the 60,000 who would meet us at the polls.</p>

<p>I am saying as nearly as I can what the hon. member said. He mentioned a number of people in connection with the next general election. Year after year I have devoted myself to this question, and have asked no help from either side in the House, but I know I have a good deal of support from both sides. I am convinced, and absolutely satisfied, that there is a strong feeling in South Africa against this particular type of immigrant coming in. I have said on other occasions, and I say now, that I do not care what a man&#x2019;s religion is&#x2014;he may be a Christian, a Jew, an infidel or a Turk&#x2014;but we do not want these Lithuanian immigrants, and our policy should be conditioned by good sense. We should make it clear that we do not want them, and take steps that they do not enter in the numbers in which they are coming in at the present moment. The hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) told of 705 people who had passed through some Jewish institution in Leman Street in London, and he would have us accept his word&#x2014;I do not doubt it for <span class="col_3125-3126" refersTo="page_0515"/>a moment&#x2014;that they received no assistance in connection with the sum of money they are required to produce in South Africa. He did not tell us of the 706th case. I read in a newspaper of an immigrant, a Lithuanian, who had been arrested for robbing a woman of &#x00A3;25 &#x2014;he was one of the off-scourings of America. His plea was that he wanted to go to South Africa. And his excuse was that he only had &#x00A3;25, and he robbed the woman of another &#x00A3;25 to make up the &#x00A3;50 he required to produce in South Africa. I could engage the committee a good while reciting misdemeanours and offences of a great many people in the Transvaal which have come to my knowledge.</p>

<p>I do not propose to enumerate the misdemeanours which are constantly committed by these people, sometimes through ingorance, sometimes not ; but in any case they show that they are not of the type that we require in this country, where it is desirable that our immigrants, from whatever country, should be a good example to the natives.</p>

<p>A second time the hon. member stated that I was not speaking the truth. I am repeating what the hon. gentleman has just stated himself, and therefore it must be true. I am absolutely impenitent, and I hope the Minister will take this matter into his serious consideration. It is a matter I am sure he himself will regard as a serious one, and he is not to be misled by the torrent of wrath that has come from my hon. friends on the cross benches. I am sure that the Minister is man of the world enough not to be stampeded by that.</p>

<speech by="#boshof">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOSHOF</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to add a few words in support of what the hon. member for Boshof (Mr. van Rensburg) has said with reference to the religious side at our universities. We see that, according to law, the Council of the Senate have not the least right upon appointing a professor to enquire into the religious beliefs of the man, and I think that that is very wrong for us as a people to sacrifice our religious principles. We know that our history for the most part is based on religious circumstances and built on biblical doctrine. To-day the law provides that the Council and the Senate shall not go into the articles of belief or religious meaning of the professor. I hope the law will be altered so that when professors are appointed the council will have the right to enquire into their religious view. We know that the scientific world is out to-day to state that everything arises from nature and that nature is everything. It will be unfortunate if a part of our people sacrificed its religious principles, and if our universities were not founded on religious principles. What will become of our country if the old people who are still faithful to their religion die out, and the people coming from the universities to become leaders of the people give up their religion. I hope the Minister will go into it and see whether a conscience clause cannot be put into the Act.</p>

<p>The Minister is supporting small botanical gardens, but surely he should concentrate on a central one. I do not mind his supporting the gardens at Worcester and Fauresmith if he wishes, but they are only show gardens and should be treated as such. Let us concentrate at one large centre, and have research work done there. Last year I criticized the instructions given by the Minister in regard to registration of voters, and I showed that the coloured community were not being treated in the same way as the Europeans, as required by the Act.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>&#x2020;Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s circular proved it. These people are being further handicapped, for after being registered they are told they must fill in new forms because the department had lost the original forms. One coloured voter has received the following letter from the magistrate at Stellenbosch&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As your name appears in 1925 printed voter&#x2019;s list for this Electoral Division, but no form of claim in support of your registration can be traced as having been received at this office, I have been instructed by the Secretary for the Interior, Pretoria, to call on you now to complete the accompanying form R.V.9.</block>

<p>That is the form required to be filled up by non-European applicants who are not already registered as voters, and the very point I made last year is borne out by the fact that even if a coloured man&#x2019;s name is on the voters&#x2019; list, as in this case, he is required to fill in form R.V.9. I suggest the reason is that they are presumed not to have been able to fill in the first form in accordance with law, and that <span class="col_3127-3128" refersTo="page_0516"/>there is, therefore, some unlawful action in regard to the first form. I would like to have the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in regard to this matter, because the community feel that they are not being fairly treated, and that there is a differentiation made between them and the Europeans while, as the Minister knows, according to our electoral law in the Cape Province, there is absolutely no difference between the two sections.</p>

<speech by="#pretorius">

<from>&#x2020;*Lt.-Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. PRETORIUS</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened to the speech of the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street), and it seems to me that he is prepared to allow any class of person to come in from Central Europe. I am opposed&#x2014;whether they are English, Germans or Hollanders&#x2014;to allow people to come in who cannot make a living in their own country. I think the time has come to go into the matter and not to allow everybody in that comes from Europe. Let us follow the example of America and allow a certain number from each country. I agree with the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) that we are not against a class as a class, but we want people in this country who can make a living here, and not people who merely come here to live on the population of our country. It is not a question here of insulting anybody. When I speak of undesirable immigrants, I do not only mean the Jew, but also people who are Christians. It is not that I am against a particular class, but it is time for us to see that we only get the best class of man in the country who will not live as a parasite, but will help to push the country ahead. It seems to me that the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) is very sensitive. I will not insult him by mentioning a certain class, but an undesirable element is entering the country, and I want him to agree that that is the case. Or does the hon. member wish us to admit any class&#x003F; People are to-day entering the country who are not an asset to our society, and they are becoming a great danger, because they do not make their own living, but live as parasites on the inhabitants of South Africa. The Minister ought to institute a thorough enquiry in order to prohibit undesirable immigrants.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#alexander">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say a few words in connection with what the last speaker said. I am very glad that still another member of the South African party has frankly expressed his opinion about this matter. We do not want people to come here who cannot make a living. Whoever said such a thing&#x003F; Does the hon. member not know the law&#x003F; It provides that a man cannot come here if he cannot make a living. Our immigration law is one of the strictest in the world. The Minister ought to be asked why he does not carry out the law if the class of immigration is unsatisfactory. There is nothing wrong with the law. The man who comes in must be suited to South Africa and give proof that he can exist. The hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) comes to the House every year and says that some of the immigrants are bad. The people are examined here and the immigration officials say that they are suitable according to the provisions of the law, and therefore it cannot be said that the people are bad. Therefore we feel insulted. We do not want bad people in the country. If a Jew is bad I will assist in keeping him out of the country. Furthermore it is bad for the Jews if people come in who are not good. What the hon. member for Illovo says is something else because every year he tells the same story, viz.: that the people have no character. Let me give an example to the hon. member for Witwatersberg (Lt.-Col. N. J. Pretorius). He is Dutch-speaking and if anyone got up in the House and said that Dutch-speaking people should not be allowed into the country because they were people of bad character he would feel insulted. That is why we also feel insulted. If the hon. member thinks that the existing immigration law is not sufficiently strict to keep out undesirable immigrants, then I ask him to read our immigration law and that of other countries. He will then have to acknowledge that our law is one of the strictest in the world. If a man gets in under it he is a good man or otherwise the immigration officials are not doing their duty. The immigrants have to be of good character, must be able to write a European language and in that way show that they have had a little education. In addition they require a passport. The hon. member has probably travelled a good deal and knows that one cannot travel without a passport. Does the hon. member know that the police of the small towns from which the people come must certify that they are of good character, that the British Consul must vis&#x00E9; their passports and that the High Commissioner in London must also do so before they can come here&#x003F; Thus before a man can come here it must be testified in his own town on the way and in London that he is a good man. One can therefore have the assurance that the man who comes here must be a good man under the Act of 1913. The people are suitable immigrants and if they make money they produce. They can produce if they have the opportunity. Last year the Zionist organization got 33,000 people to go to Palestine and many of the people commenced to do productive work on the land The people want to work on the land, but in South Africa they have no opportunity. A man cannot commence farming with or &#x00A3;500 because in South Africa you need &#x00A3;2,000. When the people acquire money they go on the land. Some of them in the Transvaal, Free State, and Cape Province want to go on the land. Not only can they work productively on the land, but also in the factories. Do hon. members know that the people making the Waverley blankets in Woodstock are Jewish immigrants who come from the same places the hon. member for Illovo is talking about&#x003F; In the blanket factories South African wool is used Why should these people be kept out of South Africa&#x003F; They are useful to the country. They are clever and suitable immigrants. They go to the villages and along the countryside and soon learn Afrikaans and English, so that <span class="col_3129-3130" refersTo="page_0517"/>they are bilingual. Of course there are bad ones amongst them, but you find bad people in every race. In general, however, they are of a good class. The farmers on the countryside speak of them with the highest respect. It is not right for anyone in this House to insult the race to which I and the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) belong. We feel insulted if our race is insulted and anybody would feel insulted if his race is insulted because he is included in the insult. We are quite ready to listen to arguments. I assure the hon. member for Witwatersberg that the matter is being exaggerated&#x2014;it is a bogey and the statements are not founded on facts. The people are suitable immigrants and we have a good Immigration Act to see that only good people come into the country. Our immigration officials also are good. Let us co-operate in the interests of South Africa. I can assure the hon. member that if he can prove to me that a man&#x2014;even if he is a Jew&#x2014;who is not of good character is coming to South Africa, then I will use my influence to keep him out. The insult of the hon. member for Illovo ought not, however, to be constantly repeated because it is not just and fair.</p>

<p>As regards the Immigration Act I hope it will be applied by the Minister. It was put on the statute book without any nationality being named therein and is only meant to keep undesirable immigrants out of the country. Because the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) has made certain allegations&#x2014;the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) calls them bogies&#x2014; the last-named must not try and frighten us by talking in a loud voice. The hon. member for Illovo is not the leader of the South African party, and we as a party are not responsible for what he says.</p>
