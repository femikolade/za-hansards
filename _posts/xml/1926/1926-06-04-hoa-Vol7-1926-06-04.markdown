<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. BROWN</person>:</from>

<p>Just before this Bill leaves this House for the last time I wish to state that I feel, and feel very strongly that the passing of the Bill in its present form will not give satisfaction to the country. At no time nave I opposed the principle of an increase of members&#x2019; salaries. The very opposite. What I am more concerned about in regard to this Bill is the position in which the Senate has been placed. They practically have had no voice in the matter. On the average the sittings of the Senate are about 50 each session, and we propose to give the members of that House an allowance of £700 a year. They are allowed 15 days&#x2019; leave each session, and many of them have availed themselves of that leave, so that we get an average of about 35 attendances per session, which means that members of the Senate are to get £20 a day for their attendance. That, I consider, is unsound. I always understood that this was an allowance; it was not a salary. The need of an increased allowance, as far as the Senate is concerned, is nothing like so great as the need in this House. Senators have no election expenses, and they have no demands made upon them from constituents. A country member informed me the other day that he had to visit 20 places every year in order to meet his constituents. I think the thing is very wrong in principle. We have eliminated from this Bill one or two objectionable features. One of them was that a member had to apply for the increased allowance. Another proposal that members should call a meeting of their constituents and put it to them whether they were in favour of the increased allowance, seemed to me out of the question. I learnt from one of the head officials here the miserable pay given to the messengers and other people employed by this House, especially considering the extremely long hours that they are called upon to work.</p>

<block name="quote">the crawling clause.</block>

<p>It might be just as invidious to draw a distinction between the allowances of senators and members of the House of Assembly as it would be to have kept that &#x201C;crawling clause&#x201D; in the Bill. It is true by minute calculation you might make the thing appear somewhat absurd, but we hope that by experience we might introduce some procedure which would make the attendance of senators more regular in the Senate than has been the case up to now. On the simple principle that it would be invidious to discriminate between the allowances for the Senate and those for the House of Assembly, I think the hon. member&#x2019;s argument ought not to carry great weight.</p>

<heading>SUGAR PRICES BILL.</heading>

<p>Second Order read: House to resume in committee on Sugar Prices Bill.</p>

<p>House In Committee :</p>

<p>[Progress reported yesterday, on Clause 1, to which certain amendments had been moved.]</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>This is undoubtedly an extremely important matter. I do not think that hon. members quite see what the ultimate results of this will be. I say advisedly this is not the last word in the assistance of the sugar industry. The system on which you are going now is absolutely unsound ; in fact it is rotten. Take the position in 1922. The late Government appointed a commission in 1922 to enquire into the position of the sugar industry in Zululand and Natal. This report is dated May, 1922. The position then was this, according to the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The following principles represent the opinion of the industry: No alteration in the present duty ; an effective automatic dumping clause; Mozambique to pay the same duty as other overseas duties.</block>

<p>That is done. In Mozambique sugar comes in as foreign sugar and pays the full duty. That was the position then. Two points come out, that at that particular time the industry asked for no additional protective duty. The industry now is again in difficulties, and they are asking for increased protection, and the Government proposes, subject to this Bill and other conditions, to give them that increased protection. Why is that ? When they were in the position in 1922 that they did not require further protection, why four years after do they come and ask for the protection to be practically doubled ? The explanation is this. In 1920-&#x2019;21 the production of sugar was 143,000 tons. The production last year was 235,000 tons, an enormous increase. The consumption of sugar in this country is estimated, and I think it is a liberal estimate, at 170,000 tons. The balance that is left over, as shown in the returns, has to be exported. When it is exported it is sold at a loss. They get from £11 to £14 for it. On every ton that is exported a loss is made. As the report points out quite frankly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the low prices obtained recently overseas for surplus sugar that have placed the industry in its present difficulties.</block>

<p>Therefore the more the industry increases and the more it produces, the worse the difficulties and the more the loss it makes. With this very high protection they are getting now it will amount to close on 1d. a lb. The more the industry develops the more will be the loss.</p>

<p>Of course it is, because here we are asked to fix prices. In a few years from now&#x2014;two or three years at the outside&#x2014; the industry will come along and ask for prices to be increased still further.

<p>No: unfortunately. This commission of the Board of Trade agreed that it is not in a sound economic position. The commission of 1922 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They are generally reasonably efficient, but most are capable of improvement &#x2026;. It is necessary that the agreement between the millers and the planters should be revised forthwith.</block>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. There are only about 1,600 Europeans engaged in this industry. It would pay the country to pension them all off rather than go on the present system and increasing the losses. This country cannot afford to go on on the lines it is going on now.</p>

<speech by="#nicholls">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>If this country followed the political economic doctrine of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) it would be bankrupt, and would have no future whatsoever. The policy argued by the hon. member that, because you send something overseas to pay for your imports and the country is thereby losing by it, is to me unthinkably unsound. As to the position of the industry in 1922, it was in an entirely different position. The world&#x2019;s markets were different, and you did not have one million tons of sugar with which you did not know what to do. The industry did not come to the Government to get the report of 1922. That commission sat in Durban, and took evidence from both sides, <span class="col_4679-4680" refersTo="page_1293"/>on which it founded its report. A chartered accountant took three months to go into the books, which the 1922 commission did not do. An expert chemist was sent to go into the facts, as well as an engineer, and the engineer&#x2019;s report is to be found at the back of the Board of Trade&#x2019;s report, in which he shows that the industry has increased in efficiency since 1922 about 10 per cent. There was an increase of about 10 per cent. of extraction. In order to enable this Bill to go through without any risk of its being withdrawn again, I want to withdraw the amendment which I put on the paper making the price for refined sugar 4d. instead of 3¾d., and I am asked to do this by the industry, as they do not want to be jeopardized in any way. The industry realizes that they are forced to do this to get the Bill through.</p>

I am entirely in the hands of the Minister of Finance.

<heading>DIAMOND CUTTING ACT, 1919, AMENDMENT BILL.</heading>

<p>Third Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for second reading, Diamond Cutting Act, 1919, Amendment Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate, adjourned yesterday, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#ernest_oppenheimer">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Before dealing with the amendments to the Act as proposed in this Bill, I would like to thank the hon. the Minister for having given me the opportunity to take part in this debate. I am naturally very keenly interested in anything that affects the diamond industry and I desire to express my gratification at the Minister&#x2019;s action in giving me this opportunity. I should like to appeal to the Minister and to ask him if he could not see his way clear not to proceed with this Bill during the present session. Even if the Minister is negotiating with people overseas in regard to establishing a diamond cutting industry in South Africa, any arrangements which he may come to, or which he may desire to come to, will have to be subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament during the next session and there is no point in passing this Bill now as it will not assist the Minister in any scheme which he may contemplate. It is strange, but it is a <span class="col_4681-4682" refersTo="page_1294"/>fact, that no one seems to learn anything from history. The very amendments now proposed were contained in the Act when it was introduced originally and were deleted with the assistance of the National party. When the Bill was originally introduced by the South African party, Mr. Hirschhorn, who then represented the Diamond Syndicate, with Mr. Brink and myself, interviewed Mr. Wilcocks, who in the absence of Gen. Hertzog was then acting as leader of the National party, and we asked him if he would assist us in having certain provisions deleted. I remember that particular interview with a great deal of interest, particularly the question of taking diamonds in series which was discussed. Mr. Wilcocks himself remarked that it seemed very hard that cutters should have to take diamonds in series, but Mr. Hirschhorn put the question this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How would you feel if you were forced by law to sell your merchandise, not as you wished to and to whom you wished, but to certain persons, and if you were forced to sell it at a certain price.</block>

<p>Mr. Hirschhorn then put a very homely simile to Mr. Wilcocks, and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Say you dealt in ready-made clothes and you had a thousand suits in your shop, and a law was passed compelling you to sell those one thousand suits at a certain price to anyone that came along&#x2014;that would already be a grievance&#x2014;but if you were told that you had to sell the trousers and keep the coats you would feel that you had an even worse grievance.</block>

<p>That is really the effect of being forced to sell single stones. The diamond trade is carried on in series and the diamond cutting trade is also carried on in series. I realize that it would be a great advantage for a cutter to be able to come to my office and pick, say, a two carat stone and nothing else&#x2014;it would be a great advantage to him if he could pick out just what he wanted. So long as this demand for single stones was small no great harm would be done, but when the trade develops&#x2014; and the whole object of this Bill is to develop the diamond cutting industry on a big scale&#x2014; then we should be faced with the position of having to sell a large number of single stones and be left with the others on our hands. That in due course would make us bankrupt. The Minister knows that we have entered into diamond buying contracts which involve no less than £40,000,000 worth of diamonds over a period of five years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>How much do you say?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ernest_oppenheimer">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>£40,000,000 worth in value. So it really means a very serious thing for the trade if the principle is adopted that we are to be forced to sell diamonds to certain people and that we are to be forced to sell single stones. It is a very serious thing if we are to be told that we must sell our diamonds at a particular price and that we must supply single stones at that price. The price being what we ourselves have agreed to pay for millions of pounds worth of diamonds plus a small addition of 5 per cent. only for the selected stones. Even if it were correct to force us to supply a single stone to a cutter surely he should pay the market price and the producer should get the benefit of eliminating the middle man. It does not seem reasonable to force the producer to sell a single stone at his wholesale selling price. Besides it is absolutely impossible to ascertain what an individual diamond costs. As far as rough diamonds are concerned undoubtedly the Minister has the best possible technical advice, but I challenge anyone to value a single diamond to within five per cent. I challenge anyone to say that any given diamonds are worth just £100. They may, in fact, be worth £105 or they may be worth £95. In a huge parcel of diamonds experienced valuators find that the mistakes made in one lot are equalized in another. Say, for instance, that two expert diamond valuators, Mr. Brink for one, and if I may mention myself, for the other, were to value a large parcel of diamonds, the total valuation would probably be approximately the same in each case, but in individual stones we might differ much more than five per cent. I have now dealt with two important points of the Bill&#x2014;the question of series and the question of price&#x2014;but the most serious point of all is that relating to partly manufactured stones. In the regulations under the Act partly manufactured diamonds are defined as stones which have been sawn, cleaved or cut, or in respect of which some process has been carried out. The Minister proposes that diamonds under one carat may be exported in a partly manufactured state with enormous concessions in regard to the export duty. Let me tell the Minister that if the whole production of the Union were to be taken and cleaved there would hardly be a single stone weighing more than one carat, so that the proposed concession is really being made on the whole production of the Union. It is rather wearisome to quote a lot of figures now but I recently made enquiries in Amsterdam and find that the latest prices for cleaving a diamond vary from 1s. to 10s. per carat according to size and quality, and for sawing a diamond weighing from 1-10th to ¼ carat, 10d. per stone. Sawing a stone of one carat or more costs 2s. 6d. per carat. The cutting, which includes polishing, varies with the size of stones and quality, but the average cost of stones weighing six to the carat is £2 15s. per carat ; of stones weighing four to the carat £2 5s. per carat ; and of a stone of one carat or more £1 2s. 6d. per carat. So the Minister will see what an infinitesimal amount of work and money is required for simply cleaving or sawing a stone as compared to the cost of producing a brilliant. Yet the process of cleaving produces a partly manufactured stone in terms of the Act, and would entitle a man to the enormous concessions which the Minister proposes. Suppose a man opens a factory with, say, a hundred saws, and picks out the single stones he requires. He obtains the advantage of per cent. for the first two years and 5 per cent. for the next three years in export tax.</p>

<p><span class="col_4683-4684" refersTo="page_1295"/>He also obtains a considerable benefit in the reduced price at which he obtains these stones from the producer. Altogether I estimate that he will receive a benefit of from 12½ per cent. to 17½ per cent. for doing an almost negligible amount of work and employing a very small number of men. But the effect of these concessions will be that the price of diamonds will drop. The first man who is clever enough or fortunate enough to make a contract with the hon. the Minister, will reap the full advantage, but the next man who come along and contracts for perhaps a large percentage of the output will discover that the value of diamonds has already dropped as the result of the concessions given to the first man, and in this way the diamond market will be undermined. I now come to a most important aspect of this question. The Minister of Finance may be indifferent as to whether people dealing in diamonds make profits or not, but surely he cannot be indifferent to the loss of revenue which will result from these provisions. America has made a determined effort during thirty years to establish a diamond cutting industry, but it has not been successful, as not more than 350 men are employed in diamond cutting in that country. I feel quite sure that the loss of revenue which would result from an attempt to establish a diamond cutting industry in South Africa on the lines of this Bill, would be far greater than the total amount which would be paid out in wages to diamond cutters here. I want to submit to the hon. the Minister that this trade is so intricate and that we have worked so hard to re-establish it on a sound basis, that it seems a pity that at this juncture a measure of this kind should be rushed through. If I had thought that this Bill would be proceeded with this year I would have prepared myself with a great many facts and figures which would have convinced the Minister of the futility of introducing legislation of this kind.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not my business. I am a dealer in rough diamonds. The hon. member himself has not done it. There are five cutting establishments in a small way in the Union. If the Minister will make enquiries he will find that since I have had control of South African diamonds, I have gone out of my way to supply diamonds to these people at very moderate prices, and I am sure they make profits. I have gone out of my way to supply them with diamonds at a reasonable price, and every one of these people will tell the Minister that I am dealing fairly with them. But I tell you that you cannot establish a diamond cutting industry either under the original Act or under this Bill. You can never do it on an ad valorem basis. The cutting of diamonds costs a certain amount per Carat, and the worse a diamond is, the more processes are required, and the more it costs to finish it. Therefore, the cost of cutting has nothing at all to do with the value of the stone. Take, for example, a big Jagersfontein diamond worth, say, £60 a carat; 10 per cent. is too much protection, because the cost of cutting is relatively small. The bulk of our diamonds, however, average only 60s. per carat&#x2014;10 per cent. amounts to 6s., and that is too little protection for the establishment of a diamond cutting industry. That is conclusively proved by what has happened in America. America also gave 10 per cent. ad valorem protection, and after 30 years has not succeeded in establishing a cutting industry there. If the Minister wishes to establish an industry here, it must be done by means of the bounty system per carat.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>Then your argument is that the existing Act signifies nothing, and ought never to have been passed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ernest_oppenheimer">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>If we want to establish a cutting industry here, the principle of the ad valorem basis is of no use. We would have the most valuable stones being cut here for the sake of protection, which on these stones is excessive, while the small stones where the protection is too little would not be cut here at all. If the Minister wants a genuine diamond cutting industry established, he should consult with the Minister of Finance and be prepared to spend from £200,000 to £500,000 as a bounty for the people who wish to cut diamonds in South Africa. He can quite easily arrive at a scale whereby there would be a bigger bounty for small stones and a smaller bounty for the bigger stones. If you hold out an inducement of, say, from 15s. to 30s. per carat, then you may succeed ; but it is of no use talking about a small man undertaking this enterprise, because, in order to cut diamonds, large sums of money have to be invested. The trade in rough diamonds is done on a cash basis and involves large amounts of money, while the trade in brilliants is done on a very big credit system. An enquiry should be held to see whether the lines on which we are proceeding are the right ones.</p>

<p><span class="col_4685-4686" refersTo="page_1296"/>I understand that there is a likelihood of the chairman of the Board of Trade visiting Europe shortly in order to be in a position to advise the Government on this matter. I should be only too happy not only to show him the various intricacies and the methods by which the rough trade is carried on, but also to see that he is made thoroughly familiar with the whole diamond business, so that when he returns to South Africa he will be in a position to tell the Government what lines they should follow for the establishment of a diamond cutting industry here. To sum up my objections to the Bill, I feel most strongly that a system which forces us to sell single stones is a most pernicious one. Let us, by all means, help the genuine cutter, but the first thing that is essential is the sale of diamonds in series, and for this Government assistance will probably be required. It is not reasonable to say that we must sell single stones at the original price, and without having regard to the fact that the removal of those stones from the series reacts prejudicially on the value of the remainder of that series. It will not help the diamond cutter to bring in the Bill as it stands at present. It is not reasonable to say that the cutter shall be allowed to pick out what he requires at the price at which we buy these diamonds. I have already put forward my objections with regard to the proposals relating to partly manufactured stones. Unless the diamond cutting industry is established in South Africa on sound principles, the loss to the Exchequer will far outweigh the amount of wages paid to the men who may be employed in diamond cutting here. The Minister&#x2019;s proposals would undermine the whole fabric of the diamond trade, and bring prices down. I appeal again to the Minister to make the fullest enquiry before continuing on the lines of this legislation, and I offer my help and all the knowledge I possess to assist him in this matter.</p>

<speech by="#hay">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has spoken very temperately and even charmingly, but he quite ignores one thing, and that is that this diamond industry is carried on under licence from the State, which grants certain people control of an establishes what is practically a world monopoly in this asset of the country. Around it they have built up a perfect wall of special protection, and upset the whole principle of British law to protect themselves. We now have the principle that a man must show how he has got possession of a diamond, and on him is thrown the onus of proving his innocence. It is unknown elsewhere under British law. The result of this monopoly is that while South Africa has produced £300,000,000 worth of diamonds, the effect has been to enrich the Solly Joels, and people with foreign names&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">beyond the dreams of avarice,</block>

<p>but when one goes to Kimberley it is to see that the net result is a few chimney stacks of the De Beers company, but no other industry whatever, apart from the glorious industry of trapping, one of the most miserable things ever imposed on a country. This big asset we have parted with, and now financiers say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">this is ours,</block>

<p>and Government must see that we have full control, and there shall be no interference with the licensees of our national heritage. Very insinuatingly the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) said, why should he be compelled to sell the trousers of a suit and not the coat and waistcoat. That argument was very speciously put. Let me put the views of a cutter. He writes in the first place, why should this industry be tied up tooth and nail ? A merchant tailor buys his material where and how he likes, makes it up into a suit of clothes and no question is asked. The diamond cutter is hedged round with restrictions. A law, he says, should be passed so that any duly licensed cutter can buy and cut and sell his diamonds wherever he likes. If he buys stolen property he must take the same risk as any other merchant takes. The curious thing is that outside this country there is the free-est trade in diamonds. As soon as the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) gets his diamonds on board ship he can do as he likes with them. In London, Amsterdam, Paris or New York, one can walk about with our country&#x2019;s gems and buy or sell with the utmost freedom. Not so here in the country of production. In this country if you find a diamond in a chicken&#x2019;s crop and you don&#x2019;t go and report it, you can be sentenced to 5 years&#x2019; hard labour on the breakwater.</p>

<block name="quote">Don&#x2019;t touch this industry, it is most precarious, leave it alone or your revenue will seriously suffer.</block>

<p>The hon. member would not talk about £40,000,000 being invested in the trade if he and his associates thought it was as precarious as is often pretended. He knows that America bought over £8,000,000 of diamonds last year and will buy £10,000,000 next year. He knows that the value of diamonds is going up and up ; he knows that the market is absolutely firm, and now he comes here and says&#x2014;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I will withdraw that particular statement, and I think I may be allowed to say that amongst the interests the hon. member is serving is also the diamond producing interest. I am defending the general interests of the people as against this particular and highly protected monopoly. The people&#x2019;s benefit is to me very much greater than the special interests represented by the hon. gentleman. It is quite right that the sale of these stones should be controlled, so as to preserve he price at which they can be put on the world&#x2019;s markets. I freely admit that, but so far the monopolists&#x2019; interest has been not to see what is the most they could do with this asset in this country, but what is the least they could do; and, instead of attempting to assist diamond cutting here, their one idea has been to prevent it. We had an election promise from the Government that it would see that we would have diamond cutting established on a large scale in this country, not in any small way. The Minister of Finance certainly did not make any such promise, because he was in the extraordinarily delightful and singular position of having had to make no election promises at all. He had a pleasant walk-over in his constituency, and we are now faced with this position, that, because he made no promises, therefore, promises made by fellow Ministers, and by prominent men who belong to the party, have not to be fulfilled! I am sorry for that easy way to escape. At Kimberley we had the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Defence and a popular member of this House (Dr. Steyn), who told Kimberley people that they were going to have a diamond-cutting industry established there on a large scale almost immediately. With what cheers was that assurance received! I thought as I went out of that hall and saw the community so delighted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What fools ye mortals be: you have but little idea of the penetrative power of the hon. gentlemen who represent the diamond interests.</block>

<p>That is two years ago, or nearly, and to-day there is one diamond cutter less in the country than there was then ; and, seeing that it would take a year before any agreement entered into with any cutters could be confirmed by this House, it is going to be one and a half more years at least before there can be any appreciable addition to the diamond cutters in the Union. That is the sacred promise of the Government and its fulfilment! Instead, Ministers listen to these specious arguments and to those who would still go on as they have gone on for years and years frightening governments and pointing out the awful danger to our revenue of taking the protected monopoly out of those greedy hands. We have the Diamond Control Bill passed last session. I regret very greatly that the Minister of Mines and Industries did not appoint the Diamond Control Board provided for in that Act, for this reason, that, by this time, he would have had three independent men who could have given him honest advice without any question of professional or personal advantage; but, unfortunately, to-day he must turn to the same sources for his information and advice which have always prevented our having any development of the kind asked for. He has to turn to one, true a very great expert in this country, whose name I mention with respect, because he is in his special line a great South African. Mr. Arend Brink, the official adviser to the Government. He has written a pamphlet to show how impracticable diamond cutting is in this country, although he points out that the cutting is worth £5,000,000 a year. He says in this pamphlet that it is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">a seductive, but impracticable proposition.</block>

<p>To this gentleman, who is definitely committed to that opinion, the Minister turns for advice as to establishing a diamond cutting industry. Is Mr. Brink likely to tell the Minister of Finance that his pamphlet, which he wrote under the aegis of De Beers Company, is absolutely wrong? Is he likely to give himself the lie in regard to this precious pamphlet ? Certainly not. This is the poisoned source to which the Minister of Finance turns as he turns also to hon. friends opposite, for advice in regard to this industry. The writer of this pamphlet points out that a tariff protection of 40 per cent. on the export of rough stones is required to get diamond cutting properly established here. I agreed with him then as I do now. I have always said that that advice should have been taken, that Mr. Brink&#x2019;s expert knowledge should have been acted on ten years ago, and we should have put on the 40 per cent. that he deemed an essential protective tariff. We, who have always advocated a big cutting industry, are responsible, not hon. members opposite, for the Minister of Finance getting 10 per cent. export duty now. When we started on this question in 1913, and got a special parliamentary special commission set up, that body <span class="col_4689-4690" refersTo="page_1298"/>recommended that cutting should be established on a large scale by a protective tariff. There was then only a registration impost of per cent. We got that raised to 5 per cent. export duty, and later increased to the 10 per cent., which returns nearly a million annually to the Treasury. In this we received no assistance from the diamond monopoly interests. No, quite the contrary. They opposed then as they do now. There is neither altruism or patriotism in the ranks of financiers connected with South Africa, as there is in the United States of America. At the bottom the Opposition has to some extent been purely political. I want the Minister to listen to this extract from the pamphlet ; it shows the spirit in which it is written&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question of the establishment of cutting factories here is purely an economic one, and should not be dragged into politics and become the sport of party politicians. There is, however, a great danger that it will serve as an alluring election cry of the leaders of a certain party who have the doubtful reputation of defying law and order.</block>

<p>And then it goes on to attack the Labour party and Socialists in venomous terms. It is to the gentleman who writes this the Minister goes for advice! When we come to the product itself, there is nothing but restriction. Why should South African cutters be restricted ? Why should they not be in the exact position of the licensed buyer, who can export where he likes, buy where he likes, and do as he likes, within the regulations? But our unfortunate cutter is severely circumscribed. We pleaded, to start with, that he should simply be treated as any other trader, able to deal freely with his product in the best market, and in the best way he can. But no, he was surrounded by all these drawbacks, so as practically to prevent&#x2014;not assist&#x2014;him in cutting. But we are a very short-sighted people. While we got £850,000 last year from diamonds, America obtained in duty £1,200,000 out of our gems. Every year that country gets more by taxation of our diamonds than we do ourselves. If the Minister had the courage to put on the 40 per cent. to secure cutting being established here, his Government would be in the position of getting more than America, and the wealthy ones in America would be paying our duty all the time. We have the opportunity of making the world pay for this luxury, and we are flinging it and his friends into the hands of the hon. gentleman opposite (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer). As for £40,000,000 being put up, the hon. gentleman talks as if he and others were putting up that great sum. Recently he has shown himself rather unreliable in figures, and this globular sum is four times the sum required to finance the trade. It is like wool, or cotton, or hides, or any other commodity. Exports are drawn against, and the consumer pays for everything. So far as diamond cutting is concerned, we are now in the unfortunate position that before any agreement can be made for outside diamond cutters to establish themselves here, another year must elapse before it could be put before this House. So far from cutters being satisfied with the treatment they have received at the hands of the producers, I have letter after letter showing that they have been unable to buy at the price at which they should be able to purchase. This attempt to compel the syndicate to sell a series, as the hon. gentleman knows, is not worth the snap of a finger. When cutters did get rough stones, they found they could buy 10 per cent. cheaper in London than they could here. It is because the syndicate or trust does not want them sold here; he wants every diamond to be sent overseas. Our business is to produce these diamonds at the lowest possible cost, and hand them over as a monopoly, and meanwhile the hon. gentleman is frightening the Government with this terrible uncertainty of a precarious and easily injured trade. Diamond cutters claim that they should have an open trade, as elsewhere. They should have. Why not ? If the Government had the astute wisdom of the hon. gentleman opposite, they would put on 40 per cent. and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let them all come ; we do not want any restrictions, we do not want anything but an effective tariff.</block>

<p>Then when diamond cutters come in under such protection, they would be established here as part of the consuming community. I have no sympathy whatever with the means adopted in this Bill of dealing with our diamond cutters. They asked for bread, and they are handed a stone.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to think it is not part of the policy of hon. members on this side to support methods of that kind. An attempt was made by the hon. member to criticize some publication by Mr. Arend Brink prior to his becoming a member of the public service. The Minister, I know, will defend him against his attacks, in accordance with what is his duty to all members of the public service when similarly attacked. I am perfectly certain that Mr. Brink, like other members of the public service, subordinates his private views and opinions, whether they may be in order to render to the Government of the day the best service in his power. I do not think for one moment that the hon. member was justified in making these suggestions that Mr. Brink&#x2014;a very highly respected South African indeed&#x2014;would form any exception to the rule. I see a flaw in the machinery which prevents the Bill from being effective at all. In the Bill of 1919, a very important feature was that the determination of the compulsory selling price which might be made applicable to a transaction between a producer and a diamond cutter was based on the current market selling price. That, I take it, was the London market selling price, from which a deduction for selling expenses was made to the extent of per cent. Now the Minister departs from that, and goes on the basis of the price obtained by the producer. I take it that, seeing that the usual purchases of diamonds outside South Africa would be outside the Minister&#x2019;s jurisdiction, the application of this Act will be confined to sales as between producer and diamond cutter. The Minister will remember, if you come to consider what the price obtained by the producer is, that it is arrived at on an average basis per carat. I ask the Minister how is he going to apply that to a single stone transaction? He will find himself in this difficulty, that he must apply to a single stone transaction the average price determined over sales of parcels sold over a period of at least three months, a price which can have no relation to the value of a stone picked out by a statutory purchaser, and which might be perhaps the best stone of a parcel. I cannot understand how the Minister proposes to get over the difficulty. In the 1919 Act the Minister has power how to settle disputes.</p>

<p>The basis is entirely wrong. The Act contemplates, not that you should fix prices stone by stone, but on the basis of an average price obtained by the producer. We will see whether the Minister finds it as easy as the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) thinks. Under the 1919 Act there was applied the provisions of the Cost of Living Commission Act, 1918, with regard to the observance of secrecy ; even the members of the board are bound to observe secrecy. Once you alter the basis of price from current market price to the prices obtained by the producer, and you allow the statutory purchaser to dispute what the price should be, then there must follow a disclosure as to what the producer is obtaining for his stones that he may sell elsewhere. The Minister under the Act must lay down the basis on which such a dispute can be determined. The cutter will press for information as to what is the actual basis of the prices obtained by the producer, and can in that way ascertain exactly the basis upon which the whole of his diamonds may have been realized by all the producers, and not the producer with whom he was dealing. This principle of allowing indiscriminate reference to the books of any particular producer or industry seems to me wrong, for how will the Minister prevent information of this kind beng broadcast? Unless there is a very clear and definite answer to these points, they seem to me to be good reason why this Bill should stand over for further consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down seems to be very sensitive to the remarks made by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay), and is one of the apostles of Mr. A. Brink. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) gave us some historical information of which the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter) does not seem to be aware. The diamond industry is the peculiar home of the Jew. I was stating that the whole diamond industry has fallen into the hands of the people known as the Jews for historical reasons, and the report quoted by the hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay) gives the reason. That is what the hon. member was referring to and the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) would not have found it so attractive, but for that reason, and the thing we have to fight to-day is the inroad that this historical fact has made in the settlement of the diamond-cutting industry in those countries mentioned in this report. I agree that the difficulty we have to-day is for the Government to get to the root of that industry. The hon. member for Kimberley, with the voice of the charmer, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since I have had the control of the South African diamonds.</block>

<p>And he incidentally said that that control amounted to £40,000,000 for five years. The control of the Diamond Syndicate is what he was referring to. The whole conflict of opinion in this House arises from that fact that the hon. member for Kimberley, in his position as <span class="col_4693-4694" refersTo="page_1300"/>controller of that industry, is making the whole of the profit of the syndicate on one side, while we want to see South Africa benefit by the shifting of the whole cutting industry to South Africa. And I agree with the hon. member for Pretoria (West) that unless we can shift the whole diamond cutting industry here, the Bill is virtually tinkering with the matter. The hon. member for Pretoria West has told us that the original Bill put forward was a Bill for the prevention of the diamond-cutting in this country. The clauses which the late South African party put in were purposely put in knowing that the object of bringing the diamond-cutting industry to this country would be wrecked by the insertion of these clauses. I go so far&#x2014;although the hon. member for Kimberley has said something radical has been introduced in this Bill&#x2014;to say that the clauses which the Minister proposes to introduce will not succeed in bringing the diamond-cutting to this country. The Bill is simply tinkering with the bigger subject. We want something much more radical if we are to shift the ground from under the hon. member for Kimberley, and the strong position they are entrenched in. The hon. member said that the Government must look at the loss of revenue that will be entailed in this export tax, and that the Minister must remember that that £850,000 was possibly in danger if a diamond-cutting industry came to this country. But what the hon. member for Kimberley did not tell the Minister was that if the cutting industry were brought to this country, the whole of our diamond output would be enhanced to about double its present value, and that South Africa would be richer by that amount. The question at stake is whether we are going to introduce legislation to bring this cutting industry to South Africa, and the Minister has told us that there is a divergence of opinion over this question. The Minister told us that the producer is very much against the introduction, of the cutting industry&#x2014;of course he is&#x2014;and that the only other alternative is a State cutting industry. If the Minister is convinced that he is not going to shift these people from their ground and get a diamond cutting industry unless we have a State cutting industry, then for heaven&#x2019;s sake let us have that State cutting industry. But the ramifications which these people are surrounded with are so strong that I do not think the Minister is going to achieve his object by what be has put in this Bill. The measure taken by itself is full of good intentions, but the other side is out to see that these intentions are not fulfilled. The Minister dealt with the difficulties he had to cope with in that old Act, and which he is rectifying here. He said the most controversial subject was the taking of diamonds in series, and the hon. member for Kimberley told us that the National party, when in opposition, opposed this question. The hon. member for Kimberley loses sight of a large section of the producers namely the alluvial diggers, and if that is to be the only way in which we can save the cutting industry, then this question is not going to help us a bit. The question of series is just tinkering with it. It might assist the small cutter, but it is not going to help him to cut those diamonds as he expects to do. What I want to know from the Minister is why, in the amending Act, there is no provision made in regard to Clause 7 of the principal Act in regard to entering into agreements. The wording is so entrenched that the powers of the Minister to enter into agreements outside this Act are practically nil. I want to know from the Minister, seeing the overtures that have been made to the Government under this clause with a view to introducing a cutting industry on a large scale in this country, whether these negotiations have broken down ; whether absence or want of elasticity of the Minister has been the cause, or whether the Minister has not been satisfied that there has been an honest endeavour to bring cutting on a large scale to this country! We have from time to time been approached by people who have entered into negotiations with the Government, and after a large amount of trouble and expense, they have found it impossible to come to an agreement with the Government with regard to the introduction of this industry on a large scale. Does the Minister think it is futile trying to amend the Act ? Does he think the Act does not want amendment or does he think there has been no serious attempt made to have negotiations on a big scale in terms of the Act as laid down here ? The hon. member for Kimberley said that the object of this Bill was to bring the industry to South Africa and that he was afraid that we would not achieve that object. He based his whole argument on how detrimental it was going to be to the industry as established in Europe at the present time. In other words he looked at the matter from the foreign point of view and of maintaining the cutting in Europe where it is at present. He put forward all the difficulties and ramifications of the trade, and all the delicate handling and manipulation of the trade as arguments against its being brought here and said that we would disturb that delicate arrangement if the trade were brought here ; but let me point out that this is the very object that this Bill is aiming at, and which I think it is not going to achieve, and so far as I can see will never be achieved under this Bill. The hon. member has pleaded for the European industry. If there is one man who is in a position to assist in bringing a diamond cutting industry to South Africa it is the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer), but we have not heard one word from him in praise of the measure, nor has he told us that he is prepared to bring the industry here. Instead of that he has been pleading the whole of the time for the European cutter against the South African cutter. He says that the ramifications of the trade are so big that if we tamper with it the whole structure may topple over. That is exactly what South Africa wants, so as to bring the industry here, and it would be very fortunate for South Africa if we could have, not only the cutting trade, but the attendant trades out here, so that we should have a thrifty and industrious population which would be a tremendous asset to us, so that South Africa should be the diamond centre and not Amsterdam, London or New York. The hon. member&#x2019;s argument is against <span class="col_4695-4696" refersTo="page_1301"/>the series question, the result of which he says would be that the mines would suffer tremendous hardship and loss. If that were sound the hon. member might have suggested that the producers themselves would start cutting here, and I would remind him that the hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris) told us on the eve of an election that De Beers were going to bring 2,000 cutters to South Africa. Where are they ? There is one other question I would like to ask, and that is in regard to the appointment of the board. The idea of the 1919 Act was that the Minister should be assisted by a technical board, whose functions were definitely set out in the Act, the suggestion being that the board would be in a position to assist the Government. I asked a question on this subject on March 16th last, and the question and the reply will be found in &#x201C;Hansard.&#x201D; Does the Minister think the board was that intended to be established under the Act, or should it be a board of technical people who could advise the Minister in regard to the progress of the diamond-cutting industry ? It really depends on the board whether the industry makes progress or not. The board has never been able to give the Government any valuable assistance ; at all events, I have never seen any report by the board, nor has it made any suggestions as to the future policy of the Government in regard to this matter. If the Minister had carried out the spirit of the Act and had a really competent board to advise him, there would not have been these impressions in the country in regard to the Government&#x2019;s intentions. People are under the impression that the Government has fallen under the sway of the hon. member for Kimberley and his friends, and that the Government has no honest intention to bring the Act to fruition. I hope that impression is wrong and that the Minister will assist us in getting rid of that impression, but the only way to do that is to see that the industry is brought here, and that the benefits of that industry will be reaped by South Africa.</p>

<p>Before you put the amendments, Mr. Speaker, I would like to address a few words still to the Minister of Railways and Harbours to accept the amendment which I have on the paper, and which is entirely in support of the co-operative spirit that exists in the present shipping control board, and which we are all very anxious and the fruit farmers are anxious to see.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>I will refer to that a little later, because I understand that not alone hon. members opposite, but the Minister of Railways, has made the same statement. I would like, in support of the amendment and the necessity of maintaining the co-operative spirit, to be allowed to read to the House the reasoned views of the late Henry C. Wallace, secretary of agriculture to the United States. This was embodied in a communication to the president of the U.S.A., and published immediately following his death under the heading, &#x201C;Study of Co-operation in Agricultural America &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bills have been introduced into Congress in the last few years which will put the. Government squarely in the business of promoting co-operative associations. The relationship of Government to co-operation should be one of service. It should help the farmers to market their crops, just as it helos them to produce crops, not by doing the work, but by supplying information. To go further would be to injure rather than to aid the co-operative movement. The latter is absolutely necessary to bring about efficient and economical marketing and standardization of crops, but the movement should be truly co-operative. It should be controlled by its membership, and kept free from the domination of Government agencies or commercial interests.</block>

<p>Here we are to have Government domination, and I am not altogether certain that it is going to be free from commercial interests. What does Mr. Hoover say ?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government can but contribute through stimulation of and co-operation with voluntary forces in our national life, for we thus preserve the foundations upon which we have progressed so far.</block>

<p>Let me give you an even greater authority than the secretary for agriculture of the United States and Mr. Hoover&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Government have definitely decided that the membership of the board should be confined to growers, and that the fruit exchange should have a majority on that board. We must not lose sight of the fact that the fruit belongs to the growers. It is not the fruit of the Government, and it is not the fruit of any other body of persons.</block>

<p>This statement goes on further, replying to an interjection about diamonds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let me confine myself to a more profitable thing, and that is fruit, for I think that in the long run we are going to have far more benefit from the fruit industry in South Africa than from diamonds.</block>

<p>Then follow these passages&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The growers must take the responsibility for the shipment of their fruit. It seems <span class="col_4697-4698" refersTo="page_1302"/>to me that it would be wrong for the Government to step in and control the shipment of fruit. Hon. members will see in Clause 6 that the administration will not, nor the board, nor any officer, be responsible for any action that may be taken. The full responsibility will, of course, rest with the exchange. &#x2026; Clause 4 is undoubtedly one of the most important, if not the most important, in the whole Bill. We therein propose to give the right to make contracts with the shipping companies to the fruit exchange. As to giving the board of control greater powers, which hon. members opposite have advocated, they cannot have it both ways. The exchange would get the majority on the board, and that ought to satisfy hon. members.</block>

<p>Is it possible to add any words of mine which would impress upon the House the advisability of accepting the amendment which I have placed upon the paper, because the words I have just read fell eloquently from the Minister of Railways and Harbours when he introduced the Fruit Shipping Control Bill last year ; and I think even now, though he has refused to answer questions put to him several times during the various stages through which this Bill has passed, he should tell us what are the reasons and what are the influences that have actuated him to depart from the policy which he pleaded for in this House and another place one year ago. True, the eloquent words I have read were spoken in this House on the 16th April, 1925, and we are now, I believe, ah the 6th June, 1926. It would be very interesting to the House, to the country and to the fruit farmers to know the reason and the influences which have been at work that have caused my hon. friend to completely change his policy. I am sorry the hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Rood) is not here. He spoke on the previous stage of this Bill, and when my hon. friend, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz), said he was a small citrus grower in the Transvaal and was associated with the co-operative organization, the hon. gentleman (Mr. Rood), who represents that constituency, deliberately denied the statement which had been made by my hon. friend. The Minister of Railways seemed to support that proposal, and the Minister gave the committee to understand that the majority of co-operative organizations in the Transvaal were of the same opinion. We were then discussing the White River co-operative organization, where there are thousands of citrus trees planted. I was surprised to find this only this morning in looking through the &#x201C;Cape Times &#x201D;&#x2014;true, hon. members do not always take for granted contributions in the &#x201C;Cape Times &#x201D;&#x2014;and I will give the Minister an opportunity of denying whether he had not these resolutions in his pocket&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir,&#x2014;I beg to advise that at a meeting of members of my company (the White River Fruit Growers&#x2019; Co-operative Company, Ltd.) held to-day, it was unanimously agreed that the following message be telegraphed to the Minister of Railways and</block>

<p>What statement ?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>A statement practically supporting the hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Rood) that the majority of growers in the Transvaal were entirely in favour of this Bill. The Minister, in fair play, when he had that telegram in his pocket, should have disillusioned the hon. member for Barberton if he considered he had made a mistake. This is the resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this meeting of co-operative fruit growers, whilst approving of most of the provisions of the Perishable Export Control Bill, views with alarm the fact that the control of exporters&#x2019; produce is to be deliberately taken out of their own hands, vide sections (2) and (5). Sections (11) and (12) provide that producers, by means of a levy, shall pay all the expenses of the board, though producers shall not have a deciding voice as to how their own money shall be spent. We feel strongly that this Bill as at present drafted is a severe set-back to co-operation.</block>

<p>That has been my argument and the argument of members on this side from the first day this Bill was read a second time. Will the Minister listen ? This carries just as much the weight of the growers as any wire-pulling telegrams he has received. The resolution goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, therefore, urge the Government not to force this Bill upon the country, but to give producers through their co-operative exchanges the right to control their own products.</block>

<p>Is that not what we did when we urged the Minister to let the Bill go to a select committee ?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We would esteem it a favour if you would publish this in the next issue of your paper. I am, etc.&#x2014;Th. S. Edwards (for secretary), White River, May 29.</block>

<p>I read this to show that we on this side who have been accused of speaking for purposes of opposition and wire-pulling are not alone in contending it is a fatal mistake to depart from the principles of co-operation. When you have built up, with great difficulty, a fruit exchange which has roped in 95 per cent, of the citrus and deciduous exporters, it is an extremely wrong thing, by a step of this sort, to largely undermine that exchange, and to hinder the good work it is doing. It is in the interests of the fruit exchange, of co-operation, and of the producers of this country, that I even now appeal to my hon. friend to accept a resolution of this character, to place the control board in the hands of a majority of the fruit exchange, who represent the fruit growers. If <span class="col_4699-4700" refersTo="page_1303"/>the Minister will do that, then there will be no objection to the Bill going through its stages. If he is not prepared to do that, I maintain that to pass the Bill as it is at present will be striking a death-blow at cooperation, and will be the worst day&#x2019;s work you could possibly do for the fruit farmers of this country. There have been efforts overground and underground to undermine the fruit exchange. I am not going into the reasons for that, but I am extremely sorry to see that if this Bill goes through in the manner the Minister proposes, you will be undermining the fruit exchange and doing much to break up an organization which, if supported as it ought to be by the State, and allowed to flourish, will, within a reasonable time, represent in this country a fruit exchange which will be able to take its place alongside the Californian fruit exchange, which is an object lesson to co-operators throughout the world. I believe this exchange, with a little sympathy, would very soon be on an equally sound and stable basis. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-sections (2) and (3) and to substitute the following new sub-sections:</block>

<p>(2) The board shall consist of an independent chairman appointed by the Governor-General and six representative members, of whom two shall be representatives of the citrus fruit industry, two shall be representatives of the deciduous fruit industry and two shall be representatives of the egg and poultry industry, such representatives being in each case appointed by the central co-operative organization which controls or represents the particular industry concerned ; Provided that if at any time the Governor-General is satisfied that the quantity of any other kind of perishable product exported from the Union justifies the addition to the board of representatives of that kind of perishable product, he may call upon the central co-operative organization which controls or represents that particular product to appoint two representative members of the industry which produces or deals with the aforesaid perishable product to be members of the board, and upon such nomination being duly made the persons so nominated shall be and become additional members of the board. Such board shall sit as a full board when required for the common interests and in panels when the interests of any one or more industries are concerned.</p>

<p>(3) The chairman shall be appointed for such period and upon such conditions as the Governor-General may determine. The representative members shall each be appointed for a period of twelve months at a time.</p>

<p>I second. I want to say a few words in regard to the support which the Bill is said to have received. I have a telegram which says that the White River and Karino societies disapprove of the Bill. The Karino Society wired Mr. Rood to vote against the Bill, so that is very clear. Without doubt there are the largest number of trees at White River in the eastern part of the Transvaal. The hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Rood) was entirely wrong in quoting the support of that part of the world The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Roux) has also made a tremendous fuss about the support in his constituency. I was informed by a friend at lunch to-day that Mr. Sarembock is very strongly opposed to the Bill. It just shows that the information of my hon. friend about Ceres is absolutely wrong. I did not ask for the information ; it was given me quite gratuitously.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#roux">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>I said last time, and I say again, that the large majority of the fruit growers and exporters in my constituency are in favour of this section. That is, of the Government appointing three members of the board of control. I do not know why the names of my constituents should be mentioned here. I do not wish to discuss the respective merits of my constituents. Every fruit grower at Ceres, who has considered it worth his while to communicate with me is in favour of this provision. One large grower who exported 400 tons of fruit during last season, and who had 4,000 boxes in the &#x201C;Edda&#x201D; personally informed me that he was in favour of the three members being appointed by the Government. I telephoned to Mr. Sarembock and, unfortunately. I was informed that he was in Cape Town. I endeavoured to see him at his hotel, but I could not as he was out. He has not taken any steps to communicate his disapproval of this section to me. As regards the evidence given by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) that is hearsay, so he must not take it amiss from me if I say that on that kind of evidence I cannot change my attitude in this committee. That is evidence that would be ruled out in a court of law. I repeat, as far as the fruit growers of Ceres are concerned, a large majority of them are in favour of this. The small farmers are all satisfied that this is the best kind of control that they can get&#x2014;independent control.</p>

Let me tell him there are people who have no confidence in the representatives of the exchange on that board as it was constituted last year. I do not say they are justified. There are a number of people who have more confidence in a board appointed by the Government than in a board nominated by the exchange. It is said they have carried on in such a way that people are a little bit suspicious of them. There are rumours about the country. I have not been able to verify them.</p>

<p>The impression all this makes on me is that the Minister is not in touch with the fruit growers of this country. During the all-night sitting we said that the fruit growers did not know what is going on, and here we find out that prominent fruit growers have to wait until the &#x201C;Star&#x201D; comes to hand through the post to see what is going on. They have not been consulted by the Government. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Roux) tells us that there are sinister rumours about that this board has not the confidence of the country. I see a leading article in &#x201C;Die Burger&#x201D; states that the strongest opposition comes from a small group of Western Province fruit growers. Is this correct from the information we have had from the hon. member foi Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), and this telegram?

We hear rumours that the interests of a certain big financier have been considered. &#x201C;Die Burger&#x201D; must not come to us for an answer, but go to the Pact Government. So it comes to this&#x2014;it is pretty plain, and must be to the country&#x2014;that the Minister is forcing through the Bill without having got into touch with a large number of the fruit-growing interests, and dead against the wishes of a large number of the fruit growers.

The hon. member for Ceres has made a great point about the want of confidence of the small grower in the fruit exchange. I wonder if the hon. member has pointed out to the small fruit growers that, at any rate, they can get rid of the executive of the fruit exchange if they continue to be incompetent, but as regards the board which is instituted under Clause 1, there is no method by which these members can be moved by all the fruit growers, small or large. That is the real argument against having a board of this kind. The fruit growers at the present time have the control of their industry, and if they lose confidence in the executive of the exchange they can remove them. But in this case there is no method by which the control board, however great their faults, may be <span class="col_4703-4704" refersTo="page_1305"/>got rid of. I ask the Minister to reconsider Clause 1. If he accepts the amendment of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) he puts himself in a very strong position. The fruit growers will then have control of their own industry, and if they make a mistake in asking for this control, the Minister can tell them that they have nobody to blame but themselves ; whereas if he adheres to his clause, they will have absolute justice in every complaint they make against his department, and it seems to me the height of absurdity for him to interfere with the property of these people. If the Minister were to accept this amendment, the Bill would go through without trouble. From a practical point of view, I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept an amendment like this, giving these people the right to control their own industry, It seems to me that in this House we are getting into the habit of passing very bureaucratic laws, taking individual rights from every section of the community, and we are now going to touch the result of a man&#x2019;s own labour.</p>

<p>When the Minister replies, I hope he will realize that the bulk of the objection to this Bill is concerned with Clause 1, and there is considerable anxiety and interest not to say curiosity, about the proposed personnel of this board. Undoubtedly, whether it is justifiable or not, there is a good deal of unrest throughout the country over this matter, and if the Minister is determined to put the Bill through in its present form, I think it is due to the public that he should announce in this House, before it goes through, who is to be chairman and who the members are to be of this board, and also the terms on which they are to be appointed ; their remuneration, and their period of office, and whether they are to be whole-time officers. I was unable to follow the remarks of the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Roux), but I think I am doing him no wrong when I say he allowed the House to believe that there was considerable dissatisfaction with this board.</p>

<p>I certainly gave it as very important information. The fact that a member of the Fruit Control Board and chairman of an important co-operative society expressed his views so definitely surely is of interest to the House. Let me deal with his next point, the position of growers in Barberton. I never referred to any particular telegram in the House. I have never given information to the House which I am not prepared to prove if necessary. I have never referred to the telegram received from Capt. Elphic. On the 25th May I received the following telegram from him in two capacities, as chairman of the South African Co-operative Produce Exchange, and chairman of the Barberton District Farmers&#x2019; Union&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hear with apprehension of opposition by Cape deciduous growers to proposal in Perishable Products Export Control Bill, that Government appoint three business men to assist with nominee of each interest concerned. As member of board of control to handle transport from centres to port of destination I consider this control essential. Appointment of business members should be on consideration of efficiency and qualification only which can be determined better by Government than by popular vote. I trust you will adhere to proposal.</block>

<p>I am going to adhere to the principles of the Bill. In regard to the statement of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) irresponsible as such statements usually are namely that certain influential interests are behind this Bill, he knows that he is making a statement he cannot prove, and not only that, but he knows that there is not a shadow of any reason for making that statement except in order, possibly, to make political capital. I have always stated to members opposite, if you have criticisms against the terms of the Bill I am prepared to discuss them on the merits. We have had valuable suggestions from the hon. member for Cape Town (Mr. Jagger) and I was glad to adopt some of them, but to say that the Bill is not in the interests of the fruit growers, or is not acceptable to the vast majority of the fruit growers), is to make a statement which is not borne out by the facts. I cannot possibly accept the amendment.</p>

Having asked the House to consent to sit on mornings, they kept us until 6 o&#x2019;clock on the morning of the following day. If the House sits after 11 p. m. and the leader of the Opposition asks him (the Prime Minister), he does not feel himself justified in sitting the next morning. The Minister must remember that it is perfectly true there was considerable discussion, but this was due to the fact that while the morning sittings were called to deal with absolutely necessary measures, the Government introduced two or three contentious Bills, and we are not going to do our duty and discuss them thoroughly when also having morning sittings. If my hon. friend talks about proroguing to-morrow, it is no use going on.</p>

<p>I think that we as a party, are very keen on seeing this particular Bill through, and as the hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) said, it is an important Bill, but the Government has shown very little conception of that fact. On what the Government thought was to be the last day of the session, they bring forward an extremely important Bill, which, as it affects the daily lives of thousands of citizens, is as important as any Bill brought forward. There are no fewer than 13 pages of amendments on the Order Paper, and I ask you, how do you expect this House adequately to deal with an involved Bill like this, and one on which the Minister himself <span class="col_4711-4712" refersTo="page_1309"/>has tabled no fewer than eight pages of amendments ?</p>

The Government has shown a poor conception of its duties towards the interests of the settlers, bringing this Bill forward in a depleted House. There are many members who have settler constituents ; and at more than the eleventh hour this Bill is introduced. It is a Bill initiated by the South African party, and I protest against the way in which the Government has dealt with it&#x2014;it was read a second time about March, and the committee stage is in June&#x2014;surely that is a curious way of dealing with a Bill affecting something like 30,000 human beings.

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) is most unfeeling. All know of the unfortunate accident that occurred to the Minister. He is the last one to appeal for consideration in regard to that ; but we sympathize with him. He was away for some months, and had a very narrow escape from death, and we all appreciate the way in which he has stuck to his work. In regard to the Bill having been on since March, I can say that the Minister of Defence was taking the portfolio of the Minister of Mines and Industries, and when we asked him if he would bring on this Bill and other matters, he very fairly said it was very awkward indeed for him to press questions in the absence of the Minister of Mines. Under the circumstances, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) might show a little kindlier feeling and be more generous to the Minister. It is overstepping the bounds of courtesy for a gentleman of his position, a former Minister, and it is up to us to say that we appreciate what the Minister has done under very difficult circumstances indeed, and hon. members of the Opposition might show their appreciation also by doing their best to push this measure through this session.</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;shall &#x201D;, in line 25, to the end of the clause and to substitute &#x201C;be entitled to such mineral rights over said land as the full owner of private land may be entitled to in terms of the mineral laws in force in the province in which the land is situate.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The effect of the clause is that Government settlers on Crown land shall be placed in exactly the same position in regard to minerals as any ordinary landowner in the country. I wish to confine my remarks more particularly to the Transvaal, where the bulk of the settlers are, and where greater mineral development has taken place. Up to 1923, practically every farm alienated by the Government was given out, plus mineral rights. Nothing was withheld.</p>

<p>My objection to Clause 2 is that it does not go far enough. I was referring to the Transvaal, and I would say that it was only in Lord Milner&#x2019;s time that this innovation was introduced, that land should henceforth be given out ex mineral rights. The result, in my opinion, is that the Government in retaining the mineral rights, is merely holding back a very negligible asset ; and will retard mineral development which, I think, will best take place as the result of private enterprise. Most of the mineral development of the Transvaal has come about owing to the fact that the mineral rights went with the ground. Clause 2 recognizes the fact that there is an anomaly, and that Government should at least have something of these mineral rights. That is the origin of the whole Bill.</p>

<p>I agree with you, and the settlers will be very grateful, but it is not enough. Why should a man, who took up land prior to 1903, get full mineral rights, and a settler receive less than his richer neighbour ? There is no reason why we should not put these men on exactly the same footing as other owners. It will do the Government no harm, but it will tend to promote mineral development. Another reason for the amendment is that it would simplify matters in respect of the mineral lands in the different provinces. The Minister has tabled a number of amendments which are intended to bring that into effect.</p>

<p>The Mines Department pointed out the very difficulties the Minister has since seen and has tabled amendments upon.

<block name="quote">Why give away anything belonging to the Government ?</block>

<p>My answer is that Government is not surrendering anything worth while. In the first place the Government has surrendered to the public by far the greater amount of the mineral rights and by giving these few remaining mineral rights to settlers, the Government will not be surrendering anything tangible. The Government&#x2019;s interest in mineral development is the added wealth, population and development which follow the discovery and working of minerals, and the Government can secure these advantages for more effectively by handing over the mineral rights to the public than by keeping them locked up. The Government has given a very valuable concession, but I say it is a pity to spoil the ship for a ha&#x2019;pporth of tar. If that is not done, the settler will be left with the grievance that he has been differentiated against.</p>

<from><span class="col_4715-4716" refersTo="page_1311"/>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>I don&#x2019;t know. I am not concerned with the ruling just now. We are asking the Government to remunerate the settler on settlement ground for the mineral development on his ground. Since 1903 a distinction has been drawn between settlement ground and private ground in the different provinces. Subsequently, ground which has been bought for settlement has been given out with full mineral rights. If this Bill goes through as it is now, we are creating a very difficult and involved Act to deal with a small class of people in a very restricted way. The Bill lays down for the settlers that, the minerals being reserved to the Crown, the Government now will allow them certain remuneration for the development of those minerals, but it is also laid down under the Settlement Ordinance that Agriculture, which has priority prevents any inroad by mineral development. The principle, however, is that as long as a man wants to farm, no mining development is going to interfere with his farming project. What the settler says to-day is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If I am farming, I want to farm and if there is any mineral development on my ground, before I give up the position which the law at the present time places me in, I must consent to it. That is the Magna Charta which the settler has held in the past, that, unless he agrees to any prospecting, nobody can go and prospect on his farm. Now the Minister finds that for the purposes of development it is necessary to get a great deal of that settlement ground. Where we are at variance with the Minister is simply as to the class of remuneration which the settler is going to get for departing from that position which he is in. We are now proposing to give him some remuneration. The settler says&#x2014;</block>

<p>I am prepared to recede from the position as far as the agricultural part of my holding is concerned, provided I am put in a position to continue my settlement somewhere else. This is highly necessary because in the Transvaal when proclamation takes place all surface rights become defunct and the whole of the rights accrue to the mineral owner. According to the Transvaal law, the mineral owner then steps in. The Government proposes to remunerate the settler for having consented to allow discovery to take place, in Clauses 7 and 8, not as an individual holder of private land is dealt with in every other province, but to give him a mining lease. That lease shall be laid down on the following conditions: (1) that the Mining Leases Board shall determine what area of that land is going to be and (2) it she determine what royalty you are going to pay to the Government for that particular lease. In granting stretches of country to settlers where settlement hitherto had not taken place, the Government did not attach any importance as far as the minerals were concerned. Under the Cape Act there is no provision made for base metals at all. Under the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment the settler in the Cape Province will receive no remuneration for base metals.</p>

<speech by="#munnik">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>No, because no provision is made in the Cape in regard to base metals. On the question of base metals, it may be argued that the State is surrendering something of value to them and they are getting no consideration for it. The attitude taken up by all Governments in the past has been to give the private owner one-fifth and the balance accrues to the State. That shows us that the State considers that it is necessary for the owner to open up that ground so that the State shall immediately come into possession of four-fifths of the mineral wealth. In regard to base metals in the Transvaal, it has been laid down that the benefit that accrues to the State from the development of base metals is quite sufficient to compensate the State in an indirect way rather than the State should take anything from it. The Government has always been prepared to take its revenue indirectly from the development of base metals. In the case of the Cape it has not been thought necessary to differentiate as far as base metals are concerned. I would like to ask the Minister whether he won&#x2019;t consider&#x2014;because the difference is so small and the benefits that are going to accrue to the State are so great&#x2014;the advisability of altering the system of remuneration to the settler from this question of the lease which they propose to substitute&#x2014;[Time limit.]</p>

Under those circumstances I would like the Minister to understand that sooner than wreck this Bill I would accept Clause 6 as it stands. At any rate, it is better for the settler to take the very substantial concession he is getting under Clause 6 than to get nothing at all. I see the Minister has an amendment on Clause 6. I presume as the Governor-General&#x2019;s consent has not been obtained to this it is also out of order, and also a great many of the other amendments. It is a very awkward position.

<p>I think it was unnecessary.

It was on that assumption that the law of 1903 was introduced. I do not hold that view. I hold the State derives very little benefit frem reserving mineral rights ; I believe mineral rights ought to be individualized instead of socialized. If I cannot put my amendment I hope the Minister will <span class="col_4717-4718" refersTo="page_1312"/>simply put the Bill through as it stands, but I ask him to give us some undertaking as to how he looks on our amendments and whether he is prepared to introduce amplifying amendments next year and give us what we want.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person></from>

<p>What people are concerned about largely is that under section 2 exclusive rights for prospecting are given to the owner. I, with others, am concerned with having a wider opportunity for prospecting in this country. The Minister of Defence, I think, stated that this clause would really and effectively open up a large area of land which otherwise would not be prospected at all. Under those circumstances, of course, one would not object, and I think the Minister said he purposed bringing forward a much wider prospecting law, which we should have in this land of very great mineral wealth. I hoped the Bill would have been brought forward at the same time that other Bills dealing with mineral rights were brought forward. I hope the Minister has not lost sight of the necessity for extending opportunities for prospecting. I would just like to read portions of a letter from a very prominent prospector, one of the most successful in the country, dealing with this question under consideration. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The result may be the grounds becoming wholly possessed by combines, and there may be notices warning trespassers that they are liable to prosecution&#x2026; My opinion is that all Government lands should never have been withdrawn from prospecting and that discovery grants should have been made more attractive and prospectors encouraged financially&#x2026; In comparison, the Rhodesian prospecting laws have resulted in progress all along the line in all branches.</block>

<p>These are the remarks of a prominent prospector who is on the side of throwing open prospecting as far as possible. I am rather concerned in that Government appear to have now made it more limited and restrictive. I suppose there is no way out of the present position with the settlements, but it is regrettable ; and I hope the Minister will remember that we are looking forward to his promise being kept, and that at an early date. The people are expecting it, and prospectors deserve every encouragement in view of the good work they have done for the country in the past.</p>

<p>Will I be in order to move to omit the proviso? I want to know on what principle we are going with the bond holder who has to get special notice from the owner of the property. Surely the bond holder, as bond holder, has all the security and protection he requires, and why should we hamper the owner of this before he can allow any prospecting? What has the bond-holder got to do with the prospecting, and to exercise this restrictively gripping right condition? It is <span class="col_4719-4720" refersTo="page_1313"/>one of those vexatious little restrictions which appears unnecessary, and I hope the Minister will consent to the cancellation of the proviso.

<p>The answer to the objection raised by the hon. member is that you have to do with a peculiar state of affairs under this Bill. Unless you make these provisions, if the Government resumes the land held or occupied by a settler, the State is bound to compensate. If the settler under this Bill gets a prospecting licence he has waived the right to compensation, and that right of waiving intimately concerns the mortgagee.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member realizes that the settler has the full right to that land, and under the Land Settlement Act, it is provided that no permit shall be issued unless the applicant satisfies the issuing officer that he has given security to the lessee for all claims for compensation. Under the Land Settlement Act, the lessee has to come to an agreement with any prospector, and that in the past has held up the whole of the prospecting on Crown lands. This proposes to give the lessee the sole right of prospecting. It is only natural, if he has a bond on that farm, that he should get the authority of the bondholder.</p>

<speech by="#thomas_watt">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS WATT</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the committee will bear with me for a few minutes while I explain this matter. It affects land owners in Natal especially, and is rather complicated. Up till about 1893 most of the land sold in Natal by the Government was sold cum mineral rights&#x2014;without reservation. After that all the land sold contained a reservation on behalf of the Government of all the minerals. An Act was passed by the Natal Parliament in 1899, which laid down, among other things, that no prospecting licence could be issued without the consent of the owner of the land, and the owner of the land might also obtain other rights in terms of the Act. The Natal Mines Act of 1899, section 45, provides that no person, other than the owner, shall be allowed to prospect on private lands unless with the consent of such owner as as hereinafter provided. Section 59 says no person other than the owner shall be allowed to prospect or mine on the land of the said owner, or to mine coal, limestone and certain other base minerals. These two clauses were read by the owners of land, the minerals of which are reserved, to give them a right to prospect for coal and other minerals, notwithstanding the fact that section 60 says that nothing in the Act relating to private lands shall affect the rights of the Crown. These provisions were very contradictory. The Government of the day in Natal&#x2014;and I am speaking of matters with which I had to deal&#x2014;waived any rights it had and allowed the land owner to lease the base minerals to any company willing to develop them. There was, however, no actual waiver, but the Government sat still. The reason was that Government felt that it could not develop the minerals themselves, so it was better that someone should do it. A large number of leases were entered into, and the matter went on for a number of years. Then in 1912 the Union Government looked into the matter, and for the first time laid claim to the minerals and required, I think quite rightly, the companies which work them to take out licences. The licences were taken out for all land worked for coal. The companies not only paid a royalty to the land owners, but licences to the Government. Nothing was said about the question of the rights of the owners until two companies fell out. One of them happened to be the owner of the surface rights, and the other company was the owner of the mineral rights of which it had a lease and also had licences from the Government. The latter company failed to pay rent to the former, and the company which regarded itself as the lessor sued the other company for cancellation of the lease and licences issued by the Government. The case was decided last year, the court holding that for soveral reasons the lessee company was under no obligation to obtain the consent of the owner to obtain licences to carry on mining operations. The court held that Government having reserved the minerals had full power to issue licences, and that the company should get the licences from the Government and thus ignore the owner. That decision gave rise to a very great deal of concern in the minds of many people who have settled on land in Natal, the mineral rights of which are reserved to the Government. This Bill confers very full and fair rights on the surface owners, because it gives power to them to prospect for minerals and to the Government to give them discoverers&#x2019; claims and mineral leases. That, however, refers to the future. Nothing is said in the Bill in defence of the rights which have been supposed to exist in Natal for almost 30 years, and consequently there is a great deal of uneasiness on the part of owners and people interested in coal mining companies. Last year I was in communication with some of the companies and owners, and they practically agreed that if a certain clause would be inserted in the Bill to protect their rights that would be all that was required. During the early part of the session, the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) put this amendment on the paper. Unless something is done to protect the interests of the land owners who have already anticipated the Bill, and who imagine that they have certain claims on the coal companies, it would be quite possible for a company to say to the land owner that, although it had a lease from him, it was under no obligation to pay any rent or royalty to him, and that it would simply take out a Government licence.</p>

<p>Not definitely because the sole point which was decided was the right of a company to carry on mining operations, <span class="col_4723-4724" refersTo="page_1315"/>it having taken out licences, but it naturally follows that if a company chooses to ignore a lease with the land owner and fails to pay the rent, the land owner will be in the position that he has leased something which belongs to the Government.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS WATT</person>:</from>

<p>I very much doubt it. But why give these people the possibility of having to face a law suit ? The greater number of them own from 1,000 to 1,500 acres of land, and if a coal mine is started in the centre of a farm the latter is useless for farming purposes, and the farmer looks for the royalty from the coal mine as a return on his capital. I hope the Minister will meet the point by making some provision to cover it. I do think, however, that these people who have already parted with the minerals, should be at any rate, in as good a position as a man who may part with them under this Bill. If there are two men alongside each other who have land the mineral rights of which are reserved by Government, one of them may have done nothing at all upon his farm, but coal or some other mineral may be found there and, under this Bill, he will have the sole right to prospect, he will have the discoverer&#x2019;s rights, and he will have the right to enter into a lease subject to the provisions of this Bill. His friend next door, who may have land on which coal was discovered, we will say, ten or fifteen years ago, and which is being developed by a company under a lease which they have obtained from him, will have no rights under this Bill at all. I say it is the duty of this committee to protect that man. The only object which the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) and I have in this matter is to protect those people who in good faith entered into leases with coal mining companies, and who for years have been receiving rents and royalties from the coal mining companies, but whose position will be jeopardized by the passing of this Bill. Under this decision which was given last year it was (clearly proved that they have no right to lease the coal or to take any action. [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I think I appreciate all the points that the hon. member (Sir Thomas Watt) wishes to urge. In fact, as he has stated, he has approached me privately and so has the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel). The position is simply this, owing to a misapprehension owners&#x2014;and when I speak of owners I mean people occupying land the mineral rights of which were reserved to the Crown&#x2014; have received high rentals from the collieries. Leases have been entered into and these rentals have been received under an entire misapprehension of the law. The misapprehension was on both sides, the lessors being under the impression that the lessees could not mine at all under the existing laws of Natal, unless they had these leases. Afterwards it turned out in this case in the Provincial Division in Natal that the lessees were not all dependent on a lease and that if they got a licence from the Government they could mine the coal. Under the Act referred to by the hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt) the owner in the sense that I have used the words, is entitled to four claims. That is his preferent right. The claims in Natal are very large ones, equal to about 100 acres. Where the lessee has stepped in and started mining and got a licence, he could only have done so after the owner has waived his right to these preferent claims. The lessors have been receiving these rentals all these years which amounted to a considerable sum in many cases owing to this misapprehension, a misapprehension shared by the lessees. In other words, the lessees have entered into leases and paid rentals in error of law and, therefore, if there is still a lease running for 10 years the lessee, however unfortunate his position may be, is, in spite of that judgment, still bound to pay the rent, because it was equally open to him to ascertain his legal position as it was open to the lessor to ascertain his. Now the hon. member for Dundee and the hon. member for Newcastle come and want us to introduce in this Bill, with which this question has really nothing to do, nor has the Bill anything to do with this question, a provision whereby we interfere with contractual rights and by which we legalize an error of law and a misapprehension due entirely to the parties.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_watt">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS WATT</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to the Minister&#x2019;s statement that under the Natal Act the owner could get a certain number of claims, it is quite true that under the Act he could, but he has given away his rights and these mining companies have already obtained licences for all the coal-bearing ground on the farm. It is not fair under these circumstances to say that the man who has already dealt with his minerals shall not be put in a worse position than the man who has not dealt with them? I think that the Minister is rather misapprehending the effect of this decision of the court. The head-note of the judgment says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where the crown has made a grant of land reserving dominium in the minerals, and the right to mine them and remove the same, rights so reserved are recognized by the Mines Act of 1899. The Crown, in the exercise thereof, may grant a valid title thereto to a licensee, without the consent of the owner of the land.</block>

<p>Here under the Bill the consent of the owner is required. If I have not dealt with my lands at all, I am the sole person who has the right to prospect for minerals, but if I have dealt with my lands before, I am to have no <span class="col_4725-4726" refersTo="page_1316"/>right at all under this Bill, and, as far as I can see, following the judgment of the court, the coal mining company which is developing my land may ignore me entirely, pay me nothing at all and obtain a licence from the Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out that where the hon. member refers to section 59 of this Natal Act, in which are the words &#x201C;except with the written consent of the owner,&#x201D; this section was interpreted by the court in that very case a no it was held not to apply to a person on whose ground the mineral rights were reserved to the Crown. In the immediately following section it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing in the preceding section or in this Act contained relative to private lands shall, in any way affect or lessen the rights of the Crown, whether declared in this Act or any document or title or otherwise.</block>

<p>The court dealt with the construction of these two sections.</p>

<p>Yes, but read Section 45.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I am pointing out what the court said with regard to these two sections. It is clear that Clause 60 overrides by its express terms any conflicting provision in 59. The hon. member refers me to 45&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person other than the owner shall be allowed to prospect on private land except with the consent of the owner or as hereinafter provided.</block>

<p>That is just my point. The court held that the expression &#x201C;private land&#x201D; in 59, and presumably in 45, did not cover the case of a person the mineral rights on whose ground were reserved to the Crown.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member will not press his amendment, because if he refers to section 28 of the gold law (Act 35 of 1908), he will find that you have the same right with the full owner, and why should you support a part owner being put in a more favourable position than an owner?</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>I want to give my reasons for voting against the clause. The provisions are directly in conflict with the mineral law, notwithstanding what the Minister has stated with regard to the law of 1908. It has always been a cardinal principle that no entry could be made on private land by any trespasser to get the land proclaimed. What we have to make our minds up on is this&#x2014;whether any owner of agricultural land which has been given out for settlement purposes is going to be subjected at any time to the Government taking the right of proclaiming that ground over his head. I do not think the Minister is wise in introducing this clause as far as settlement ground is concerned. We want to give every encouragement possible to the settler, and if a settler does not want to go on with the mineral development of his ground, but go on with its agricultural development, and you introduce this, you are striking a serious blow at settlement. Our settlement is taking place in that portion of the country where it is difficult to get settlers, in the unhealthy districts of Natal, and the northern territories.</p>

<p>As an amendment to the amendment moved by the Minister on this clause, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To insert the following new paragraph to follow sub-paragraph (iv) of paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of new section 98:</block>

<block name="quote">(v) to any co-operative trading society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1922, or any amendment thereof, and of which such employee is a member, or</block>

<p>I would like to refute some of the arguments that have been used by hon. members on this question, and especially some of the arguments used by my hon. friends on the cross-benches. One of my hon. friends on the cross-benches the other evening, while being perfectly fair in many respects in his criticism of my case, made a statement to the effect that one of his reasons for being against it was that a man&#x2019;s wife might run into debt owing to the stop order system. If a man is dealing with any outside trader in any town in South Africa, if his wife wants to run into debt, she can do so, and she can run him into debt. I do not object to criticism of the principle for which I am contending, but I do object to anything in the nature of misresentation, or anything which is intended to bolster up a case against this organization by quoting examples which are applicable to any course of trading in the Union. We heard a great deal about the way in which the co-operative movement in England has been built up, but I claim that it is no use making any comparison between the co-operative movement in South Africa and the co-operative movement in England. On the Rand we find it very difficult indeed to build up a co-operative society on the ordinary principles of co-operation, owing to the shifting character of the population. We have a shifting population from Randfontein to Springs. Another statement was that if the co-operative society depended on the stop order, it would be disastrous if the employer were to take away the facilities. The facilities being granted there are facilities granted by many other employers in South Africa, including the Government itself and the municipal councils. The hon. member said that the principle of no stoppages of wages must be retained. If that were the object of this Bill, we would have no complaint, but the principle of no stoppages whatever from a man&#x2019;s salary or wages is not maintained by this Bill. This Bill lays it down that certain stop orders are to be recognized. I cannot understand the attitude of the Minister and other members, when they say that they are opposed to stop orders, and that every man must be paid his wages in coin of the realm. Then another argument brought in is in regard to the payment of insurance premiums for the police force by means of stop orders. I believe the tendency to lapse is just as great and even greater outside the stop orders than it is with the stop orders. Then we come to the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. McMenamin) when he spoke about easy credit. One of the ruinations of the people in South Africa is the system of credit. Men compete with one another to get names on their books for credit. I know of instances where men earning 15s. or 16s. a shift have been pressed to buy a hundred and fifty guinea piano. Again I say they are building up their case on misrepresentation. There is no more easy credit there than with other traders, and not as much. These men can prove definitely that they have drawn the attention of the representatives of the organization when they think they are likely to overstep the mark. When the hon. member makes the statement that there has been considerable overbuying in connection with the East Rand Co-operative Society, then I say he has not sufficiently investigated the case. Then the hon. member for Boksburg says that the stop order should be allowed for sick benefit societies. If that principle is right, I say the men are equally entitled to have the stop order system for the purpose of supplying them with food, clothing and shelter to prevent them from becoming sick. There is no difference in the principle. The same hon. gentleman went on to say that these co-operative societies do not worry how much the men have left. The facts in connection with the East Rand Co-operative Society are entirely opposed to that statement. I say deliberately that statement is not founded on fact. Then he went on to do what I hardly thought he would do, and that was to produce a list of civil imprisonments in Boksburg, and he certainly conveyed the impression that these men had all been sued owing to their connection with the East Rand Co-operative Society. To my mind he conveyed the idea that they were all members of the society. When I asked to see the list it was the ordinary list of men sentenced to civil imprisonment during that month. It is entirely unfair of the hon. member to produce a list of that description, simply certifying that 28 or 30 men in such and such a month had had civil imprisonment orders made against them; and to try and nail that on to the society. In any other town you would get just as big a list in proportion. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Will the Minister explain one or two things in this amended clause? In paragraph 98 (1) (a), sub-section (1) it says &#x201C;in current coin of the Union.&#x201D; I do not quite follow that. In sub-section (2) intended to validate payment by cheque, or is it intended to be supplementary to (1) ? Then in paragraph (b) (2) that reads to me as a very extraordinary paragraph. Is it not quite sufficient to lay down the law as it is laid down, that a company shall not arrange to trade directly or indirectly with its employees, without going so far as to create an offence, and possibly to send a person to gaol for becoming surety for payment of a debt ? Much as I sympathize with some of the principles underlying this legislation it seems to me that this is going to almost fantastic lengths. The number of crimes made by this one section really becomes alarming. I ask the Minister to explain why sub-section (b) is really necessary.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. McMenamin) went on to make <span class="col_4735-4736" refersTo="page_1321"/>a statement that these men have no right to come to the House and ask for the system of stop orders to be legalized. They have not done so at all. They have asked the House not to single them out for differentiation. The mine worker is only asking to be treated like every other citizen in the country. He says, if the Government wishes to make stop orders illegal let them do it for every other citizen in the country, and they are prepared to accept that, but they say you have no right to single them out for special legislation. It is entirely unfair. The native on the mines has the very privilege they are denying the white man in the co-operation societies. The Minister is doing an absolute injustice to 800 men in the Boksburg constituency, and to a larger number than 800, because this society has proved by the departmental returns that it has been responsible for keeping down the cost of living to the community in that area.</p>

<p>Question?</p>

<speech by="#waterston">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSTON</person>:</from>

<p>There is no question about it, and if the hon. member paid a little more attention to Krugersdorp, and less to Boksburg, he and I would get on very well indeed. With all respect to him, he knows nothing whatever about the East Rand Cooperative Society. I say there is no question that this organization has been responsible for keeping down prices in that area, and has been of unbounded benefit to the men who are members of that society. Another argument brought against these people is that women are in the habit of getting loans from the co-operative society. I say that the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. Christie) when he made that statement had nothing to go on in connection with the East Rand Co-operative Society. Even if women were doing this, the argument is equally applicable to the private traders. The case put forward by the East Rand Co-operative Society is that the objection to their method of trading is raised by a few retailers only. It is the trader that is putting up the agitation against them, and when they say that I say it is absolutely correct. Then people come along and say that a certain number of traders have been driven out of business by the society. There is no case where proof can be brought forward that any man has been driven out of business owing to the operations of this organization. Even if it were so, I say the benefits to the community have outweighed any commercial man having disappeared in that area. The society employs 17 white men at a higher rate of wages than the ordinary trade union rate, and they are employing more men to-day than the whole of the commercial community in Cason Road have employed in the whole of their existence. I am speaking of Boksburg North. Boksburg for years has been struggling against Johannesburg in order to keep the trade in the hands of the commercial people of Boksburg. Frequently working men will tell you that they can pay their return fare to Johannesburg, pay for their meals, and save more than if they had stayed at the Reef town. In the Boksburg areas there is a gross turnover of approximately £5,000 a month, and if we were to spread this over the 80 retailers, it is only £63 per business, which means practically nothing to them at all.</p>

<p>I am rather anxious to get the measure through the House, so I am not going to follow the example of my colleague (Mr. Waterston) and discuss all the mazes of the Act. When I spoke the other evening I produced certified copies of the records of the magistrate&#x2019;s court of Boksburg, showing that 38 people had during the first four months of this year had civil imprisonment orders given against them, ranging from three days to three months. Being an official document it did not say where these men were employed, but in a covering letter from the Boksburg Chamber of Commerce I was informed that all these people were employees of the E.R.P.M., and connected with the co-operative stores. That statement bore out my argument that because of the easy credit of these co-operative stores and excessive buying quite a number of these workmen find themselves in difficulty&#x2014;and I have nothing to withdraw. In my view, it is very unfair trading, because this one concern has the guarantee of the stop order, and they do not confine their operations to the co-operative society but have their doors open to the ordinary public. My hon. friend in his eloquent argument did not meet the one salient point, that the society can easily get along without the stop orders. During the past few years this society has set aside reserve funds, and if it is all that is claimed for it, there is no necessity for stop orders to carry on its business. I look upon the stop order as the thin edge of the wedge for trading by the mines, for we know that <span class="col_4737-4738" refersTo="page_1322"/>once the mines take an interest in trading, all sorts of manipulation is resorted to in order to influence their men.</p>

<p>I did not hear much in favour of the worker in the speech of the last speaker. The argument is all in favour of the trading interests. I have never been able to understand the attitude of hon. members on those (Labour) benches on the stop orders. They seem to be afraid of some establishment of the truck system or of giving some privilege to the Chamber of Mines. There is no suspicion of a truck system in this case, nor can there be any suspicion against the Chamber of Mines. I think the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) has put up a very good case and I am going to vote for his amendment. It seems to me that the people who are working in the mines and who are the real producers of the wealth of the Band should have an opportunity of spending their wages in the best way possible.</p>

<p>Certainly. The traders on the Reef are owing their living to the purchases made from their stores by the people working on the mines. We are told that if this stop order system is allowed to continue they will be ruined, and so, in order to protect them the real producer of the wealth is to give them out of his earnings, an unnecessary livelihood. The worker is to be prevented from getting a fuller return for his efforts, because it is inimical to an already overcrowded distributing class. The workers on the Rand ought to be allowed to establish their own trading concerns if they want to do it.</p>

<p>The strongest point made by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston), in favour of the acceptance of his amendment, was, in my opinion, the fact that the principle of stop orders is already agreed to in this Bill, and if you are to allow employees on the mines to give a stop order to sick benefit societies, and to insurance societies for funeral expenses, it is far more important that you should permit of stop orders to societies that are carried on for the purpose of keeping the miners alive and well. The Co-operative Societies Act of 1922 was framed to encourage co-operation in South Africa&#x2014; especially co-operative trading societies. I know something of the considerable benefit cooperative societies have been to working people in Great Britain. The representatives of the East Rand Co-operative Society told us that if the stop order system is done away with, it will react detrimentally to their particular society. I am out to encourage co-operative trading societies in South Africa by every legitimate means and I will support the amendment of the hon. member for Brakpan.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>It was so. The beginning of these co-operative societies, the E.R.P.M., lay in the desire of trade unions upon the Rand to start these societies, round about the war time, to decrease the cost of living, and they were comparatively successful for a time. The majority of them failed. Only one or two were a success, one in Germiston and one on the Rand. They became branches of this society, which had ramifications throughout the country. Ultimately the Chamber of Mines came to their assistance with a loan of £50,000&#x2014;I am not <span class="col_4739-4740" refersTo="page_1323"/>dealing with this present one&#x2014;and they were bolstered up. Out of these co-operative societies emerged one or two societies, and one at East London, which purported to be a co-operative society under the Act, was really being run by one man. When the manager of the co-operative stores came down here and interviewed me, among others, in the endeavour to get support for the stop order system, I put the question, Can anyone join your society? He said no ; only those working on the mines &#x2014;on the E.R.P.M. My point is that it is not a real co-operative society, when it is engaged in that sort of work of distributing all that is required by the general public, if it is confined to one section of it. It is quite true from my own knowledge that the East Rand Co-operative Society will not allow men to overspend. There is a limit to the stop order allowed.</p>

It is limited to these men on the mines and nobody else is allowed to join, and that is where the true principle of co-operation is vitiated.

<p>I am afraid my hon. friend has not been of much assistance to the Minister who has introduced the Bill. I have been listening very attentively to hear the reasons why it is necessary to alter the existing state of affairs. Neither Minister has vouchsafed any information on that point, and when the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs waxed so eloquent about co-operation I was thinking of sending for a copy of the Co-operative Act of 1922, of which he has shown such extraordinary ignorance. Under that Act any seven or more persons can form a co-operative society, and any section of the people may form such societies. The essence of the co-operative trading system is that by the members paying cash the society is able to purchase its goods at wholesale prices. The Minister says that the amount of the men&#x2019;s purchases is limited. Is that not a good thing ? Is it not a good thing that people should be able to obtain their goods at reasonable prices ? Is it more necessary that men should be enabled to have a stop order, so as to pay their life insurance premium, or a stop order to enable them to provide food and clothing for their family ? The experience of the world is that in all walks of life there is always a certain proportion of people who, when they get their pay at the end of the month, are led to spend more than they ought before they have made provision for supplying for their family&#x2019;s needs.</p>

<p>I am sorry to disagree with the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) but it is quite evident that hon. members have been led astray. The question at issue is not whether co-operative stores should be started on the mines, for the Act recognizes that, but it prohibits mining employees dealing with stores run by the mines, that being an extension of the truck system. The Rand towns have grown up on the principle that trading in the vicinity of the mines should be on the basis of free competition. What is asked for now is the same subterfuge that has been tried by the mines in the past. The Committee on Trading on Mining Areas reported that we were well on the way to having a Kimberley location introduced on the Rand, and that the mining companies, having sold ground for townships, were now engaged in trading. Hon. members opposite should recognize that it is impossible for any Government to give a lien on wages on the assumption that the men are not able to control the spending of their own money. That is a direct reflection on the worker. The mine workers on the Rand are as thrifty as any community we have, and are perfectly able to control their own affairs without our putting this extra weapon into the hands of the mining companies. After the strike, the Chamber of Mines introduced a trading boncern in its native recruiting organization. If the proposal is agreed to, there would be nothing to prevent the gold mining companies issuing stop orders for their native employees, and within a very short time, we should have the Rand in the same position as Kimberley, where the stop order system is carried out to perfection. In that case, the goods are bought from friends of the company and the natives are allowed to buy on credit on condition that the amount of their purchases is deducted from their wages. The Minister is trying to turn the Rand into one big compound. The old Volksraad was very wise when it recognized that the duty of a mining company was to take out gold, and not to mess about with kaffir pipes and blankets. It is only recently that a demand has arisen for the co-operative societies to have a lien on the men&#x2019;s wages. We recognize that the individual must be assisted in co-operation as far as possible, and the Government is prepared to give every assistance to co-operation. All that the men on the mines require to do is to cooperate and to co-operate amongst themselves, provided that they rely upon themselves, free from any mine company.</p>

<speech by="#waterston">

<p>What grieves one in connection with this East Rand Co-operative Society and the workers employed on the mines banding themselves together to keep down the cost of living, and voluntarily signing a stop order on their own pay, is to hear such a mass of misrepresentation put forward when the matter is being discussed. The hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) said they should manage their own affairs. That is what the men ask for. They say that if they agree to sign a stop order on their own wages, why should they be singled out for differential treatment ? The hon. member behind me says that you cannot trust the mine companies. It is no use anybody in this House becoming so blinded by prejudice against the mine companies that he is prepared to do an injustice to the working classes in the sole interest of the commercial community. I challenge the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to produce one man in the whole of the Boksburg area who is prepared to swear that he has been forced, directly or indirectly, into joining this organization, or signing a stop order. The Minister has agreed to the principle of stop orders. He has admitted it in regard to insurance premiums. I cannot help feeling that an injustice is being done to the 800 members of this co-operative society. They produced evidence before the departmental committee proving that it practically meant life or death to these men to have the stop order. It is their own credit, and the merchants recognize that as cash. The aim of the commercial community behind this action of the Government is to kill them. Individually amongst the commercial community you find as good men as you will find anywhere, but when they act as a commercial community in connection with the maintenance of prices, etc., they have no consideration for the workers or anybody else. The East Rand Co-operative Society have to pay taxes and licences like other trading concerns. In 1925 they paid £262 in taxation. Their membership has increased in 12 months from 770 to 902. The amendment I have moved is to say that, in addition to the insurance companies, and the sick benefit societies, that the Minister is making provision for and in reference to which he has recognized the principle of the stop order, he should also recognize that principle in regard to &#x201C;any co-operative trading society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1922, or any amendment thereof, and of which such employee is a member.&#x201D; That man is just as much entitled to the privileges of the voluntary stop order system as any one working on the mines is entitled to the same privilege or a sick benefit society. One of the arguments used against the co-operative society is that it is confined to men on the mines. The sick benefit society is also confined to employees on the mines. It is not fair to single these men out and say they are responsible for this and that, when if evils can be proved against the society they can be proved against any business house in South Africa. In addition to other benefits which have accrued from membership of this organization, in 1926 these men divided among themselves £26,514 7s. That was their bonus &#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I have an amendment as an amendment to the one proposed by the Minister. My intention is to exempt recreation rooms or sporting clubs and refreshment rooms from stop order prohibition <span class="col_4743-4744" refersTo="page_1325"/>On the mines, in my district as well, there are refreshment rooms where the clerks in the office and the employees in the engine rooms come for coffee or tea, where they can get other refreshments and cigarettes, and where when off duty they can play dominoes, chess, draughts, and the like. The custom is that I.O.U.&#x2019;s are given for the small expenditure, the total of which is deducted at the end of the month from the salaries of the clerks and workmen. It seems to be an innocent practice, and although my amendment is in the same direction as that of the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) it is of less importance, and I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept it. All the objections to the stop order system cannot be made in this case. It is said that under the stop order system too much is purchased, out this surely does not hold in the case of coffee and tea. In the second place it has been argued that the stop order system is a certain means of control, so that the people are not quite free to spend as much as they like. It therefore prevents extravagance. A third point mentioned is that a man, e.g., buys boots in a shop under the stop order system and then sells them at another place for a smaller amount. These objections do not apply in the case of refreshment rooms, because these are only established for the convenience and pleasure of the employees who do not always have change in their pockets when they are going to work. I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I am against the stop order system for any purpose whatever, but it does not say that those who are against the principle of stop orders are necessarily against the principle of co-operation. Most of my life has been spent in the co-operative movement, but I have yet to find any community where there is a solitary co-operative society that has been built up on the stop order system. The societies with which I have been connected have been built up entirely upon the capital and thrift of the people. They not only encourage thrift, but inculcate the habit of dealing with their own business and a judicious apportionment of their money in various directions. Many of the mining companies have sold land to the traders, and have allowed them to invest money in that trade, and are now ruining these traders. That seems to me to be utterly unfair to any system of trading in this country, and it is not a principle that has built up the co-operative movement in other countries. I believe we are embarking on a dangerous principle by admitting the stop order system, and we are doing co-operation a great service by eliminating it.</p>

<p>It is a curious political point that finds the right hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) and the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) in one camp, and the hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) and myself in another. It was a revelation to the right hon. member for Fort Beaufort when the hon. member for Roodepoort (The Rev. Mr. Mullineux) told him the difference between these co-operative societies and the ordinary co-operative societies of which the right hon. member is so ardent a champion. The former compete with the merchants by getting hand-in-glove with the mines, and obtaining terms from them which the merchants cannot get. If merchants tender stop orders the mines will not honour them at the end of the month. So long as the mines discriminate, and accept stop orders from these co-operative societies, and not from the merchants, the dice are loaded in favour of these societies, which do not function legitimately as co-operative trading societies should function. If conditions like that were going to bring some of my right hon. friend&#x2019;s farmer friends to bankruptcy, he would quickly see their difficulties.

<p>I wish to say that I am not for a moment assuming any mala fides, either on the part of the mines or the co-operative societies. I have got to deal with the principle that has always been observed for the last 35 years on the Rand. One of the principles was the present section 98 of the gold law, and I do not say it simply because it is the law, but with my experience of the Rand, which I think is more than most hon. members present, I know it is a sound principle. This stop order <span class="col_4745-4746" refersTo="page_1326"/>system that has come into vogue, is a violation of the Act as it stands to-day&#x2014;and if it is not a violation of the letter of the law, it is a violation of the spirit of the law&#x2014;because the whole spirit of this provision all along has been that the wages or salary shall be handed over in coin, and that no deduction shall be made. What is the effect of the stop order? If the mine acts upon it, then, of course, a deduction is made. Another objection raised is that you must not stop this particular order unless you stop orders everywhere. Obviously, in a Bill like this, I cannot embody a clause doing that. It would be out of place. I am dealing with an amendment to the Gold Law. Another point is that on the Witwatersrand you have the very special problem, and from the earliest days it has been recognized that special legislation is necessary. I must say that the hon. member for Brakpan is a first-class booster. He has so boosted this society that they might very well do without this adventitious aid of stop orders. In the strike of 1922, one of the first things the shops of these co-operative societies did was to close down.</p>

<p>I go further. I have already referred to the letter of Mr. W. A. Martin, of Johannesburg, a man of standing and one of the most respected men in Johannesburg, but I want to point out that up to now, you have in this Bill almost literally taken over the suggestions of the Select Committee and the wording of the Bill marked A.B. 36/22, A.B. 23 in Clauses 24 to 29, and that Bill was prepared not by this Government, but by the Government of the right hon. member opposite, and he was in 1923 a member of that Government. The stop order is specifically forbidden in this Bill which we have copied. The stop order has always been in conflict with the letter of the law or the spirit of the law. In my speech on the second reading, I dealt with abuses that take place. I do not say they are general, but such abuses do occur, and whenever a man feels that he can get something by simply signing a piece of paper, he is more prone to spend his income than when he pays in hard cash. It is no argument that in Clause 6 I recognize the principle of the stop order by making an exception in favour of benefit socities and insurance companies. A man is not prone to waste his money on these, and there is a limitation at once to his temptation, if I might so put it. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston).</p>

<p>*Nor can I accept the amendment of the hon. member for Lydenburg (Mr. Nieuwenhuize).</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked me whether payment by cheque would be regarded as a contravention of section 98 (1) (a), sub-clause 1. I mentioned that at the second reading. That is the wording of the present Act, and nobody would ever dream or has ever dreamt during all these years, of prosecuting a company because they pay their manager or shift boss by cheque.</p>

<p>Nobody would interfere with that. We know the mischief which is aimed at by the Act, and that is sufficient. In regard to the other point raised by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that is only one of the implications set forth. It may be that provisions overlap slightly. The hon. member knows by experience, as a lawyer, that any language in the world is inadequate to express our thoughts. If he pays an employee direct or, in the case of illness, the person&#x2019;s duly authorized agent, then he is within the law. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) asked why I made no provision regarding any person becoming a surety for a person employed on a mine. That is already the law to-day, in section 98 (b). Abuses I have been told have occurred in connection with a lot of stop orders to natives, and it has occurred in connection with the N.R.C. stores. A native is paid in one room, and they go with their wages to an adjoining room, and there the compound manager sits with the stop orders and he at once asks them to pay the amount shown on these orders. Well, if that is not a flagrant violation of the letter of the law, it is a flagrant violation of the spirit, and that is why I have inserted the words,</p>

<p>who pays or procures the payment of a debt.</p>

<p>I think these are all improvements, but may I suggest to the Minister another small amendment in sub-section (3). There it is proposed that if a mine is closed for some reason or other an inquiry will be held by a commission appointed by the Governor-General which shall consist of three persons. There is no doubt that this whole clause is a very drastic one and may make people nervous and the position may become more serious in future, because we are approaching a time when we may expect mines to drop out and mines to close down because of ending their career. A commission merely of three persons might not be very suitable and might make investors in the mines nervous and I would suggest to the Minister that we alter this provision and, instead of providing that the commission shall consist of three persons <span class="col_4749-4750" refersTo="page_1328"/>appointed by the Governor-General we should make the Government Mining Engineer the chairman. I would, therefore, propose&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 44, to omit &#x201C;three&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;the Government Mining Engineer as chairman and two other &#x201D;.</block>

<p>The result would be that the Government Mining Engineer will always be one of these three and he will be the chairman. That would ensure that, whilst the Government has latitude about the other two persons, there will be somebody of great technical training. I think the Minister will agree with me that this is a very drastic clause and where we can temper it and make it more acceptable and put it in a form that will frighten people less it seems to me that we would be serving the interests of the State, because the mining industry is no longer the great catch for investment purposes that it was and this clause really does go very far.</p>

<p>I think the Minister, in his endeavour to protect the bondholders, is rather unfair to the State. For instance, it is provided here in case of the State being compelled to take it over and work a mine it should make a first charge in favour of the bondholder of the amount due to the bondholder, including interest. I have a case in mind where the State would have to pay half-a-million pounds before it would get anything. It seems to me it is asking too much. The clause will also have the effect of preventing the State from negotiating or working properties which it might otherwise do without such a heavy contingency. I would like to suggest to the Minister that in a case like this the fair thing would be to say that the State and the bondholders should equally share in the profits which are made.</p>

<p>May I, before we come to the amendment of the Minister, move a small amendment in sub-section (6). Sub-section (6) now reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If after considering the commission&#x2019;s report the Governor-General is of opinion that the non-working or inadequate working of the area held under the mining title is detrimental to the public interest, the Governor-General then may give notice and proceed to the confiscation of the mine.</block>

<p>Here the Governor-General has to be of opinion that the stopping of the mine, or the non-working or inadequate working of the mine, is detrimental to the public interest, but I would submit that there is another factor very important to consider. It is this, that the stopping of the mine may be due to causes entirely beyond the control of the mineowner. It may be there is no working capital ; it may be any one of a very large number of causes. I do not think, if the Governor-General is convinced that the stopping of the mine is due to unavoidable causes, that he should proceed to the confiscation of the mine. Naturally the stopping of the mine would almost always be detrimental to the public interest, but there may be other considerations. He may not be a free agent at all. I would therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 11, after the word &#x201C;title&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;is not due to causes beyond the control of the registered holder of the mining title.&#x201D;</block>

<p>So the Governor-General will have to convince himself of two facts. Firstly, that the stopping of the mine is not due to causes entirely beyond the control of the mineowner, and secondly, that the stoppage is detrimental to the public interest. If the provision remains as it is here, the mineowner may be perfectly innocent, and there may be the best reasons for the stoppage ; yet the Governor-General is obliged to go on and declare the stoppage detrimental to the public interest and confiscate the mine.</p>

<p>It is of course obvious that there may be causes beyond the control of the holder of the mining title, and yet the State should step in and apply the powers under this clause. One of the instances the right hon. gentleman has himself given&#x2014;for instance, it would be going too far because the working capital has become exhausted, and then probably and consequently lie there for say, 20 years because he has had £1,000,000 of working capital and spent every farthing.

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>As the House is aware, machinery already exists under the Post Office Administration and Shipping Combinations Discouragement Act of 1911 for the discouragement of shipping combinations which are deemed to affect adversely the trade or industries of the Union. The Bill before the House, whilst taking over the provisions in this connection in the Act referred to, is designed to afford a further measure of protection to importers and exporters against arbitrary action on the part of shipping companies engaged in the South African trade. Representations have been made to the Government from time to time that the rates of freight charged by some of the shipping companies trading to and from South Africa on certain imports and exports are excessive, having regard to the rates charged for the transportation of similar commodities between other countries. I do not propose on this occasion to go into the general question of ocean rates to and from South Africa, but it is felt that the Government should be placed in the position of being able to deal with complaints which are made in this connection, which at present it is not. In other countries the Government has found it necessary to pass legislation enabling it to deal with the levying of excessive rates of freight, more especially when the export rates have an unjustly prejudicial effect on the exporters of the country concerned as compared with their foreign competitors. A section of the Bill which appears to have attracted a good deal of attention is that which provides that a rate of freight having once been reduced may not be increased within a period of twelve months without permission. I would at once state that the power sought in this respect is to counter temporary rate cutting by shipping companies for the purpose of penalising, against his competitors, an individual importer or exporter who has been fortunate enough to obtain freight at a cheaper rate than that charged by themselves. In this connection I would specially refer to an instance which has recently been brought to the notice of the Government where an importer was successful in obtaining a lower rate of freight for the conveyance of galvanised iron to South Africa than that quoted by the conference lines. The conference lines upon becoming aware of the position promptly reduced their rate of freight on this article to an unpayable rate for a short period, in order, as a punishment, to place the competitors of this particular importer in a better position than himself, then subsequently raising the rate to somewhere about the original figure. If in consequence of the importer referred to obtaining a lower rate of freight than that quoted by them the shipping companies had reduced their rate to the same figure no exception could have been taken to their action, but when they temporarily reduce the rate to an obviously impossible figure they could have had only one object in view, and that was to place other importers in a better position than the importer who had dared to ship his goods by a vessel In cases where a rate is reduced for a bona which was not controlled by themselves. <span class="col_4753-4754" refersTo="page_1330"/>In cases where a rate is reduced for a bona fide purpose consent to its increase would not be refused, but it is very necessary that some provision should be made for affording protection to shippers who are enterprising enough to seek cheaper freight, against financial punishment by a shipping company of the kind which I have just described. Another matter dealt with in the Bill in connection with which special mention is necessary is the power sought by the Government to enter into contracts fixing maximum rates for definite periods, for the ocean conveyance of goods exported from the Union, and to pay subsidies in connection therewith. In the existing ocean mail contract which deals primarily with the ocean conveyance of the mails, provision is made that the freight rate on certain articles of produce shall not exceed certain maximum rates which are listed in the contract. This meets the position to a certain extent as far as the activities of the mail company and its associates are concerned, but as there appears to be a growing disinclination on the part of the contractors to the linking up with the mail contract of freight matters, it is deemed desirable to make provision whereby such matters can be dealt with if necessary, apart from the conveyance of the mail. Further it is conceivable that circumstances may arise where it is desirable that maximum rates of freight should be fixed by vessels other than those of the contractors or their associates. The principle of the fixing by Government of maximum rates of freight on exports is not new and has for some time been in operation in some other countries. In New Zealand, for instance, in a contract entered into by the New Zealand Government for the conveyance of mails between New Zealand and San Francisco, maximum rates are fixed for the conveyance of passengers, and for all classes of freight, both to and from New Zealand, and to and from, and between, certain intermediate ports of call. In another contract entered into by the same parties for the conveyance of mails between New Zealand and Canada similar provisions obtain Another instance is that of Italy where under the contracts for subsidised mail services between Italy and Mediterranean Islands, Italian Colonies, Egypt, India, Morocco and the Far East, maximum rates are fixed for the conveyance of passengers and cargo between Italian ports, to and from Italy, and foreign ports of the Adriatic and certain other ports. South Africa is largely dependent for its prosperity on economic ocean transport, and the Government is convinced it will not be doing its duty to the country if it does not take steps to see that South African importers and exporters receive a fair deal from the shipping companies engaged in the trade. Dealing generally with the matter, however, the existing mail and freight arrangements with the South African conference lines cannot be terminated without twelve months&#x2019; notice, and that being so, and in view of the necessity for proceeding with other important business before the House, it is not proposed to proceed further with this measure during the present session.</p>
