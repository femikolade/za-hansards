</ol>

<p>IV. That it is unable to recommend that the prayers of the following petitioners be entertained:</p>

<p>(1) Anderson, B. L. ; (2) Behr, A. M. L. ; (3) Bell, C. ; (4) Boyd, W. J. ; (5) Brimacombe, J. F. ; (6) Campbell, T. ; (7) Carter, J. ; (8) Chalmers, Annie W. ; (9) Clay, C. J. ; (10) Coetzee, G. P. ; (11) Collett, J. J. ; (12) Corry, J. ; (13) Cowie, J. ; (14) Cranston, H. and 4 others; (15) Currin, J. ; (16) Dalgarno, C. C. ; (17) Dedwith, W. C. ; (18) Devine, T. ; (19) Donohue, W. J. ; (20) French, A. and 86 others; (21) Froneman, H. J. ; (22) Fryer, W. J. ; (23) Garrett, J. B. ; (24) Golding, J. W. ; (25) Gradwell, W. B. ; (26) Harbott. H. G. (2 petitions); (27) Jacobs, W. D. ; (28) Jarvis, I. W. A. ; (29) Jenkins, W. T. ; (30) Jones, H. E. ; (31) Judge, H. J. ; (32) Keates, F. J. ; (53) Kennard, J. T. ; (34) Little, J. ; (35) MacNay, A. ; (36) Marran, C. C. Mc.D ; (37) Maude, J. ; (38) McNish, T. ; (39) Newton, J. H. ; (40) Olivier, C. H. E. ; (41) Pieterse, C. J. ; (42) Porter, Jane; (43) Prentice, J. ; (44) Quigley, J. A., (45) Roberts, T. ; (46) Saunders, S. B. ; (47) Schutzler, C. M. A. ; (48) Stacey, A. E. ; (49) Stewart, Margaret; (50) Stretch, J. B. ; (51) te Boekhorst, H. ; (52) van Zyl, N. J. ; (53) Wagner, H. E. F. ; (54) Walker, H. J. ; (55) Williams, E. C. ; (56) Wissing, H. C. ; and (57) Wright, J. A. V. With reference to the petitions set forth hereunder, your committee regrets that owing to the limited time at its disposal within which to deal with the numerous petitons referred to it, it has been unable to complete its investigations into these cases and is, therefore, unable to report thereon. During the past four years the number of petitions standing over at the end of a session has accumulated to such an extent that the committee finds itself handicapped at the commencement of each session in dealing with new petitions referred to it during that session. In order, therefore, to enable arrears to be worked off, your committee recommends that the petitions now standing over be referred to the Government for consideration and report.</p>

<p>House In Committee :</p>

<p>On Paragraph V.,</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>With reference to Paragraph V, the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) raised the matter the other day in the House of the number of petitions that were standing over and that could not be dealt with by the committee, with the result as set forth in these paragraphs that every year when Parliament reassembles it has hundreds of these petitions standing over from the previous year and cannot give proper attention to the petitions coming in. The Government is prepared to consider the matter and we shall probably adopt the suggestion to appoint a small commission out of the members of the present Pensions Committee to consider these petitions during the recess and to submit and report to Parliament next session, which report could then be referred for formal adoption to the committee. I am prepared to accept the <span class="col_4123-4124" refersTo="page_1015"/>recommendation with a view to taking action as indicated.</p>

<p>Could my hon, friend not frame some regulation under which no petition could be presented more than once, because many of these petitions are presented year after year.

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that this amount is now voted to the rates equalization fund, and, of course, will be invested and earn interest. The intention is that this amount should remain in that fund until such time as Parliament again votes the amount out of that fund, so that control of that money is subject to Parliamentary approval. I cannot at the present moment say whether we will want this amount during the course of this year. We may, or we may not ; it depends upon the financial results of the current year ; but I give the undertaking that when the money is disposed of the House will be consulted and asked to deal with that money in the ordinary way. The reason why we contribute this amount to this fund is to create a reserve, so that in case there is a set-back as a result of a reduction in rates or a falling off in traffic or other reasons, we may then revert to this money, and in that way make up the deficit <span class="col_4125-4126" refersTo="page_1016"/>without resource to raising the rates or reducing the salaries of employees.

<p>If the hon. member will look through the brown book, he will himself find the answer. There are still quite a number of lines of the 1922 programme which we have still to complete, and on which large sums of money are to be spent. We have not sufficient funds this year to go on with all these lines, and the only thing we can do is to construct them gradually.

<p>As the result of the actual construction work, we found that the bridges had to be very much strengthened, as the rivers have come down in flood. That is one of the causes why the estimate has been exceeded. With regard to the natives, we took every step, in consultation with the Health Department, to provide for their health ; but, unfortunately, a loss of life did occur. It is not the fault of the Railway Administration. It is true, with regard to the contractors, that they did not take all the precautions which could have been taken, but I do not think the hon. member can blame the Railway Department for that. We provided all the necessary facilities in terms of the requirements of the Health Department. There is no further serious loss of life.

<p>The spending of the money is concerned in it.

The natives died on the building of the administration&#x2019;s line, and the building was at Government expense.

<p>I do not want to discuss a question of policy. The Minister is living under the shadow of Table Mountain, and does not know what malaria means, and what distress is caused both to Europeans and natives by the introduction of natives who are not immune, and who are infected with the disease and become carriers of the disease to others. The medical officer of health points out very clearly that the Administration&#x2019;s hands are tied. I suggest to the Minister that he get his hands untied, and that he get labour into this area economically and under the best circumstances. There is no doubt that this line as far as the, labour is concerned, has cost the Government three times as much as if they had labour which was immune. The Minister is shaking his head&#x2014;what does he know about it &#x003F; I am speaking from a thorough knowledge of all local conditions and with considerable experience of malaria. I am raising this matter, not as a quibble, and not to score a point against the Administration, but because it is a matter of considerable public importance. In the interests of economy and efficiency, the Minister should see whether some change cannot be brought about in the personnel of those who are constructing the line, that is, obtain native labour which has some degree of immunity.</p>

I regret it was not possible to include the line he refers to. The lines in the western Transvaal and the Free State were included mainly on the ground of giving employment. I am hoping next year to be able to give consideration to the line referred to. In reply to the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen.

I hope it is not going to interfere with the old structure at the Castle. I see, in Item 155 and other items, the principle is adopted of voting out of capital funds for re-sleepering.

As far as I understand, we have constructed the two main port elevators and the first line of the 34 elevators to feed them. Included in the original elevator project were smaller elevators to feed these elevators themselves. Where the scheme has broken down is that in most of the grain elevator districts the channel of the grain has been diverted to points which were never intended. Is it intended to continue with the 17 smaller elevators or with the 34 and the two&#x003F; If it is the intention of the Government to continue on these smaller elevators, on what lines are they to be, and when can we expect them to be built&#x003F;</p>

<p>What the hon. member has stated is correct. We are not able, unfortunately, to provide the whole of the money this year to erect a bridge over the Umfolosi River. The money for the acquisition of land is to cover expenditure on land already acquired. The cartage plant at Port Elizabeth is quite sufficient, I am informed, to deal with the traffic, and under the circumstances we are not adding to it, but just replacing where necessary. The automatic signalling does not mean a replacement of the staff. The hours of duty of the men engaged in the signalling cabins were very carefully investigated by the Hours of Duty Committee, and we have adopted the recommendation.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) mentioned the matter of grain elevators, but there is a misunderstanding in the matter. I am sorry, but we are not able this year to give any additional money for the building of grain elevators. The amount of &#x00A3;223,398 appearing on the estimates is intended for the completion of the Durban grain elevator. No new grain elevators will be built this year in the outside districts. I am sorry, but there is no money available. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) mentioned the station at Louis Trichardt, and regretted that only &#x00A3;100 was being spent this year. That is a matter of lack of the necessary money, <span class="col_4133-4134" refersTo="page_1020"/>and the hon. member must be patient.

<p>It will be the duty of the Defence Department to consult them. In carrying out the electrification of the railways in the Cape Peninsula we are bound by the agreement with Messrs. Merz and McLellan, which covers the whole of our electrification, and we do not propose to depart from that, so that Messrs. Merz and McLellan will remain the consulting engineers for the administration in the carrying out of the work. In connection with the work on the Simonstown and Sea Point lines, we are not going to follow the same system as we did in Natal for obvious reasons. Here the power station will be built by the Electricity Commission, whereas in Natal we erected the power station. All the civil engineering work for these two lines will be done by the department. We are asking tenders for the overhead equipment and track bonding, and have requested the chief civil engineer to put in a tender. If his tender is satisfactory, it will be accepted. In reply to the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl), I may say that in regard to the re-sleepering and re-ballasting, we are not asking for the full amount, but only for that portion which is to be taken from loan moneys. The improvements at Monument station, which, I admit, are very necessary, hang together with the whole of the improvements of Cape Town station, and the yard. With the purchase of Fort Knokke we are in a position to deal with the matter in a comprehensive manner, subject to the financial aspect.</p>

On the question of bridges I would like to ask the Minister what he is going to do in regard to the road rail bridge over the Buffalo River near the harbour mouth. That bridge is used for both ordinary traffic and rail traffic. I would like to call the Minister's attention to two items&#x2014;No. 152, Cape Town-Simonstown ; relaying and strengthening 32 miles, 52 chains of track, total cost &#x00A3;160,285, and No. 588; electrification of railways, Cape Town suburban line, &#x00A3;428,062.

<p>I am told that it does not carry the full amount. According to the estimate of Messrs. Merz &#x0026; McLellan this line was to carry 30,000 tons a day. My information is that it will not carry that amount of traffic normally and I would like to know from the Minister whether the line can deal with 30,000 tons a day. Then I see under Item 594, construction of one standard grain elevator, &#x00A3;2,000 spent, &#x00A3;16,000 to be voted, total estimate cost, &#x00A3;18,000. The Minister said last night that no extra elevators were being erected. Perhaps my hon. friend will explain this item. Then we have Item 595, research and experimental work, &#x00A3;5,000. I would like to know how that money is going to be spent. Under Item 257, we have a very heavy amount, &#x00A3;249,700, North Coast line; deviation and new bridge (Umfolosi River). I think we ought to have some information in regard to that item. Under Item 292 we have an estimated cost of &#x00A3;36,767 to provide new power-worked signal cabin, Cape Town, and under Item 293 an estimated cost of &#x00A3;42,405 for installation of automatic signalling, Cape Town-Wynberg, that is &#x00A3;79,000 for signalling that we are spending on eight miles of line. That is not all the expenditure on that line, for under Item 360 we have an amount of &#x00A3;53,000 to be spent on the substitution of subways for foot bridges at stations on the Cape suburban line, of which we are now asked to vote &#x00A3;18,360. There is also Item 152 as well&#x2014;Cape Town-Simonstown: relaying and strengthening 32 miles, 52 chains of track, total estimated cost, &#x00A3;160,285. It is only fair to say at once that my hon. friend is not responsible for this. I am only mentioning these matters to show the enormous amount of money that we are spending on the Wynberg line.

<p>The hon. member will remember that the north coast line will now form part of the extended line, and consequently we have been re-ballasting this line in order that it can carry the increased tonnage. There has been great development in Zululand and those parts. Let me point out to the hon. member that, unless the line is of a particular type and standard, we cannot run heavy engines on it, which means, of course, loss in working. The hon. member has asked me about the alterations at Daimana. This work is nearing completion. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) and the hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt) have asked me about our experience now that the electrification is in working order, and what the results are. As the hon. member knows, the full system has only been in operation for about a month, and the results up to the present are very satisfactory indeed. He has asked whether the system will take 30,000 tons. I have not the least doubt it will. It has taken up to 27,000 tons a day. Our difficulty is not the question of carrying it, but that there is not sufficient traffic. The line will take all the traffic that Natal is offering at the present time.</p>

<p>Yes. The hon. member has shown that the cost is now about &#x00A3;4,000,000, but he has evidently overlooked the fact that &#x00A3;2,800,000 is the cost of the power station, and will be taken over by the Electricity Commission, so that has to be deducted. Another hon. member has asked me about research work. It is experimental work on the whole system with a view to improvements. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has also raised what he calls the &#x201C;extraordinary expenditure on the Wynberg and Simon&#x2019;s Town line.&#x201D; Let me point out that that has nothing to do with the question of electrification. Corrosion has taken place in the rails, and the re-ballasting necessary is quite apart from electrification. We must keep that line up to first-class standard, because the traffic is particularly heavy and always increasing. I admit that automatic signalling is expensive, but I think the additional safety it gives justifies the expenditure. Much of the expenditure on re-ballasting and re-sleepering is financed from the renewals fund. The hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) has asked me about an overhead bridge at Zuney. If we were to build these at small stations and sidings, there would be no end to our expenditure. Hon. members must realize that if we are to provide overhead bridges at small stations our capital expenditure would be out of all bounds. I am not prepared to face expenditure of that kind. It is just as well that the public outside should know that and that they should exercise care, when they cross the line. The question has been asked about the bridge at Buffalo River. If the municipal council at East London will undertake their share of the responsibility&#x2014;it is a question of negotiation&#x2014;we are prepared to discuss the matter with them, but they will have to undertake their share. The hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt) has asked me whether the expenditure under heads 3 and 4 has anything to do with the establishment of the central workshops. It has not. If a central workshop is erected in the Cape Peninsula, sufficient ground to meet the needs in that regard is available.</p>

<p>Has the Minister considered, in connection with this wagon stock that has been ordered, a more suitable type of truck for sugar cane&#x003F; We use a considerable number of trucks, and they are built, not for that particular traffic, but for the coal traffic, and are very ill adapted for the sugar cane traffic. The administration require these trucks to be loaded with a minimum tonnage of cane, and penalize the planter if that tonnage is not obtained. Yet the trucks were never meant for this purpose, and the administration places a severe handicap on the industry.

<from>&#x2020;Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BYRON</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister will make it quite clear what is going to be the cost of these electrification schemes. We have items 607 and 608, electric locomotives, costing &#x00A3;180,000. Hon. members will see that this has been charged to renewals fund. I do not see by what stretch of imagination he can charge additional locomotives to renewals fund. We have the report here from the Auditor-General that the assistant general manager had recommended, in view of the traffic expected, that 17 electric locomotives be purchased. These surely are properly chargeable to capital cost. As in the case of the Cape Town-Simonstown line, it would seem that the full cost of electrification of these lines is being concealed from us. As an illustration, it cannot possibly cost &#x00A3;5,000 a mile to relay and re-sleeper the Cape Town-Simonstown line. Why this sum of &#x00A3;180,000, which is clearly for additional locomotives and not to replace locomotives&#x003F; I think the country wants a clear explanation of this, and I hope, in framing future estimates, the Minister will not adopt this style, which is open to serious objection. I think we have a right to object if the figures are not clearly put before us.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>Because, in one case the amount is taken from loan funds, and in the other case from the renewals fund. The hon. member has no justification for his charge about concealment. Let me say to the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) that I am in this case following the precedent laid down by my predecessor, with which I agree, because if it is possible for us to take <span class="col_4141-4142" refersTo="page_1024"/>money legitimately from the renewals fund, rather than burdening loan expenditure on which the users of the railway will have to pay interest, I think it is all to the good that we should do so. I submit, further, that this can be fully justified in this case, because, as the hon. member knows, there has been depreciation on rolling stock which has not been made up, to the extent of &#x00A3;2,000,000, which has not yet been made good ; we are doing what is right, and I am prepared to defend it. In regard to the Sea Point line, I have gone carefully into the matter, and it is not possible or desirable at this stage to scrap the electrification of the line as suggested by the hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser). In reply to the hon. member for Germiston (Mr. G. Brown), the position is that tenders are asked in South Africa, and I am surprised to hear that local manufacturers have not received sympathetic treatment. If they bring me any specific case, I will go into it.</p>

<p>In regard to these locomotives which have been charged to renewals fund, I am responsible for that ; I gave instructions when I was in office that these should be charged to renewals fund. It was my policy, which I strongly support to-day, to keep down the capital account on the railways. We are spending over six millions out of borrowed money this year. Anything that could be reasonably, by little stretch, charged to the renewals fund, and we had the money, we did it. Otherwise, you pile up capital expenditure and have to pay interest on it. Then I don&#x2019;t want the Minister to be subject to the temptation of having a large amount in the renewals fund and then, when he is in a tight corner, take some of it, as I was compelled to do.</p>

How is it that his engineers cannot make closer estimates of new works&#x003F; You may reckon that any estimated work will cost anything up to 20 per cent, more than the original estimate. These 17 locomotives are a case in point. They were estimated to cost &#x00A3;144,000, and that was after the experience of purchasing the 78 locomotives ; and now we are asked to vote &#x00A3;180,000. I think something ought to be done to induce those responsible officials to make closer estimates of expenditure.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I have one grievance against the consulting engineers in regard to these electric locomotives used in Natal. It appears that an electric engine may be composed of one, two or three units, each of which costs about &#x00A3;12,000, so that a complete engine would cost &#x00A3;36,000. I do not consider myself that the consulting engineers made that clear at the time we were considering the question of electrifying the Natal line&#x2014;certainly I never grasped that position. The consulting engineers, in their report on the introduction of electric traction, stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We consider it desirable that the standard electric goods engine should be capable of hauling a 1,200 tons train composed of loaded wagons at a speed of about 40 miles per hour on the level, or a train of 1,800 tons at hot less than 30 miles per hour.</block>

<p>Any layman would have taken that to refer to one unit. I consider we were not quite frankly and candidly treated in regard to this point. I was astonished when I heard that it required three units to draw a heavy train. I never understood that an engine to draw these trains would cost &#x00A3;36,000.</p>

This detailed survey, of course, is preliminary to carrying on the big harbour scheme, and I hope we can take it that this means that the scheme is to be gone on with. It appears, however, that the survey is going to take more than a year, thus it will be another year before it will be possible to obtain a vote to carry on the complete scheme.

<speech by="#william_macintosh">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAM MACINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>When the committee adjourned I had asked the Minister about two items connected with Algoa Bay, Nos. 713 and 714. I would ask the committee&#x2019;s attention to page 42, items 737-8-9, provision of lighters. The first item there is four steel lighters to replace four wooden lighters. That, of course, does not provide for any extra traffic. The next item makes provision for four refrigerator lighters, that is for fruit traffic only. Then there is item 739, four additional lighters, which are to be completed this year, and for which &#x00A3;7,100 is being voted. Apparently those are the four lighters which have already been begun, and on which I see there is an expenditure of &#x00A3;6,000 up to 31st March, 1926. These will be the four, I take it, that the Minister promised and arranged to be built on his visit. On that occasion a request was made for 12 lighters, and I cannot understand how it is that the Administration seem to be never prepared to trust the men on the spot. They have the Harbour Advisory Board to advise to the best of their capacity, they have their own officials there, but whatever is put forward is always whittled down, or turned down altogether, and that particularly applies in regard to the case of Algoa Bay. Once again, I would like to refer to the estimates of revenue of the different harbours, and the estimates on the other side for services and interest. You will find that Cape Town is estimated to have a profit of &#x00A3;99,000; Durban, &#x00A3;117,000; East London, &#x00A3;4,000; and Algoa Bay &#x00A3;140,000. That is the Minister&#x2019;s own estimate of what he is going to get from Algoa Bay, and yet when it comes to a mere question of getting a few lighters, the whole 12 of which would cost about &#x00A3;40,000, it is like extracting a double tooth without gas. To get any money for equipment for this port, which gives the best net return of any port, year after year there is the greatest difficulty. The Minister must know that the work is at the present time being hampered for want of lighters and want of stock. It is not only the present Administration, but it was the same thing before under the previous Administration. If one looks through this book, apparently at Durban, for instance, money can be poured out like water, at Table Bay there is not a little being poured out, but at Algoa Bay there is the greatest difficulty in getting any expenditure for the traffic that is offering.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to Item 727, Table Bay: Modified Southern Scheme. I see that the Minister only, asks for &#x00A3;5,000 this year on behalf of the modified southern scheme. I would like him to explain why we are going so slowly in this matter. Here is a scheme estimated to cost over &#x00A3;2,000,000, and yet we are only to spend &#x00A3;5,000 on it this year. Then, in Item 728, widening south arm, Table Bay, we have the old principle of going to the Renewals Fund, in this case for &#x00A3;42,000, and I see we are also buying two new steel lighters, &#x00A3;9,000, out of the Renewals Fund. For the strengthening of No. 1 jetty and removal of decking, there is no vote on these estimates. Is that because we are spending the money out of Renewals Fund &#x003F; I would like to refer to item 750, one 60-ton non-propelling electric <span class="col_4145-4146" refersTo="page_1026"/>floating crane, &#x00A3;50,000. Here we have a floating crane. The difficulty of Table Bay is in regard to the dry dock. No heavy weights can be taken out of that dry dock, except special appliances are erected. I take it that this floating crane would be useless there. We have been crying out at Table Bay for years past for a heavier crane. I would also like an explanation in regard to Item 748, purchase of one new steam tug, Table Bay. I see that the estimated cost of this is &#x00A3;68,000, and there is only &#x00A3;1,800 on the vote.</p>

The hon. member also asked me about the provision of only &#x00A3;75,000 for the outer works, while last year we spent about &#x00A3;100,000. This year, unfortunately, we have been very much pressed for money. The amount which has been placed at the disposal of the department is Only &#x00A3;6,000,000 from the Treasury and, with the very big works going on at the present time, we have found it very difficult indeed to meet all needs. I trust the hon. member will realize that we are in earnest in regard to that work. I do not think it will be necessary to discharge any men. I thought I gave those eight additional lighters with very good grace. If the hon. member will look again he will see, under Item 737, that there are four steel lighters to replace four wooden lighters, while Item 738 provides for four refrigerator lighters, and 739 provides for four additional steel lighters. The request of the Chamber of Commerce was for 12.</p>

<p>The progress of the construction of the breakwater at Port Elizabeth has been most disappointing. We have always heard that there was to be no delay. One looks at the figures given here and finds that the estimated expenditure during subsequent years is &#x00A3;838,000. That would mean at the pace of &#x00A3;75,000 a year it would be eleven years before that breakwater would be finished. Some of us want to live to see the breakwater finished. The Minister has given the assurance in Port Elizabeth and in this House that whatever might be the position about the harbour as a whole there would be no slacking in the building of the breakwater. Now it has slackened down to &#x00A3;75,000 a year. It is a preposterous way of leaving the thing.</p>

We are going to see the effect of lengthening the south pier before we touch the north pier.

<p>I am glad the hon. member has mentioned that, because it is responsible for a large portion of the &#x00A3;330,000. We took over certain assets when the occupation took place, and the Otavi Mining and Railway Company claimed against the Administration for a very large amount. The select committee upstairs dealt with it some years ago, but the whole matter was still outstanding at the time I took office. After full investigation we came to the conclusion that a payment of &#x00A3;55,000 would meet the whole case and personally I think the settlement is satisfactory. I think it was only just that we should have made them a payment and I think the transaction is a sound one. In reply to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) he will understand that while the total expenditure is &#x00A3;336,000, that does not mean that we have actually spent more than &#x00A3;150,000 in cash.

I know that court, and have practised in it, and that court sits in Bloemfontein for two months out of the twelve. It is adequately housed in the Raadsaal, and so far as I know the judges of the court have expressed the opinion that they are adequately and sufficiently housed there. It is a court half the size of this chamber. The accommodation of the bench and counsel is quite adequate, handsome and dignified. If ever there was an item of unnecessary expenditure in our loan estimates, it is this particular item ; and one can see it is not dictated by the necessity for building an appeal court, but out of consideration to giving <span class="col_4151-4152" refersTo="page_1029"/>a sop to Bloemfontein, and to secure by this vote the anchoring of this court in Bloemfontein.

<p>I should say so! Seeing that for a quarter of a century the public revenue has come mainly from the Rand, I should say so. The magistrates&#x2019; courts at Johannesburg are in a state comparable to the Caledon Square courts that existed in Cape Town until they were rebuilt a few years ago. These courts are used twelve months out of the twelve months by tens of thousands of people, and yet this white elephant, for I may call it so, is to be built out of public money. I can tell the Minister a very much more needed and wiser way of spending that money, and that is in providing for a suitable law library attached to the appeal court. There is a private library for the judges, but the appellate court has no library, and the practice is to take your books with you when you argue a case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barlow">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken spoke of the dignity of the building in which the appeal court is housed at Bloemfontein, but he has been most undignified in this matter ; because he has not put before the committee the truth. He has not told this committee that this appeal court will not only house the appeal court but the Master of the Supreme Court of the Free State and the library&#x2014;you lawyers always want cheap books. But he also has not told the committee that the Government have made a contract with the Bloemfontein town council and the latter have spent &#x00A3;10,000 on a piece of ground which was bought from Sir John Fraser. They have demolished some houses and people have been turned out of their homes. The piece of ground is worth &#x00A3;16,000 and it has been given to the State, He talks about its being a ramp. I do not know what that word means. It is certainly not an English word. It is a vulgar word and vulgar words come out of the mouths of little vulgar boys. He does not mean it from a military point of view. Bloemfontein has only had a few crumbs up to now. We have got the appeal court under the Act of Union. If we talk about moving Parliament the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) goes off like a pop-gun. The judges do not live in Bloemfontein except one. They break the spirit of the Act and live in Cape Town but they won&#x2019;t be able to do that very much longer. When the appeal court sits at Bloemfontein the street has to be blocked up and traffic has to be turned round another way and certain people have their business cut off. I also think that the Government should build those magistrates&#x2019; courts in Johannesburg, but you must carry out your contract with the Free State.

The hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) talks about a contract. Will the Minister, of Finance lay on the Table particulars of that contract &#x003F; I support what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in regard to spending a substantial part of the money on a decent library for the use of the judges and those who have to practise in the appeal court; for the library is a perfect scandal. If you want to appear in the appeal court, you either have to take a cartload of books there with you, or you have to go to the offices of the High Court, where there is a scanty library. In regard to item 7, in connection with art gallery, Cape Town, when I raised the question on the general estimates, the Minister gave me a reply which certainly soothed me down, because I gathered from him, when he said &#x201C;Wait and see what is on the loan estimates,&#x201D; that there would be a considerable sum down. There is an item of &#x00A3;500. I suppose that is for clearing the weeds off the foundations. The appeal court at Bloemfontein is not in the same position as the art gallery, because the latter is an absolute debt to the public of Cape Town. The Minister of Public Works knows perfectly well that his predecessor met a deputation, and admitted that an obligation rested on the Government in this connection. I hope the Minister is going to give us something tangible in connection with this. Regarding the item on page 7 third line, Cape Town Parliament House, alterations, a rumour has been going about which I trust is unfounded, that included in that is a fund for the making of a bowling green in connection with this House.

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The proposal did not come from the judges, but it is not for the judges to decide what buildings are to be erected. I am glad that the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) mentioned another reason for having a proper building, and that is a suitable law library. I am recommending the purchase of one of the best law libraries&#x2014;that of Mr. Justice Kotze&#x2014;to be housed in the new appeal court at Bloemfontein, where there will be proper accommodation for the books. We require other buildings in Bloemfontein for other Government purposes. The Master and the Registrar have not sufficient accommodation, and one of the ways in which we shall utilize parts of the space in the new court is for officials who require additional office accommodation. You could, of course, give that additional accommodation without the expense we are going to incur if we did not also require an appeal court building. The money for the appeal court has been voted by the House, and I cannot understand why the House should revert to the matter, as nothing new has happened in connection with it, except that since last session one of the appeal court judges has gone to live in Bloemfontein. Nothing, however, has happened to make what was right last year wrong this year. It is not fair to reopen old controversies without any new grounds. It is necessary to house the highest court of the land properly in Bloemfontein, and I hope it will have the effect of enabling us to dispose of our appeals rapidly, and will not make it necessary for judges to work at very high pressure, as they do to-day. They have been very anxious to go back to places where they have big libraries and better court accommodation than they have at Bloemfontein. With the new buildings, I do not think we shall have the very large number of reserved judgments that we have to-day. We shall give the judges so much comfort that it will be possible for them to do all their work in Bloemfontein, and not to rush off to their homes, and try to work out judgments by correspondence, which seems to me to be the very worst way of working out a judgment. My idea is that as soon as we have that proper accommodation at Bloemfontein, we should have legislation laying down what the sessions are to be, and giving parties the right to place their cases on the roll, in exactly the same way as they do in the courts of first instance. All that I hope to be able to put straight, but the first step is to obtain a propel building. The only argument against this proposal is that the present state of affairs is merely temporary, and that the House is of opinion that the appeal court should not stay at Bloemfontein. That argument I can understand, and if that argument should prevail I may start an argument of my own with regard to other matters. At the present moment, it is a good deal safer for everybody to Stick to the position as it is.</p>

<p>I congratulate those who have the ear of the Government, both at Bloemfontein and Cape Town. While we are very glad to see an art gallery for Cape Town, it should wake up to get the balance required to complete the building according to plan.

<p>Yes, partly. You have the Michaelis Gallery, and, indeed, don&#x2019;t know how much has been done for you. With regard to the expenditure of &#x00A3;90,000 on a palace of justice at Bloemfontein, which will be used only about three times a year, and then for only short periods, I would prefer to see the money spent on the provision of hospitals rather than law courts. We are spending heaps of money on the drawing-room, but leaving the kitchen out of consideration almost altogether. We are not attending to real interests of the country, but providing ornaments and fringes. Coming from the Transvaal, which provides most of the revenues, I shall probably receive very little attention from the Minister, or the House in the matter I wish to mention. There is an item on page 10, loans to provinces for capital expenditure.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I listened with some care to the statements of the Minister of Justice, but it seems to me that his arguments were a complete non sequitur. He said that he looked forward to the time when the judges would sit together in Bloemfontein and confer about their judgments, instead of writing to each other, as they do to-day. I agree with him on that point. Then he said that this happy consummation would depend on building a new appeal court at Bloemfontein. The argument is that they have nowhere to sit today to confer about their judgments, that they have no sort of accommodation in which they can properly do their work. A more ridiculous statement has never been heard in this House. The judges are as well accommodated in the present building in Bloemfontein as Cabinet Ministers are in this House. The court in which arguments are conducted is, for all practical purposes, as good and adequate a court as exists in the Union to-day. I say that the suggestion that all these reforms in the procedure and sitting of the appeal court are necessary, but must be postponed until a new building is put up, is an absolutely laughable argument.</p>

<p>The suggestion was that when the new building was finished, the Minister would feel that he had sufficient moral courage to bring about these reforms. The proposals have nothing to do with each other. If the judges lived in Bloemfontein, then this association together and discussion of their judgments would be possible. I want to say a word to that &#x201C;perfect gentil knight,&#x201D; the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow), who has given this House a lesson in courtesy and good manners and told them what words they may use in their vocabulary and what words they may not. I wonder that the Minister of Justice himself did not come under the lash of the hon. member (Mr. Barlow) when he spoke of the municipality of Bloemfontein &#x201C;coming up to the scratch.&#x201D;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I may be permitted to express my amazement at this committee being read a lesson in gentleness and courtesy by the hon. member for Bloemfontein ( North.) If there is an hon. member who is entitled to read the committee that lecture, it is not the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North). I think if this House and the outside world were asked the last place in which they would look for refinement, it would be in the bench occupied by the hon. gentleman himself. I think I may now leave the hon. member, who is simply out on what I may term a vote-catching expedition. This vote is to provide a building for a court which sits two months out of the twelve, which has two sessions per year, each lasting one month only. It is for a court which at the moment is adequately housed. I do not suggest that no improvements are ever to be made without a report from the judges, but I do suggest that where in the past there has been a bad court building, the judges themselves have been very insistent in their complaints as to the inadequacy of the accommodation provided. So far from there being any complaint from our learned Judges of Appeal in regard to the accommodation in that court, they have, I believe, expressed themselves as being perfectly satisfied. If that is so, what in the world are we spending &#x00A3;97,000 for &#x003F; Why are we spending this money practically as a sop to Bloemfontein&#x003F; I say, as a lawyer myself, that this expenditure is not justified. There are a large number of places in the Union which are waiting for proper courts and have not got them. I would say to the Minister that I for one would be no party to trying to upset the compromise which was arrived at by which the appeal court sits in Bloemfontein, The suggestion has been made that this agitation against the court for Bloemfontein is due to some of us, possibly members in the Cape or others, wishing to remove the court to Cape Town or to Pretoria. There is nothing of that sort in my mind or in the mind of anyone else who has objected to this expenditure.</p>

Leaving the hon. member where he is and where he should be, I want to go a little bit further and say that I believe that the time has come, not to build the appeal court in Bloemfontein, but to concentrate at Pretoria. I believe that and I believe that the Government, if they took that in their hands, would get the support of the whole of the Free State. I think that we would be satisfied and I think the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) and the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) would be satisfied with us. I may be wrong, though I do not think I am, but I have never known Cape Town yet come to this Government and say&#x2014;</p>

<p>They wanted &#x00A3;100,000, the Shylocks, for a small piece of ground to build this particular post office on. And that is the great mother city, represented by the hon. member for Rondebosch, the patriot of the patriots! They made the Government of this country pay &#x00A3;65,000 for that small piece of ground. We do not do those things in the Free State. No, we give the ground, although we have got to pay for it. That is what Natal does, too. These great patriots here, these great Capetonians, these wonderful people who &#x2014;well, never mind. What, about my hon. friend (Mr. Blackwell) &#x003F; They wanted to build a station at Johannesburg. What did the Wanderers do&#x003F; They got the ground for nothing from the Government and then they want &#x00A3;65,000&#x2014;represented by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell). We, in the Free State and Natal, have helped the Government in every way possible. If the judges in South Africa had their way&#x2014;with the exception of Mr. de Villiers&#x2014;there would be no appeal court in Bloemfontein at all. Let us carry out the spirit of the convention. The appeal court has outgrown the home it is in. It is wanted for the provincial council of the Free State. Then to say it is a political ramp! Would we worry about the appeal, court just to catch votes &#x003F; Are we the type of people to do that&#x003F; We have all the votes we want without going out of our way to catch them. We want a decent building for the highest court in the land. It should be properly housed. I think it is very wrong for the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to come and put forward the view he has. He does it because he is a South African party man. The South African party men in this House always do whatever they can against the Free State.</p>

I do not propose to go into that question, but when the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) talked a lot about little boys, one could not help thinking of little Jack Horner. When he stands up in that corner of the House and has the effrontery to appeal to the House in the spirit of the convention after what we have heard from him&#x2014;well, we have heard something from him the last few days which illustrates how the spirit of the convention appeals to him.</p>

<p>Yes, it is most amusing to listen to these attempts of the Minister of Dedence who has a good deal to account for. I am glad to hear the Minister of Justice say what he did about the library at Bloemfontein, because that is a long-felt want. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) in his omniscience talks about every subject under the sun in this House and lectures everybody. If ever Satan required a lecture&#x2014;well, we will leave it at that! When he lectured Cape Town on the question of the provision of land for the Art Gallery and the duty of the municipality to provide funds, he is either entirely ignorant or recklessly regardless of the fact that this is a debt due to Cape Town. The Government took over from the old art trustees in New Street the building which was there. Since that date the Government has owed that as a debt. I quite recognize that in the past it has been impossible for the Government to redeem that debt, but I say now that the time has come for the debt to be paid. That is all we are asking. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) simply does not know what he is talking about when he talks like that.</p>

We have to revote &#x00A3;679,000, and we are asking for &#x00A3;600,000 ; so my hon. friend will appreciate the great difficulty we have experienced in apportioning this money. We took the question of the art gallery seriously into consideration, but there are other circumstances quite apart from the provision of the money. It is an intricate thing ; it is different from the ordinary architecture and design. A good deal of consultation is neceessary, and we have not quite concluded this consultation, but we are getting going about the end of September.

<p>Exactly ; that is why the whole thing is premature. It can just as easily be cut out as put in. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has raised many points. One was a dairy in connection with the Agricultural Department. He spoke about his own dairy not costing as much, but the hon. member&#x2019;s dairy, I am assuming, was merely considered from the commercial point of view, and this dairy is for training, and he must confess that the costs are a little bit more when you have all the appliances for training. I need not deal with the question of the appeal court, which has been dealt with already. With regard to the Labour Department&#x2019;s offices in Barrack Square, the hon. member must know by this time&#x2014;he has been in office, although not closely associated with labour&#x2014;that office accommodation is in a parlous condition, and there is lack of office accommodation in Pretoria, but particularly in Cape Town. The district engineer of the Public Works Department is nearly run off his head endeavouring to fix up office accommodation. The labour offices must be together, and although both the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) and I dislike spending money, I would like to see Cape Town very much improved by the activities of the Public Works Department. The Trades Hall is entirely unsuitable. Even as a Trades Hall it does not foot the Bill. A rent of &#x00A3;16 is being paid, and I think it is &#x00A3;8 too much, You have the site space, but no facilities and no accommodation. To get to the offices you have to go through the main hall, and there may be a meeting in progress. We are endeavouring to arrange for a site to be placed at the disposal of the trades unions in Cape Town, and they can erect their own building. It will be little enough, and a recognition of the real claims, in the economy of the state of trade unions. I am not going to ask for it to-day.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and I hope the hon. member will not oppose if he cannot actually support. He raised the question of the Cape Town police barracks. The present barracks certainly are an eyesore, and they have got to come down, and we have to provide alternative accommodation. We have the site also on the barracks square. It will be a big building. Reception depots for natives are an essential part of the scheme of things. It is realized that the natives have to be looked after ; fed when they arrive as strangers, housed, medically examined, and so forth. The hon. member has also raised the question of the post office annexe, &#x00A3;130,000, total cost, plus garage, stores, and that sort of thing. We are at present hiring accommodation at a very high rental, something over &#x00A3;2,000 a year for stores accommodation, garage, etc. We have a piece of ground in Prestwich Street, and it is proposed to house the whole of it there. Just now we have the mechanicians&#x2019; shops at the top of the post office building, and are in fear of fire day by day. The Kimberley post office due to expansion, we have to alter. In regard to the waiting-trial cells in Johannesburg, unfortunately, we do require these. In regard to Durban general offices, any representative here from Durban will agree that it is a most wasteful and inefficient way in which we are conducting our public business in Durban, owing to the offices being scattered. This is overdue. In regard to Cape Town offices, we have a piece of ground in Lelie Street, at the back of Marks&#x2019; Buildings, where we propose to make a first instalment of our reconstruction of office accommodation for the Government. That is where the start is going to be made. [No quorum.] There is just one other point, Sterkstroom public offices, &#x00A3;1,100. The hon. member feared that because the amount was passed last year, and the building not proceeded with that there may be some danger of its not being proceeded with this year. I may say that the contract is already let, and the building is about to proceed.</p>

<p>Then when is the House going to get an opportunity of deciding&#x003F; Will he give the committee this assurance, that unless a specific vote for this purpose is passed, the Government will not go on with the bowling green. In connection with Parliament buildings, to provide, by the money of the taxpayers, a bowling green for members of this House, would be nothing short of scandalous. We have billiard rooms run at the expense of the State in which members spend, to my mind, a great deal too much time. If we are going to have a bowling green to meet the convenience of hon. members opposite so that they can dodge out of the House, it would not add to the dignity of Parliament. If hon. members want to play bowls or any other game, for heaven&#x2019;s sake let them do so, but let them put their hands in their own pockets and provide the necessary money. There are many other matters of much more importance which the Minister tells us that the country&#x2019;s finances will not allow him to make provision for. I hope the Minister will give the assurance that work of that character will not be gone on with without the House having a full opportunity of expressing its opinions thereon.</p>

<p>May I point out the attitude which the Government adopted when this matter was raised last year &#x003F; I think the hon. member for Paarl (Dr. de Jager) took a very prominent part, and urged the necessity for improvements to the Parliament buildings. Of course the right hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt), when he says the ultimate responsibility is the Government&#x2019;s is right, but in matters affecting the convenience of members of Parliament the Government will be guided very largely by the House itself.

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to explain that the recommendation of the Internal Arrangements Committee at that time was for a scheme costing something like &#x00A3;40,000. It was divided into two portions, one portion to be for the complete remodelling of this chamber, and the other portion to be used for providing additional accommodation for the Hansard staff and the reporters, and for the convenience of members of the House. The Government accepted that portion which provided additional accommodation for the Hansard reporters, for the press and for the convenience of members, which included the transfer of the billiard room from its present place, and the utilization of the present billiard room for other purposes, and the erection of a new billiard room at the far end of this new building. Those plans were submitted to the committee, and the members opposite wanted us to go in for the whole scheme, but we did not do so. We went in for what we thought was the most urgent. That cut the expenditure down to &#x00A3;20,000. The plans were then submitted to Mr. Speaker, to the officials of this House, and to the various parties interested. Mr. Speaker and the officials had to have a say as to what would be most convenient arrangements for the conduct of the business of the House, and those plans were eventually approved of by Mr, Speaker and the officials, in co-operation with the chief architect of the Public Works Department, the secretary of the Public Works Department, and myself. As far as I know, those plans have not been altered, and all this controversy has arisen on account of some rumour. It is absolute news to me that any provision is made for a bowling green, and I do not think that hon. members should prejudice the whole scheme on account of a possibility of something like that happening, which could very easily be avoided if suitable steps are taken. Here we propose providing accommodation for the convenience of the members and officials, and, in order to make what appears to be a cheap party score, hon. members are getting up and jeopardizing the whole scheme.</p>

We eventually submitted a plan to this House for an expenditure of something like &#x00A3;43,000. That included the entire rearrangement of this chamber as a debating chamber, with the galleries, and in addition to that extensions not merely for the convenience of members and the press, but also for the convenience of Parliament.

<p>Yes, leaving some things out and adding others. The position therefore is this, that if the Minister has adopted the plan, either partly or wholly, which the commission submitted to the House, well, he should abide by it. If he is adopting any variation from that, the House ought to be consulted, surely. I do not think it is either fair or correct, nor does it show any real desire for improvement for the convenience of members, nor the spirit in which a responsible Minister of Public Works should view the requirements of Parliament. The Minister should certainly not indulge in petulance. Something has appeared, or has been rumoured, as an addition to these plans in the form of a bowling green. There was never any mention of a bowling green on this plan. Well, let him tell us he is not going to have a bowling green. It was not in the commission&#x2019;s report, and it has not been recommended by Mr. Speaker, I am sure, so why now threaten to withdraw the whole plan and the absolute requirements of the House on the mere question to tell us where the bowling green suggestion comes from. Why threaten to withdraw the whole of the improvements to the House&#x003F; The Minister must recognize that Parliament does require proper housing. We must have these extra rooms as committee rooms ; Hansard must be provided for and the press must have proper accommodation. All the Minister need tell us if there is a rumour about a bowling green is that he does not intend to carry out that rumour. All he need tell us is that he will go on with the extension, or as much as possible of it, as recommended by the commission, and there will be perfect satisfaction.</p>

Why should the Minister then, just because of what the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) has so unwisely introduced into the debate, threaten to postpone the work which is so generally admitted to be necessary, for another year &#x003F; It has already been postponed a year. By taking his revenge in that way the Minister would exhibit a pettiness which is not worthy of him. It would suit the book of the members from the north who have no time for the Cape. They will be only too glad if no improvement whatsoever, however necessary, was made to the Houses of Parliament, because they do not want the Parliament here. Bui that desire would be no excuse for the Minister. The Minister should also remember that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort is not a Capetonian.

I cannot see how Mr. Speaker, being responsible for the good government of Parliament, can go on in the way we have been going on in the past. These additional rooms are essentially necessary.

There is no question about it that the posts which are being used in parts of Natal are not sufficiently heavy to withstand normal weather conditions, and that a heavier type of pole is necessary. The way these posts are erected is most unsatisfactory ; they are not properly anchored, with the result that they are easily displayed, and are to be seen in places facing north, south, east and west, some broken and others bent.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEANE</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me this estimate is too small. The Land Bank is being starved. If the Minister will look at the bank&#x2019;s fourteenth yearly report, section 68, the board estimated that &#x00A3;1,250,000 would be required to enable it to give full effect to their requirements during the financial year. As a fact, only &#x00A3;850,000 was provided, and only &#x00A3;670,000 was available out of the 1925 vote. The Land Bank costs the State nothing, and these loans are more urgently necessary than ever. We have just gone through a terrible season of drought. Then if the bank costs the State nothing, why should not these unfortunate farmers have the full use of it &#x003F; Up to now the bank has been responsible for keeping a large number of men upon the land who would otherwise have had to sell their land and gravitate to the towns. That is a policy we must avoid at all costs. The position to-day, because the bank is not financed as it should be, is that these farmers have to go to ordinary commercial banks and pay 7 per cent, on overdrafts. It is bleeding them. I ask the Minister to consider this vote according to the recommendation made by the Land Bank Board. We are very fortunate in having an efficient Land Bank Board of directors, and the least we can do is to carry out their recommendations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to point out to the hon. member that as regards farmers having to pay 7 per cent, for over-drafts, that sort of thing was not part of the business of the Land Bank, to advance money to farmers on overdrafts, but during this session we have passed the Agricultural Credits Bill to enable the bank to supply that certain class of short time credit, and for that purpose we are making a special grant to the bank. We do not anticipate that the Bill will be in full working during this financial year. Probably, in a few years, we shall have to supply a larger amount. As far as the bank&#x2019;s ordinary operations are concerned, the hon. member is right when he says it appears from the report that they require a much larger sum. But, as in the case of other loan votes, we have not been able to give the full amounts required by various departments for development. If we acceded to that instead of asking the House to vote &#x00A3;13,500,000 we would have to vote &#x00A3;17,500,000. It is absolutely impossible. We cannot go on voting capital moneys at the rate we are doing. In addition the bank will have over a million pounds available this year in capital, so that the amount available to the bank for advances will be over &#x00A3;2,000,000. Under these circumstances I do not think it can be said that we are not making fairly liberal provision for the bank to enable it to function in the way Parliament intended. I do not think the hon. member is right when he says we are starving the bank. For instance, the capital has grown to over &#x00A3;10,000,000 with this grant, and I have informed the general manager that he will have to curtail his operations to a certain extent. We will not be able in future years to go on voting these large amounts we have been voting in past years. Last year and this year the amount we have been voting has been swollen in connection with certain special grants, but the time will come soon when the bank will have to rely more upon its own resources. We cannot go on at this rate. We hope the bank will continue in future to be operated on sound business lines, but still I think we are coming to the time when we shall have to consider the position that we cannot go on increasing the bank&#x2019;s capital by &#x00A3;1,000,000.</p>

<p>As the right hon, gentleman knows, the farmers have been getting advances from year to year. I believe that policy was started in 1910. Last year we granted &#x00A3;28,000 to the wheat farmers.

This year we have put down an amount of &#x00A3;5,000 on the Estimates, but I am hoping that, after the good year which the farmers have had, it will not be necessary to spend the whole amount.

How about Witbank &#x003F; I understood that was going to be put up by the Victoria Falls Power Company and then taken over by the commission. There is also one at Sabie.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>This is really a matter that comes under the Mines Department. The Treasury is only concerned as far as the provision of the money is concerned. Under the Act which was passed by Parliament, this Electricity Supply Commission can either go into the open market and borrow the money themselves, or they can borrow through the Treasury. They have no assets really of a tangible nature at present. It is difficult for them to get the money in the open market, and, therefore, we agreed to finance them. This year we are providing &#x00A3;1,600,000, that is, &#x00A3;887,000 for Cape Town, &#x00A3;200,000 for Durban, &#x00A3;400,000 for Witbank, &#x00A3;25,000 for Colenso, &#x00A3;68,000 for Sabie, and &#x00A3;30,000 for general administration. The total scheme will ultimately cost &#x00A3;5,700,000, that is, &#x00A3;2,500,000 for Colenso (a charge or debit which we are taking over from the railways), &#x00A3;1,130,000 for Cape Town, &#x00A3;530,000 for Durban, &#x00A3;80,000 for Sabie, &#x00A3;1,420,000 for Witbank, and contingencies &#x00A3;40,000. In the case of Sabie, that is a station to promote and encourage mining development. Therefore, the Government is advancing the interest in the first few years until such time as they are able to make this payment. As far as the payments are concerned, on which we are advancing this money, they will have to be redeemed after a number of years. They will be paying the same interest as the Treasury is paying, plus cost of raising the money, etc.</p>

<p>The hon. member is quite right, there is a considerable amount of unemployment on the Rand. A large number of the men unemployed have been employed on railway construction works, and as these have been completed so they have lost their employment. They are now waiting for new railway construction to start. Unfortunately, some of the proposals have not been advanced far enough to give immediate relief. We could have placed more had it not been for the severe drought in the Western Transvaal districts, which caused acute distress and unemployment there. Certain road works in the provincial council also came to an end, and we had to make provision not only for men from Johannesburg, but for some who were suffering in consequence of the drought and others who had been employed on road construction. I am hoping that the railway proposals, practically almost ready to start, will provide openings for some of these men on the Reef. I am in close touch with the Minister of Railways and Harbours. I am also in collaboration with the Administrator of the Transvaal with a view to seeing if we cannot employ numbers on road work, on the piecework system, under proper supervision and organization, so that we can get the best possible <span class="col_4183-4184" refersTo="page_1045"/>results ; my idea is not merely to offer subsidies and leave matters at that, but to pick suitable men and place them so that they can earn sufficient to live on ; and to ask the province to share the difference in cost with my department if it comes out more expensive than it would have been had native labour been employed. I am glad to say, in regard to certain road work in the Potchefstroom district done by white men earning fair wages, that I have a satisfactory report from the road engineer</p>

<p>As far as that is concerned, the purchase of stock and implements is secured because they are nearly always given to the owner, and so we have got security. The Land Rank informs us that, as far as that part is concerned, it is quite satisfactory. With regard to the maintenance allowances, under the ordinary tenant farmer scheme we do not get back these subsidies, but under this extension scheme the tenant farmers have not only to repay the cost of the implements, but also the maintenance allowances which they get during such time as the crops mature. In this regard we have had good recoveries, but there have been cases, through no fault of their own, through drought or pest or other causes, where we have not been able to recover. This scheme has hardly been in operation for 12 months, but I hope to be able to give more information in regard to recoveries and losses next year.</p>

In regard to the purchase of land, we already have a training farm at Hartebeestpoort and this provision is to enable the department to start another training farm somewhere else if found necessary, or if we wanted to extend the tenant farmers extension scheme.

<p>The number of tenant farmers we have with private farmers is, I think, 352. Apart from that we have got about 100 placed on Government land. I am very sorry to say that there is a larger number not making the headway that I would like to see. I have called a halt and am getting a report on each individual, and am giving close attention to the matter, because I can see that this scheme, while good in itself, is a rather difficult and delicate one to handle, because you have to get three elements to be satisfactory, first the satisfactory farmer, then the satisfactory tenant and then suitable land. I have given instructions now that all the papers and evidence and magistrate&#x2019;s records, and so on have to come to me before placings are sanctioned. J should say, however, that 50 per cent, are making good, but where we find that a man is not getting on well, sometimes we transfer him to another farm or put him back on to road work. Everything depends on administration. The scheme is sound if we can get the elements right. If I can get the failures reduced to 20 per cent. I shall be satisfied. At present we have more than that. I am doing my best to make the scheme successful, <span class="col_4185-4186" refersTo="page_1046"/>and I think we will succeed. I am satisfied that the scheme is fundamentally sound.</p>

<p>If 50 per cent, are making a success of it, I think the Minister ought to be fairly well satisfied. I am pleased to hear that. Do the reports of the officers point to the fact that the men under Government supervision are likely to do better than the men on their own &#x003F; The maintenance allowance of &#x00A3;23,000, I understand, is the amount given for the maintenance of families that go on the farms to do farm work.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>That maintenance provision is for the subsidy which we give to the tenant farmers whom we place on Government land, and which we get back from them. If a tenant farmer is placed on private land that subsidy is lost. We pay it in both cases. It cannot be more than &#x00A3;5 7s. 6d. a month for a man and his family, which is for the bare necessities of life, and to tide them over while their crops are growing. The right hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) has raised a point which I am glad he has raised, viz., that we are getting a far higher percentage of successes with the tenant farmers under direct Government supervision, because they are under proper discipline, and we make them pay back everything we advance them. They are put on their mettle, and their successes are far higher on our own land, and that is why I want to concentrate more particularly on what we call our&#x2014;</p>

<p>because the results are eminently satisfactory, and more so than when these people are placed on private land.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>I observe from the report of the Land Bank that their control of the funds that are issued for tenant farmers under the scheme of the Minister is confined merely to bookkeeping, and though cattle and implements may have been bought, the Land Bank inspectors do not visit the persons to whom these cattle and implements have been issued, and it is no further concern of the Land Bank what happens to this property when once purchased. Has the Minister any means of supervising this property&#x003F; I quite understand the Minister has his welfare officers, but their work has to do more with the welfare and the social side of the work, and not so much with the business side. The Land Bank report shows that the sum issued to tenant farmers up to 31st December was &#x00A3;33,845, of which only &#x00A3;753 has been repaid. Surely this is a very small return for such a heavy expenditure. Can the Minister tell us anything to lead us to hope that a better result will be given at a later date &#x003F; As to the Doornkop estate, has Mr. Schlesinger an interest in that estate, and is Mr. Rosenberg now the representative of Mr. Schlesinger.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HEATLIE</person>:</from>

<p>I quite agree with the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat) that no tenant farmer can farm successfully when he has to give the farmer half his crops. Any farmer who gets tenants on those terms is doing very well indeed. I would like to ask the Minister whether he knows that that is so&#x2014; can a tenant ever succeed by growing maize on the half-share system &#x003F;&#x2014;and whether the Minister will give it his immediate attention to this, otherwise his tenants will never succeed.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the question asked by the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick), Mr. Schlesinger has not, according to my knowledge, anything to do with the company. I have not heard his name mentioned. As to the recoveries of the Land Bank being so small, most of these people have been placed within the last twelve months, and there has hardly been sufficient time. Next year, I hope to be in a far better position to gauge how the money is coming in. In reply to the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat), the subsidy does not go on indefinitely. It cannot go on for a longer period than fifteen months&#x2014;the first nine months at the full rate, and the next six months half the amount. I agree with the hon. member that for a tenant farmer to give half his proceeds away for the mere use of the land is a very big price to pay for the right to farm. If many of us had to pay half our earnings for the rent of a house we could not make a success of our business. We are settling 150 on Government leased land. The tenant gets everything he produces. We, of course, deduct costs of administration and <span class="col_4187-4188" refersTo="page_1047"/>what it costs to place him&#x2014;subsidies and supervision.</p>

<p>He pays interest on it. We have to pay for the farm&#x2014; that will be shared out pro rata, and these people will pay the interest, in the form of rent. If everything goes well we lose nothing at all. As to the other and very important point raised by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) (Mr. Strachan) and the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat) in connection with the apprenticeship scheme, I may say that some time ago the department took up the question of apprenticing boys to farmers for a period of two years, under certain conditions, and the papers were placed before me. I saw that if the scheme was to be a success it had to cater, not merely for the town boys, but also for the country boys. The machinery that we had at our disposal did not make that possible, because the department was working through the Juvenile Affairs Boards, which are confined mainly to the large towns, and ail the applications that came to these boards were from town boys. Without the farmers&#x2019; support and co-operation the scheme would fall through. In the Free State we have converted the Juvenile Affairs Board of Bloemfontein into a Board for the Free State, thanks to the help we have received from the Schoolteachers&#x2019; Association in the Free State. They have been keen and active and have co-operated with us and sent their representatives through the different districts of the Free State. I dissolved the Town Board and formed a new board, which will tap the districts as well as the towns. Each local centre has a representative. A move has been made recently in Paarl to form a Juvenile Affairs Board to tap that district, and we are also contemplating such a board at Potchefstroom to tap the Western Transvaal. I feel that we must have machinery in order to keep us in touch with the country boy, and I have suggested that we should work through the different school boards ; my department has sent a circular letter to the various school boards, telling them that we propose to go in for this apprentice scheme for placing lads with farmers and to ask for their assistance. I have asked the department to let me know the result. I did not launch the scheme formally until we had got the necessary machinery. I should mention that the department is at present administering that farm bureau scheme which the &#x201C;Sunday Times&#x201D; started some time last year. The &#x201C;Sunday Times&#x201D; called for applications, and asked for farmers who were willing to take the boys and brought the two together, and the officer, who has been detached to supervise this farm apprentice-work, is now, at my request, interviewing a number of the farmers who have these &#x201C;Sunday Times&#x201D; boys, and finding out how far they are successful, to enable us to profit by any mistakes of the past, so that we can proceed on as sound lines as possible. Of course, a proper agreement will have to be drawn up between the farmers and the boys or their parents. We have the forms ready, but we are not satisfied with them, and I have asked the official to go round and see what variations are necessary. The farmer will engage the boy for a period and then be asked whether he will retain the boy in his service. There is the question whether the boys should live with the farmer ; the question of pocket money, and who is to clothe them, and a lot of details, which we are working out before we eventually say, that is what we have decided ; now we shall make our appeal. When we have this machinery ready, we will make the appeal, being satisfied that we have done everything possible to make the scheme a success. May I make an appeal to the farmers on both sides of the House, not only to help us themselves if they can, but also to use their influence in their districts to get other farmers also to do so. It is appalling the number of boys who have been brought up on farms who do not understand farming, just for the lack of proper attention and training. We will do a big thing for South Africa if this scheme succeeds. Why should not a boy be apprenticed to a farmer, as well as to anyone else &#x003F; It is good to take a boy away from his home and put him with somebody who will undertake to train him and look after him properly. Another point arises out of this: Commissioner Lamb of the Salvation Army, who is their representative, travelling round the world on this very scheme, in connection with which thousands of boys have been placed on farms in the dominions, says that experience has shown that it is almost essential, before a boy starts his training, that you give him pre-apprenticeship training, at some place where he will learn the right end of the horse and how to approach animals&#x2014;the rudiments ; especially a town boy.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister whether the man who is to be his supervisor on this tenant farmers&#x2019; scheme is a man who is a successful farmer, or a man who is a broken-down farmer&#x003F; You usually find that a successful farmer will not take on a job like that. I would like the Minister to look for a man who has made a fair success of farming to train these young fellows. If a tenant farmer takes a full-grown orchard, or vines, in our Western Province, he cannot nay half of his income back to the owner, and when he goes in for cereal sowing, he cannot give more than a third, otherwise he goes broke. I would like the Minister not to settle any man unless these are the terms arranged.</p>

What is the position of the Government in regard to these improvements. Are they secured in respect of the money advanced.

Three made good and are really getting on, but seven were dismal failures. Their mentality was low and they had little ambition to advance themselves. After a few months, for instance, one was so unsatisfactory that he was told to leave, but he had no home to go to ; because his father was in goal and his mother had eloped. We must have some stuff to build on, the bulk of that offered is too poor and hopeless.</p>

The hon. members for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat) and Worcester (Mr. Heatlie) said that the tenant farmers could not exist if they worked on the half, and I want to ask the Minister if it is not the case that on certain farms they have to work for a third share &#x003F; I also want to ask the Minister if it is not his experience that some of the tenant farmers leave the farmers as soon as the subsidy after the first six months is no longer paid &#x003F; Then I also want to know whether a mistake is not being made to call these people tenant farmers instead of bywoners.

There have been no steps taken, so far as I know, to acquaint the farmers with the Minister&#x2019;s ideas in the matter.

I quite agree with the hon. member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson) that to lend a large sum of money to the Doornkop Estates was absolutely unbusinesslike, as the Government has no security and there is no liability on the company to make good any loss.

This vote provides &#x00A3;108,000 in connection with naval store and workshops accommodation at Simon&#x2019;s Town. The Auditor-General says that we have paid for oil tanks &#x00A3;4,000 and have undertaken to keep them supplied with oil for the benefit of the Imperial Government at a cost of &#x00A3;84,000.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DRUMMOND CHAPLIN</person>:</from>

<p>It is extremely good of the hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) to give us all this information on behalf of the Minister, but the fact remains that he has not given us any reliable information at all. The point I want to make is this. We received from the Imperial Government <span class="col_4191-4192" refersTo="page_1049"/>material, which oil the Estimates furnished by the Minister amounted to about &#x00A3;5,329,000. We paid against that &#x00A3;150,000, leaving a balance of &#x00A3;5,179,000. We have also sold property, land and buildings which formed part of the gift, the sales realizing &#x00A3;473,000. I quite admit that the property has been administered in accordance with the Act which was passed when we accepted the gift, and I do not question the fact that this material was handed over as a free gift, and I do not think there was any particular condition attached to it, except what is set out in the Act. At the same time, the point arises, what are we doing in return for this gift &#x003F; It is quite evident, from the fact that the Auditor-General has referred to the &#x201C;gifts&#x201D; that we are making to the Imperial Government, that the point is not clear, for if the Auditor-General could make a slip like that, members of the public can also misunderstand the position, and they do not realize that we are doing a certain amount in the provision of oil tanks in connection with defence. It is only reasonable that we should do that, considering we have received gifts valued at over &#x00A3;5,000,000, which at 5 per cent, interest is worth to us about &#x00A3;250,000 a year. I do not say for a moment that there is anything wrong, but I am merely asking for information, and the hon. member for Vredefort will pardon me if I think the Minister of Defence is better qualified to reply than he is.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The position is perfectly simple. In 1921 the Imperial Government handed over to us stores, etc., as a free gift, and a very munificent gift it was. I would be the very last to minimize it for a moment. At the same time an engagement was entered into by us to carry out certain works at Simonstown, the object of which was to improve the accommodation for the Admiralty, and leave the western part for the more exclusive use of the Union navy, if we can dignify our few little ships by such a title. We have been carrying that undertaking out. Part of the undertaking was that we should put up oil tanks and fill them and hand them over to the British navy full, after which they would keep them full. They advance the money, and we have to repay the amount within four years. Then our obligation finishes. This explains the item, provision of oil fuel, &#x00A3;80,000. With regard to lands and building, either my arithmetic or that of the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) is wrong, as I make the amount &#x00A3;2,252,000 for artillery stores, etc., and &#x00A3;2,110,000 for lands and buildings.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I see. I thought the hon. member referred to defence assets. As against that we paid over &#x00A3;150,000 in cash for buildings and land which had nothing to do with defence. There was an honourable obligation that the land&#x2014;or its value if we sold it&#x2014;should be used for defence purposes, and we are carrying that out. I am particularly glad that the hon. member for South Peninsula is so clear on this obligation, as there is a certain piece of very valuable land at Muizenberg&#x2014;the sports ground&#x2014;which we shall very shortly have to sell, and I am relying on his good offices to put a stop to any popular clamour there may arise over that matter. In regard to the question asked by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) as to the &#x00A3;113,000 for this purpose, that is a long-standing matter, but, as I told the House on a previous occasion, we wish to provide for putting into the field a force of 25,000 men, if required. Putting that force into the field is not merely a matter of rifles and bandoliers. There is all the various equipment of war which you must have. We cut that down to the very lowest amount. We make the allowance for all those things which we can get locally in the country, but I found an estimate considerably more than that when I came into office ; but I feel it only right that we should be in that position, and there is this increase in the standard stock which we must face.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Minister will reply on this vote to the question I raised just now. My point is that the &#x00A3;177,000 which the House is now voting is money of which the Government has really had the equivalent in property and material that the Imperial Government handed over in 1921 when the adjustment of the account had taken place between them, with the understanding that was made with the then Minister of Defence that that money should really be earmarked by the Treasury for the purpose of carrying out defence works in this country. Really we are now out of our own money, only giving &#x00A3;71,000 a year towards the upkeep of the navy that protects the whole of our trade and commerce.</p>

<p>Alterations and additions to artillery barracks are not alterations and additions to barracks for artillery. The hon. member is not aware of the local customary name. Artillery Barracks is the name of what used to be artillery barracks, but which now are to be the defence headquarters which were voted last year. They have been offices, I think, ever since the Anglo-Boer war. The other item is consequent, of course, upon the programme, upon which he and I differ so much, of putting the artillery in detachments in several places in the country.

<p>On proposed omission of Clause 87,</p>

<speech by="#pearce">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PEARCE</person>:</from>

<p>I am very sorry that the hon. the Senate has thought fit to delete Clause 87, which was inserted by this House. I hope and trust that this House will not accept that deletion. We find that in the gold mining industry in this country, there is something akin to the coal industry of Great Britain. In 1914-1915, when there was a prospect of a <span class="col_4195-4196" refersTo="page_1051"/>great upheaval, the Government appointed a commission to investigate that industry. They did so, and from the statistics given acknowledged the the workers had a grievance so they subsidized the wages to prevent the upheaval, on behalf of the workers interested in that industry. In 1921 the Government of Great Britain considered the advisability to cease giving that subsidy. The coal mining interests were able to prove that, unless the subsidy were given, it would be impossible for them to pay a decent living wage, and at the same time a dividend to the shareholders. A large percentage of the companies had increased or watered their capital to such an extent, that these industries were unable to pay a living wage to the workers and at the same time a dividend to the shareholders. The watering and inflation amounted, in some instances, to 493 per cent. We are living under a system under which shareholders are entitled to a fair dividend. What we object to is the re-construction of companies and the watering or inflation of their capital, so that it is impossible to pay a fair living wage and at the same time a fair dividend. I believe the time will come when the gold mining industry of South Africa will be under the same conditions, and we ask that at least the Government of this country should know exactly the financial conditions of these companies, and should be able to assist, in time of strife, either the companies, if they are in the right, or the workers, if they are demanding what is just. There is no doubt about it, when the strike arrives, which ultimately it will, the State will have to step in, either to assist the gold mining industry, or to contribute to the wages of the workers in that industry. Under those conditions, the clause should be re-inserted in the Companies Bill so that at least the State should know the exact conditions which exist. I believe also that there are a large number of companies in this country getting indirect or direct assistance from the State. We have heard statements made in this House proving that in the sugar milling industry there is inflated capital, and that they already hold such power of regulating prices, that it has become a menace to the sugar planters. I believe the Government are assisting the planters; but are we justified in assisting anyone unless we know exactly the conditions which exist&#x003F; Are we justified in assisting these industries unless we have all the cards on the table&#x003F; We must know not only what cash has been put in, but what originally was the capital. Large numbers of the gold mines have their capital watered to the extent of 200 to 300 per cent. How is it that the millionaires have been created &#x003F; It has been by the manipulation of shares. It was proved in the Gold Mining Commission&#x2019;s report of 1908, that the gold mining industry was paying only slightly over 3 per cent. That information was given in reply to a question. It was also stated in reply to another question that on real capital they were paying 32.96 percent. I am an out-and-out protectionist, I believe there are numerous claims made to this Government for assistance, if this clause was inserted in the Companies Bill we would know exactly the cause of their needing financial assistance. We would be in a position to refuse them unless it was on a sound basis. I am sorry that this Bill is re-introduced at the end of the session, I do beseech hon. members to consider not only the present conditions of South Africa, but that we have to legislate for the future. We must take a lesson from what has happened in Great Britain and America. I will not weary the House with the records of other countries at this stage&#x2014;I believe every hon. member knows what has happened in other countries. But we should consider and realize that the time will come when we will have a similar crisis in South Africa, because the big industry of South Africa cannot carry on for many years longer and pay a living wage to the workers employed in it, and a dividend to the shareholders. Let us take a broad view of the matter, realizing that we are the guardians of the people of South Africa, not of company promoters, and persons who manipulate shares in order to enrich themselves, leaving behind the poor widows who have invested their money, and leaving the State to legislate for their assistance in future. I believe this clause was a just one and one in the interests of the people of South Africa. During the previous debate, it was stated that this clause was ridiculous ; because the information it asks for can be got by inspection at company&#x2019;s office. I have been unable, in the interim, to find anyone who does not acknowledge that it is impossible to get information. I know of instances of shareholders asking for information at the annual meeting, when the chairman has refused to grant the same, it is surely, therefore, impossible for an ordinary person to find the information. If the information was shown on the balance sheet, and persons purchased the shares, they would know exactly what they were buying. Also in the case of a future crisis in South Africa, the people of South Africa would be able to judge, not as they were, in England during the crisis, unable to judge whether the coal industry was correct or not in stating they must reduce wages.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Probably the majority of the House would agree with the view of the hon. member who has just spoken, but the trouble is that the Senate is bitterly opposed to this section. I suggested a via media by trying to throw away a portion of the section to enable the rest to be passed but notwithstanding that attempt, was unsuccessful, and I am certain there is no chance whatever of passing this clause through the Senate. Of course, all of us desire to see this Act passed ; because I think it is going to improve the condition of affairs in South Africa, and I hope we will not press the restoration of this clause, because I am very much afraid, if we do so, the Senate will again reject this <span class="col_4197-4198" refersTo="page_1052"/>clause. I take it that politics is really the science of doing what is possible. We cannot always obtain what is ideal, and as we cannot do that we must do the best we can with the material at our disposal. I very strongly impress on the House to accept this amendment, whether we are in favour of it or not, to preserve the Bill. The view in another place is very strong that we can obtain this information in other parts of this Bill, but I admit probably by a very roundabout road, and probably one that will not often be traversed by people who want information. With the best will in the world, I cannot see how we can replace this clause. I would strongly ask the hon. member to allow his objection to drop, in order to pass a very useful bit of work, the foundation of which was laid years ago. On that account, if this is pressed to a division, I will be compelled to vote against any restoration of this section. I cannot possibly be a party to wrecking this Bill.</p>

<p>I hope the House will not accept the Senate&#x2019;s amendment which deletes the sentence limiting the operation of the Act to loans not exceeding &#x00A3;500. The first proposal in this House was that the Bill should not apply to loans over &#x00A3;300. A Usury Act is for the benefit of the poorer classes of people. A man who is able to borrow &#x00A3;500 can make his own arrangements with a bank to obtain the money. The first proposition was &#x00A3;300, but the amount was raised to &#x00A3;500 here as a compromise.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coulter">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister will see his way clear to stand by the original clause. If he went back to the other place and stated that after consideration this House had decided to adhere to the original draft, I think that would be considered sufficient to justify the withdrawal of the Senate&#x2019;s amendment. The exemption that the Senate has deleted was borrowed from the law of Canada, which was passed to protect the poorer people from the rapacity of moneylenders who profited by the distress of the poor. It was found there that the line along which the matter should be approached was to cause as little inconvenience to trade and commerce generally as possible. That is an argument which should appeal to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, when I remind him that in very influential labour quarters it has been pointed out that one of the most vital things for the success of labour is the maintenance of trade and commerce. The Bill deals with small people to whom loans are a necessity&#x2014;not money to be used in commerce or adventure to enable the borrower to reap if he can a big return. One of the arguments put before the select committee by the moneylenders was that merchants were entitled to turn over their stock three or four times a year at 10 per cent, on each turnover, thus making a total of 30 or 40 per cent, per annum, and it was argued that moneylenders should be enabled to do the same. At first sight this is a very plausible argument, but the distinction is that in the case of the merchant the transaction is a productive one, but in the other instance a man has to borrow through sheer necessity. Nearly every civilized country in the world today recognizes that the exploiter of mere necessity is a man whose methods of business are to be discouraged. Where a man is able to borrow &#x00A3;500 or more he obviously would not belong to that particular class which it is desired to protect. Therefore, if there is no need for his protection then the purpose the Bill will serve has no application to him. You find yourself faced with a further argument that the less you interfere with business generally, particularly banking business and business done with people outside our own borders, the easier you make that business flow through the normal channels of commercial intercourse. We should not bind upon our commerce more shackles than are necessary. We should not interfere with our foreign trade more than is absolutely necessary. You may create uncertainty and difficulty and that all reacts against the smooth working of commerce. Consequently, I do ask the Minister to stand by the findings of his committee. It was a representative committtee and he will agree with me that this point was very fully considered. I believe that if he went back and represented that point of view more fully to another place and put these reasons before them and said that this Bill was evolved as a result of the work of all parties in this House and that it was entirely non-contentious and non-partisan and pointed out the importance of abiding by a considered decision of this kind, it would be sufficient to convince the members in another place that it was inadvisable to break down such an important principle of the Bill. I entreat the Minister to stand by this considered deliberation on the part of the members of the committee.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>It must be remembered, of course, on the other hand, that for an amount of this description the, interest chargeable is 12 per cent. I made all the points in the Senate that the hon. member (Mr. Coulter) speaks about, for instance the large amount of work that was done by this committee. The opposition to this clause started with Senator Kerr, and it was practically unanimous. My powers with them are not so great, perhaps, as with the Government side of the House. If we have this amount of &#x00A3;500 and upwards and interest at 12 per cent, is allowed, I think that interest is sufficient. Where the House took out the proviso that this Bill only refers to debts <span class="col_4199-4200" refersTo="page_1053"/>below &#x00A3;500, and the other House has made, the Bill apply to amounts over &#x00A3;500, we must take into account the fact that interest is allowed of 12 per cent. I do not think that it makes very much difference to our Bill whether we delete these words or not. As to the other point raised by the hon. member, even with these shackling provisions you would still have a perfectly fair mortgage bond allowing an amount of 12 per cent, interest to be charged and also allowing these further amounts to be charged under section 2. I think it would be a perfectly fair transaction, if it is a transaction that is not of a risky nature. I think we must not make provision for the more risky transactions, the transactions in which your capital is in danger. We make provision for the transaction in which we take it your capital is not in danger. These privileges apply generally, and naturally your man who lends money of &#x00A3;500 and up-wards will see he gets his full 12 per cent, where he knows of the shackling provisions of this Bill, and I take it he would know about them very soon indeed. I think this Bill is a Bill which we should see through this House, and I do not want us to do anything to put the Bill in danger. I do not think it is going to make very much difference in the ordinary case, and, after all, we are legislating for the ordinary case. The Senate has taken the view that for all amounts above &#x00A3;500, your maximum interest must be 12 per cent. I do not think we are likely to dissent from that view. I must appeal to the House to enable the Bill to be passed, because I think it is a useful Bill. I do not anticipate that we will put an end to the evils of usury, or to evasion of this Bill ; we are going to have usury and evasion of the Bill, but in a smaller degree than before the Bill was passed. The effect of the Cape Act has been very satisfactory, although the arguments which could be employed against that could be employed against this Bill.</p>

<p>Yes, I admit that, but I think the less that is paid in interest on loans the more there will be for other purposes. I have no doubt it is the right thing to work for more ordinary commercial business and less usury, less interest. This House has raised in this Bill the slogan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">small interest as far as loans are concerned,</block>

<p>and I think all the Senate has done is to carry that slogan a little further, so they have really bettered their masters on that point, and I hope the House will accept that. Very largely the Senate was influenced by the fact that in their experience they have seen a great number of cases in which men, often farmers, without any great knowledge of business, have borrowed money, even above &#x00A3;500, at very excessive rates of interest, and they wish to place these farmers in the position of people borrowing below &#x00A3;500. I trust this House will accept the amendment. I do not think it will do much harm, and it may even do good, but at all events, I can assure the House that the Senate was practically unanious in their view upon this point.</p>

A similar clause to this was in the Income Tax Act of 1919 and remained there until last year, when it was dropped. This clause compels anyone resident in South Africa to pay tax on any income he may draw from the securities of other countries. Last year that clause was taken out and in consequence of that large investments were made in the Southern Rhodesian loan, which was issued subsequently. The reintroduction of the clause is looked upon as rather a breach of faith, although I do not think the Minister intended that, and it will have the effect of sending down the price of the Southern Rhodesian loan very considerably. Investors in that stock in the Union regard this as a very considerable grievance, although I do not see how the Minister can alter the position.</p>

<p>The reason why it dropped out of last year&#x2019;s Act was because the general principle that we laid down and the House accepted, was that, as a general rule, we wanted to tax incomes from a source within the Union. That is the basis of our legislation. It was only afterwards, when we saw in this connection that it would have this unfortunate effect that we decided to discourage the deliberate investment of money by Union residents outside the country. If people do invest outside the Union there is no reason why they should be exempted from taxation. This is one of the cases where we had to depart from the principle of our Acts; which is only to tax incomes from sources within the Union.</p>

<p>It does seem to me that there are very good reasons why the Minister should agree to accept the view that has been pressed upon him in this matter. I regard one of the strongest arguments in favour of our objection to be that which the Minister has himself just used. In the law of 1917, it is true we had a provision to this effect, and so far as the investment world was concerned, it would understand that all investments made from South Africa, and which were exempted from taxation abroad, should be taxed within the Union. But in 1925 the Minister deliberately abandoned that policy. After all, to the people who have to attend to the investment of money, and who follow legislative changes of this kind very closely, it would appear to be part of the deliberate policy of the Government that, having for a number of years decided that that class of investment should be <span class="col_4203-4204" refersTo="page_1055"/>taxed so far as income tax is concerned within the Union, it would in future be exempted from taxation. I take it that the Minister did not bring about that change of the law inadvertently. In consequence, he has led a number of people spread through all walks of life into the belief that if they supported investments which might be available to them outside the Union, they would not be taxed in respect of those investments by him through the income tax. The second ground of objection to it is that it is so illogical. For the sake of illustration, let me confine my remarks to Rhodesia. The Minister still recognizes that where investments are held in Rhodesia, which do not take the form of issues of Government stock, the income from those investments should not be taxed within the Union, but quite illogically, apparently having in mind this recent issue of Rhodesian stock, he singles out in this clause 2 of the Bill &#x201C;stocks or securities issued by the Imperial Government or by the Government of any other state, including other Dominions or any British Colony or Possession.&#x201D; If his principle were sound&#x2014;and he relies absolutely upon that principle&#x2014;he should make this wider. He recognizes that that would be unjust. He evidently recognizes that it is desirable to encourage investments, certainly at any rate as far as private investments are concerned, in Rhodesia or in the mandated territory of South-West Africa. It would be an act of courtesy, an act of comity, if the Minister realized that in a sense we are also responsible for the development of those territories on our borders. What does seem to me to be so harsh is to pass this law, so as to deprive investors of the benefits that they were to secure under this prospectus of the Rhodesian Government. Investors were given to understand that the loan would be free from Union tax and income tax in Rhodesia. Upon the strength of that assurance a million pounds was found, very largely in the investment market in Cape Town. I believe that the persons responsible for the issue of that prospectus had authority for the statements they made. I can tell the Minister it is a fact that the inducement was held out to investors that the loan would be free from taxation. I would like to ask him if he will not make an exception in the case of a British colony or mandated territory in southern Africa. I do not wish him to go beyond that, but I do ask him to realize that uncertainty of this kind, created by Acts of Parliament which in effect are retrospective, will react upon his own investment market when he comes into the market with a loan, as he must in the immediate future. There should be an absolute guarantee that when once a prospectus of a loan is issued there will be no interference with its terms. The Minister may say he gave no guarantee. That may be so, but now we have ascertained that the Minister was consulted, it is reasonable to assume that he was told that this inducement would be held out to Union investors. I do wish to stress the importance of keeping faith with those investors ; I say deliberately that a circumstance of this kind is not one which he should view with equanimity, because it is bound to react on the investment market in the future. We have been endeavouring to build up a market for investment in Union loans. I therefore desire to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>The principle of my amendment is to make it clear that we do not take up an attitude of selfish isolation.</p>

<p>I want very strongly to support the suggestion of the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Coulter), which I think is a very sound proposition. Our own interests and the interests of Rhodesia are bound up together ; anything that conduces to her prosperity conduces to ours. So I think we might stretch a point. I do not think it is necessary to bring in the mandated territories, but it would be, I think, sound policy in regard to our interests to get as much interest in Rhodesia as possible. It is a perfectly fair proposition.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place let me tell the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter) that before the Rhodesian loan prospectus was issued the treasurer did approach us and ask us whether the flotation of such a loan within the Union would be regarded sympathetically. I at once said yes, but the Rhodesian Government did not say in their prospectus that the loan would not be subject to Union income tax. I certainly never gave any guarantee to Union investors that investments in this thing would not be liable to taxation. The hon. member will see that if we did not make a provision of this nature we would be putting a premium on investments outside the Union. The hon. member says, why don&#x2019;t you make that applicable to all investments outside the Union &#x003F; Generally they are liable to taxation, and in most cases higher than in the Union.</p>

<p>I think you should exempt Rhodesia altogether. Their requirements should not be more than a few hundred thousand pounds, which we could afford to lend them, and there is a bigger demand <span class="col_4205-4206" refersTo="page_1056"/>for our products and the like.
