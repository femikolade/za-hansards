<p>On Clause 5,</p>

<speech by="#william_macintosh">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAM MACINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>I rise once more to record by objection to this clause as amended, on the ground that it introduces into co-operation a compulsory feature which is an absolute negation of the principle of co-operation and overrides the Co-operative Act, which confines the business of co-operative companies to their members by providing here that nonmembers shall make use of the co-operative companies for the sale of their produce. This, as I say, is a negation of the principle of cooperation, and it is unfair to traders who have to compete for this trade and to pay their additional licences, income tax and other charges that the co-operative companies are freed from. This is done by the Land Bank, not for the protection of public funds, but they are asking for these special privileges under the pretence of popularizing the co-operative movement. It is done in the face of the strongest possible apposition on the part of the Agricultural Department, as officially stated, which is the department that has to do with the co-operative movement. For that reason I wish once again to record my protest against this clause.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask a question on this. Perhaps the Prime Minister would be good enough to tell us when he is going to lay his Native Affairs Bills on the table. The next question is on page 112 under Summaries&#x2014;Griqua money &#x00A3;6,000. It is quite a considerable sum. Perhaps my hon. friend will give us some information about it. It is a new vote.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place I see my hon. friend is very anxious to have the Native Bills before the House. I hope by the end of the month to lay them upon the Table of the House. I may say they are being translated and will be printed. As to this &#x00A3;6,000, this is in consequence of the agreement that was entered into with the Griquanation and Adam Kok. Shortly after, or while they were leaving the Free State for East Griqualand, it was agreed that Adam Kok was to draw a yearly subsistence of &#x00A3;200. and his people &#x00A3;100. and that was in consideration of certain rights which the Griquas had, or claimed to have in connection with land in the Orange Free State. Subsequently when Adam Kok died these sums of &#x00A3;200 and &#x00A3;100 ceased to be paid, and the reason given was that it was a personal allowance. The Griquas have all along maintained that it was not a personal allowance, but was in consequence of the real rights with which they parted, and that the income should go partly to the new chief and partly to the others. The Government of the day did not see their way to follow them. This question has eventually been brought to us. I have read the document and submitted it to the opinion of the law advisers, and they agree with me that this is more than a personal obligation. The Government has thought it right that this sum of &#x00A3;300 should be paid, but that it should not be paid to any successor, or quasi successor, of Adam Kok. The whole &#x00A3;300 should be put into a native fund, and this should yearly be drawn for the purpose of assisting the development of the Griquas. So practically this is the sum paid into that fund, and it will remain as the capital, the interest of which will be devoted to the Griqua people.</p>

<p>Will the Prime Minister make a statement in regard to his intentions in connection with the removal of the Makoba tribe from New Amalfi to the Umzimkulu district. The position as I understand it is that this tribe was settled on their present location not only because they rendered splendid services during the native wars, but also so that they could act as a buffer between the Basutos and the European settlers. At great personal risk they settled there, and now simply because they happen to be in the midst of the Europeans, and because their land is valuable they are required to give up their holding and move to another locality which is not nearly so good. True they are to get one and a half acres for each acre they now hold, but what is the value of holding more ground when the ground is practically valueless. We shall appreciate a statement by the Prime Minister, for the tribe is very unsettled, and even Europeans who wish to see justice done are disturbed.</p>

<p>Near Kokstad. They hold that this new ground is not suitable, and feel very strongly that they should be consulted. The natives are not opposed to any change provided they get land equally as good as that which they are required to vacate, and I think their point of view quite the correct one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>As far as that is concerned, the position I have taken up is that the amount has been given to a reserve of those natives, and those natives are not going to be deprived of that ground unless with their consent. Unless we can give them something that is satisfactory to them they are going to remain.</p>

<speech by="#sephton">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SEPHTON</person>:</from>

<p>With regard to the item, Native Agricultural Demonstrators, &#x00A3;1,024, I do not know how the amount will be allocated, to me it seems a very small sum when you consider the five millions of natives and the large native areas in the Union. At the end of last session and since I have endeavoured to persuade the Minister to pay a visit to the district of Herschel. During the last 15 years I have noticed a great deterioration of the agricultural and pastoral conditions of the district. It has been overstocked, and the resources are rapidly diminishing, while the population is increasing. This cannot continue. It has been suggested that the native ploughs in a most slovenly way, but they have not the facilities for cultivating land that Europeans have, and are forced to use antiquated ramshackle ploughs and six or eight indifferent oxen, and the result is inevitable. It cannot be favourable. I consider it highly necessary that we should have demonstrators to assist these people, and educate them to better methods of cultivating their land. The resources are decreasing, the population is increasing, and the result must be <span class="col_3377-3378" refersTo="page_0641"/>an overflow somewhere. I do think that the very earliest opportunity should be taken by the Minister to visit the district and get a knowledge of the conditions there, with a view of trying to meet the future.</p>

<speech by="#barlow">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister whether he can tell the House what is the line of administration the Government is taking with regard to trade union organizers amongst the natives&#x2014;whether they will be allowed to go all over the Union like white organizers&#x2014;I ask the question because one Kadalie has been banned from various portions of the Union. I do not say the Government is right or wrong, but I do not know the reason why, and therefore, I cannot give an opinion, but I would be glad it the Prime Minister could make a statement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps I may answer this at once. With regard to the question of the hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton), I just want to point out that these are not new demonstrators. There are a number of demonstrators appointed and paid by the Bhunga who will also disappear from these estimates from next year because, under the Taxation Act that was passed last year, a sum of money will be paid into the Native Agricultural and Advancement Fund, and they will be paid from that fund in future, and, as my hon. friend will know, a portion of the income from certain taxes upon natives is to go into that fund for the purpose of assisting development in the native territories. So that you may say that this will be a matter the advancement of which will depend on the income that that fund is going to derive&#x2014;an income that is not, I think, going to be inconsiderable, compared with what it is to-day. As to the position in regard to the Government&#x2019;s line of administration&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) referred to trade unionists. At any rate, with respect to Kadalie and others, I may say that this Government has not in any way departed as far as its attitude towards these people is concerned from the attitude of the previous Government, except in this individual case of Kadalie, and I may say that the Government is determined, as far as he is concerned, to persist in that attitude. The position is simply this. As hon. members know, Kadalie should not have been in this country, and would not have been here if the Administration had acted as it should have acted a year or two ago. I do not want to go into details in the matter. He was, or is, here simply because of failure to have him put beyond the boundaries of the Union, or rather through failure to say to him that he could not stay within the Union. Kadalie has been a very active agitator, and, from the reports that I have, an agitator of no mean kind, with the result that, through his action and the action of one or two others there has been a scare for the last six or seven months throughout the Union, of a kind which makes it imperative that we should take every step to see that we are not landed in some kind of unpleasant fray one of these days. It was while this scare was at its height that Kadalie wanted to go down to Natal, and hold meetings there, and the inhabitants&#x2014;to my mind quite properly&#x2014;knowing what the situation is there, knowing how they are surrounded by the most backward native tribes in the Union&#x2014;I think it is well known that your Zulu, for instance, to take one tribe in Natal, stands far behind any of the other tribes in any of the other provinces as far as advancement in the line of civilization is concerned. These people, knowing or feeling what was going to happen if he were to come down there, asked that the Natal law, which says that the Government can at any time prohibit a native from any other province coming into Natal, should be enforced, and we have had that enforced, with the result that Kadalie was not able to go down into Natal and make any further propaganda. We are prepared to let natives go from one province to another as freely as they like ; but we shall certainly not allow it when we find dangers ahead such as we saw we would run, if we allowed Kadalie to go down to Natal and Zululand and those places, and stir up feeling as he has done in other places.</p>

<p>I was asked whether our Urban Areas Bill was getting on. I may say here that we are getting along as fast and as successfully with this Bill as can be expected under the circumstances. It is being adopted right and left by almost all the municipalities, as far as the building of locations is concerned, and the clearing of the native from the state of promiscuous living in among Europeans. In regard to that, which is a question only in the bigger centres, we are getting on very well indeed. Some municipalities had to be hurried up a bit, but for the last six months or more they have been coming up to the scratch very well. In Johannesburg, quite a number of quarters have been cleared already, and I believe at the present moment there are some four to six hundred new quarters erected for further clearing of the city of natives. That is to get them into their proper locations. If I were to give an account of the whole it would take far too long, but if hon. members, for instance, would like to have a report on the whole circumstances in regard to the Urban Areas Act, I shall be only too glad to lay one upon the Table of the House.</p>

<speech by="#tom_naud&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. F. TOM NAUD&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I shall be very glad if the Prime Minister could enlighten us how far the territories which have been reserved by the Beaumont and Stubbs Commissions as native territories will no longer be regarded as such. I am not so much concerned about the areas in which only natives live, but about areas which are more appropriate for habitation by white people. I should like the Prime Minister to explain what the native territories are. In the low veld there is already closer settlement of white people and it is impossible <span class="col_3379-3380" refersTo="page_0642"/>to think that that will be a native territory. The misfortune, however, is that the man who wants to develop the ground does not know whether it will be a native territory. When application is made for ground and ground is purchased the answer is that that cannot be done without the approval of the Native Affairs Department. Uncertainty, therefore, exists and also in Potgieter&#x2019;s Rust not only as a result of the platinum discoveries, but as a result of the reports of the commissions, because areas inhabited by white people still fall within the area which is recommended as native territory. I want to ask the Prime Minister if it would not be better if those parts, which according to the report, are regarded as native areas, should fall back as areas to be inhabited by white people. Then there is another point that I want to bring to the notice of the Prime Minister, something of great importance to the northern parts of the Transvaal, that is the control which now exists in connection with dipping tanks in areas which are native territories under the Department of Native Affairs. We have had cases of East Coast fever and it is because the cattle of the natives are under the supervision of inspectors appointed by the Native Affairs Department. We feel that all the inspectors ought to be under the Department of Agriculture and that the inspectors of the latter department should supervise the dipping tanks and alone have a say. It is said that the officials of the Department of Native Affairs are not as competent as the officials of the Agricultural Department.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STALS</person>:</from>

<p>There are a number of direct descendants from the Griqua captain, Waterboer, of whom there is one who signed himself Nicholas Waterboer, who is in particularly distressing circumstances. The fact that the payment has stopped since the death of the first Waterboer is regarded as a great injustice, as has been remarked by the Prime Minister in his statement to the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). I should like to know in what way the amount is being employed in Griqualand. The people are often in distressing circumstances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>As for the last point, I am not going to give it to the captains or would-be captains. It only leads to trouble. It is simply transferred to the Development Fund, which exists under the authority which to-day supervizes it, viz:, the department, and it will be used for the improvement of the ground of the Griquas in Griqualand, but I am not going to pay it for personal objects. I may just add here that the chiefs of the Griquas are acting in such a way that more and more of the country of the Griquas is becoming lost to them, and to-day they only possess about ten farms out of all the ground. That is just the result of the way in which the captains, sub-captains and quasi-captains went to work. As regards dipping tanks, about which the hon. member for Pietersburg (Mr. J. F. Tom Naud&#x00E9;) asked me a question, I must of course go into the matter to find out if there are any grounds for the complaints, and if it is actually necessary to supervize them. Then the Department of Agriculture will certainly have no objection to doing so, but so far I have not known of any complaint. With regard to the matter of native territories, this is not a suitable opportunity to discuss them. We are engaged on comprehensive legislation in this connection, and it would be better to say nothing about the matter now.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEANE</person>:</from>

<p>I would like the Minister to enlighten us as to the policy of the extension of irrigation to the native areas. The natives are now paying more taxation, and they are entitled to more consideration in this direction. Last season the Natal native areas were practically without rain. It is 30 years since conditions were so bad as they are to-day. The irrigated land on the Tugela, where the natives go in for intensive culture, are a credit to the Administration. During the coming season large native areas in Natal will be absolutely without grain, and I foresee trouble if the natives are not fed. They are entitled to have larger areas under irrigation. Natal lends itself to irrigation, for it has large rivers and exceptionally rich soil.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The Department will be only too glad to extend irrigation as much as possible in any of the native territories. The Department and I are fully convinced that it is absolutely necessary that natives should adopt better methods of agriculture, but we have to consider the question of funds. That is one reason why the native development fund was created.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that five farms riparian to the Umlaas River, which is the source of the water supply of Durban, are being bought from the Natal Land and Colonization Company by the Native Affairs Department, on which to locate natives displaced from a native area. The establishment of a congested native settlement upon the catchment area of the Durban water supply is bound to expose the water supply to a serious risk of pollution, and I hope the Prime Minister will state what the position is.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Last session about 300 morgen of ground on the south coast of Natal were bought by the Government from the natives for some &#x00A3;30,000. We cannot take ground belonging to the natives and not give them land elsewhere. Hence this purchase was made in the Umlaas River Valley&#x2014;that is the ground now referred <span class="col_3381-3382" refersTo="page_0643"/>to by the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick)&#x2014;in order that those natives removed from Amanzimtoti should be settled there. Unfortunately, it has been brought to my notice that, according to the opinion of some people, these natives are so situated that they may defile the head waters that have to be used by the people of Durban. I have referred this to the native commissioner, and the native commissioner has sent me a reply, in which it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Well, of course, these are objections which you always find whenever you want to get ground for the native outside the immediate area that he has already.</block>

<p>He does not think that there are any real reasons for not buying that ground and giving it to the natives. That is the position where I now stand, as far as the information is concerned which I have asked for from Natal.</p>

<speech by="#gilson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>There is a matter to which I wish to call the attention of the Minister of Native Affairs and it is one which I have brought up in this House on several occasions, that is the absolute necessity of legislative control both of recruiting of labour in the native territories, and proper control of that labour when it reaches the plantation areas in Natal. In spite of the remark of the hon. member for Natal Coast (Brig.-Gen. Arnott), when I brought this matter before this House on a previous occasion, that I was &#x201C;talking utter rot,&#x201D; I have to bring to the House to-day facts which I am sure will convince members of the necessity of something being done in this matter. These complaints have been going on for some years. They are largely concerned with the climatic conditions, in fact they became so bad two years ago that the district council of natives at Umtata decided, with the sanction of the chief magistrate, to send a delegation to enquire into the conditions prevailing on the Natal and Zululand coast. This was very finely stage-managed, by whom I do not know. I have never seen a delegation more misled&#x2014;and I say this deliberately&#x2014;than this native delegation was. We all know that the south coast is a perfect health resort in so far as the climatic conditions are concerned, but it is to the north of Durban and Zululand where the conditions are bad. The delegation was taken to various places, but the portion where the conditions are really bad was unexplored by this delegation. They were only taken as far north as La Mercy estate. Certain allegations of ill-treatment are also made. I think that plantation labour, recruited labour, is always more subject, possibly, to that sort of thing than labour that lives on a farm. I do not intend to go into that aspect of the matter, but I would draw attention to a circular issued by the Zululand Planters&#x2019; Union in which they record their disapproval of employers of native labour using methods of coercion or punishment other than those recognized by law, and also lay stress on the necessity for the prompt and regular payment of wages. A circular like that is not issued unless there are some grounds for issuing it. The principal trouble, however, lies in the climatic conditions. Let there be no doubt about the conditions that obtain in Zululand as far as labour is concerned. I have a report of the debate which took place in this House on the Zululand Railway Construction Bill two years ago, when my hon. friend the member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) said, inter alia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We investigated the incidence of malaria &#x2026; and we came to the conclusion that, although two out of three of the people we had put there on experimental farms had died from blackwater, Zululand was going to prove of such vast importance to the Union, etc.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Here I have a survey map of the Union, and the whole of Zululand is marked as serious endemic malaria, and that is from the official malarial survey map of the Union.</block>

<p>The hon. member also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The only man who can live there is the man who will take adequate precautions, who will mosquito-proof his house, keep away from water, and send his wife and family to the high country in the summer months&#x2014;the man who has enough money and intelligence to do that is a man who can live there.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) made this remark&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think it is wise that those who go to Zululand should know the dangers of malaria and not be lured into a sense of false security and settle there in the belief that it is a healthy territory.</block>

<p>I have here the report which was issued in 1925 by Mr. C. A. Wheelwright, the Native Commissioner of Natal, and Mr. Park Ross, the Assistant Native Health Officer for the Union. Speaking of plantation labour, they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no doubt that in the immediate future the cotton industry will employ a very large labour force, and that measures for the safeguarding of this labour will require the earnest consideration of the Government. The area occupied by the cotton and sugar planters to the north of Durban is liable to be visited by serious outbreaks of malaria.</block>

<p>The commission states that it would be well if such labour could be obtained from malarial districts of the Union or elsewhere, and that without most meticulous care such labour cannot hope to escape the disease. There is only one other document that I want to quote from. Every year the magistrates of the territories meet at Umtata in what they call a magisterial conference to discuss various matters affecting the administration of the territories. At the last conference one of the magistrates, Mr. Mitchell, introduced a resolution to the effect that the recruitment of natives to work on the sugar estates of Natal should be controlled, as in the ease of mines and works. He also remarked that the most important consideration of the moment was the betterment of the conditions on the sugar estates themselves. The magistrate who introduced the matter said that lots of complaints had reached his office, and not less than 100 warrants for deserting boys had been <span class="col_3383-3384" refersTo="page_0644"/>received. Another magistrate spoke of the number of boys returning from Natal with their health seriously impaired. Colonel Muller, now Secretary for Labour, said that the motion only touched the fringe of the subject, and that the position was scandalous. He also observed that some steps must be taken to control the recruiting and the conditions of plantation labour. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to refer to the answer given by the Minister of Native. Affairs to the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) about the transfer of natives to the banks of the Umlaas River. As an inhabitant of Durban, I was very disturbed at the answer of the Minister, because I think he does not realize the seriousness of the position as far as our water supply in Durban is concerned. Surely there could not have been a stronger objection made to such a transfer than the possibility of polluting the water supply of a large town like Durban. If these natives are to be put on the banks of this river I do not see how the Minister&#x2019;s department could possibly prevent the water being polluted to some extent. I would point out to mm that Durban has been spending hundreds of thousands of pounds upon the perfecting of its water supply from that river, and if all that is to be spoilt by the possibility of a native tribe being put on the banks of the river he will see how serious the position is. I hope the Minister will go into the matter himself and make sure that there is no danger of this taking place, and if there is, that it shall not take place.</p>

<p>Of course I am always prepared to hear any representations and as far as I am concerned I shall only be too glad to meet them, but in this case let me just remind my hon. friend that up to the present time the municipality has not made any representation. Judging from the report that I have got, it is really more a matter of the fears entertained by a few individuals in the neighbourhood where the natives are going to be stationed. This is all I know, and all I have done is to lay before the House the answer I have got to the reference I made in regard to this matter. If your municipality could make out a good case, then as far as possible I should certainly come to their assistance.</p>

<p>I would like the Minister to go again into the matter referred to by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow)&#x2014;That of Kadalie. My object is to point out that a most important principle is involved here. No charge has been made against this man. If he has been breaking the law he should be prosecuted. The Minister said that he would restrict him from entering into Natal by a Natal law. Is he not referring rather to the Immigrants Regulation Act of 1913&#x003F; If there is a special law of Natal dealing with it, it would be as well to know it. As far as I know this man has been going round the Union forming branches of the Industrial and Commercial Union as a trade union of the natives. I take it that the natives are just as entitled to form trade unions as the European workers. I thought the great argument was that the native allowed himself to be exploited. Surely then we should encourage him to join trade unions. At any rate, it is no crime to form a trade union. It is contended on behalf of Kadalie that his speeches have been mixed up with the speeches of other men who do not belong to the organization.</p>

<p>I say it is contended that his speeches have been mixed up with those of others. If they have not been, why has this man not been prosecuted for a breach of the law&#x003F; Surely the proper way is to prosecute and punish him for any wrong-doing that he may be guilty of, and not prevent him by administrative machinery from forming branches of a trade union. The Minister referred to the action of the previous Government. It is begging the question to say the man should not be in South Africa. If the previous Government did not take the opportunity, the law afforded them of keeping him out of South Africa that may or may not be their fault, but to-day he has the right of domiciled South African. I do say a very dangerous principle, is involved here; and if members who represent labour constituencies are going to allow a native engaged in trade union work to be administratively prevented from entering various parts of the Union, then they are breaking up everything they have told us they held sacred in the past. I do not wish to defend any man who has been doing anything criminally wrong. If he has been doing wrong let him be prosecuted, but if not, to use the administrative machinery of the law to prevent him from entering any part of the Union is simply to give the native the idea that as long as you are a white trade unionist you can address as many meetings as you like and deliver what speeches you like, and nothing will be said ; but if you are a black man the law is going to be pretty sharp upon you. For these reasons I hope the Minister will go into the matter again. Has he read Kadalie&#x2019;s speeches to see if they are of the character attributed to them&#x003F; There was a case reported to-day where a man belonging to the same organization was acquitted at Bloemfontein by the judge, in regard to certain words alleged to have been uttered by him. To condemn a man unheard, not to <span class="col_3385-3386" refersTo="page_0645"/>give him a trial and then to exclude him from organizing trades unions, is taking a step which might be fraught with dangerous consequences to other sections of the population.</p>

<p>Arising out of the Minister&#x2019;s reply to the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) when I understood him to say that the purchase of this 10,000 acres of land was merely an adjustment to replace land taken from the natives on the Natal coast by way of exchange, a matter which came up last session under the Native Release Act, and was sanctioned by this House. On that occasion I registered a protest against the department extending the native areas of Natal, in which 25 per cent, of the land has already been set aside for the natives. The Minister will remember the result of the visit of the Native Affairs Commission to Natal, when the people of Natal protested against any further land being set aside for native purposes. The transaction which was sanctioned by this House last session was an exchange of approximately 4,000 acres given by the natives for 20,000 acres, together with the sum of &#x00A3;30,000 in cash given by the Government. It is difficult to understand how the subsequent purchase of this 10,000 acres is with the object of replacing land taken from the natives when they were given 20,000 acres in exchange for these 4,000 acres on the Natal coast. My point last session was that as the result of this exchange the Government had added 16,000 acres to the native areas in the face of the protest made by the people of Natal to the Native Affairs Commission. I protested against that. If this present transaction is to go through it means that the native areas in Natal are being further augmented to the extent of 10,000 acres, making 26,000 acres in all. As I said last session I came with a mandate from my constituency to oppose any additional areas over and above those scheduled in the Natives Lands Act of 1913. European farmers resent very much having these native areas contiguous to their own holdings, as it depreciates the value of their land. Notwithstanding the protest registered by me last year, the Government are pursuing the policy of adding to the native areas. There is plenty of land already in Natal set apart for natives, and it is certainly not necessary to add to these areas. If it is not too late, I ask the Government to reconsider the matter in order that this transaction may not go through. If the Governor-General&#x2019;s consent has not yet been obtained it is not too late.</p>

<p>I hope that the Prime Minister will elucidate the reply he has already given with regard to the administrative action he has taken with regard to Mr. Kadalie. The effect of that reply was that Kadalie was not merely to be prevented from going to Natal, but if he left Johannesburg for the Cape he would be prevented from going back to Johannesburg. That could not have taken place under any Natal Act, and probably could only have been done under the Immigration Act. Is that being done as the result of any political speeches that have been made by Kadalie, or as the result of his policy of organizing the natives into trade unions, and urging them to work for higher wages&#x003F; I can understand the scare that would take place in the sugar mills of Natal when the natives, instead of the miserable wages they are getting, asked for 3s. or more a day. It would be a good thing for the white people; for the more the natives&#x2019; wages, the better it will be for the white workers. I notice that the friends of the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) are very quiet on this question of native organization to get better wages. I happened to read one of Kadalie&#x2019;s speeches about six weeks ago, reported in the &#x201C;Times of Natal&#x201D; and addressed to a meeting of natives in Pietermaritzburg; and I must say that I have never read better trade union propaganda for many a year. It is the propaganda preached by every trade union organizer in South Africa and England for a number of years. It is preposterous to take up the attitude while, on the one hand, industrializing the native to prevent him from organizing for self-protection.</p>

I rise for the purpose of referring to what has been said by the hon. member for Umvoti (Mr. Deane), who has referred to the impoverished condition of the natives in certain portions of Natal. I would like to draw attention to the impoverished condition of the natives in the Eastern Province of the Cape, and ask the Minister if he would inform the committee how the new native taxation&#x2014;the poll tax&#x2014;that was introduced last year, is being collected, and whether a large number of natives in the Eastern Province find great difficulty in paying that tax. Is it or is it not a fact, as has been represented by farmers, that if they want to secure their native labour, they themselves are obliged to find the tax, because the natives are not able to do so&#x003F; The grants for the relief of distress are reduced from &#x00A3;950 to &#x00A3;250. There is likely to be considerable distress, owing to the failure of the mealie crop, and the impoverishment of the condition of the natives.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. member said the &#x201C;colour bar Bill,&#x201D; and I will only say that those who are so much against the natives becoming organized are also voting against that Bill. When you suggest that the natives should be organized, and should ask for higher wages, the friendship of these hon. members for the natives vanishes. You love the native because he is unorganized, and because he works cheaply. It is a wrong thing to do what has been done in the case of Mr. Kadalie. I would not condone what Mr. Kadalie or any other organizers did in preaching sedition, or advocating violence, but here you are dealing with a trade union movement, and we do not want this movement to go through the experience it went through in other countries. But Mr. Kadalie is to be taken as a native trade union organizer, and if he kicks over the traces and says things which are contrary to law, then, as the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) says, you must proceed against him under the law ; but it is a different thing to interfere with him because he is organizing the natives on trade union lines. I want to ask the Prime Minister not to be led away on this sort of question by your Maj. Triggers. The evidence given on this Bill before the select committee by such gentlemen goes to show mat they regard Kadalie as a clever man who is organizing the natives industrially, but that does not prove that Mr. Kadalie is the menace to society that some hon. members think he is.</p>

<p>You have the Auditor-General drawing attention to the non economic nature of certain white labour, and he says that where you employ Europeans where you could have employed natives, it is non economic and un-businesslike. That is to say, the whole basis of society, so far as the working class is concerned, must be the cheapest procurable native labour. I want to see the natives organized industrially and politically in the same way as the white folk, as that is the only way in which the organized white workers can maintain their position. I do not wish to see the Prime Minister interfere with genuine organizing work. The hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) quoted from a report of the sugar industry, which showed how disgracefully the natives were treated, and perhaps that was why Kadalie wanted to go down to that part of the country. If the natives there were organized industrially, they would demand better conditions of labour. If Kadalie departs from trade union principles, I should condemn him as soon as any man; but if his sole idea is to lift the natives up in society, I want to see the Government encourage that policy. If the Prime Minister does anything to interfere with the industrial organization of the natives or the coloured man or the white man, he will drive the movements underground, and it will be bad for South Africa.</p>

<p>I wish to express a certain amount of disappointment at the vote for nine agricultural demonstrators and the sum of just over &#x00A3;1,000. I feel it is a question in regard to which the Minister should take immediate action. We all know that in the native areas the position is critical and serious, and that the land of these natives in these areas is steadily deteriorating in production, and that the natives themselves are steadily going down into abject poverty. They are living on the border line of starvation, and it is a matter which requires immediate attention. I should like to see some organizing carried out on a fairly large scale, say a large department of the Agricultural Department devoting its attention to the cultivation of the land in the native areas. What can nine native demonstrators do&#x003F; Surely they require a European at the head of them to direct their efforts. Have these demonstrators been specially trained for this purpose, and what are their qualifications&#x003F; I feel this ought really to have the attention of our Minister, because, after all, the native question is a very serious one, and the condition of the natives is such as to demand his special attention. If he wishes to see a contented native race on the land, he should strain every effort to give them the opportunity to learn how to cultivate their land, and so to get crops that will at any rate keep them and afford them some decency of life. I hope the Minister will turn his special attention to this evil, and see that something is done very soon. It would make a lot of difference to the natives if they saw that the Government recognized the position and were taking special action.</p>

<p>Further to the question put to the Prime Minister by the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick), I feel quite certain I <span class="col_3389-3390" refersTo="page_0647"/>am voicing the opinion of my colleagues and myself when I say that we appreciate the reasonable manner in which the Prime Minister has met this question, but I want to go further and ask the Prime Minister if he will be agreeable to postpone any further negotiations, or, let me say, to start the placing of natives on that area until a full investigation has been made. I believe, under the Land Act of 1913, before this grant of land can be conferred, it has to go before the Governor-General-in-Council for sanction. If that has not been done, the Prime Minister might delay any further development in this direction. The Prime Minister referred to the fact that the Durban municipality had made an offer of land in that area which was, I presume, the farm called &#x201C;Clifton,&#x201D; but the municipality made that offer on one condition, namely, that a certain area on the banks of the river was reserved and fenced off so that the natives would not have the opportunity of making use of the land right down to the banks of the river. That was in order to save any possibility of pollution so far as the catchment area was concerned, but with the present sale of land, if I might so put it, the area which the natives are to be permitted to utilize goes right down to the river itself. That is one of the main objections we have to the granting of that land. I do not think it is necessary again to point out to the Prime Minister that there ;is very great difficulty in tracing the causes of typhoid and kindred diseases, and the municipality for the last three or four years have found it necessary in the Umzindusi catchment area to try and co-operate with the native area and to get the Native Department to co-operate with them in order to move that concourse of natives from the catchment area for that very reason. They feel that the catchment area is unwittingly being polluted through the occupation of that land, and we in Durban are trying to get the Government to avoid the same possibility occurring in our area. The municipality has spent a million pounds on the development of the scheme, which is to hold good for 25 years. I do not think it is unreasonable to ask the Prime Minister to withhold any further settlement of the natives until a further full investigation has been made and the opportunity has been given for presenting full representation to the Prime Minister before it goes before the Governor-General-in-Council for final confirmation.</p>

<p>I should be only too glad, if it can be pointed out that it will have the effect on the water which the inhabitants of Durban are developing eventually. I think it would be unwise to take any further steps; but I do hope my friends in Natal will assist me in getting what I think is only fair, namely, the necessary ground for these natives. Otherwise, I do not think the Natal members would last year have granted the right to dispose of the natives&#x2019; grounds unless they looked upon it as a necessity that the Government should restore to the natives the ground they have taken away. In regard to the remarks of the hon. member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson) he came to see me about that question, and I gave him whatever information I had on that point, but as far as I can still recollect, it was that, after all, the 20,000 that was given to the natives was within the demarcated native area. There again I quite agree that once we have decided upon giving to the native within certain areas certain ground, we should not go outside that and give more outside. That would be contrary to what the law of 1913 contemplated. In regard to the hon. member for Queenstown&#x2019;s (Mr. Moffat) remarks about demonstrators, a good many young natives are being trained and trained very well in the native territory, for the purpose of acting as teachers on their own behalf, or otherwise in the employ as demonstrators, but he must not make the mistake of thinking that these nine are the only demonstrators. These are the ones paid for by the Government. The bunga is also paying for quite a number. These also in future will be paid for out of monies to come in to the development fund, and the monies which are going into that fund will be at the disposal of the authorities. There is a European supervisor in charge who will be paid for out of the Union vote. He is there to-day. With regard to Kadalie, I was asked whether I resorted the Immigration Act or a special Natal Act. I resorted to a special Natal Act affecting Natal, and I think quite rightly. We must not forget that Natal is in a position different to any of the other provinces, and that, while we are quite prepared to run risks in other provinces, we may not run the same risks in Natal. May I point out that the whole question has nothing to do with trade unions. The natives can have as many trade unions as they like. This is really a measure for safety, and I would not have done my duty if I had not stopped him from going down to Natal. The right hon. member for Port Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) has put me several questions. Up to this moment I did not know of the position threatening to be bad ; I won&#x2019;t say very serious, but bad. The Chief Native Commissioner (Mr. Norton) just arrived to-day, and I am told that he has told the Chief of the Department that things are not as good ; in fact, things are likely to be bad. I am glad the hon. member drew my attention to it. At the same time, as far as the funds provided for here are concerned, I may say that the Treasury has never stinted on any occasion the necessary monies for coming to the assistance in such case. As far as the taxes are concerned, they will only be due in the locations on July 1. I believe that we shall find that a great many natives will not be able to pay. Very well, we shall simply have to go without. The law does not tell us that we must suck blood out of a stone.</p>

<p>Section 5 of the Native Urban Areas Act states that Government may compel all natives living in the limits of any urban area, or any specified portion thereof, other than those exempted, to reside in a location, native village or hostel. Obviously, natives should not be required to live in a location, native village or hostel until there <span class="col_3391-3392" refersTo="page_0648"/>is room in these places for them. But a proclamation was issued bringing Johannesburg under the Act at a time when there was no room in the location for possibly one-twentieth or one-fiftieth of the native population. Technically, every native in the urban area of Johannesburg is, to-day, committing an offence, because he is disobeying the order to live in the native location. The authorities are trying to effect the removals sectionally. For instance, the natives living in Doornfontein are told to remove to the location, but the natives see their friends next door at Braamfontein are left unmolested, and this leads to a sense of injustice on the part of the natives. The Doornfontein natives, however, do not go to a location, but try to find quarters elsewhere in the municipal area. About three months ago a native was prosecuted in Johannesburg. He was one of some hundreds who had been ordered to leave Doornfontein, but instead of going to a location he proceeded to the New Clare Township, which is inhabited almost entirely by natives, who were rounded up and prosecuted. The native to whom I referred was charged with disobeying this particular section. The magistrate, however, held that this part of the Natives Urban Area Act was entirely valueless insofar as its penal provisions applying to the natives are concerned. The magistrate stated that a native who disobeyed an order of this sort could not be punished, and that the only way to enforce the order was to make use of sub-section (3) of section 5, which makes it an offence to harbour a native who has been told to live in a location. I should have thought if the Native Affairs Department did not agree with that judgment it would have appealed, but I am told that legal advice was taken and the magistrate&#x2019;s judgment was accepted as being correct. If that is so, what is the position&#x003F; There are tens of thousands of natives at Johannesburg who have been told to live in locations. Everyone of them can set the order at defiance, and the only means of redress the department has is to prosecute persons harbouring natives. In order to obtain a conviction against a harbourer it would have to be shown that the defendant knew that the native was one to whom the order applied. I was consulted professionally on the matter, and my view was that practically the utility of this portion of the Act had been wrecked by the magistrate's judgment. I think the magistrate&#x2019;s view is correct.</p>

<p>Of course, the only alternative in a place like Johannesburg would be to leave the municipality to complete the location whenever it liked. But unfortunately, we have to declare that a municipality falls under the Act in order to compel the municipality to build a location ; otherwise the whole of the Act would be frustrated. We are getting the municipalities to act, and they are acting fairly fast. Although Johannesburg was slow to move, when once we got it to make a start it moved very reasonably and satisfactorily. The department insists on the cleaning up of Johannesburg going on at a certain rate. For that purpose the municipality can take only a certain section, as it would cost millions to erect locations to provide for all the natives in Johannesburg. All that we can do under the circumstances is to make the best of a bad job, and I think Johannesburg is making the best of it in conjunction with the Government. As regards the magistrate&#x2019;s judgment, it was referred to the Attorney-General, who held that the judgment was wrong. Another case will be brought, and if the magistrate decides again in the same way the case will be taken to appeal.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a matter which is of considerable importance to stock farmers in Natal, and that is in regard to the removal of stock thieves from the area where a theft has been committed to an area where no stock farming is carried on. Under section 37 of the Natal code, power is given to the Governor-General-in-Council, after consultation with the Natal Native Trust, to shift any native from one area to another in Natal where it is deemed expedient in the general public good to do so. Ever since the Natal code was passed successive governments have exercised that power to shift native stock thieves where application has been made upon petition by tile farmers in the district where the native resided, and where the stock theft was committed. Each case has been considered on its merits. I understand that the Minister of Native Affairs has now laid down as a matter of policy that this power will not be exercised unless there has been a second conviction. The reason, I understand, given for this is that, under the Stock Theft Act passed in 1922 or 1923, no provision is made for the removal of any native and that, ill exercising this power, the department would really be penalizing a mail twice. I submit that it takes years to catch a stock thief ; in fact, in some cases you never do catch them. It is a most difficult thing, I submit, to convict a stock thief twice. The natives realize the seriousness of the offence. When a native takes the risk of committing a theft he realizes that he is liable to a very heavy penalty. I submit that there is no better penalty and no better deterrent against the native stock thief than the fact that he knows that there is the possibility and probability of his being removed from his tribe and from his chief and placed with another tribe and subject to another chief. I submit further that usually when a native commits a theft he contaminates the other natives in the area in which he lives. Only recently I received a telegram from the chairman of the Newcastle Farmers&#x2019; Union, reading as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">See Minister re deportation stock thieves, Newcastle. Native Commission, Natal, <span class="col_3393-3394" refersTo="page_0649"/>seems unable to act. Farmers&#x2019; Union press immediate action.</block>

<p>There have lately been a series of convictions for stock thefts in Newcastle and on petition by the farmers in that area they have been informed that the department have decided not to exercise the powers under section 37 of the Natal code unless and until there has been a second conviction. According to the last census, the total number of sheep and goats in Natal was 2,697,000 and, in that year, 1923. the total number of sheep and goats stolen and missing was 154,000. In my own constituency (Utrecht) there were 221,000 sheep and goats, and in 1923 the total number stolen and missing was 6,025. In the Newcastle district there were 153,000 sheep and goats, and the total number stolen and missing in 1923 was 2,760. The only effective way, in my opinion, of dealing with stock thefts is to apply this very good section of the Natal code in every case where there has been a conviction, and where the police, supported by the magistrate, give a report that they are satisfied that the native concerned is an undesirable, and that for the public good he should be shifted to another area. I hope the Minister will seriously consider this matter from the farmers&#x2019; point of view, and give a clear reply as to what exactly is the policy of his department.</p>

<p>I have laid down that rule for the department in regard to the removal of natives for stock theft. I did it, not because I would not like very much to protect the farmers against these thieves, because I know how difficult it is to catch them and I think the hon. member rather understated when he said that some of them are never caught. To my mind 90 per cent, of them are never caught, but unfortunately when the Stock Theft Act was passed in 1923 the question arose and when it was proposed that not a similar but a much milder provision should be introduced for the Native Territories in the Cape, Parliament would not hear of it. What I felt was that you must take into consideration, in the first place, what the feeling of Parliament is as representing, as it were, the whole people on a matter like this and then try to go so far as to give an assurance that, at any rate, when the same crime is committed a second time this additional punishment should be inflicted. I am prepared to assume, subject to the hon. member (Mr. Nell convincing me of it, that the position in Natal is so different from the rest of the Union that it is really necessary that this additional punishment should be given on a first conviction and I am quite prepared, if that can he shown to me, to go back upon the line I have laid down for the department and say that we should follow and give effect to the Natal law in full. The course is for the magistrate to recommend and there is, of course, the guarantee that your magistrate would not recommend this additional punishment unless he felt sure that there is a reasonable necessity for it. Since the matter was raised I have been thinking it over and if the line I have adopted is not proving effective, I am prepared to adopt the other and accept the recommendation of the magistrate after a first conviction.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS WATT</person>:</from>

<p>I am very glad to hear the promise made by the Minister to look into this matter again, because I can assure him that the farmers in the northern parts of Natal, who have been suffering heavy losses from stock thefts recently, are perturbed at the decision which has been come to. When the code was enacted the native chiefs were consulted about this particular clause, and they agreed that it was a clause which would enable them to govern their tribes with greater ease, and give them more control over their own people. Up to that date there were heavy losses sustained by sheep farmers in the Newcastle and Dundee district, to such an extent that many men are going out of sheep farming altogether, but this clause had very good effects indeed. The action of the Government was taken in this way, that a native was taken from the district where he had been stealing sheep and placed in a district where there were no sheep, somewhere on the coast, and that was looked upon by him, no doubt, as a very severe punishment, but as a very great deterrent to other evildoers. I put this point to the Minister, that it is very difficult, first of all, to obtain a conviction for stock thefts, and a sheep thief may go for months or years without detection, but when he is detected, and convicted and punished, surely it is no greater hardship for him to be sent out of his own district into another part of Natal, than it is for a man who is convicted of some crime or offence for which he may be deported. I think the two cases are very analogous, and owing to the heavy losses which have been sustained in Natal, I am very glad indeed that the Minister is going to reconsider his decision in this matter.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to deal with a matter not yet touched upon, and that is the system of government in the Transkeian territories. As the Minister knows, we govern there by proclamation. In the old Cape days an Act of Parliament did not ipso facto apply to the Transkei ; it had to be specially applied and could be amended. Ever since Union, every Act passed in this House applies ipso facto to the territories. We have the anomalous position there that Acts passed in this House came into force and we are also subject to control by proclamation and a difficult position has arisen. We now have a further addition in the issue of regulations by different Ministers. It is difficult enough to keep in touch with proclamations, but when we have regulations framed by various Ministers, the position becomes almost impossible. Recently the Minister of Labour issued a proclamation under the Conciliation Act in regard to one of the industrial institutions, laying down an order that in the Transkei the same wages would be paid for Europeans, coloured men and natives. In Umtata and two or three other places where we have a printing business, we have to pay the same wages to natives as we have to pay to Europeans. I do not think that is the policy of the Minister. I do suggest that before any&#x003F; <span class="col_3395-3396" refersTo="page_0650"/>of these regulations made by Ministers of other departments are imposed in the territory, they should go through the ordinary course and be proclaimed by the Minister of Native Affairs. The Department of Native Affairs will then be able to keep in touch with the different matters legislated upon in the territories, and pursue a common policy. Then we shall know exactly where we are. I would like to hear from the Minister, if he does not intend to accept that suggestion, how he proposes to deal with the matter. I trust he will explain exactly what attitude he intends taking up to meet the difficulties which have arisen there. A further point I wish to deal with is the question of the divorce courts in the territories. Ever since 1879 we have had divorce courts, specially proclaimed under proclamation, dealing with native cases. We all know that the native cannot afford to go to Grahamstown, which is the nearest high court, but for some reason last year the old proclamation was de-proclaimed and the natives had to go to the higher courts to get their divorces. Last year the Minister said he was introducing an Act this session which would meet the difficulty. Such an Act has not come into force, and in the meantime dozens and dozens of natives want to get these divorces. In view of the numbers of divorce cases that are accumulating up there, the Minister might consider the advisability of reverting to the old procedure until this new Bill of his comes into force. I would further like to know from the Minister what he intends doing to aid the industrial development of the natives. I see that on the Estimates a sum of &#x00A3;200 is devoted to the industrial development of the natives in the territories. I would like the Minister to explain how that amount is utilized. A further point is in connection with the land that was recently purchased at Glen Grey. Natives from that area, I presume, will be drawn from the congested locations and placed upon that land. My personal view is that they are not rich enough to pay the heavy interest and redemption charges that will be involved. The native, as we know, lives under a communal system, and he understands that particular method of owning ground, and I think in developing that piece of country, and settling natives upon it, the system which prevails in other parts of the country should be allowed to continue there, that is, that out and out titles should not be given to each particular native occupying land in that particular area. I suggest that a system be introduced to make the whole of that area pay for that particular land. After all is said and done, if natives congested in a location are placed on other land, it assists those who are in the congested area. I would like to ask the Minister exactly how he intends to deal with that particular aspect. The last matter is that of Kadalie, which is one which interests us in the territories, because I see a resolution has been passed in the Native Council and numerous resolutions passed at native meetings protesting against the action taken against him. The Government should explain to the natives what the reason was for preventing Kadalie from visiting Natal. We have to face this particular factor&#x2014;that we must not make the natives think that we are afraid of any of their organizers or agitators. We must allow the natives clearly to understand that we are not afraid of Kadalie as a trade unionist and an organizer of his people. But if the Prime Minister has evidence that Kadalie is causing unrest, he should make that clear. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>There seems to be a good deal of consensus of opinion among hon. members who know the conditions of the natives that their economic conditions are getting worse. I read a report of Prof. Macmillan in which he points out that the condition of 40,000 natives in the Herschel district is undoubtedly worse economically than some years ago, and that they are not producing enough to keep themselves. I wish to suggest to the Prime Minister that he might have an economic survey made of the native territories, which would be extremely interesting and would be a guide, and it might also enquire into the cause of their going backward. I see in this report of the Native Affairs Commission that they urge upon the Government the institution of native councils with as little delay as possible; in the first place, because the native members of the annual conferences are partly elected from these native councils. Under the Act of 1920 the Governor-General may establish local native councils, and so far as I can make out, not many of these have been created, especially outside the native territories. The necessity for these native councils becomes greater after the Native Taxation Bill became law, and that has become law.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In answer to the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), I may say that, as far as these native councils are concerned, they have never been kept back by this Government. We have been trying to get them going on as fast as possible ; but on the recommendation of the Native Affairs Commission, it was not found expedient to get them their councils before certain powers had been taken which were taken in the Native Act of last year, or in other words, a certain amendment had been brought into the 1920 Act. Since that time they are going on and forming these councils. I have on the order list a small Bill asking for an amendment of the 1920 Act. We are acting in conjunction with the Native Affairs Commission in order to allow the natives to get these councils. As far as the economic position of the natives in Glen Grey is concerned, it has been well known for several years that the Glen Grey natives are getting into a state of congestion in that district. That is why last year &#x00A3;50,000 was voted for the purchase of certain farms, and this year another &#x00A3;50,000 will be voted for the further purchase of farms there. Anybody who goes through the territories will find, and it is the common opinion of those in authority there, that your native does not, in the first place, work the ground as he should, and does not get anything out of the ground like what he ought to, and in the second place, as far as stock is concerned, firstly, it is in <span class="col_3397-3398" refersTo="page_0651"/>ferior stock, and secondly, he insists on overstocking the whole country with cattle, whereas the time for cattle breeding has passed on such a scale as the native is used to do, so that he is not economically using his opportunities today, and that is one of the reasons why we have resorted to the system of agricultural demonstrators, and why we have already two places in the territories where there is a kind of agricultural school. It was surprising to me to see the number of native students attending these schools, but in the meantime there is not the least doubt that because of the growth of population in these territories the natives individually&#x2014;I will not say collectively&#x2014;are poorer, and that is one of the reasons why the Native Development Fund was instituted last year. The hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) spoke about that proclamation business. I am afraid it is not an easy thing. I won&#x2019;t say that some means cannot be found to assist the people there in what they are after ; the difficulties they are feeling with the awkward state of things, in consequence of the laws of the Union ipso facto being made applicable there, but I am afraid we cannot adopt his suggestion, as that would mean that the Native Affairs Department would practically have to control all the regulations under all the laws issued by the various Ministers.</p>

There are so many points that have to be carefully considered by the department, the legal advisers and myself, that we have not been able to do more than bring it to the stage that more or less we can be sure that it will come before Parliament next session. In regard to this question of the divorce courts, I think the hon. member will remember that I did express myself in favour of those natives getting their divorces as near home as possible, and I hope this will be one of the measures which will be treated in that Bill.</p>

<p>In regard to the industrial development of the natives, I practically stated that in the native territories this will now be dependent on the moneys which We hope are going to come into the development fund, and as these come in we shall be in a position to know what they will be. After July, more or less, probably not before December, we will be in a position to know what we can expect from them, but I have the greatest hopes that this fund being instituted, and the moneys to be set apart for that purpose, will result in the native territories being in a better position than ever before, to come to development. The hon. member raised the question of the possibility of the natives paying for the lands we have bought at present, and have been bought in the Glen Grey district and so on. I do not think the department contemplates these lands being bought by these natives in a hurry, and all that we shall have to do will be to let these natives, as they do in other parts of the Union, pay rent, whether eventually they will buy or take over. But that is what is taking place in other provinces ; so that it is not a question of their being able to pay back the moneys at present paid for these farms. All the Government will say is :: &#x201C;There are farms at your disposal,&#x201D; and then get those who go there to pay rent as tenants.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to refer to a matter which I brought up last year. It is the old standing question of the migration of natives into the towns, looking for employment and causing congestion. This is still going on. We have asked that some control should be exercised in issuing these passes. I understand that recently a number of natives arrived in a congested labour area&#x2014;Cape Town&#x2014;when there was no work for them. I know Governments have repeatedly stated they cannot control these removals. If the native asks for a pass to look for work he must get it. The Government only can bring in legislation to control the natives if power to do so is needed. Every town and municipality complain of locations being crowded, and natives being allowed to come forward ; and apparently there is no control even in the way of advising the natives where they can go and obtain employment. This being such a practical matter, I trust it will claim the practical attention of the department. The other question I will mention is the way in which natives employed on the mines are being sent home without being subjected to official medical examination to see if they have contracted miners phthisis. At three stations they are shipped off without such medical inspection, to avoid compensation for miners&#x2019; phthisis. This is an injustice. These natives are brought from their homes to work the gold industry ; to assist in making profits which grow larger and larger every year, and which, as we have frequently pointed out, go overseas to a considerable extent. I want to know why the native department does not fully protect these natives in that they are subjected to strict official medical examination, so that they can get the compensation due to them. Many of these natives when they come back to the labour area, to <span class="col_3399-3400" refersTo="page_0652"/>be taken on the mines, are told that they cannot be employed, because they have contracted miners&#x2019; phthisis. Where did they acquire the disease&#x2014;in their locations&#x003F; No! They receive no compensation. We cannot expect natives to work on the mines unless they obtain fair treatment. There are three stations on the Rand where the boys are sent and escape the examination in order to save wealthy mines payment of compensation. The natives should have a square deal. I put a question on the paper the other day in regard to this matter, but members are very cleverly put off in regard to questions. Apparently, I omitted to use the word &#x201C;officials&#x201D; in regard to medical examinations, and was answered accordingly. It is usually a case of &#x201C;cross questions and crooked answers.&#x201D; That is the attitude towards members by those who prepare replies that are put into the hands of Ministers.</p>

<speech by="#sephton">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SEPHTON</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased that some provision has been made for improving the salaries of headmen. Such a recognition is long overdue. Headmen&#x2019;s duties are arduous and very varied&#x2014;they have to act as police-mien, justices of the peace, assist in the collection of taxes, and they are also noxious weed inspectors; further, they have to maintain order. We have 22 headmen in the district of Herschel, and their average annual salary is &#x00A3;13 9s. 1d. That is altogether inadequate. On the other hand, a policeman who rides a horse and is provided with uniform draws an average annual wage of &#x00A3;57 to &#x00A3;60 a year, although his duties are not nearly so important as those of a headman. During an enquiry held in 1923, evidence was given showing how headmen could assist in the suppression of stock thefts. Their help in this respect would be invaluable. It would be wise, instead of having a large number of native policemen, to make better use of the headmen and to pay them more. Some time ago I held a meeting of headmen in the Herschel district, and suggested that any headman who failed to carry out his duties should be dismissed, that they should be better paid, have larger responsibilities, and that their tenure of office should be dependent on their doing their duty. They said they would welcome this. If this suggestion were adopted, headmen would be able to stop disorders in the native reserves. In many cases headmen, unfortunately, connive at stock thefts. Police officers have suggested that headmen should be rewarded for assisting in the detection of stock thefts, but that would have a bad effect, and it would be better to let them know that they would be liable to lose their posts unless they assisted to suppress thieving and generally to fulfil their duty. We should have headmen drawing better pay and given responsibilities, and so taking the place of a large number of policemen who are not doing nearly such good work as they might do if they steadfastly set their minds thereto.</p>

<p>Reverting to my remarks regarding the conditions under which labour is worked on the plantations, the matter was discussed at a magistrates&#x2019; conference at Umtata.</p>

<p>This is a very deep grievance, and the whole matter of recruiting labour requires controlling. Mr. Norton, the Native Commissioner of the Cis-kei, said that the question was, why did not Natal use its own labour&#x003F; Mr. Brownlee said that a large number of the natives were in the fever area. I take it that every hon. member will accept the position that the climatic conditions, especially in Zululand, are absolutely against the existing class of labour which is working there. The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) has told the House that the Natal sugar industry pays the highest native wages in the agricultural industry. That is perfectly correct, and yet at the same time the hon. member tells the House that the desertions are appalling. The only step taken so far is to pass a clause in the Bill of the hon. member for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins), bringing these natives who are working on shift under the Masters and Servants Act, and making them liable to punishment for desertion. The desertions do exist, but what is the reason&#x003F; These natives are taken from an absolutely healthy area to areas which these reports indicate to be absolutely a pest-hole at certain times of the year as far as malaria is concerned. The first thing that a native thinks of when he gets ill is to return to his home. He sees his fellows dying round him, he makes for his home ; can you blame him&#x003F; I do urge upon the Minister that we must have control at both ends. The sugar planters complain that they are getting the riff-raff from the territories. The fact is that they take what the gold mines will not accept. There is an absence of legislative control and medical examination. These boys go forward without any examination, and it has been freely said that they are not in a fit state to work. I do ask the Minister if it is not time something was done to control this situation. We want the boys to have proper contracts, we want those contracts to be protected, and we want the natives to be examined, so that only sound boys are sent away. We want to see that proper feeding and housing conditions are given the boys on these estates. Another aspect of this question is the unsuitability of the Transkeian natives altogether for work in these malarial areas in Zululand. I do urge upon the Minister these two things&#x2014; firstly, the introduction of legislation controlling recruiting and the conditions under which the boys are working, and secondly, the advisability and, indeed, the necessity of allowing Portuguese natives who are acclimatized to go into the malaria-infected districts of the Union.</p>

<speech by="#nicholls">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deal fully with the charges which the hon. member (Mr. Gilson) has brought forward, and also the conditions under which labour is employed in Natal and the causes of the mortality which has occurred there. The hon. member has made charges against the sugar and cotton industries which I entirely refute. Let me first say that the sugar industry is subjected to the same inspection by the Native Affairs inspectors as the mines are. We have at Eshowe, in <span class="col_3401-3402" refersTo="page_0653"/>Zululand, a Native Affairs inspector who has the right of entry to go on to all estates and see that the public health orders regarding housing are properly carried out. I have here a circular letter from the Native Affairs Department addressed to various inspectors, in which the Minister of Public Health authorizes them to enter upon land or premises in Zululand, make any inspection or perform any work that may be necessary under certain sections of the Public Health Act. Further correspondence on the subject shows that, so far as the housing conditions are concerned, all the orders that are issued by the Public Health authorities are being carried out, and carried out with willingness by all the planters in Natal. The official documents disclose that the bad treatment and sickness complained of does not lie at the doors of the sugar industry. The trouble does not arise there. The hon. member has touched upon a very much deeper phase of the whole question than has appeared on the surface. Following its white labour policy to the bitter end, the Government has put an end to the introduction of Portuguese labour which has been coming over the borders of Zululand and the Eastern Transvaal for many years past. This labour has filtered over without any let or hindrance, with the direct encouragement of the Government for years. It has been the means of developing economically portions of the country that would never otherwise be developed. The procedure in the past has been that a Portuguese native, who perhaps does not want to work on the mines, has presented himself at one of the stations along the border and asked for an inward permit, and without any difficulty that has been given to him, and he has come down to seek work on the sugar or cotton estates or on the farms in the eastern Transvaal or northern Natal. That has been stopped. The natives have been warned that if they come over the border they will be arrested, and they have been arrested. They have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment as prohibited immigrants. The whole policy of the past in getting this labour to develop our resources has been reversed. What is the result&#x003F; The Government has allotted a large area of land in northern Zululand, which is the most malarious land in the Union. The men selected for these farms are people who have shown the Land Board that they have the necessary foresight and ability and the capital to win out ; and their first endeavour to develop their holdings is frustrated by the policy of the Government. Instead of being able to get the acclimatized labour which exists in plenty a few miles away, they have had to send down to recruiting agents in Maritzburg and elsewhere, and they get the riff-raff of the Union. This non-immune labour comes up into these malarious regions for which they are quite unfitted. They get malaria, are unable to work, become discontented, and desert, causing considerable loss and delay to the settlers. The cotton planters, who are the people mostly concerned, do look after these people when they become ill. I want to show how foolish this policy is, even from an economic point of view. If you turn to page 147 of the Economic Commission&#x2019;s report, it says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is little doubt South Africa is underpopulated in the sense that an increase in population would lead to the more effective exploitation of the great natural resources, and to an increase in wealth production per head. The utilization of imported labour will have the same effect as the utilization of imported capital, and increase the funds available for wages.</block>

<p>Certainly in the malarial districts of Zululand no other labour except acclimatized labour will ever be able to work there. The attempt has been made to fasten the onus for the state of affairs commented upon in the correspondence read by the hon. member upon the sugar and cotton industries. I am going to place the guilt where it properly belongs. I am going to prove to the House, by correspondence placed on the Table by the Minister, that the Government has been guilty of criminal folly in sending men to their death when they were firmly warned that if the men went there they would die. By preventing the importation of acclimatized Portuguese labour for work in northern Zululand, they have sent many natives to their death. At the beginning of the session, I asked for reports from the Railway, Native Affairs and Public Health Departments on the subject of native labour in Zululand, and I have here a mass of letters placed on the Table by the Ministers concerned. When the construction of the line from Matubatuba to Pongola was decided upon, it was thought that perhaps white labour might be used in the construction. The Department was then warned by medical authority that if they used white labour they would die, and it would be criminal to do so. The Government was impressed by the evidence, and decided upon native labour. Anyone who knows anything about human resistance to disease knows that the European resists malaria much better than the non-immune native, and if it was criminal to send Europeans to work in Zululand then it was criminal to send natives from Pondoland and the Transkei, who were already physically unfit, and less able to withstand a malarial climate than the European. On the 8th December. 1924, this is what was said by the medical officer in regard to the railway construction&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is an undesirable class of natives being recruited. Syphilis and tuberculosis cases have been detected and sent away, but two are at present so ill that they cannot be sent away. The climate here demands a robust type of native, well fed and cared for, and the Administration is only out for disaster unless these points are attended to, which is not the case at present. The same applies to the contractors&#x2019; boys. Disease among them increases, and the Administration should undertake entire supervision.</block>

<p>This was in December, 1924, just at the entrance to the malarial season, and instead of <span class="col_3403-3404" refersTo="page_0654"/>taking these natives away and sending natives who were immune, the Government allowed this condition of things to go on. On the 27th of February, 1925, the Public Health authority in Durban wrote to the Secretary for Public Health&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The position at the contractors&#x2019; camps is not good. Medical attention is furnished by the Administration, and is satisfactory, having regard to transport difficulties. The contractors are supposed to send sick natives to the Administration hospital. Some have done so; the majority have not. Natives continue to roll up at hospital, having come from various camps up to 40 miles distant. These natives have no admission order, and say that on turning ill they have been turned off, presumably to save hospital fees. One case has been treated and sent to the police. These, questions are serious matters, involving human life.</block>

<p>These natives, turned off by the contractors, stream down the line. They do not die on the formation ; they die on the way home, or after arrival ; and these are the people the sugar industry and the cotton industry are charged with killing. On the 1st of April, the Public Health Officer at Durban wrote to the Medical Officer of Health here&#x2014;</p>

<p>I rise to support all that has been said by the right hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt). In my own division there have been heavy losses on the crops, and this has led to very great distress. It is not only the natives who are suffering from starvation, but our Europeans as well. We have one of the most congested areas as far as the natives are concerned, and the Minister knows that himself, seeing that he has visited that part. An amount of &#x00A3;250 is put down for the relief of distress. On the agricultural vote &#x00A3;16,000 was put down for drought distress under the Relief Act, that is for Europeans, and &#x00A3;200,000 for unemployment&#x2014;practically also to be used for relief for Europeans ; but only a paltry &#x00A3;250 is put down for the relief of distress of the natives. I am very pleased that such a large number of hon. members have mentioned the native agricultural demonstrators. The Minister has told us that they should be paid out of the development fund. Do hon. members think that this is right, and that this, fund, which comes out of the native direct taxation, should be charged to provide these native demonstrators&#x003F; This should come out of general revenue. If it is charged to the development fund it will become overloaded. I should like to know what provision is to be made for the establishment of native councils, and how many will there be in Kingwilliamstown&#x003F; The natives have been asking for this, and I should like to know what progress has been made. What workable understanding has been arrived at with the Divisional Council in connection with taxation&#x003F;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to continue the story where I left off. The administration were warned of the amount of life that was being lost, and they used every remedy but the right one ; that is, to take the non-immune natives away and bring immune natives in. On the 12th May it was decided to push ahead with the mosquito-proof defences, and anyone who knows anything of natives at all knows that mosquito-proof houses are very little safeguard. Owing to the difficulty of having to move camps from place to place, it is almost impossible to keep the natives in a mosquito-proof house. The resident medical officer began to feel that he was being blamed for the state of things, and he wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have already pointed out that the recruiting agents are sending up boys suffering from phthisis, congenital hip luxation, and the like, as fit for the work. Phthisis patients have a small chance in life under suitable conditions and climate, but in the low veld, as here on this construction, they only add to our sick list and death rate, and unless a vigilant eye is kept on the class of boy employed on this line, our death rate will be abnormally high.</block>

<p>On the 20th August the general manager of railways wrote to the secretary of public health that there were some 60 deaths amongst natives employed by the contractors. Why, this is a battle&#x2014;a campaign being carried on. The railway medical officer considers that approximately 30 per cent, died of malaria uncomplicated, although badly nourished, 40 per cent, of malaria complicated with phthisis, scurvy and influenza, and 10 per cent, of dysentery. I have just received information to-day that last month the Railway Administration sent up six Europeans and a gang of natives to remove part of the old bridge left by the flood of a couple of years ago. While erecting their huts one of the six Europeans died of blackwater fever, and a native died, and the whole gang had to be removed without doing the work that they had to do. So little recognition is there of the climate. There is no record in this number of deaths of those who died on the way home. We know that 80 died on the spot, and we can only guess, how many died on the road. The general manager puts the blame On the Government for its policy, because he himself had tried to obtain immunized labour to work there, but owing to the white labour policy, he could not bring <span class="col_3405-3406" refersTo="page_0655"/>this about. On the 5th September we have this from the Union Health Department. It is the strongest indictment I could possibly make&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I agree with the general manager that it is unfortunate that the native labour is recruited from districts where the boys are unaccustomed to the conditions obtaining in the low veld, and I would like to be allowed to express it in a different way. It is a very unfortunate thing that the Railway Department is employing non-immune native labour in a highly malarious area. I agree that the difficulties of getting immune labour within the Union are very great, but I am also aware that there is an enormous immune labour supply just over the Portuguese border, the bulk of which goes to the Transvaal mines, where immunity from malaria is no advantage.</block>

<p>This is from the Union Officer of Health. On the 19th September the Secretary for Native Affairs found it necessary to write to the general manager of railways in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the words of the Assistant Health Officer, Natal, there has at no time in the history of the Union been a major work relying mainly on native labour which has been conducted in so unhealthy a spot.</block>

<p>We cannot bring immune labour over to our country because of the policy adopted by the Government for their exclusion. There is another malarial season ahead, and still the same position, with the Government taking no notice, although these natives are dying like flies! There is the warning from the Native Affairs Department to the administration itself to get immunized labour, and still there is no attempt made to do so. So more natives arrived from Pondoland and elsewhere to be broken in in the unhealthy spots in Zululand, where a large portion of their labour is valueless. On the 11th of December last the Health Officer in Durban wrote the construction engineer of the works at Matubatuba that Hluhluwe river was one of the most malarious places in South Africa, only approached in malignity by other swamp country immediately to the north of it; that out of one lot of 40 boys, 25 had taken malaria ; that he understood there were no mosquito-proof barracks and no anti-mosquito work and that, unless proper measures were taken immediately, serious illness and death among employees in this part were unavoidable. That was after twelve months&#x2019; efforts by the Public Health authority to try to bring about an improvement ; and the blame for all this mortality is thrown on the cotton painter. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am further informed that you are still getting a pretty poor class of recruit. The doctor had eighty medical rejects in one lot of 300 boys. I am further informed that these were not all from recruiting agencies, but some of them came from the department itself, presumably from the Transvaal, and the doctor was able to inform me of some helpless unfits as boys with heart disease, who were sent for your work presumably to shift rails, etc. Leaving criminal responsibility of those who traffic thus in human life out of the picture, let us regard your natives as pure machines.</block>

<p>That is to the Railway Administration. If anybody brought an accusation like this against a private employer in this country, I wonder what would be said in this House&#x003F; The letter goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why cannot the railway deal with human machinery as they would with, inanimate machinery&#x003F; Your labour can be kept healthy by taking proper precautions and neglect of these precautions is an extraordinarily expensive item for which this country has to pay. I am not in any way suggesting that you have neglected the care of the administration&#x2019;s natives, but we are here faced with a proposition which involves you and the contractors, and in which disaster, is absolutely certain, unless our advice is followed.</block>

<p>No precautions, under all the circumstances, could prevent a heavy death rate amongst such a class of recruits. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#marwick">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister sent the Native Affairs Commission to Natal about a year ago to deal with the question of the better enforcement of the Masters and Servants Act, not only in that province, but with the object, I think, of unifying the system throughout the Union. I wonder whether the Minister could tell us whether, as a result of the report of that commission, we can expect better administration and better enforcement than at present. There is a great deal of wide-spread complaint as to the indiscipline among native labourers on the farms, and the difficulty of managing this form of labour where people are far removed from magisterial influence and where, as in the past, they are obliged to use moral suasion to keep their natives at work. I think the Minister would be gratifying a very large class of people interested in this question if he would give us information on that point. I should like to supplement what the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) has said in regard to the unwisdom of preventing natives from Portuguese territory entering Zululand for employment by the cotton planters. In addition to the embargo on Portuguese territory, there seems to be some difficulty in getting Swaziland labour for farm work in the Union, and that is a great mistake, because at one point in Zululand, Swaziland natives are conveniently situated ; are immune to malaria and are men who would be very useful, as they understand the kind of work in which they are needed for cotton plantation and sugar cultivation. There is one other point. Certain changes have recently been made in the native administration in Zululand. The Minister, I think, has transferred the magistrate at Nongoma, who has hitherto been responsible for native administration in the whole of Northern Zululand. He might let us know whether he is entirely satisfied with the native administration in that region, because there are complaints in portions of Natal that some of the Zulu chiefs are exercising political <span class="col_3407-3408" refersTo="page_0656"/>influence and sending messengers into the Natal districts to raise money for certain funds in Zululand. That action, on the part of Zulu chiefs, has been resented by the chiefs in Natal, and I hope the Minister will be able to tell us whether he will be able to put a stop to that kind of political influence being used by the chiefs in Zululand.</p>

<speech by="#nicholls">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to conclude this story, which is a sorry one for this country. After twelve months of knocking at the door of the Railway Administration by the Department of Public Health and the Department of Native Affairs all telling the same story, practically no action was taken to overcome the difficulty. These natives were undoubtedly sacrificed on the altar of a foolish political theory. On the 25th of January, 1926, the Public Health authority of Durban wrote to the secretary for Public Health, Pretoria&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Class of recruits poor.</block>

<p>Still poor after eighteen months&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">See my 2/40/58 of 11/12/25 to construction engineer which shows 80 rejections out of 300 recruits. The recruits were largely non-immune as previously complained of, but at date many local (quasi immune) boys were being taken on by contractors.</block>

<p>These quasi-immune natives were coming from the farmers all round and were being induced to desert from the farms to come to these contractors at a higher rate than they were getting on the farms. So the Administration began to solve its difficulties by robbing the farmers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Construction engineer has appealed to the Administration to send only Shangaans or other immune natives. These are not yet forthcoming and Administration for its own use has depended mostly on non-immune Transvaal and Cape labour of fair class. Since construction started there have been 19 deaths at Matubatuba hospital. Less than half of these are stated to be malaria. The treatment at the hospital appears to be very good and reflects credit on the staff. Deaths have occurred mostly at camps. Between April and September, 1925, there are stated to have been about 90 and since that date about 12. This is far too high. The trouble apparently lies with the contractors who do not report sick in some cases until moribund, and there is no doubt that cases have occurred in which sick boys have been discharged. We may not know of all the deaths.</block>

<p>No! We do not know all the deaths. They have occurred in many places, at the railway station, on the road, in their villages after they had crawled back home. The graveyard the hon. member mentioned contains no doubt a number of them. But what else could be expected. I have a letter from the Inspector of Native Labour in Northern Zululand who writes that the majority of natives are recruited labour and they are the worst boys he has come in contact with, mostly scum picked up in large areas and sent forward and are unfit for the work The climatic and other conditions at the camp tell on them with the result that only 50 per cent, turn out to work. Until the boys are medically examined he is afraid the present state of affairs will continue. I hope the Minister will realize what the position is. There are some 30,000 acres of land under cotton, and the only labour which can effectively work in that neighbourhood is the labour which the Government is preventing entering the Union. I hope the Government will endeavour to bring about an amelioration of the shocking state of affairs to which I have called attention.</p>

<p>T see the item &#x00A3;500 for maintenance of border fences. What fences are these&#x003F; Until about three years ago an arrangement existed by which a fence rider was employed by the Herschel magistrate to maintain the border fence, the farmers contributing their share of the man&#x2019;s pay. However, the farmers found that the fences were falling into disrepair, as the man was not doing his duty, so it was necessary for them to do the job themselves. Consequently they notified the magistrate that they would cease to pay any further contribution for the wages of the fence rider. The fence belongs as much to the Government as to the farmers, so it is the Government's duty to assist them to defray the cost of its repair.</p>

<p>I am sure it would be a scandal if this vote were allowed to pass now after the statement made by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls). He has certainly depicted what to my mind is a scandalous state of affairs. I am perfectly sure the Prime Minister did not know of this state of affairs, but what really surprises me is that the Minister of Defence sits there quietly and takes the thing as a matter of course.

<p>Of course not, but the Minister ought to have known. Had this been something carried on by the mines of the Rand&#x2014; well, this House would not have held my hon. friend the Minister of Defence. I think the Minister of Native Affairs must admit that it is a most unsatisfactory state of things and I think steps should be taken at once to have it remedied. As far as I can understand, it simply results from the fact that the Government have refused to allow Portuguese natives to come in. They even won&#x2019;t allow them to cross the river from Portuguese territory to come into British territory on this side of the river.</p>

<p>Of course, but the law. I suppose, like everything else, can be altered <span class="col_3409-3410" refersTo="page_0657"/>when it is a question of human life, as it appears to be in this case. When you can get men from Portuguese territory on the other side of the river to come into the Union territory to work these cotton and sugar fields, it does seem like carrying even the ideas of my hon. friend the Minister of Defence somewhat to an extreme, sacrificing life in this fashion simply to carry out an idea. It shows the extent to which the Minister of Native Affairs is prepared to give way to Labour ideas, because this is the policy advocated by Labour. I hope now that the revelations have been made in the statements of the hon. member for Zulu-land and the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson), steps will be taken in the near future to remedy this state of affairs. I remember when some statements were made in this House in regard to the loss of life amongst the natives brought from Nyasaland for work on the Rand mines, the rafters simply rang in denunciation of such a system and it was promptly stopped and has never been reopened since. This is a case which in my view is far more serious than that and yet the Minister of Defence sits there and takes it as a matter of course.

<p>These gentlemen, of whom the hon. member for Zululand is one of the representatives, have been very anxious to get natives from the territories for which the member for Griqualand pleaded this afternoon. They wanted natives, they have tried to get natives from those territories and elsewhere in the Union, but the position in regard to the natives on these plantations is not such as to give the department the right to really encourage the natives to go there. They knew it themselves and they approached the department. The department said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Very well, we are quite prepared to help you, and we will place you in the same position as ordinary labour areas, so as to bring you under the Recruiting Act, and give you all the privileges of the people who are employing recruited natives, but then you must submit to all these safeguards as to health, etc., which are observed in Johannesburg.</block>

<p>At first they were prepared, and they thought of accepting, but suddenly they took fright and, after taking fright, they have not approached us again and, from what I have been informed, they are not prepared to submit. No, they want all the privileges they can get, but they are not prepared to take upon themselves the <span class="col_3411-3412" refersTo="page_0658"/>obligations accompanying those privileges, with the result that, of course, they have been complaining and they have, perhaps, reason to complain. For instance, one of their gravest complaints was that these people come there and then suddenly leave their service, and they have no hold over these men. I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, but why&#x003F; You can get them if you are only prepared to undertake the obligations.</block>

<p>They won&#x2019;t. Why not&#x003F; Simply because the obligations are too onerous. Now the hon. gentleman comes and cries, and brings in the position of the natives along the railway line there, and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">See how they have been ill-treated.</block>

<p>As I have said, we did not ill-treat them. As for as the railway itself is concerned, every precaution was taken to see that the houses required for its servants should be as safe as possible. If the contractors did not do so, all we could do was to bring it to the notice of the proper authorities. The railway took immediate steps to see these things were rectified, and approached the contractors and asked them to look into these matters. That they have done, and they have answered us accordingly. The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) says&#x2014;</p>

<p>Of course, you will have white men living everywhere, too, but I am talking about the ordinary native, those who are employed. As far as that is concerned, we all know that your doctor will tell you that, in the first place, your native does not get immunized against malaria, and, in the second place, your so-called immunized native is usually the man with the weakest constitution and first to succumb. Of course, this is the humanity side of the question&#x2014;the hon. member is quite prepared to have natives brought from Portuguese territory to come and die, but he complains in this House that we are so inhuman as to allow natives to be brought from parts of the Union to die down there. I think the contractors may have been unwise, or the railway may have been unwise, but to come and make a long story and cry about it as the hon. member for Zululand has done, really I think that is not justified. The hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) asked me whether I could tell him what we expected would be the consequences of the interviews with the Native Affairs Commission down in Natal regarding the Masters and Servants Act. The Masters and Servants Act is not quite a measure that pertains to my department ; it is the department of the Minister of Justice. But I may tell the hon. member that we had, and have still, under consideration, the Act brought forward by the hon. member for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins). This Act, of course, it is thought, will make proper provision with regard to what he is complaining about. Whether it will do so I must say, honestly, I do not know, and that is why I said at the commencement that I would prefer that the measure should stand over and let the Government take it in hand. Well, hon. members did not want that ; they have gone forward with this thing, and I hope it is going to assist them. If it does not, the Minister of Justice will probably later on have to see that something is done to supplement whatever may be wanted. I have been asked by the hon. member for Kingwilliamstown (Maj. Ballantine) when certain native councils in regard to Kingwilliamstown and two other districts will come into operation. It is hoped that these will be in operation by October. In the meanwhile there are certain formalities which have to be complied with&#x2014;for which my department is not responsible&#x2014;and until that is done they cannot be put into operation. The hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton) asked about the &#x00A3;600 for border fencing. That is in connection with Basutoland and, I think, Herschel. I am informed that, as far as Herschel is concerned, it is also covered where the wire fencing is for locations. As far as Basutoland is concerned, it is the border fencing.</p>

<p>I should have thought that the indictment that was brought forward by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) before the committee adjourned, would have caused a good deal more enquiry to have been made by the Minister, and would have produced an entirely different answer from that which he has given to the charges made by the hon. member. I was so impressed with the statements made by the hon. member that immediately the House adjourned, I took the opportunity of reading through the papers, and a more serious indictment in the official documents laid on the table, starting in December, 1924, I think it would be impossible to conceive. Since the days of the wastage of life in the early construction of the Panama Canal. I have never seen such a wastage of life as is detailed in these papers before the House. An hon. member remarks about miners&#x2019; phthisis. I am not discussing miners&#x2019; phthisis now. I am discussing the wastage of human life which has been going on for months, owing to the Government being afraid to bring immunized natives, instead of which they have sent down natives, knowing from the reports that a high percentage of their lives must be lost.

But is he not Minister of Native Affairs&#x003F; Is he not supposed to be the father of the natives in this country, and when he reads the papers, which have also passed through the Native Affairs Department, surely he will admit that these are statements which his Ministers should have brought to his notice&#x003F; If the Minister of Public Health and the Minister of Railways have not brought these things to his notice, then I must say they are extremely culpable for the attitude they have adopted. When the Minister says that the Railway Department alone is responsible, may I read him a report, from the many excellent reports, not by an irresponsible person, but by the Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Union, who for months has continued to call attention to this fearful wastage of human life. In a report dated the 15th December, 1925&#x2014;and I read it for the information of the Prime Minister to show that the Railway Department and the general manager are not responsible, because they evidently called attention to the unsuitable character of the natives&#x2014;he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I agree with the general manager that it is unfortunate that the native labour is recruited from districts where the boys are unaccustomed to the conditions obtaining in the low veld.</block>

<p>Then, in further reports, he refers to the criminal wastage of life. Why&#x003F; Because he points out that an entirely unsuitable class of natives are being brought down to do this work. Why&#x003F; Because the unfortunate natives are crucified on the cross of the Pact, because the Minister is afraid to depart from the doctrine laid down by the Minister of Defence and his colleagues. If my hon. friend would read this report he would find that natives of all sorts are brought down, a policy against which the sugar planters of Zululand have protested, and against which these officials have protested also in the strongest possible manner. They state that the climate demands a robust type of native, well-fed and well-cared for, and if possible one who is immune, as the Gazaland natives are, from the ravages of malaria. This is also stated to be one of the most malarious places in the Union ; in fact, they know of only one other place equal to it, and that is somewhere right across the border. My charge against the Minister&#x2014; because, after all, he is the head of the Government&#x2014;is that if he, as Minister of Native Affairs, had known these things were going on for eighteen months, what he should have done, irrespective of the pressure of the Minister of Defence, was to say that he was responsible for the lives of these people, and that, irrespective of the views of any section of the Cabinet or his followers, he would not send down unsuitable natives to die almost like flies ; and that, under these particular circumstances, at least he would have allowed the Gazaland natives to come in. Not only from a material point of view would they have been of assistance, but from a humanitarian point of view it was his duty to see that this policy was carried out.</p>

<p>I really do not know why the Minister should have replied in the tone he did, or why he should suspect my sincerity in bringing this forward. Does the Minister, as an honest man, not think that this was a fit subject to be debated on his vote&#x003F; Does he think we should sit by blindly and not raise our voice in protest when we see natives sent to their death because of a foolish political policy of the Government&#x003F; He says I should have referred it to the Railway Department. I would like to remind him that I have raised this several times in the House. I referred to it last year also, but no notice was taken. The Prime Minister, in his reply, has attacked the sugar and the cotton industry, which are struggling under the difficulties which he has imposed upon them. He has tried to throw the blame on them, because they have asked to obtain the only labour which can safely be employed. What is illegal about the Portuguese natives coming over the border&#x003F; It has been going on for years.</p>

<p>I am not giving the previous Government away. It did wisely. The present Government has allotted thousands of acres of land to white settlers in malarial regions of Zululand, and after doing so the Prime Minister took away their labour, by which these people alone could earn their living. If they have been forced to go down to Pondoland and other places for their labour, whose fault is that&#x003F; There was no need to do it before. Are these planters to go bankrupt, to see their cotton remaining unpicked, because they are driven to obtain labour from the Cape which cannot withstand the climate, while a large population, able and willing to work, remain locked up a few miles away&#x003F; The Minister of Lands will know I brought the matter up when he was in Zululand touring with me. The chief native commissioner of Natal writes, in reference to the cotton fields&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would be well if such labour could be got from malarial districts, when one could expect that the labourers would have a certain amount of malarial immunity.</block>

<p>The Prime Minister endeavoured to teach me something about malaria. I have lived in a malarial country all my life. Natives do live in malarial districts and in the low veld. There are natives living at Umfolosi&#x2014;one of the worst places in the Union&#x2014;and there are large native reserves around the shores of Lake St. Lucia. The Prime Minister does not know the native areas&#x2014;he has lived so long in the breezy plains of the Free State, that he does not know what is going on in the malarial areas. If the Government had acted with wisdom in admitting this labour, which needs only the slightest nod of encouragement to come over our border, they would have saved all the heavy mortality, and they would have given the settlers they have placed on the land a better chance of success. They are shut out. Can the Prime Minister reconcile it with his con <span class="col_3415-3416" refersTo="page_0660"/>science that they have piled up the death rate like this amongst the natives&#x003F; These natives have been recruited for the Railway Administration, not knowing the conditions under which they were to be employed.

<p>If he had power to prevent Transkeian natives from coming down here to compete against the coloured labourers, is it not as just that no passes should be issued in the Transkei to natives to go to Zululand or the planters of Natal&#x003F; From the humanitarian point of view, I must say without hesitation that it is the duty of the Prime Minister to safeguard the interests of the natives, because they have nobody else to look to. When the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) brings one of the most serious and criminal charges that has ever been heard in this House, is the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister the right attitude to be taken up by the leading man in the country, who is the guardian of the native&#x003F; Hon. members across the floor are continually trying to make capital out of our past native administration, and we frequently hear the taunt&#x2014;</p>

Last year my hon. friend and I brought it up. We all know that the rejects from the gold mines and the weaklings who cannot pass the doctors are recruited for the sugar estates in Natal. I know cases where rejected natives have been handed over by a mine recruiter to a sugar recruiter, and these natives are subjected to all the dangers of a malarial country. It is the duty of the Prime Minister, if he knows the conditions are not satisfactory in Zululand and Natal, to bring legislation into this House to compel the planters up there to accept laws operating in this country, and thus protecting the interests and health of the natives.</p>

<p>The hon. member, for the first time last year, directed the attention of the House to the sugar plantations in Zululand, where the natives were not being properly treated. Thereupon, the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) denied it, and said that the natives were treated in the best way, and that mosquito-proof houses were being built for them. Now the hon. member for Tembuland brings the matter up again. The hon. member for Zululand denies that the conditions on the sugar plantations are so bad, but now he has got hold of a document which states that the natives employed on railway construction are not treated well. The hon. member is trying to transfer the blame from the sugar planters to the railways. I do not want to excuse the railways, but it was the duty of the hon. member to complain about it last year, and I am certain that the Native Affairs Commission and the Government would have gone into the matter. Now, however, he makes a fuss about the matter, and wants to state that that happens as a result of pressure which is exercised by the Labour party. The hon. member now wants to make insinuations against the Government, because, although the Government has taken certain steps to solve the difficulty, he says that the Government has neglected the only correct manner, viz., not to allow natives to be introduced from malaria zones. I come myself from a malaria zone, the northern Transvaal, and thousands and thousands of natives are living there. Malaria is very severe there, and no doctor will state that the natives are immune to malaria. Those who have once had the disease are the most liable to it. If they are sent from one part of the country to the other, they easily get the disease. The hon. member for Pretoria (South) (Dr. van Broekhuizen) got malaria here in Cape Town, because he had it in his system and it broke out here. If, e.g., natives are sent from Waterberg to Zululand, then the disease will break out at once. It is a known fact, because the bodies of such persons are weaker than those of others. I am sorry to hear that conditions are so bad in Zululand, but then the hon. members for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) and Tembuland (Mr. Payn) ought to have told us so last year. They must not blame the Government because the Government have not brought natives from malaria zones to work there. I agree with the hon. member <span class="col_3417-3418" refersTo="page_0661"/>for Zululaud that if natives are sent to a malaria zone, then they must be healthy natives. They must not, e.g., have miners&#x2019; phthisis or ordinary phthisis. If that is the case, I can understand that they will not be able to stand the conditions. I hope the department in future will take care that it does not occur again, but the criticism made by hon. members opposite was a little unfair.</p>

<p>The hon. member now wants to say that the sugar plantations have caused the conditions. Two years ago the same matter came up in the House, and then it was shown by hon. members what deaths there were among the natives there. There was never a question of the natives not being properly treated on the plantations. The hon. member for Waterberg says that if a man has once had malaria he very soon gets it again. Why do we then never go to the malaria districts in the summer in the Transvaal&#x003F; We were afraid of malaria. But I did not get up just to speak about this matter, but to criticize the policy which the Government has pursued in the past and which is still being pursued, the policy which they follow owing to the influence of the Labour party. It is that the natives living beyond the borders are prohibited from coming to the Union for work. That is the policy which is being carried out through the railway administration which is not carrying any people here. What are the consequences to us in the Transvaal&#x003F; I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he knows what the loss to the State is in consequence of this&#x003F; And what is the loss to the mines&#x003F; And what to the farmers&#x003F; I know that the Transvaal farmers are suffering through the prohibition of the importation of natives and many farmers could not go on with their work. The stopping of the importation of the natives for the mines reacts on the farmers. I cannot see why these labourers who can assist in developing the country from which all of us can reap the benefit should be prohibited. It is said that the farmers are employing white men. How many farmers can make it pay if they have to employ white people&#x003F; That is something into which the Prime Minister and his department should investigate very closely, so that something may be discovered to find work-people for the farmers in the future. We do not want labour for nothing, but sufficient labour to go on with the work, labour that we can use. If no remedy is found then conditions will be such that the farmers will have to close down</p>

<p>My reason for intervening in the debate is because this afternoon the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay), who when he gets up to speak about anything on the Rand exudes a poison-gas of a very virulent and malignant type, tried to poison the mind of the Premier, who cannot know the conditions that exist on the Rand. The hon. member said that natives were sent off from three East Rand stations, suffering from miners&#x2019; phthisis, so that the mines could avoid paying compensation, and he implied that these miners&#x2019; phthisis men were sent to their death.

They are looked after, and I say they should be looked after. They are humane men, and they realize that every native on the mine is an asset. It is a grievous state of affairs when men, under the privilege of this House, can make statements against men whom he knows to be honest, for the one purpose of poisoning the mind of the Prime Minister, so that he may do things against them because he does not know the actual state of affairs.</p>

<p>I just want to make a few remarks and to associate myself with what has been said by the hon. member for Witwatersberg (Lt.-Col. N. J. Pretorius), with reference to the prohibition of the importation of natives from beyond the border. This is due to pressure from the Labour party on the Government, because the Labour party want to stop the natives from working on the mines. That is directly against the interests of the farmers. As the hon. member for Witwatersberg has said one heard nothing but complaints last year of shortage of labour on the farms. Even in the constituency of the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. van Niekerk), the new member of the Native Affairs Commission, there were complaints about the shortage of labour to reap the harvest. Why should natives outside the borders be prohibited from coming to the mines&#x003F; I do not wish to accuse the Government of having imported it, but pressure was also brought to bear on the previous Government. Why should the mines and the <span class="col_3419-3420" refersTo="page_0662"/>farming population suffer in consequence&#x003F; There is something else. I should like to know from the Prime Minister whether the Native Affairs Act is strictly carried out with reference to the &#x201C;native farmers,&#x201D; people who hold farms to let them to natives. I know of cases where the natives on such farms never work. That is against the law. I should like the Prime Minister to assure the House that the law is applied there. I know that there are municipalities and private people who make natives pay rent to live on their land. I regard this as a scandal if a farmer keeps a farm to let It to natives. I also have natives on my farm, but I make them work. I am anxious for the Prime Minister to publish his segregation Bills. We have to-day heard that they will be introduced about the end of the month, but we shall have to wait another year before they are passed. It is directly against the interests of our people for people to keep farms just to let them to natives, while they do not get proper work out of the natives. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) has been at his old game in vilifying the mines. He states that the mines do not look after the natives properly. The Minister of Mines and Industries has also told us this afternoon what the Government has done in connection with miners&#x2019; phthisis. Hon. members had an opportunity during the recess of visiting the mines. Let us be honest. Are hon. members not convinced that as much as possible is being done on the mines for the natives and for their health&#x003F; There is almost more done for the natives than for the whites because they are examined, treated in hospitals, kept clean and altogether civilized. We are accustomed to some members of the Labour party always try-ing to paint the mines as black as possible. Then there are members representing outside districts who do not so well understand matters, yet they join in vilifying the mines. I want to assure hon. members that the Witwaters-rand gold mines are doing as much as possible for the health of the natives. In connection with miners&#x2019; phthisis I do not want to say any-thing further, because who was it that started fighting it&#x003F; The former Government interested itself in the matter, and the Miners&#x2019; Phthisis Act of 1912 was passed. The former Government made a commencement and tried to bring about an improvement. It could not, however, be done in a day. The people will not believe everything that hon. members opposite and on the cross benches say. This Government can make an improvement, and we will also assist to improve the health of the people. It is not, however, quite right to say that we on this side of the House have done nothing.</p>

<p>One does not know whether hon. members on the Opposition side are inore concerned in regard to the importation of natives from Portuguese East Africa, or for the health of the natives of the Union, If they had left entirely out of consideration the question of the importation of natives from outside the Union, one would have been prepared to accept their statements at their face value. Natives are imported from Portuguese territory by the Chamber of Mines and other employers for the purpose of keeping the South African native in his place from a wages point of view. The wages of the South African native are governed by the amount it costs to import labour, and if employers were not allowed to bring in labour from outside the Union they would have to pay higher wages to South African natives. I have not heard a single member opposite raise his voice on behalf of the natives on the mines. Even when they do take the place of white men, there is no increase in their wages. The right hon. the member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) said that natives should be well nourished and of good physique. Well, let the employers pay higher wages, and thus en-able the natives to be well nourished. I quite agree that the mine managers are as humane as anyone else. They have no desire to break the mining regulations, but if those regulations stand between them and increased profits, they are going to break them. I have visited the clearing station of the Chamber of Mines. We were told that sick natives are cleared out of that station every morning. There is no doubt that the full number of natives suffering from miners&#x2019; phthisis is not known to the Government. The whole system is at fault. If hon. members opposite attack the Government for not taking steps to carry out Scientific investigations to prevent disease, they will be on the right track, but when they plead for the further importation of cheap labour, they are not working in the interest of the natives at all. While they pretend to champion the cause of the South African natives, they want to bring in thousands of natives from outside, so as to have more Union natives unemployed. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) advised the City Council not to pay high wages to natives, so as to discourage their coming to Cape Town at a time when there was a good deal of unemployment here. Hon. members opposite do not care how many natives come to Cape Town, or whether the white community is depressed, so long as they have a reservoir of unemployed so as to keep down the wages of whites and blacks.</p>

Why, it is the very reverse. A very small percentage of our Union natives will descend the mines, which consequently have to depend on east coast natives. Then the imported native will work for twelve months, as compared with only six months for which the Union native will sign on. Does the hon. member not know that last season we produced 24,000,000 bags of maize, 15,000 bales of cotton, &#x00A3;1,000,000. worth of wattle bark&#x003F; We are extending in every direction in agriculture, and the only check is the shortage of native labour.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROOD</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think there can be any doubt that there is a shortage of labour among the farmers. This has been so for years, but the question now is whether the scarcity of native labour is due to the action of this Government, or possibly even of the former Government. To say that we in South Africa have not enough natives to do the work that there is to be done at the moment in the mining industry or on the farms, is not correct. There is quite sufficient labour. Quite a different question is the one as to why the kafirs do not come to work. What is the cause that the natives, even in districts where there is a large number of them, will not come to work&#x003F; I can state that in the low veld of the Transvaal, where there are many natives, that is a fact. The kafirs do not come to work. I think that the evidence of the chairman of the Natal Agricultural Union before the Economic and Wages Commission is correct, viz., that a time comes in the year when the kafirs do not want to work. It is not then a question of wages ; one can offer a native anything, but he simply replies that he does not want to work. I think everybody from the countryside will confirm that statement. There is no economic urge or necessity for the native to work, and therefore he does not do so. If he does in deed work, then he prefers to work on the Witwatersrand mines. We have to-day in the Union actually only two recruiting corporations, viz., the W.N.L.A. and the Native Recruiting Corporation. Both recruiting bodies are controlled by the Chamber of Mines. To say that we can solve the whole question by admitting Portuguese natives&#x2014;they are not prohibited by the present Government, but were always prohibited, although they came to a certain extent from Rhodesia, possibly in smaller numbers to-day than formerly&#x2014;does not hold water. The few that get through do not work on the farms. Most of the natives coming from Portuguese territory cross the boundary illegally, and it is unfortunate that they are only punished by a fine of 10s. or one week&#x2019;s imprisonment. They serve the week, and then immediately go to the Witwatersrand. There are quite sufficient natives in the Union and the British Protectorate to include them with the others, but I certainly think that it is necessary for the Government to enquire how many natives are available in the immediate future. This is specially important for industries like the cotton industry, where, at a given moment in the year, a great number of natives are required, and where it is impossible to employ expensive natives, otherwise cotton growing will never pay. I would suggest to the Government to immediately create a central recruiting body with various branches, where all natives can report to be sent through to the various industries that require labour. The two recruiting bodies that exist at present have got all the power in their hands. They select the best natives for the mines out of those coming from Portuguese territory, and those that are the weakest are left over for other purposes. Then it has been said here that the natives from the native areas get more malaria than the natives of Zululand. I think the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) will agree that even if the natives do not live there on the highest points, they certainly do not prefer to live in the marshy areas the railway runs through, and I think he will agree that natives coming from the higher parts of the country get malaria just as much as natives in the low veld. This is a year for malaria, The white people of the high veld get malaria just the same as those in the low veld. It is just the same with the natives. The point, however, which I especially wish to urge is that the Prime Minister should make an effort to see how many natives there are available, and how they can be divided up over the various industries in the country.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken has often said that we would certainly agree with him on various points, but I do not at all, agree with him when he asks the Government to enquire into how many natives there are available in the Union. I cannot follow him quite well. I should like to see him doing the work himself. What would be the result&#x003F; We cannot compel people to work, but it is voluntary, and we cannot punish people who will not work voluntarily. The hon. member said that there were enough native labourers in South Africa. I think he makes a very great mistake if he means voluntary workers. The position is such that if we get no natives from without for the mines, the farms will be without workers in consequence, because natives go in the first instances to the mines. If we allow natives to come over the border, then other natives are free to work on the farms where they grew up. The Prime Minister knows what the position is. There is much truth in what the hon. member for Witwatersberg (Lt.-Col N. J. Pretorius) says, viz., that the farmers suffer much from shortage of labour. I am speaking of the eastern Transvaal. In my district 500, 600 to 1,000 natives are required, and things are very bad. I can tell the House that farming went backward very much last year. The Prime Minister should remember that farming is the chief industry of the country, and that provision should be made for its continuance. The <span class="col_3423-3424" refersTo="page_0664"/>railways depend on the produce of the farmers carried over them, and the income tax to a great extent comes from the farmers. The Prime Minister should go into the matter a little, and see what the result of stopping the importation of native labour actually is, and take steps so that the farmers in future shall have sufficient workers. We do not pay our workmen badly, very well in fact, but it is impossible to use white labour, because where will be the profit for the farmers&#x003F; The past year was a particularly good one, but we shall see how unfavourable conditions will be this year. If it goes on in this way, many people will have to get Government assistance, and a great cause of that is a shortage of labour.</p>

<p>I congratulate the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) on his speech ; I congratulate him on the success with which he has drawn a red herring across the trail of the discussion on which we were em-barked ; on the success with which he has evaded dealing with the issue raised by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls), and in turning it off by a sort of counter-attack on the mining industry, which is not concerned with this discussion in the least. The issue is the charges made by the hon. member for Zululand against the Government of neglect and inattention amounting almost to criminality in the handling of the natives in northern Zulu-land. That charge is this, that being warned over a period of something like 18 months that the natives were dying almost daily in these construction camps on the railway line, and being warned that that was due to the fact that these natives were being recruited from native territories in the Cape, they not only took no steps to stop that, but they proceeded right up to the present moment in that course. I can imagine the hon. member for Brakpan, who is a highly emotional person, had he not been as he is to-day, the chief labour M&#x2019;bongo of the Government, seeing red at the mere mention of that fact. Instead of facing the issue frankly and asking himself whether a case has been made that these natives have been treated with criminal neglect and allowed to die like flies, he has tried to cloud the issue, and lead the discussion into paths having nothing whatever to do with the matters raised by the hon. member for Zululand. He says this is nothing but a dishonest attempt on the part of Zululand sugar planters to get removed the embargo on the importation of native labour into Zululand. That is a stupid and malicious charge to make.</p>

I do not envy him his perverted sense of humour; I see nothing funny in it. The indictment contained in these documents is an appalling one. Had the Prime Minister been sitting on these benches, the welkin would have rung with the iniquity of the Government, if our Government had done this thing. I remember the debates that took place in this House many years ago on the great mortality from pneumonia suffered by the natives from north of 22&#x2014;how this House was shocked and the country was shocked by those revelations. The country would not allow it to be resumed even when, by the discovery of Sir Spencer Lister, that mortality was done away with. The Labour party was most insistent <span class="col_3425-3426" refersTo="page_0665"/>that that mortality should be done away with.

My hon. friend&#x2019;s friends, the Chamber of Mines and the big financial institutions, are moving heaven and earth to get this embargo removed. They want more and more natives from Portuguese East Africa, and I say that when hon. members on the other side start to shed a lot of crocodile tears about the poor natives dying, and couple with it the question of the removal of the embargo, they cannot blame me and other hon. members when I doubt their sincerity.

They plead for the natives and for the further employment of natives, to the detriment of whites, and they come forward on behalf of the Colour Bar Bill, and say there is no work for the natives.

<p>I thought the: Prime Minister made rather a sad exhibition when he first replied to the indictment of the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls). The hon. gentleman washes his hands of all responsibility for this state of affairs mentioned in these documents. The Minister has forgotten that when he spoke before on this question he said he could not be responsible for the actions of the Minister of Public Health or the Minister of Railways as these things referred to their departments. For. 18 months this has been going on. I have never read such a shocking description of waste of life, owing to the lack of sympathy of the Government,. I should like to read the report again. I will tell the Minister of Native Affairs where his responsibility comes in and where the Railway Administration are not responsible. By the pressure which the Minister of Defence puts on the Prime Minister the natives are prevented from getting any other labour. Notwithstanding what the Mabonga who has just gone out has said, our charge is that when the Government knew that there was such a serious amount of sickness and waste of human life the Prime Minister owing to the pressure to which he was subjected, was afraid to alter the conditions in that particular section, and to permit suitable immune natives to come in and do this work and thus prevent this serious loss of life. Notwithstanding the condition of affairs which was detailed in official reports it is regrettable for the Prime Minister to think it was a matter of levity, and undeserving of the serious consideration of this committee. I daresay my hon. friend was trying to push this aside, and was simply acting when he replied.

<p>When I brought this matter up, I tried to do so without any exaggeration. My case was quite strong enough by merely reading extracts from documents placed on the Table by the Prime Minister. It is not the cotton or sugar industries which should be attacked, but the Government itself. I submit that the reports show that although malaria does exist on the sugar and cotton estates, the conditions are not so bad compared with what exists on the Administration&#x2019;s own line. The Government has to choose whether it is going to allow the whole of that fertile region of Zululand to be developed, or go out of development, for you cannot bring this human wreckage from the mines and expect it to develop a country.

<p>I deny it. The position is whether the Minister is going to see all the land recently given to settlers go back to its original condition, or whether it should be developed to produce future wealth for the Union. The mortality of the natives is a signpost for the Government as to the policy it is pursuing in these malarial regions. Natives who have been born and bred under malarial conditions are not nearly so subject to the disease as natives who have never been in contact with it. Quite a number of the Zululand natives live in the malarial belt ; the Tonga tribe are in one of the worst malarial districts on the east coast, and they would be very helpful in the development of our cotton fields. You may say this would be exploiting these people, but we are trying to exploit the land. My hon. friend laughs. I suppose he would rather see the land go back and become a wilderness than employ men from outside our borders. Here is a track of country largely depopulated because the Zulus who live on the hilltops prefer to go to the mines, and rather than obtain natives from malaria regions who could work this land in their natural habitat, my hon. friend (Mr. Waterston) would rather see the land go back to the wilderness from which we are trying to rescue it.</p>

The charge which has been brought against the sugar and cotton industry is very light compared with the scandalous state of affairs which has been revealed in the papers laid on the Table. I have stated the case to the House, and I think I have made out a very good case and if on the strength of what I have said, and in view of the circumstances in northern Zululand, the Prime Minister is not convinced that he should relax this rule against the admission of Portuguese, then he must be so much under the thumb of the left or the right wing, whichever it is, of the Labour party, that no logic would appeal to him.</p>

<speech by="#stals">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STALS</person>:</from>

<p>This House has been busy for some hours discussing a very serious question. One realizes at once that when you deal with the lives of citizens, whether they are Europeans or natives, it is a matter of very great concern, but we cannot free ourselves from the suspicion that there is an effort, perhaps an unconscious effort, on the part of some members, to make some political capital out of these sad facts. We all of us regret, as we naturally must regret, if we adopt a Christian attitude, that so many lives have been lost in Zululand during the past 10 months, but that, of course, is not an exception in malarial countries. We know of outbreaks on the island of Mauritius at Port Louis, where, in a very short time, some 31,000 individuals died, at the rate of about 200 a day. We have to admit that at times we must expect severe epidemics. The evidence in this case is that for 18 years no such epidemic has occurred in that area in Zululand as was experienced in 1924. In 1924 a bad and serious epidemic broke out, and the Government of the day is being held responsible for that serious epidemic. I think we must realize ourselves, if we want to be honest, and if we pretend to know something about the condition in that area, that we must seek for other causes. It has been alleged by various members opposite that if natives from elsewhere than in the Union had been introduced into the Union, the death rate would have been smaller. I am not posing here as an authority on malaria, but may I express my grave doubt whether this would have been true in any sense&#x003F; The charge that is hurled at the head of the Government seems to me to be not only far-sought, but in many respects to be without any foundation. Epidemics of malaria can only be fought rationally by prophylactic measures. The question here is whether the Government, in so far as they were responsible, in so far as they had control or were contributory agents, did their share of responsibility towards providing the prophylactic measures which have been necessary in the past&#x003F; I, for one, found sufficient in these very papers which have been quoted this evening to show that the Railway Department, at any rate, and the Health Department for their part, have done their duty towards these unfortunate labourers in these camps. I am going to quote a few passages from these papers. In a paper dated 3rd March, 1925, the Union health officer at Durban writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the new construction the sanitary supervision, as far as the Railway Department goes, is good. I do not think that Dr. realizes the absolute necessity of prophylactic quinine, as opposed to waiting until the disease breaks out. But the contractors are mostly Italian, and they treated their boys abominably.</block>

<p>Another passage from the same report. This is dated 27th of February, 1925, and is from the same health department&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I visited the new construction on the 23rd inst., and have now to bring to your notice the position in regard to these natives. The South African Railway Administration provides adequate medical and hospital facilities and is in a position to satisfactorily cater for all employees that come under supervision. The condition of the employees is <span class="col_3431-3432" refersTo="page_0668"/>reflected in the low incidence of disease, especially malaria.</block>

<p>We all regret that life should be lost, but if we want to take this seriously then we must have other ways to eradicate the evil, and not attach political significance to it and blame the Government for something for which they are not to blame. The question of immunity is, to my mind, an academic one. Scientific attempts have been made to immunize people against malaria in India and elsewhere, and these attempts have failed. Personally, I must express my great doubt that we could get immunity, no matter where we got the natives from.</p>

It is that the natives, for whom he is responsible, were being recruited from an area where there was no immunity against malaria, going to certain death, when there were numbers of natives beyond the border, who, living in a low country, have a natural immunity. He was warned, and he took no notice. When the natives were there and died, did he instruct his department to assist in fortifying the natives in any way&#x003F; This railway is not the only railway built in Zulu-land. We know that Zululand is subject to epidemics of this nature. There was a rail-way built in 1904, and an epidemic occurred then, and the then Minister of Native Affairs in Natal instructed his magistrates to administer quinine to the natives. The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) asked how the Europeans fared in the building of this rail-way. I have no doubt they were fortified with quinine. The very least he could have done was to issue quinine to fortify these natives. I am shocked and disappointed at the Prime Minister&#x2019;s repudiating his responsibility, and at the levity with which he has treated this serious subject.</p>

<p>I cannot add anything to the indictment the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) has brought forward, but I do ask the Prime Minister to reply on the point I raised to begin with. He has disclaimed re-sponsibility so far as the Zululand railway is concerned, but he must accept responsibility as the head of the Government. He is entirely responsible for the conditions which obtain in the planting areas of Zululand, which I outlined this afternoon in the reports which I read. Every one of these documents has been lying in his office for the last year, some for two years. This question was brought up last year, and on previous occasions. The Prime Minister knows perfectly well that most of these difficulties could be overcome by bringing plantation labour under the Mines and Works Act of 1911. He knows perfectly well that legislation is fore-shadowed in his own department. He knows very well that all these natives, physically incapable of the work they have undertaken and unsound in health, would not be sent forward from the territories if there was a proper inspection before they Were recruited. That is what the Prime Minister is responsible for. The reports come from official sources, and are not the offspring of my imagination. They are the conditions obtaining on the plantations of Zululand. Only last year the owners signified their willingness and realized the advantages of coming under the provisions of that Act, but for some reason or other the Prime Minister has allowed this thing to go on from year to year. If he is content to allow this state of affairs to go on as in the past, let him tell the House so plainly, and that he takes no interest in it. On the other hand, I ask him now, as I have asked him for the past two years, when he intends to bring in the legislation that is necessary to control these affairs. This has gone on long enough, I say with all due deference to the Prime Minister. Twice he has answered me on the Native Affairs Vote, and still we see this state of affaire go on&#x2014;an absolute lack of control in the territories, and the same in the areas where the natives work, which are admitted to be unhealthy.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>I feel that this matter can be approached purely from the point of view of the health of the natives who have been referred to. I have had an opportunity of looking through the file of the correspondence laid on the table, and I find that the Railway Department has been able to devise ways and means on the spot by which the health of the natives can be improved. It is true the charge is one against the contractors, and it is noted by the Medical Officer of Health concerned that the system which prevals under them is one, to use his words, of " exploitation of human life.&#x201D; But it hardly behoves the Prime Minister merely to wash his hands and say, as he has done, that he is entirely powerless to control the classes of person for whom these <span class="col_3433-3434" refersTo="page_0669"/>natives work. The hon. the Prime Minister said that there was no power at his disposal to prevent these men being recruited, and being left to the tender mercies of the contractors. I would like to say to the Prime Minister that there is existing legislation, and so far from blaming the previous Government for not providing that legislation, he might have found time to refer to the Native Labour Regulation Act. Section 5 of this Act makes it clear that no person may recruit natives for employment without a licence, and that the issue of that licence is entirely in the discretion of the Minister. Where then does the argument come to that he is powerless to interfere with the recruiting of natives, and the further statement that he is unable to control these natives once they are established in those districts&#x003F; In section 23, provision is made for regulations, and if they do not exist, they can be issued, whereby the conveyance of natives to their destination, and the control of the native labour during their sojourn in native labour districts can be regulated. Apparently the Minister has not considered this Act. I think it is due to us from the Minister to say now that this is pointed out to him&#x2014;this exploitation, if you like&#x2014;it is due to both sides that he will give a better reply than he has delivered, and that he will take account of these points. I have sufficient confidence in him to know that he will reply to the committee that he is willing to peruse these various reports and give the matter serious consideration. It is quite clear from these reports that the Railway Administration is not responsible, and it is the Minister&#x2019;s duty, when he finds there are contractors who are exploiting these poor human beings, whom the medical officer has described as &#x201C;human trash,&#x201D; to recognize that he owes a duty to them and this House to alleviate these conditions.</p>

<p>I regret very much the attitude of the Minister on this question. After all, I do not think it is a very good excuse, when he has had it brought home to him today, probably as never before, the state of affairs existing in these fever stricken territories, to try to shelter himself behind the previous Government. Hon. members opposite, during the election, referred to the iniquities of the late Government and spoke of the way they would redress these grievances, and now that the power is in their hands, they are doing nothing. Is that the way they are going to treat all their election promises, and not take steps&#x2014;</p>

<p>I would point out the difference between the Minister&#x2019;s attitude to-night and that which he adopted in the native territories. There he told us his first charge as Minister of Native Affairs, was to see to the welfare of the natives. The Prime Minister promised that every attention should be paid to their wants. Now he has an opportunity of improving matters which have been brought to his attention. It would be a sorry thing for us to have to tell the natives that the Prime Minister absolutely refused to take any steps to rectify matters, and sheltered himself behind the actions of the previous Government. Has he not stood up as the champion of the natives as a man who is going to solve the native problem&#x003F;</p>

<p>I think I had better answer the hon. member at once. My answer must be emphatically no, because I have no power to do so. I have told the hon. gentleman in private that I had not the power, and that the law&#x2019; allows me to issue the proclamation he wants only for the mining areas. That is why we tried to negotiate with the sugar planters and told them that we would treat them on the same basis as we would the mining areas under the 1911 Act. I am certainly not going to pass a Bill for that purpose. I told the hon. gentleman that we could not do it, and really for him to come here and make a pretence of this when he knows that the law does not allow it&#x2014;well, really!</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>I asked the Minister of Native Affairs this afternoon what his views were with regard to the proclamation system. He gave me a reply which I think was very unsatisfactory. I want to ask the Minister what the position is going to be in the native territories if industries are started up there. Under the Conciliation Act the principle has been accepted by this Government of equal pay for European labour, coloured labour and native labour. We know that the Wages Board is sitting at present, and it is quite possible that further regulations may be promulgated. I understand that there is a possibility of a tannery and boot factory being established in the native territories shortly, in which the idea is to utilize native labour as far as possible. If such a factory is established, will the Conciliation Board operate, and will the wages of the natives be fixed and be placed on the same level as Europeans&#x003F; Another point I would like to put to the Minister is the question of a divorce court up there. The Prime Minister, when he was in the native territories, promised that he <span class="col_3435-3436" refersTo="page_0670"/>would go into the matter very craefully. Today he says there are difficulties. The opportunity for getting divorce there has existed for 40 years. Without any reference to the natives, without any consultation at all, a proclamation was issued taking away that power from the chief magistrate. I would like to know from the Minister where the difficulties exist, and why he cannot issue a proclamation to-morrow to say that the chief magistrate shall deal with those cases. Another point is the power of government by proclamation. The Department of Native Affairs issued a proclamation a short time ago prohibiting all coloured people from obtaining liquor. That is a privilege which they have had for 40 years, and I am in very serious doubts about the power that is given to the Government to issue proclamations. Tomorrow we may have a proclamation issued directly affecting the Europeans. I would like the Prime Minister to reply to these three questions, because they relate to matters of great interest to the people in the territories.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. gentleman wants a reply, I must be brief again and give him a reply. As far as the first question is concerned about the proclamations, that is a question of law. The lawyer will be able to answer that question better than I can. In regard to divorce, I am not going to issue that proclamation, at any rate, not before I have considered the question better and have seen all the difficulties out of the way. No. 3 was the question of wages in view of the prospective establishment of industries in the territories. I cannot tell him that. We will have to see.</p>

<p>Any natives attempting to obtain a divorce have to go right round to Grahamstown if they want to get that divorce, and that practically puts the thing out of court. It is a condition of things which is very unfair. For 30 or 40 years the natives have had a competent court both at Umtata and Kokstad, but by this proclamation the Department has cut away from the natives any opportunity of getting a divorce at all. The expense of appealing to Grahamstown makes it impossible in that case. It will lead to a very serious state of affairs. I hope the Prime Minister will consider that and see if he can give some relief even if it is only temporary. I would appeal to him to relieve what is a very real hardship and which is keenly felt by the natives of these territories.</p>

<p>I want to ask a few questions about the trade commissioners, which is another item that goes up steadily by some thousands each year, the incresase over last year being &#x00A3;3,672. I wonder if the Minister, when he replies, could give the figures of our trade, with the countries for which we have trade commissioners. We have a trade commissioner on the Continent, the cost of whose office is &#x00A3;8,274. We have a trade commissioner in America, and the cost of his office is &#x00A3;6,200, an increase of &#x00A3;2,000 over last year. Can the Minister show in what way the work of the trade commissioner in America has produced tangible results&#x003F; I am not saying that it has not. Is there any growth in our trade with Kenya, and is the market in East Africa one we are sufficiently exploiting:&#x003F; I believe there are opportunities there, from what I know. It is a curious sort of anomaly that the Minister with whom we are brought most into contact in dealing with reports of the Board of Trade and Industries is the Minister of Finance, yet we find that this vote is under the Minister of Mines and Industries. I want to raise the point, if I am in order, as to the inconvenience from which members suffer by reason of the fact that these reports of the Board of Trade and Industries are tabled only shortly before we are called upon in Committee of Ways and Means to discuss these reports. Take the changes in the customs tariff, which we were debating only last week. It was only with the greatest difficulty that I could get a peep at the report of the Board of Trade. They prepared a sort of omnibus report dealing with items of taxation, which was put on the Table in typescript form. Once my friend in front of me (Mr. Jagger) gets hold of these reports, it is difficult to get them away from him. Cannot these reports be tabled earlier and printed&#x003F; There is a greater necessity for reports of this nature dealing with taxation than the ordinary departmental reports. Then I would like to ask what changes have been made in the personnel of the Board of Trade and Industries&#x003F; Last year we had a certain amount of discussion on that, and I ventured to make a criticism on the ground that it did not then contain a single man of commercial experience.</p>
