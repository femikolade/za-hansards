<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the Minister would not accept my reasonable amendment last night. I would move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end of the item &#x201C;motor tractors for agricultural purposes: free.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Under the exemption of agricultural machinery under tariff No. 118, it is only machinery and apparatus not specially provided for which come in free, and I am afraid that unless we put this in the item now under discussion it is possible&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This item deals with chassis. I am afraid the hon. member (Mr. Stuttaford) is out of order.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>A motor tractor, to a large extent, is chassis. It seems to me it would come in most conveniently here.</p>

</speech>

<p>Shall I be in order in moving to insert it after &#x201C;129,&#x201D; making it 129 (a)&#x003F; I move to insert it as a special item. I am afraid that unless we make it perfectly clear the Customs Department will consider that it comes under one or other items of motor transport generally. Item 129 deals with motor cars.</p>

<p>May I say to the Minister that this is an amendment of a certain item in Act 36 of 1925, and that&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but we are dealing with what is before us. We cannot deal with Act 36 of 1925 now.</p>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but we have nothing to do with that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to have your ruling, Mr. Chairman, because this is an important matter. I understand that we are now dealing in the schedules before the committee with an amendment of the customs laws. Under the circumstances is it not within the province of any member of the committee to move a reduction of any item in the existing customs laws of the country&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As I have said, hon. members may only move reductions on what is proposed and submitted to us, whatever the Act may say. Rule 115 applies to it. On the motion of Mr. Roux, an amendment was made in the Dutch version which did not occur in the English.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to move another amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">motor car chassis for the repairing and building of roads free.&#x201D;</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I feel in this case that the difficulty is perhaps due to want of <span class="col_3331-3332" refersTo="page_0618"/>knowledge of the mechanism. The engine of the chassis of the tractor is a similar class of article. There is no definition here that the motor chassis shall only be used on the road. Under this clause anyone importing a motor chassis would be charged under this item. You would find that the Customs Department would consider that this comes under this item.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not see how that can be so. This only refers to motor cars, not to tractors in any shape or form. Item 130 might be made more to apply to tractors, although it is not mentioned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the Minister would explain why he has made this change, because I think the change he has made going to defeat the object which encouraged the House in a previous session to make a great difference in the customs duties on motor chassis being imported for the purpose of having bodies built in the Union. Under the existing tariff, chassis, the bodies of which were to be assembled in the Union, came in at 10 per cent. Those of which the bodies were to be assembled in the Union came in at 20 per cent. Now we are going to allow a duty of 15 per cent, upon chassis, the bodies of which are simply to be assembled here. Does the Minister think that is going to encourage the coachbuilding industry of the Union&#x003F; Instead of building up a body-making industry, the chassis will be imported ; the stamp signs will come in, a coat of paint will be put over them, and you are going to give them a duty of 15 per cent. If you are building up a really genuine motor car body building industry, one would not have an objection to altering the tariff.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The right hon. member is wrong, I think. All that we mean to be imported are panels, stampings, and the structural parts of metal shaped but otherwise in the rough. All the other usual work connected with bodybuilding, all the wood and leather work, is to be done here. If we had a sufficient demand we would probably do the stampings here, as they do in Australia, where they have five times the number of cars they have here in this country. Our demand is comparatively small, and it would entail the installation of very expensive machinery.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reitz">

<from>Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>What otherwise have they to do with the shaped metal&#x003F; Screw it on and paint it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>A motor car does not consist of only steel work. It says here, &#x201C;not fashioned or cut to shape.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<from>Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is finished off. We are convinced that a very important part of the work of body building is to be done here, and that this concession is justified.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reitz">

<from>Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has not made himself very clear. Upholstering is not what he is protecting&#x2014;he is protecting the metal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>If the other parts are imported we do not give protection.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reitz">

<from>Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister is trying obviously to establish the metal part of it as an industry in this country. It is not the leather work and the upholstery work he is trying to protect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is the other way round, the very things I do protect. Is there no wood work in connection with the thing&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>In item 129 of the old tariff, under the head of motor cars, you will find, chassis imported for body building purposes, 10 per cent. ; motor trucks for body building purposes, 5 per cent. The whole of the superstructure can be made of any material grown in South Africa. This one, as far as I can understand, is really for the benefit of the Ford people and the South African Motors&#x2014; that they should start an assembling works.</p>

<p>In Port Elizabeth.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barlow">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>That is why the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) is so against it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, no; be fair. The Ford people find they cannot get the stamping done in South Africa, and they import the stamping. The Minister says it requires heavy machinery to do it. I am not supporting the Minister&#x2014; I abominate all these various things&#x2014;but I am only trying to make these things clear.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister will excuse me, but his punctuation is so prolific that it confuses, and I find very great difficulty in appreciating the meaning of this. The other material seems to be perfectly free. Either it wants more commas out, or some more in.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Take them all out!</p>

<p>Item, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On item 130,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person></from>

<p>; Steam wagons have hitherto been free, and are to be charged 10 per cent. Why put in an item like this&#x003F; Steam wagons are used only by contractors, municipalities and divisional councils. No firm in South Africa is going to make them&#x2014;these wagons are made by large firms overseas, like Merry-weathers, arid others, which specialize in these. It is only putting an increased burden on public bodies, and I hope my hon. friend will reconsider this. It will not bring a single man here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is probably right. The steam wagons will not be made here, but the bodies will, <span class="col_3333-3334" refersTo="page_0619"/>and that is what we are after. We admit the chassis at 5 per cent., and the bodies can be made here. If you have the whole article free you will not encourage the building of the body in South Africa. Although motor trucks pay 20 per cent., in practice they are not imported nowadays. In every case the body is being built in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Why do you want 5 per cent.&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is to put it on a par with your motor-truck which, at present, pays 10 per cent, on the chassis. Our present policy is to force the people who make the chassis to build the body here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barlow">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has let the cat out of the bag. He says the duty is to put the steam wagon on a par with the motor truck. The motor truck is burning oil which we import from America. The steam wagon is burning our coal. I find that the imports of steam trucks are going down. In 1924 we imported 60,000 and, for the last six months of 1925, the figure was only 26,000, and prices are going up higher every day. This tax is going to accelerate the price more than ever. This cannot be a protective tariff because we do not build these things in South Africa, and never will be able to build them here, and as a revenue tax it is highly objectionable. The Minister wants to put a tax of 5 per cent, on the steam wagon because they are going to build the body. Let the steam wagon come in free and tax the body. The farmers in the Free State are beginning to use these steam wagons, and I know it is the farmer who is going to pay in the end The Minister&#x2019;s constituency is next to mine, and we are running steam wagons to bring in the produce into our constituency and that of the hon. member for Boshof (Mr. van Rensburg).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>How many farmers in your constituency are using the steam wagon&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#barlow&#x2019;">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW&#x2019;</person>:</from>

<p>The son of the late Mr. Fichardt is running them from Bloemfontein to different places. We are going to make it more difficult for these people to run these steam wagons which will assist the Government in the western Free State. Why tax them&#x003F; The municipalities and the big contractors are using them. The Minister will get no revenue out of it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>In spite of the plea of my hon. friend, I am not afraid of the effect of this tax either on the farmers or the municipalities. He has told us that the importations are decreasing. There is absolutely no reason why this particular article should have an advantage over the motor lorry and charabanc and these things, and what we are after is to get the body built down here. It is only 5 per cent, on the chassis.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>How much body is there to a steam wagon&#x003F;</p>

<p>No. The hon. member says the steam wagon burns our coal, but we can get rid of our coal in other ways.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not often agree with the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow), but I do on this occasion. I do not know whether the Minister knows that there are a great number of steam wagons used in the wattle industry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>We would like to have the information. If the farmer uses them let him pay the duty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>They do not use coal to make their steam. They use wattle wood. This industry is growing because the wattle farmer has found out that, instead of having a great area of land for running his oxen, it can be better used for wattle, by using mechanical transport. I hope the Minister will have some regard for this portion of the country which is using these wagons. Why increase their difficulties&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>The last thing I should desire is to interfere between the bark and the tree. While agreeing with the Minister that he is justified in doing everything, he can to assist in the building of bodies for steam wagons in this country, which bodies are very often fairly large and are a legitimate industry, that is no reason for putting on a duty of 5 per cent, on the chassis which previously came in free. Last year traction engines and trailers, stone crushers, and street sweepers, which had previously paid a duty of 3 per cent., were put on the free list. Why not allow steam wagons without bodies to come in free&#x003F; Divisional councils are using a large number of steam wagons for road construction purposes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barlow">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister will not listen to me, and therefore, I will quote something to him from &#x201C;Die Burger&#x201D; of 14th April. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Transport is the artery of trade and industry, and any increase in costs of transport is a tax on every industry in the country, especially on the farming industry.</block>

<p>That is enough.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#munnik">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>On this question the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) seems to be antiquated. He says the reason for using the steam wagon is because it burns our own coal, but we can consume our own coal by making electricity, and if sufficient inducement offered, we could also obtain motor spirit from coal. The farmer has a very much cheaper vehicle in a motor wagon than in a steam lorry, which is entirely antiquated. The tendency to-day is to use petrol and electricity and not steam.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deane">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEANE</person>:</from>

<p>The district I represent is a wattle one, and has an enormous amount of wood and bark transport. Two or three years <span class="col_3335-3336" refersTo="page_0620"/>ago there was quite a boom in the Sentinel steam wagons, because they were admitted free, but to-day petrol driven lorries are more in favour. I have yet to see a steam driven lorry which will carry twelve tons, but that is quite a common sight with petrol motor lorries.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reitz">

<from>&#x2020;Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>I understand the Minister said his object was to get the bodies of steam wagons built in this country. According to item 130, motor trucks, trailers and vans and charabancs, the bodies of which can be made here, are not protected. I do not know whether I read the item aright.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that the hon. member (Col. D. Reitz) does not quite understand the position. He will see that the completed vehicle is heavily taxed, not because we want to get the revenue from that vehicle. If you take the other item, we let the chassis in at a low rate, and this has the result that the body is built here. We find that people do not import the completed vehicle. We do not want them to import the steam wagon and pay the duty of 5 per cent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>The point is why charge this duty on chassis of 5 per cent.&#x003F; If it is desirable to encourage people to import chassis in order to induce them to build the bodies here, why not let them in free&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The reason is that last year, when we dealt with the tariff as a whole, we said we could not let the chassis in free altogether. We had to get something from them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I think this is going a very long way. Iron pipes, which are used for irrigation purposes and for bringing water into towns and cities, are to bear a duty of 20 per cent. But that is not all. Further on I see that pipes, piping and tubes for drainage purposes are also going to be taxed 25 per cent. If that is encouraging industry, I don&#x2019;t know what is encouraging industry, that&#x2019;s all! Where is the encouragement to a man who wants to carry out irrigation work&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#rockey">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROCKEY</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to support the protest of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). All the big piping brought out to this country over 20 inches in diameter, every bit of it is rivetted when it comes into this country. There is not the machinery in this country to-day to make this big piping. It cannot be made here, and won't be made here for years, so what is the use of putting a duty on material of that kind&#x003F;</p>

<p>Is that the sort of protection we are indulging in&#x003F; Is the Minister trying to create an industry out of a man taking a jack-hammer or a monkey-wrench and screwing these rivets together&#x003F; It seems to me that this is protection run mad. We are putting on a protective duty of 20 per cent, for the purpose of creating a class to screw in rivets. It seems to me an extraordinary way of building up a South African industry.</p>

<p>If this is extending engineering shops, I am sorry for the industrial future of South Africa. This is of a piece with the whole system. You are protecting bastard industries. There is no sign in this tariff that I can see, with the possible exception of sugar, of protecting any bona fide South African industry by creating and encouraging industries that are using South African raw materials. Can this Souse imagine a more parasitical, a more bastard, industry than this rivetting business&#x003F; All our key industries that can be established here are ignored in this tariff. This tariff as it stands is simply going to harass the public, increase the cost to the public and establish not one single industry of any significance in the Union. It is a tariff of nick-nacks.</p>

<p>I am afraid I must differ from the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz), in his estimation of the value of an engineering industry or engineering workshops in this country. I believe the hon. member is in favour of an iron industry in this country. This is one of the subsidiary industries. We hope one day to make the iron and this will be one of the subsidiary industries. Let me tell the hon. member that the material is imported in sheets and it is smoothed out, perforated and rivetted here. There is a lot of labour in connection with the whole thing. Our object is to provide <span class="col_3337-3338" refersTo="page_0621"/>employment for our own people. The hon. member does not want that, apparently.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) that this is protection gone mad. The cost of the piping to the consumer in this country is not represented altogether in the 15 or 20 per cent, ad valorem duty, but also in the additional expense that will be caused to him owing to the extra cost of making inferior pipes in this country. To my mind this protection appears as ridiculous as it would be if anybody said: We shall nut an enormous tax upon iron safes, because you can manufacture the keys in this country.</p>

The Vereeniging steel people are pushing ahead to make the very material that these pipes are made of and we have the finest mechanics in South Africa. Some of them are looking for work to-day, while stuff that can be made in our own shops is being imported. Not long ago the Minister of Mines and Industries paid a visit to some of the workshops on the Witwatersrand and in one of these saw a big job being carried out for the Irrigation Department, largely consisting of wrought iron rivetted pipes.</p>

He is looking at it through the wrong end of the telescope. When hon. members on the other side bring forward a policy under the sacred name of white employment, or this or that, I always suspect them. They have in the past exploited the public in the name of South African patriotism, and I am afraid they are going to do it again under the sacred name of white employment. We are just as desirous of strengthening the position of the white man, and of seeing economic employment, but we think we have every right to criticize an unsound tariff without having it thrown in our faces that we do not want white employment.

<p>The South African party Government initiated a policy of white labour in this country. We started it on the railways, in forestry and at Hartebeestpoort. We gave employment to thousands upon thousands of whites. The Minister is a fair-minded man ; surely he will give us credit as South Africans for being anxious to see the position of the whites strengthened in South Africa. That is why I appeal to him, not to meet us with this argument every time we legitimately criticize the tariff. It is untrue and unfair. I will prophesy that this series of bastard industries will not strengthen the white position in this country.

You are taking about the best steps you can to deprive white labour of work here.

It is admitted that the farmers do not make a big income, and you are interfering very seriously with that income. The tendency will be, as in every country&#x2014;it has been shown to be so in America, and in some little degree in Australia and Canada&#x2014;to drive people off the land. In the mining industry the tendency of this legislation is to increase the working costs, and, as has been pointed out by the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer), the more you increase the working costs, the more mines you make unpayable, and the fewer men are employed. If we advocate moderation in these things, it is done with the same idea as my hon. friend does it ; we believe our policy will lead to more employment of white labour.</p>

That is the result of the example we have been setting, and giving white men a chance that they did not have before. I suppose we will have a time of trouble in this country again, at some time or another, when we shall be very glad to have the engineering shops in this country. We appreciated their presence in the time of the war. I think I was perfectly entitled to make the deduction I did from the conduct of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central). At present it may be true we are importing steel plates. We hope that very shortly we shall turn out iron and steel in this country, and the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) may be able to give us information about that. The pipe is made in this country. The hon. member for Germiston (Mr. G. Brown), who speaks with some authority, has given us the assurance that these pipes are being made. We are <span class="col_3343-3344" refersTo="page_0624"/>not paying a heavy duty on this raw material under item 127&#x2014;those are enamelled sheets. We want to put a duty on the finished article to encourage the completion of these pipes in our own engineering workshops, and if these people get a chance, there is no reason why this sort of work should not be turned out in this country at as cheap a price as the article we are importing.

No, this is all very well&#x2014; to talk about your primary industries and to protect them&#x2014;but one thing has been clearly demonstrated in this country, that your primary industries, in the mines and farming alone, will not provide work for all your people. There are hundreds of people in our towns to-day, many of whom inherited farms, but they are off these farms to-day. People are slipping off the land. There are many factories which have influenced this. We are still doing our best to stimulate both those primary industries. Take your average farmer. He may have three or four sons. They won&#x2019;t all stay on the farm. Some say they have no inclination for farming, and some will go to the towns no matter what you do, and that is what you have to reckon with.

But I plead that before you put a penalty upon a large section of the agricultural people, who use these pipes very largely in their irrigation works, the Minister should consider more than he has done in the past, whether this is a legitimate case for introducing a moderate system of protection.</p>

<p>One hon. member pointed out a certain type of work that he contended could not be done in this country. He referred to the cutting of plates. I am prepared to state that as yet there is no plate that has come into this country that our men are not able to bend, cut, drill, rivet and erect. During our visit to the various industries up north, one engineering works on the Witwatersrand had a notice posted in a conspicuous place which stated that nothing in engineering is impossible to the South African artizan, and I believe that to be true. If these men are given the opportunity, they are fully competent to produce the requirements of this country, but the position in regard to engineering, along with other trades, is that because of the oversea production by lower standards, we are not in a position to compete. Give them the necessary protection, and our engineering trade can be made second to none in the world. I have been unable to grasp whether we have a free trade opposition or a protectionist one. They speak with many different voices, and are unable to decide this important matter themselves. I am not prepared to admit that under a free trade policy you will eliminate or even reduce unemployment, but under a tariff wall we have a far better mode of livelihood for our workers than under free trade. It may be pointed out that in protected America you still have unemployment ; that I also admit. But in free trade Great Britain, unemployment is far more acute and consistent, and the general conditions of the workers cannot be compared with those of the American artizan.</p>

<p>In the schedule it says that the present maximum duty tax on &#x201C;wrought iron or steel pipes and tubes&#x2014;rivetted&#x201D; is 1s. ad valorem. The words &#x201C;ad valorem&#x201D; ought to go with the 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, proposed duty. When I refer to the old schedule of the tax then I find that it is 1s. per 100 lbs. and not 1s. ad valorem. The old tax was 1s. per 100 lbs. and the proposed tax is now 15 or 20 per cent, ad valorem. It is clear that the words really ought to go in columns 3 and 4. The Minister quoted the report of the Board of Trade and Industries. The board seems to me not to be so very positive that the article can be made here. The board says in its report that that proposed tax of 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, is on wrought iron or plates and pipes and 25 per cent, on steel windows and parts thereof. (The Minister has dropped the 25 per cent, duty on steel windows). The report further says that the articles in this item have been selected after careful consideration whether they can be made in the Union, and that sufficient can be made to provide the country&#x2019;s requirements if existing machinery is extended. The board by no means says that the article is already made here, but that it can be so made, and that sufficient can be made to provide for the requirements of the country by making alterations to the machinery. The Minister has made it prefectly clear that the duty is imposed to protect the manufacture of plates and wrought iron. Now I ask the Minister if he does not himself think that the tax now imposed is too great a jump, viz.: from 1s. per 100 lbs. to 15 and 20 per cent, ad valorem&#x003F;</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEUWENHUIZE</person>:</from>

<p>I hope it is as the Minister thinks and that the increased duty will not affect the price, because the difference is very great. 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, ad valorem tax means a duty of 7s. and 8s. per 100 lbs. Take, e.g., a steel pipe with a diameter of 12 inches and a thickness of 8 inches. The duty on this will be 7s. or 8s. This means that the duty will be 700 per cent, more, which seems to be too big a jump. I can understand that protection of home industries is necessary but it is too big a jump. They are pipes which are used by farmers for irrigation, because the carriage by rail on the pipes is small as they weigh little, less than cast iron pipes on which owing to their greater weight more railage has to be paid. The pipes are preferred for irrigation purposes. I hope the Minister will see his way to make the duty 5 per cent, minimum and 10 per cent, maximum, instead of 15 and 20 per cent. Another point is that I should like to alter the word &#x201C;vasgeklamp&#x201D; into &#x201C;vasgeklink&#x201D; which is the word used in the English text, and quite rightly, because rivets are used for the purpose.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">REYBURN</person>:</from>

<p>I take it the reason why the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) has moved this amendment is that he is afraid that this duty if applied to pipes for agricultural or irrigation purposes is going to increase the price. That is not necessary at all, and I would like to point out that in many cases, putting on a duty like this actually decreases the price. Take steel pipes. Steel to-day is almost a monopoly in Europe. It is in the hands of one big trust. What happens, of course, when an industry is started through a protective tariff, especially, is that the price of the steel trust&#x2019;s pipes promptly comes down in competition. I would remind the House of what happened in Australia in regard to reapers and binders when the protective tariff was introduced. These implements were formerly admitted duty free, but when a 45 per cent, duty was put on the price of reapers and binders immediately went up from &#x00A3;98 to &#x00A3;125. The local factories soon afterwards started production, and, instead of selling at the old price of the imported article, they started selling at &#x00A3;95. Then along came the trust, and notwithstanding the 45 per cent, duty which had been put on, they brought their artificial price down from &#x00A3;125 to &#x00A3;80. To-day with a tariff of 45 per cent, the cost <span class="col_3349-3350" refersTo="page_0627"/>to the farmer has been reduced to &#x00A3;68. That is what will happen in this case. When we get an iron and steel industry, prices will come down.</p>

There is no such thing as far as I know on a sugar estate as a cane truck as such. There are the ordinary trolleys built up on pieces of wood to hold the cane. There are literally hundreds of miles of light railways on the sugar estates. I know of large consignments on order which will be heavily penalized. Zululand is intersected by small rivers and creeks and dongas, and ironwork for bridges forms a very important item in laying these railways This is purely an agricultural industry, and the Minister told us under 89 that we were not to worry about it ; it was for the mining industry only. He was very clear that the agricultural industry was not going to be included in this. Let me remind him that the sugar planters in Zululand are without exception Government settlers.

<p>Because the farmer is not going to pay more, and the little he will pay is a burden he should carry if he wants to have a protection policy. We have examined these proposals of the Board of Trade, and we have cut out the things where it appears that the engineering workshops are not yet in a position to manufacture those articles at a cheap and satisfactory price, but there is no reason why, if this protection is given, these articles could not be turned out as cheaply as they can be imported. I understand that this cane truck is merely the body, which can be turned out in any engineering workshop and at cheap prices. As far as the axles and wheels are concerned, they come in free under another item. It is just the body which we are going to tax.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>That is very strange, because I have a letter from a friend here who is in the sugar business, and who writes on this very point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So far as I can gather, no cane trucks are being or have been made in South Africa, nor is there any likelihood of their being made in the near future whatever may happen in years to come.</block>

<p><span class="col_3351-3352" refersTo="page_0628"/>There is another point also in this connection. My hon. friend has three items in this list alone where he is putting a burden on the sugar industry. Take 118, plates and frames for sugar presses. That has been put up to 20 per cent. Now on this item of cane trucks the ad valorem duty is increased to 20 per cent. Then further down, item 235, pastes and powders, there is an increase from 3 per cent, to 20 per cent. All these mean an added burden. My friend also writes&#x2014;</p>

As a matter of fact, the Railway Department is paying these duties, and you increase the capital cost on your track, and so forth, and the annual charge for interest. There is only one way to pay for these things, and that is by the things produced. That is what the Minister and his friends behind him entirely forget. The things that come in have to be paid for.

The idea is not to put a heavy duty on the imported article, but we want to stop the importation of articles which can be made in our own engineering workshops, which they can make as cheaply as the imported article.</p>

<p>I hope the Minister will make this apply very severely to the South African Railways. It is getting very prevalent in the country, and this House, to decry and belittle anything that is made in this country. Every article that is mentioned in this particular item under discussion can be made in our own railway workshops, and more cheaply than they can be imported. The difficulty is that we have officials in our railway service who are continually decrying and belittling the South African manufacturer. During the regime of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), a little footbridge was wanted at Germiston, and the officials seriously recommended that it could not be made in this country. It could have been made within a fortnight, not many hundreds of yards away from where it was to be erected ; but it took seven months to get it from overseas. We are importing points and crossings that could be made quite as well at the Salt River workshops, and other articles which could be made as well there, and at the Uitenhage workshops. Even when they were going to build a graving dock in Durban they must try to get an engineer from overseas ; fortunately, our own engineers stopped it, and we constructed that dock, with the result that at least &#x00A3;750,000 was saved on what it would have cost had an engineer been imported from overseas. Last year, or the year before, 1,000 grain wagons were ordered, and I believe they could have been made as well here. I hope we will be able to make axles and wheels here very soon. Cannot iron bridge-work be made in this country&#x003F; They are continually making bridge-work on the mines of the Witwatersrand, and our own railways, when they want a little bit of bridge-work, call for tenders, through the High Commissioner&#x2019;s office, and send over to Great Britain or America. I am glad the Minister is taking up the attitude now that the South African article is not inferior to anything we can get on the other side, and that the workmanship is not inferior. If we are to go on importing this work, what is to become of those lads who are passing into those shops&#x003F; They will have no opportunity to be trained as highly-skilled men. I am glad that the Minister is going to insist on a tariff that will assist to develop this industry, because these things can-and should be made in this country.</p>

<p>I wish to support all that has been said about this item by the last speaker, the hon. member for Germiston, and in doing so I would point out that this will be of far greater value to our local engineering trade than the item we have just passed. That gives a little protection over steel pipes, etc., and is of some value, but this item is of the utmost importance to our own industries, and will certainly mean more employment. Opposition members have continually opposed protection to what they have called bastard industries, and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) has now moved an amendment against this proposal. Surely, sir, we are not to be told that our engineering industry, the key industry of the Union, is to be classed as a bastard industry. I cannot understand the argument that an industry which is well protected should be allowed free trade for its own requirements. The hon. member wishes to exclude the sugar industry. Well, sir, that industry has been given healthy protection by this House, and I venture to suggest it would be most unfair if we allow them to obtain their requirements in the cheapest possible market overseas, to the detriment of our own engineering trades. No, sir ; this item is of the utmost importance to our local artizans, and I hope the hon. the Minister is not going to listen too much to the blandishments of the importing merchant princes on the Opposition benches.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nicholls">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>I would not like the House to suppose that the sugar industry is opposed to this tariff. I have a letter from the secretary of the South African sugar industry, giving the views of the industry on this matter. In this letter the secretary states that he thinks he is safe in saying that there is a general opinion not unfavourable to the increased duties, provided their aim is the development of South African industries, and there is reasonable prospect of that aim being achieved. Naturally, people who had ordered cane trucks and had them on the seas, and as a result of that tariff were suddenly called upon to pay 17 per cent, more on the price, felt that some expression of opinion should be obtained. As a protected industry, the sugar industry naturally supports protection in other industries where there is an opportunity of further employment in the country. The engineering industry employs the greatest amount of white labour in the country, and there is no industry which we can develop so greatly as that and all the other subsidiary industries related to the production of iron, and because it is an industry that can grow in such importance and because its chief markets, will be overseas or in the territories beyond the Union; I think it ought to be protected in its initial stages. Pig iron should be protected by a big bounty, as I advocated in my speech the other day on a motion to go into ways and means. If pig iron can be produced cheaply, the other industries can be carried on cheaply on that basis. I simply rose to say that the sugar industry has discussed these tariffs and is agreeable to the introduction of such a duty.</p>

<p>When this motion was introduced, I put a question to the Minister. I want to know what the policy is with regard to protection&#x2014;whether the protection and stimulation of the iron and steel industry is to be by a protective duty or by a bounty.

<speech by="#nel">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I think the Minister has overlooked the position the raw material is going to be in. Here you have girders&#x2014;structural steel. I want to give the relative position of the industries using structural steel, say, at Cape Town. These figures are from, the leading article in the &#x201C;Cape Times,&#x201D; and I have ascertained that they are correct. Imported steel can be delivered at Johannesburg to-day at &#x00A3;14 16s. 11d. a short ton ; in Durban at &#x00A3;10 13s. 6d., and in Cape Town &#x00A3;10 10s. a ton. The railway rate from Vereeniging to Johannesburg is 18s. 4d. a ton, and from Vereeniging to Durban &#x00A3;2 5s. a ton, and to Cape Town &#x00A3;4 3s. 4d. a ton. To capture the market or to be able to cater for that market at these various centres, Vereeniging would have to sell on rail at Vereeniging for Johannesburg at &#x00A3;13 8s. 7d. ; for Durban at &#x00A3;8 8s. 6d. ; and for Cape Town at &#x00A3;6 6s. 8d. The latter is, I understand, considerably below the price at which structural steel can be produced to-day at Vereeniging. So far as Johannesburg is concerned, the locally produced article will be able to compete there, but it will not be able to sell a ton of steel in Cape Town, Durban, Port Eizabeth or East London, in competition with the imported article, unless some special form of protection is granted. We hope that pig iron will very shortly be produced at Newcastle. Cleveland No. 1 pig iron can be delivered in Johannesburg via Delagoa Bay at &#x00A3;6 14s. 7d. a ton, at Durban at &#x00A3;4 18s., and in Cape Town at &#x00A3;4 15s. In order to compete against this, we should have to sell pig iron at Johannesburg at &#x00A3;5 16s. 7d. a ton, at Durban at &#x00A3;3 16s. 2d., and at Cape Town at 2d. a ton, as the railage from Newcastle to these points is: Johannesburg 18s. a ton, Durban &#x00A3;1 2s. 4d., and Cape Town &#x00A3;4 14s. 10d. If my figures are correct, this industry will be placed in an impossible position so far as the coast towns are concerned, and unless there is a readjustment of railway rates, or other adequate protection granted, it will be impossible to sell the industry&#x2019;s products at the coast towns. The only place where it will be possible to sell is Johannesburg. What does the Minister intend to do about it&#x003F; High protective duties are being given to the subsidiary industries, but nothing is being done for the key industries. Since this Government has been in <span class="col_3355-3356" refersTo="page_0630"/>power, we have not received for these primary industries which produce the raw material a pennyworth of protection, or even sympathy. I have made efforts to secure some help for the industry, but have always been turned down for political reasons, and no other, because the Government is all out to build up an iron industry at Pretoria. When I brought forward a motion on the subject, I received no sympathy &#x2019;whatever from hon. members opposite. I hope the Minister will show some practical sympathy, and do all he can to stimulate and protect this very important industry.</p>

<p>The industry can be worked economically, and it can produce all the pig iron required in this country. The principle of bounties has been adopted, and the industry is based on that principle. When the bounty was granted, it was assumed that subsidiary industries would be built up on the same principle. We have to look a little further than South Africa if we wish to establish a sound iron industry here, and we should aim at securing the Rhodesian and other markets in the north. That can be achieved only with the help of a bounty. The Minister should take a bold step and assist the industry by means of a bounty, for I am afraid if once it is established on a protective basis, it will be very hard to return to the bounty system. It would pay the country to give a bounty even to the subsidiary industries, so that they may sell their articles in the adjoining state. I believe there is quite a big market in the north. The industry cannot really expand on a large scale on the Union&#x2019;s consumption only. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Yes, but it does not make sufficient provision.

It is a beautiful illustration of what I have said all along, that the Government are looking at the protection of our industries through the wrong end of the telescope. This is a tariff which is designed to build up the Labour party. It amounts to a bounty to the Labour party, and I hope that Nationalist members will note what is going on. This is a subsidy paid to the Labour party at the expense of the farmer and the rest of the public. Let me tell the hon. members who have threatened me with what my constituents will do, that my constituents will be quite satisfied with knowing that they are represented not by a man who is cringing at every turn and blowing not and cold with every change of the wind.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>The speeches which we have had from the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) and the Minister of Finance were extremely interesting and also an eye-opener. All these elaborate proposals for the purpose of encouraging the engineering industry have been founded on one thing&#x2014;the turning out of pigiron <span class="col_3357-3358" refersTo="page_0631"/>at Newcastle. The Minister several times has indicated, and it has been clearly understood here, as far as I am concerned, that one of the reasons why this elaborate schedule has been brought forward has been largely for the purpose of assisting the engineering industry. We have been told by the Minister that they are now turning out pig iron at Newcastle, and they want to find a market for it. Now we are told that they cannot sell their pig iron in competition with imported pig iron. The basic industry of this elaborate engineering industry is itself wanting assistance from the State. In that case this is not a natural industry. They cannot compete with stuff that has to come 6,000 miles ; they have to come and whine to the State. I do not think it would be done of set purpose, but the committee has been put under a wrong impression. I am not blaming the Minister, but we understood you had the pig iron on the spot, and now we find it is not there. Where then is the justification for these heavy duties that you put on these other industries&#x003F; Some of these industries are importing pig iron because they cannot get it in South Africa at the price. The next thing, I suppose, will be a heavy duty on iron and steel, and up go prices still further.</p>

I think the hon. member is going a little beyond the mark when he accuses us of coming forward under false pretences. All these are to encourage the engineering industry, not the industry of producing pig iron. As for the delicious statement that this was a Labour tariff, why, for the last week we have been hearing that this is a monstrous tariff ; it is going to increase the cost of living by making bread and ready-made clothing dearer&#x2014; and yet he says this is a Labour tariff. The hon. member forgets he is talking to the same audience. I saw in the papers that he made a speech at Bethel where he denounced the Nationalists for delivering themselves into the hands of the Labour party, and then, only three days later, he denounced the Labour party for delivering themselves into the hands of the Nationalists. He should not do it to the same audience. We are entirely logical in our course.

The reply gave the number: Buffers, 6,121; coupling links, 18,090. The average landing cost per buffer imported was &#x00A3;5 10s. 9d., and the average cost of the locally made buffers in the railway workshops was &#x00A3;4. In regard to coupling links the imported link cost 13s. 2d., and the link made in the railway workshops cost 8s. 10d. I think that justifies the statement of the hon. member for Germiston.</p>

<p>I deny that I suggested anything to the contrary at any time during the discussion. The Government did not accept this recommendation, because they had not commenced production, and the industry had not sufficiently advanced. Then they deal with the engineering industry, and discuss it from every angle. And there we picked out certain items which we think they can be made here economically to-day at satisfactory prices, and accepted them. Mere, for the last hour, we have been discussing an item of steel pipes, where it was distinctly stated that the raw material&#x2014;steel plates&#x2014;was being imported free. Where am I deceiving the House&#x003F; The whole burden of the song this afternoon has been that I am giving protection to the engineering industry, and they are importing the raw material. I did not deny it. What ground has the hon. member for saying: Here is a revelation&#x003F; I do not think it is right. They talk about the Government being unsympathetic to this iron industry.</p>

<p>I shall be pleased if the hon. member will give examples. I am informed that what happened in some cases was that application was made for protection, and the Board have gone in a few cases to people in the same line of business to see whether they agree with the application. The hon. member complains that in some instances not enough evidence has been taken. We deliberately state here that as far as the proposals at present before the House are concerned, they are in the interests of the engineering industry, an industry which we have got in the country&#x2014;an industry trying to carry on in the circumstances in which they find themselves. If we get this pig-iron produced cheaply, I suppose the industry will have a better chance, but even while that state of things has not come to pass, we allow them to import the raw material free. I do not see why we should not keep these people going. I think the hon. member will see he was wrong in saying that I had deceived the House, and that something has come out now that absolutely upsets the case of the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Park-town (Mr. Rockey) has made charges against the Labour party in regard to the limitation of apprentices. The hon. gentleman, who is such an authority on the working classes, should know perfectly well that this is a matter of arrangement by the apprenticeship committees, which are composed of equal numbers of employers and employees. Why does he not accuse the employers, representatives whom he represents in this House&#x003F; We are quite prepared to answer for what we are responsible for, but the Labour party has nothing to do with this, and is not prepared to take the blame. But I might tell him why it is not advisable to have too many apprentices. What is the good of having shops full of apprentices and have the fathers of the boys going about looking for work&#x003F; The hon. member wants to have six fathers applying for one job, so that the law of supply and demand will operate with the inevitable result that the maintenance of the civilized standard of life will be seriously threatened in this country.</p>

He states that they are already producing 30,000 tons, and that if they are to meet the prospective requirements of other important industries, further additions will have to be made to their steel plant.</p>

<p>I want to know also from the Minister what is going to be the position if, during the next six months, pig-iron is produced in large quantities and dumping takes place in the country. Is he going to give us protection, because the iron and steel industry in Europe and England is under an international agreement at present to export their products to any country at 33&#x00BD; per cent, less than the cost at which it is sold in those countries. The result is going to be that immediately we start producing pig-iron, it will be dumped here at 33&#x00BD; per cent, less than the price in the country of production. Is the Minister going to give us protection against dumping and has he taken into consideration the position I mentioned, in which I clearly demonstrated that it would be impossible to compete in the coastal areas of South Africa with imported steel and pig iron&#x003F; This is a very serious matter, and unless something is done, the protected engineering trades will use imported material, as Newcastle will not be able to compete at the ports. The matter should be very seriously considered both by the Government and the Board of Trade.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. BROWN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is a little bit out there. Pig-iron is of no earthly use until it is manufactured into something. What the country requires is not to export the pig-iron but to provide a home market for it, and we should develop our internal markets. It is no use talking of exporting, seeing that India is landing pig-iron at Durban at &#x00A3;5 10s. a ton f.o.b. We cannot deliver pig-iron at that price, but we should assist the engineering trades to create a market for the goods they make out of the pig-iron. In the meantime a large, number of our boys, who should be trained to trades, are drifting into blind alley occupations, because there are not sufficient industries here to afford them employment.</p>

It is some three or four years since that took place, and I am not aware of the exact circumstances, but I have got a list in this report of the Departmental Committee of the Railways which shows the fallacy of that statement. Louvre catches cost at Uitenhage 7s. 3d., while the imported local cost is 11d. Spring, table and folding catches cost 10s. at Bloemfontein and 2s. imported.

I have had some correspondence about this matter, and it has been represented to me that carbonate of soda is used for several other industries.

<p>This industry has been in difficulties from the start.

The industry has claimed that it ought to have a dumping duty. It is entitled to a dumping duty now, and I shall have to either increase the present duty or put on a dumping duty. The board, after investigating the matter, bas come to the conclusion that this would be the better way of dealing with it. Unless I can get the Minister of Railways to give them that special rate, they will still be in difficulties. So far the Minister of Railways has not been prepared to give them that rate. The board, in their report, state that unless they get the increased duty and also the special rate, they will remain in difficulties.

I do know that two local bag factories are pretty well going out of business owing to competition from overseas. They have the machinery to produce all the requirements of this country. I am not referring to grain bags or wool bags, but to the linen bag used mainly for tobacco, and pocket sugar, or flour bags, but they are all being brought from overseas. I am told that your local bag manufacturers have quoted a price pretty well equivalent to the price of the imported article, and still they have not been successful.

<p>I wish the Minister would tell us what industry he thinks he is protecting under this. Take the case of a firm in England making incubators. They send their catalogues here. The Minister forces that firm to have an agency here, but you cannot force them to do so if it is economically unpayable. It is apparently an industry of agents.</p>

<p>I know the hon. member for Riversdale (Mr. Badenhorst) never reads anything. Farmers depend largely on catalogues for their implements. Take the medical profession, which gets catalogues from which a medical man selects the instruments he wants. Does the Minister seriously intend to force instrument makers to have an agent here&#x003F; They will not do it, and the result is that you will debar medical men, schoolmasters, artists, literary men and farmers&#x2014; one can hardly think of any branch of intellectual activity that will not be prejudiced by this. It is a very important market, though a limited one.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has just been expressing a considerable amount of sympathy with merchants and manufacturers, and unfortunately was not able to translate that sympathy into practice, but here I think he has that opportunity, and I hope he will grasp it. Last year I pointed out that under his methods of taxation of public companies, he charges an investment in a public company at a higher rate than the most wealthy individual in the country which is 2s. in the &#x00A3; normal tax. Under the resolution as we have it, the Minister is charging income, small or large, at the rate of 2s. 6d. in the &#x00A3;. I would like to refer the Minister to the report of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue for 1924-&#x2019;25, which was the last we have. On page 16 he will find that the taxable income of individuals amounts to &#x00A3;58,000,000 odd and on that they pay a normal tax of &#x00A3;1,754,000. The taxable income of companies amounts to &#x00A3;25,000,000 odd, only half the amount, and they pay &#x00A3;1,886,000 odd. That is, for committing <span class="col_3371-3372" refersTo="page_0638"/>the sin of having your money invested in limited liability companies, you are paying double the rate of normal tax that an individual does. On the same page, he will find that the tax yield per &#x00A3; of income of individuals is 7.17d. per &#x00A3;. The tax for each &#x00A3; of income of the limited liability companies is 17.99d. That seems to me conclusive evidence that the Minister taxes an investor in limited liability companies at more than double the rate that he charges a private individual and the next report of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will show a greater accentuation of this injustice than even the present one. I think I can appeal to the hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay) to support me in this. In addition to this injustice, last year the Minister omitted to put in any clause enabling the company to pass on the normal tax to the preference shareholder, and the result is that today if a man has &#x00A3;20,000 a year invested in preference shares, he pays not a single penny in normal tax, while a man with an income of &#x00A3;200 or &#x00A3;300 a year, if he has anything invested in ordinary shares, he pays 2s. 6d. in the &#x00A3; and in addition has to pay the income tax of the gentleman with &#x00A3;20,000 invested in preference shares. I suggest to the Minister that the whole basis of the tax is wrong and always was wrong. The Minister and his predecessors have started on the wrong basis, and they will always be wrong until they get back to a fair basis to start with. The Minister is always replying that he considers a company is a persona, I think he said.</p>

<p>A legal entity.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>That is a beautiful word ; but when it comes to deciding the tax, the legal entity has to pay tax at a higher rate than the individual. He is only a legal entity so long as it is to his disadvantage and when it is to his advantage, he is told you are not the same as an individual. I do not know what the Minister will call him then, and whatever way the matter is looked at, the company is mulcted. There is no essential crime in investing your savings in a limited liability company ; so why should an individual pay a higher rate in the &#x00A3; in investments in limited liability companies than when he derives his income from any other kind of investment&#x003F; I do not despair of converting the Minister because he is essentially a fair-minded man. I feel that privately he knows it is unjust ; But the dread necessity of collaring money wherever you can get it, putting your hand into any man&#x2019;s pocket where you think you are safe, is a vice which even the fairest-minded Minister of Finance acquires in a very short time. I have suggested to the Minister that he should put a tax of a shilling on a limited liability company. A shilling is the basic rate ; that is each individual is charged a shilling plus so much, according to the increase in the amount of his income. If the Minister would put that tax on at a shilling and then each individual would be assessed when they came to deal with his private income at the rate appropriate to his personal income. That is, if a man had &#x00A3;20,000 a year he would pay another shilling, making it the maximum. If he only had &#x00A3;200 a year, he would not pay anything extra at all. That puts the case fairly. I recognize that it is asking too much to ask the Minister to put on sackcloth and ashes to-night and relinquish this unfair gain that he makes and reduce this tax from 2s. 6d. to 1s., but he might reduce the tax to 2s. That is the maximum that any man in this country has to pay, however great his income. Then next year I will ask him to so arrange his finances with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that he can get back to a just and correct position. I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In paragraph (b) to omit &#x201C;and sixpence &#x201D;.</block>

<p>and I would further suggest to the Minister that in the Bill incorporating this resolution, he will consider the wisdom of inserting a clause for preference shareholders and other than ordinary shareholders, somewhat on similar lines of Clause 48 of the 1917 Act. That may obviate that portion of a very unsatisfactory form of taxation.</p>

<p>I have sympathy, but these gentlemen deliberately incorporate themselves into a limited liability company, so as to derive the benefits of incorporation. We have introduced special legislation giving companies all the benefits of incorporation, and for that reason we are taxing them separately. I would very much like to assist the preference shareholders, for I know some of them have difficulties in obtaining a refund from the British Government, but if we do that you upset the principle upon which the tax is based. I am therefore very sorry I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I am very much disappointed with the Minister. I thought he had really a soft spot in his heart for the merchant. I cannot see, if he insists that a company is a legal entity, which is exactly the same as an individual, how he can possibly defend a tax of 2s. 6d. on a company, when the maximum tax on an individual is 2s. Another absurdity is that a shareholder resident in England cannot obtain any benefit from the Imperial Treasury for the amount he has paid on the dividend as income tax in South Africa. If you deduct 2s. from a South African dividend paid in England, the Imperial Treasury refund it to you, but because we do not deduct it we do not get the money back from the Imperial Treasury. Of course, this is one sort of support for the Imperial Government, and they should recognize the kindness of the Minister in arranging it.</p>
