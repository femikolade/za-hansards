<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before you put the questions, may I address you on a matter of privilege? The matter I want to mention is the very serious insinuation &#x2014;charge&#x2014;which was made against my personal honour last night by the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick). His remarks, taken together, can bear only one construction, and that is that I have been guilty of doing something which was discreditable and which involved my personal honour, and consequently that I was prevented from carrying out my duties as a Minister of this country. I wish to ask the hon. member for Illovo whether he is prepared to formulate and substantiate the charges conveyed in the insinuation which he made. If he is, then I am going to ask that this House <span class="col_1051-1052" refersTo="page_0563"/>sets up a select committee to investigate these charges and to report. I would like to express my personal wish in this regard that I should be pleased if the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) could be chairman of that committee. If the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) is not prepared to formulate this charge, then I ask him unequivocally and unreservedly to withdraw the serious insinuations and imputations which he made last night against my personal honour.</p>

<speech by="#marwick">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to the statement of the Minister of Labour. I have only to say this, that I want to stand or fall by what I said in the House last night. I have before me the unrevised report of &#x201C;Hansard&#x201D; on this question. On reading a statement made by Mr. Maxwell, a well-known man throughout South Africa, and well-known throughout the world for his work on big game&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Has the hon. member any definite charges to make against the Minister on account of improper conduct?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marwick">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>I can answer that very clearly. After reading that statement I was asked by the Minister &#x201C;Are you referring to me&#x2019;&#x201D; I said &#x201C;No.&#x201D; Could anything be clearer than that&#x2014;&#x201C;Are you referring to me?&#x201D; The Minister got up excitedly and demanded to know that and I said, &#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>Then the Minister said &#x201C;Hit straight, do not hit below the belt.&#x201D; I said &#x201C;The Minister knows I never hit below the belt.&#x201D; I said from the outset that this matter demanded an inquiry and I said &#x201C;Will the Minister move for an inquiry; will he face a select committee?&#x201D; If I had wished to impugn the Minister&#x2019;s conduct, I am perfectly well aware I could only have done that by a substantive motion accusing the Minister of specific dereliction of duty or dishonourable conduct. I have not done that. I have asked for a select committee and my contention throughout is that the Minister dare not face a select committee because of his mismanagement.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<question by="#marwick" to="#acting_minister_of_justice">

<num>IV.</num>

<from>Mr. MARWICK</from>

<p>asked the Acting Minister of Justice:</p>

<ol><li>(1) Whether the police at Boshof, Orange Free State, and Kimberley investigated certain charges brought against an attorney named Scholtz, formerly of Boshof, by one J. J. van Rensburg;</li>

<li>(2) whether the police proceeded against Scholtz, and, if so, where, when, and with what offence was he charged;</li>

<li>(3) whether the matter came before the then Attorney-General of the Orange Free State (Mr. de Jager), and, if so, what opinion, if any, did he express as to whether the accused had committed a criminal offence or was merely liable civilly to van Rensburg;</li>

<li>(4) whether the Minister of Justice referred the matter to a legal adviser in 1927 for report as to whether there were good grounds for him to alter or countermand the decision of the Attorney-General of the Orange Free State, and, if so, whether the Minister altered or countermanded such decision;</li>

<li>(5) whether the case was subsequently sent to the Attorney-General of the Cape Province to be dealt with, and, if so, whether the Attorney-General considered that there was a criminal charge against the accused;</li>

<li>(6) where was the case fully heard and with what result;</li>

<li>(7) in what capacity did the late Attorney-General of the Orange Free State (Mr. de Jager) attend the proceedings in Bloemfontein;</li>

<li>(8) whether he was previously instructed by the Minister to attend such proceedings;</li>

<li>(9) whether, in view of the allegations of the falsity of the accused&#x2019;s books in the course of the proceedings, the Minister will have such books impounded with a view to the accused being proceeded against for not keeping proper books; and</li>

<li>(10) whether the Minister will lay upon the Table the depositions in the preparatory examination, the proceedings at Bloemfontein, and all relative correspondence?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#acting_minister_of_justice" to="#marwick">

<from><span class="col_1055-1056" refersTo="page_0565"/>The ACTING MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<ol><li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) No.</li>

<li>(3) Yes, the Attorney-General considered the police docket and directed the public prosecutor not to prosecute as he considered that the evidence did not disclose a crime but that at most van Rensburg had a civil claim against Scholtz.</li>

<li>(4) As a result of representations made by van Rensburg to the Minister all the papers concerning the matter were submitted to one of the law advisers for consideration. After considerable further investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department, the law adviser came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case of fraud. He submitted a report to the Minister who sent it on to the Attorney-General for reconsideration of the case with a view to the prosecution of Scholtz.</li>

<li>(5) No, but the law adviser referred to above had in the meantime been appointed as Attorney-General of the Cape Province and as the investigation of the case was a very lengthy and laborious matter, he could not come to a final decision before he had assumed duty at Cape Town. His report was, therefore, presented after he had assumed duty in his new post.</li>

<li>(6) A preparatory examination of Scholtz was heard at Bloemfontein from the 26th to the 29th of November, 1928, on three counts of fraud with alternative counts of theft alleged to have been committed in 1920. At the conclusion of the preparatory examination, the magistrate of Bloemfontein discharged the accused on the ground that no criminal offence had been established.</li>

<li>(7) Law Adviser Hoal had been sent down from the head office to conduct the prosecution. I am informed that Mr. de Jager only looked into the court on one or two occasions but that he did not take any part in the proceedings. I may add that Mr. Hoal agrees that the magistrate&#x2019;s verdict was the only possible one.</li>

<li>(8) No.</li>

<li>(9) It appeared that the accused&#x2019;s books had not been well kept, but no allegation of falsity was proved. There is no power to impound the books as only in case of insolvency it is a criminal offence not to have kept proper books.</li>

<li>(10) No, but the hon. member can see all these papers in my office if he wishes to.</li>

<num>VI.</num>

<from>Mr. MARWICK</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Agriculture:</p>

<ol><li>(1) Whether Mr. M. J. Holmes, who had served for 15 years as sheep inspector in the district of Kuruman, was retired by the present Minister of Agriculture, and, if so, for what reason;</li>

<li>(2) whether a nominee of the Minister was appointed as Mr. Holmes&#x2019; successor;</li>

<li>(3) whether such nominee was a land owner or a sheep farmer;</li>

<li>(7) whether there was an extensive outbreak of scab in his ward about the time of his transfer and during the ensuing months;</li>

<li>(8) whether 84 cases of scab occurred in his ward;</li>

<li>(12) whether the Minister will lay upon the Table the report of the senior inspector on the eradication of scab in the Kuruman district?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_agriculture" to="#marwick">

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE:</from>

<ol><li>(1) Yes, on 21st January, 1925, having reached the age of 55 years, at which age sheep inspectors are normally retired from the service.</li>

<li>(2) Yes.</li>

<li>(3) He has 27 years&#x2019; experience of sheep farming, he also took the usual course in scab at the Johannesburg abattoirs, and successfully passed the examination. I do not know if he is a land owner.</li>

<li>(4) As a result of an infection found at the time of a stock sale at Vryburg, the local veterinary officer made an inspection and a serious infection was found in the area of the inspector concerned.</li>

<li>(5) As a result of this report of the veterinary officer, the magistrate of Kuruman was asked to hold an inquiry and to ascertain to what extent the inspector was responsible for the infection. The magistrate found him guilty of negligence but on account of the difficult nature of the area and the poor assistance received by the inspector from the local farmers, which the Kuruman District Farmers&#x2019; Association confirmed, the magistrate recommended that the inspector should not be dealt with in too drastic a manner but that he should be reprimanded and transferred to another area in the district; the department could not, however, agree to the latter recommendation and it was decided to transfer the inspector to the Transvaal.</li>

<li>(6) 30th April, 1928.</li>

<li>(7) The inspector went to the Transvaal on 10th March, 1928. In February two cases and during January two cases of scab were reported in his area.</li>

<li>(8) According to the returns received from the inspectors, there were 2 outbreaks of scab introduced from other areas and 39 local outbreaks in his area during the period April to end of December, 1928.</li>

<li>(9) When the infection was discovered, it was decided to carry out compulsory dipping in that area; this compulsory dipping was undertaken by the inspector of the adjoining areas under supervision of a senior sheep inspector.</li>

<li>(10) Only the subsistence and transport expenses of the inspectors who carried out the dipping, to an amount of ¬£228 15s. 6d.</li>

<li>(11) The hon. member does not say for what period the information is desired. From 1st April to 31st December, 1928, however, 14 outbreaks of scab were reported in the other portions of the Kuruman district. During this period 19 prosecutions were instituted in the district.</li>

<li>(12) I am not aware of any special report having been submitted by the senior inspector in charge of compulsory dipping, but I have sent for the relative papers from Pretoria and should the hon. member desire any further information, my office will endeavour to supply it.</li>

<from>The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<ol><li>(1) Three rooms in an existing building owned by Mrs. Keightly were hired for postal purposes. Slight alterations were carried out by the owner to make the rooms suitable for the purpose.</li>

<li>(2) From 1st April, 1911, to 31st October, 1928. The rent paid was as follows: 1st April, 1911, to 31st March, 1916, ¬£6 per month; 1st April, 1916 to 31st March, 1919, ¬£5 10s. per month; 1st April, 1919 to 31st October, 1928, ¬£6 per month.</li>

<li>(8) The building owned by Mr. J. A. du Toit has been hired since 1st November, 1928, at ¬£8 per month.</li>

<li>(9) Because Mrs. Keightly&#x2019;s demand for rent at the rate of ¬£10 per month was considered to be unreasonable and, although, after the offer of Mr. du Toit was received she reduced her demand to ¬£8, the change was effected because the post office reported that Mr. du Toit&#x2019;s premises were better suited to their requirements.</li>

<p>The hon. member has Germany on the brain. Our force is in a different position from that of a large army. It is intended to discard the present 18-pounders with which our three permanent batteries of field artillery are equipped and to replace them with the more modern type of 18-pounders, the guns now in use being passed on to the active citizen force, and the 13-pounders we still have being finally discarded. <span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0572"/>We have been watching affairs very closely, and we have been obtaining very full reports of experiments which have been made in other countries with regard to motor traction, but we do not think the time has arrived for us to mechanize our batteries, although it is becoming more and more clear that there is going to be a great difficulty in maintaining a supply of suitable horses during hostilities. It is just as well, however, to allow the richer countries to experiment. With regard to the item of ¬£42,000, &#x201C;Contribution to Aircraft Replacement Fund,&#x201D; it was thought that the position might be met by re-engining some of our old machines. The machines so re-engined were very satisfactory in some respects, but finally it was decided that it would be wise to reconsider the whole position. Our machines are of the 1916 and 1917 type, but since then a very great deal of progress has been made in military aviation, and the Government felt that as we were going to spend this vast sum to re-engine our machines, it would be wiser to spend an additional ¬£25.000 and obtain entirely new machines of the latest type. The Director of Air Services was sent to England early in December to determine which of the various service types of aeroplanes was best adapted to our purposes. The cost will come withon ¬£125,000. We have been using the Avro machine for the initial training of our flying men, but experience has shown that the much lighter Moth machine was far more economical. And so, instead of getting more of that kind, we decided to buy 20 of the Moth type. I am sure the committee will agree it is far better to take it on a broad basis.</p>

<p>The Minister has quite properly told us that he is paying attention to what other countries are doing in connection with artillery. I would suggest he should concentrate on this country too. Our animal transport is rapidly diminishing. Furthermore, there is the unfortunate fact that our young men can no longer ride, for want of the means of practice. Therefore, he is up against this&#x2014;that we are faced with the prospect of having serious difficulty in getting animal transport for artillery, and even if you had it, it would take a long time to train our young men as drivers. This is eminently a country suitable for motors and motor transport, and if the Minister will reflect, he will see that while the limit our animal-drawn artillery is about 20 miles per day, mechanized artillery will run to as high as 200 miles per day. Surely he could hardly hesitate in deciding what style of artillery to use and the means of moving it. He knows that in time of emergency we would have a number of motor-lorries in this country on which guns could be placed with their equipment, saving all the trouble of horses and harness and the training of men for their use. There will be no difficulty in getting a large reserve of trained motor drivers. The Minister must necessarily, in view of all the circumstances, decide in favour of motor transport.</p>

<p>The policy the Minister has expressed in regard to the replacement of aircraft everyone will agree with. There is one point I would like to raise. The Spartan that is on the way out has not been tested in this country, and I would like to know why a Spartan was definitely decided on before tests were carried out. It is only a small point. The Spartan has equal properties with the other two and may possibly have a better performance, but I am anxious to know why that type was decided on before actually carrying out tests at Pretoria. The other point is that I assume this Aircraft Replacement Fund is really for the replacement of obsolete craft over a period of time. I assume that in the normal operation of the craft, either in training or in flights, the department allows for a certain amount per hour for depreciation. The other day the Minister mentioned the cost was ¬£25 per flying hour. Does that amount also provide for depreciation? If so, that should be credited to the department.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to the item, &#x201C;Medical services&#x201D;, and to point out the necessity for an increase in the vote. In Europe they have one doctor to every 1,000 inhabitants, and out here at least one in 5,000 is necessary; but in the native reserves there is only one doctor to 40,000 natives. The result is that many of the natives have not the slightest chance of getting medical attendance. The infantile and maternal mortaility is appalling in the native districts, and the position is one that calls for action on the part of the Government. I am aware that a very able report has been presented by a commission which was appointed to go into this question. Is the Minister going to take any steps under that report? You have two or three native beds at the Umtata Hospital, and two or three at the Kokstad institution, and that has to serve a native population of a million. The native reserves supply the Union with labour, and with natives returning from big centres you are likely to get a most serious outbreak of some epidemic disease owing to the lack of medical supervision. You have no means of finding out the existence of a disease until the outbreak is too serious and widespread to be checked.

The agricultural implements were presented to the Native Development Fund, this being due to a change in the system carried on in the Transkei, where we have officers teaching agriculture to the natives.

<p>I should like to endorse what the hon. member has said. We are asked to vote ¬£15,000. These diggings may be run at a loss for all the information we have, and this may be waste of money. We hear rumours that they are not run at a loss, but that fabulous sums are extracted from the diggings. Surely we are entitled to be told what the result of the work is. I venture to predict that, if we are not told in this House what these results are, and what is proposed to be done with the money raised by the operations, the country will be told a month or two months from now, and the nest-egg which is being accumulated, assuming there is a nest-egg, will be used by the ministry up and down this country in order to make promises to the electorate. I submit the proper place and time for giving information as to what is being done, is here in this House on this vote. I will ask the Minister to tell us what the results have been, the number of diamonds won, how these diamonds have been sold, to whom, and in what volume. I think I am justified on this vote in raising the general question of the life on these diggings. We were told by the Prime Minister that these diggings were really a den of thieves, that crime, especially in relation to the diamonds themselves, was rampant.</p>

The first three questions were of a similar nature to the first part of this question, and I said I did not consider it in the public interest to give the information asked for at present. I was asked if the State was still engaged in the operations&#x2014;yes. I was asked the number of employees. I gave it&#x2014;122, and I may say that in consequence of the distress in Namaqualand we hope to employ within the next few weeks a considerably larger number, making about 200. I want to point out that ¬£90,000 has been voted.

The Minister has that information in his pocket or in his head, because we are told we will get it on another occasion in another manner from another Minister. This question is proper and natural to this occasion, and he says: &#x201C;Out of a sense of chivalry I do not want to deprive my colleague of the pleasure of giving the figures of what we have been doing.&#x201D; I take this point, that we are entitled to have this information and that, failing it, we should not vote this money.</p>

If we are going to give information by bits and pieces, it would have a detrimental effect on the market, which members over there are anxious to keep up. The Minister of Finance has told us that in his Budget speech he will place the picture before us, and we shall then have all the information we require.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is. I do not agree with the member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) that this agitation is owing largely to reticence or furtiveness on the part of the Government. It is due to the fact that the Government wanted to prevent a very undesirable state of affairs. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) asked what measures we are taking in regard to the prevention of I.D.B. He will see from the very material increase in the police that we have taken very material measures, but I want him to bear in mind that if you were to put 100 or 200 picked men to carry on a state alluvial diggings in connection with any other big diamond proposition, some of them are sure to succumb. De Beers, with all its organization and enormous experience, is not yet free from robbery, and other big concerns have had similar experience. We are trying to suppress it as far as we can, and during the last few months we have spent large sums of money in this regard. Of course, the position is always grossly exaggerated. I should like to points out that a large industry like the Witwatersrand gold industry to-day loses something like ¬£200,000 annually from illicit gold dealing. You can never put a stop to this sort of thing entirely. There is a strong tendency among the South African people to flock to the diamond diggings, and some of them become illicit dealers. We could not possibly allow the public to go to Alexandra Bay and take possession of it. The only sound policy is that which has been followed by the Government. The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) has asked me to explain the whole position in Namaqualand. I do not think the question is an appropriate one, because it is the same as in the case of the ordinary digger who rushes to the Minister of Mines because there is a drought, and the farmer who goes to the Minister of Agriculture because he cannot pay the interest on his bond. I have to supply the remedy, and the remedy, according to some people, is to throw Namaqualand open. But I cannot do that. As regards general poverty on the diggings, that is a matter for the Minister of Labour, and as regards droughts, that is a matter for the Minister of Agriculture, while as regards actual suffering, that is a matter for the Provincial Council. I would refer the hon. member to a statement made a few weeks ago regarding our intention. The Government has come to the conclusion that with this extraordinary wealth from the state diggings, it is only right that considerable sums of money should be spent upon well-founded irrigation schemes and other forms of permanent relief, I will, therefore, ask the hon. member to excuse me from going into details. Regarding the question by the hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay) regarding supplies for the diamond cutters, we have been doing that and have endeavoured to treat them fairly, and I do not think there have been any complaints or grievances on their part. There cannot be any objection to the prices we charge them. What we have done is to refuse to enter into a contract undertaking to supply diamonds at a certain rate for a definite period. We are dealing with the cutters as fairly as we can. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) will remember that we amended the Diamond Cutting Act in 1927, but unfortunately there has always been some unpleasantness between the cutter and the ordinary private producer, and for that reason we have started supplying the cutters with these stones.</p>

<p>The Port Elizabeth grant consists of ¬£1,000 for equipment, and ¬£1,000 for general purposes.

When this matter was discussed last year I pointed out the waste that was occurring in connection with the motor allowance given to the inspectors. I pointed out to the Minister last year that Inspectors were making net incomes ranging from ¬£1,400 to ¬£1,500 a year due largely to the excessive motor allowance. The allowance of 1s. a mile is extravagant, and apparently there is no system of vouching accounts for motor hire. The Minister is entirely at the mercy of the inspectors, and the claims are paid without being vouched for by any responsible officer. That opens the door to all sorts of abuses, and the consequence is that there has been this enormous expenditure in connection with locust extermination due largely to this extravagant motor allowance.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I can see that our friends are much disappointed, as the Minister of Finance has said that we have succeeded in so destroying locusts that the farmers&#x2019; produce is no more eaten up as happens in Kenya and other places. I told the House last year that we could expect a fairly large number of locusts to hatch. This happened, and flying swarms came away in various places. There were many eggs in different places, and a great outbreak was to be expected. The outbreak took place but I am very thankful that, with the assistance of the farmers, we have succeeded in fighting it. The expenditure would have been much higher than ¬£60,000 if it were not that one of our entomologists, Prof. Maliy found a poison in a form of powder which we can use in place of the poison with water and other mixtures which we used formerly. This obviated the transport of water, etc., which previously had cost much money, and brought the costs down considerably. A great difficulty this year was the inclemency of the weather. We had rain, and a few days after excessive heat, and the locusts hatched, only a few days later it suddenly became cold and in this way it happened in consequence of the changes of weather that locusts hatched from the same nest four times successively. While formerly we disposed of such a nest in one go, we had to deal with it four times. That greatly increased the expenditure. We experienced difficulties, but successfully overcame them. It is possible that in distant parts a swarm will still hatch out here and there. No one can say what is going to occur, but we shall get the upper hand of the strayed swarms as well. The hon. member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson) spoke about inspectors again, and asked as a fact there was <span class="col_1083-1084" refersTo="page_0579"/>proper supervision of them. What does the hon. member wish? Am I to put a person behind each inspector to see whether the inspector does actually note up the number of miles he travels in his motor, and behind that person another person and so on? It is impossible. Let me say that the people I have appointed are extremely conscientious and that we very highly appreciate the work they have done. If hon. members knew the places and sand deserts through which they sometimes have to go they would acknowledge that what we are paying for the work is not too much. As for control, I appointed a chief inspector, and I surely cannot do more. The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. C. van Heerden) wants to know where locusts have hatched out. They were in the district of Fauresmith, subsequently in large numbers in Jacobsdal, and to a less extent in Hopetown and Prieska. Still later there were also reports of locusts from De Aar, but I am glad to say that we destroyed the locusts very successfully. I have just received a communication from Fort Beaufort that large swarms are flying high over there, but it sounds almost impossible. Further enquiry is being made, and if we really have to do with a strayed swarm we shall quickly deal with it. I may say that I often get telegrams about locusts, which on investigation turn out to be flights of birds, or else some other mistake has been made. The hon. member for Swellendam (Mr. Buirski) asks whether the larger amount put down for the guano islands is intended to improve the conditions of the workers there. I just want to tell the hon. member that those men are paid at a fixed wage, and that the larger amount is required to provide for a larger number of them. It was not at first expected that the quantity of Guano would be so large, but now that it appears that the quantity is greater than expected, more workers are required.</p>

<p>I wish to call attention to the continued increases in salaries, wages and allowances. Last year there was an increase of ¬£50,900, the year before there was an addition of ¬£61,850, and now we are being asked to vote ¬£37,300, so that in two years ¬£150,000 more are to be spent on salaries, wages and allowances for one Government department alone. It has been said that the post office is a business department, but the man in the street would say that the post office tries to be a business department, but the Government prevents it carrying out its good intentions. I think the Minister of Finance is one of the persons to be blamed, for if he followed the advice given two years running by the select committee on public accounts, and curtailed the enormous quantity of work which the public departments imposed on the post office, there would be no necessity to ask for increased salaries. In 1902, Australia changed from the franking system and made the public departments pay their own postage, the result being that in one state alone the Government postage bill in two adjoining towns was reduced from ¬£19,600 to ¬£3,600. Simply by saving an enormous amount of labour in handling unnecessary mail and by a new method of handling correspondence they cut down the postal charge by 75 per cent. The Minister of Posts has shown he is prepared to examine all these matters dispassionately, and we want to know whether he is prepared to urge on the Treasury that in order to keep expenses down he should be allowed to follow the Australian system and charge departments for the use they make of the post office. Why is such an enormous amount of unnecessary postal matter sent through the post office by departments? It is causing an enormous increase in the staff. It is not only the Union Government, but also the provincial governments.</p>

<p>I am pointing out that there is a continuous increase in personnel. In two years it has caused an increase of ¬£150,000 in salaries, and in numbers there has been an increase in the last three years of 1,500, and I take it this ¬£37,000 we are now considering means a further addition to the staff, and I am showing that that can be eliminated if the Treasury will adopt the Australian method of handling postal matters. I think if the Minister will consider this matter it will lead to his making a saving.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>It is obvious that if the hon. member was out of order in addressing the House I shall be equally out of order in replying to his questions. In the course of an inspection I have made of one or two of the larger post offices, I specially examined the detailed accounts and the volume of business and its increase, and I must say that if every business in this country is increasing as the post office <span class="col_1085-1086" refersTo="page_0580"/>business is, then the country must be in a very prosperous state indeed. If the hon. member could show say five per cent, increase in volume of trade he would not object to an increase of say three-and-a-half per cent, in expenditure to earn that five per cent. That is the position so far as the post office is concerned. In regard to increase of staff, it was found in the Johannesburg Telephone Exchange that the girls in the telephone exchange were working too long hours owing to the altitude, and it was undermining their health, and the hours were reduced to 39 a week. It was later found that similar conditions of continuous work prevailed in the Cape Town Exchange, and the reduction in hours was made applicable here. That necessitated an increase in the staff of telephone operators. Another reason for it is this increase is that it was found inadvisable to employ girls after six at night. Formerly they worked up to 9 p.m. and as a general policy throughout the department, that was reduced to 6 p.m. which entailed the employment of males at a higher scale. There has also been a considerable cut in the original estimates of this department, and that cut has had to be made good in the additional estimates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members will remember that last year it was explained to the House what our plans were with regard to the settlement of the Angola farmers in South-West Africa. In previous years, we have made available to the South-West Africa Administration for land settlement purposes in South-West Africa, a sum of <span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0581"/>¬£200,000. That was to make ready for settlement a block of land, but a few farms only had been allotted, and the rest were still available for settlement. Then this plan came forward for the settlement of the Angola farmers, and it was agreed that the South-West Africa Administration should make this ¬£200,000 available and also that we would provide a further ¬£150,000. We actually voted that money to the South West Africa territories. It was subsequently pointed out that the administration there would have no direct liability for the repayment of the money. To regularize the matter, I now ask Parliament to vote this money, which will be expended in the way I have explained to the House. There will be no direct liability to the Union Government, as far as the South West Africa Administration is concerned, but the advances will be repaid by the settlers to a fund and these repayments will again be made available for settlement in that territory. The hon. member, is perhaps right when he says it will not come back to the Union again, but the money is spent on a re productive service. It is true that it is outside the Union, but the objects are of a permanent nature and in the interests of the Union. It was pointed out to us by the South West Africa Administration that we could not then be made liable for the settlement of those people, former inhabitants of the Union, who had gone to Angola. We felt we had a certain moral obligation to these people. From time to time, too, large numbers of people are going over from the Union and settling in that territory, consequently the grant, although the money is expended outside the Union, is justified. I admit there is some substance in what the hon. member submitted: that the money should be found from revenue. I may inform him that under proposals which we will lay before the House during this year a fairly large amount will be transferred from revenue to loan for capital purposes. It will make no difference, and will not prejudice our unproductive debt position at all. I agree with the hon. member that we should be careful not to expend moneys on loans which are unproductive. During the four years I have been responsible for expenditure, transfers have been made from loan account to revenue account. I think it might reasonably be argued that it is expenditure of a capital nature, although not actually expenditure in the Union.</p>

<p>I cannot give the actual number of families, but I understood from the Administrator that there would be more families than was originally thought.

<p>. The Minister has just told us that this is by no means the end. When we originally undertook to relieve these people, we thought there would be some limitation of the expense to which the Union was to be put. This matter was recently brought up in the South-West Parliament, when certain German members of that parliament objected very strongly to the policy of the Administrator, who, they stated, had gone behind their backs to this Government. Whether that is right or wrong I am not prepared to discuss at the moment. We are advancing these large sums to individuals who are residing in what is practically foreign territory. Suspicions have been aroused that we are not always going to have these mandatory powers, therefore I ask, is it in the interests of the Union to advance this money? We have no security, and I do not know how the Government is going to enforce repayment.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that the bulk of this money has been expended, not for land settlement, but for the transporting of these people, and I hope the Minister will give us some details as to how this money has actually been spent. I understand that the question was put to the Administrator, who avoided the issue by saying that they could get all the money they needed from the Union Government. I hear that there has been scandalous waste in regard to this money, and reports have reached me not only of waste and extravagance, but even peculation. I am given to understand that no less than 57 lorries were purchased for this trek, and that the road is now littered with derelict lorries. I believe this entire sum has been spent on transport alone. I am told that the whole of the transport could have been done for a matter of ¬£20.000, and that that would have left a considerable margin of profit. Instead of that it has cost ¬£150,000, and not a single family has been settled on the land. The money has gone into this disastrous experiment of motor lorries, and I hear that the Administrator is now down here for the purpose of appealing for another ¬£150,000. I do not say that is <span class="col_1089-1090" refersTo="page_0582"/>true, but I ask the Minister to inform us how this money has been spent. I think we are entitled to have a detailed account of the cost of transporting these people; how many lorries were purchased, the number of officials, and what it cost per family in transportation?I believe that not one single family has yet received a grant of land, and that up to now none of these people have been settled on the land. I understand that a still further amount of money has to be spent on transport. If these stories that are current are incorrect, I think they ought to be squashed by the Minister.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>This is the first time I have heard of a scandalous state of affairs, and of waste and peculation. I hope the hon. member will formulate his charges more specifically. I regret that I am not in a position to refute what he has said. People on the spot dealt with the matter of transport arrangements. At first it was thought that it would be possible to transport these people by wagons and donkeys, but the plan of motor transport was arranged because of local conditions. I do not think the hon. member is entitled to say that his plan would have proved more economical. My information is that some of the farms have been prepared for the reception of these people, that a number of the farms are ready, and that some of these people have actually gone on to the farms. According to my information, all the money has not been spent on transport. The rest of these people can only go to the farms as the farms are made ready for them. It is altogether unavoidable that a further amount will be required, but the hon. member has no right to imply that if his method had been adopted, the transport could have been done cheaper. Owing to the nature of the country and the large distances between waterholes, I understand it would have been impossible to have transported these people by donkey wagons. If the hon. member had given me notice that he was going to raise the question, I would have endeavoured to obtain the information for him. We are not primarily interested in the details of the expenditure. As far as the Treasury is concerned, we have dealt with the amount in a globular sum, and we expect the South West Africa Administration to account to us for the expenditure.</p>

<p>Then I can only say it is all wrong. I am merely informing the Minister that there are a great many tales and rumours in circulation to the effect that there has been most scandalous extravagance and even worse in regard to the expenditure of this money in transport. It is not enough to say that we have handed the money offer to the South-West administration, and have finished with it. I have been up there myself, and, while I do not profess to know all about it, from what I know of it, the transport of 250 families by motor-lorries is bound to prove very expensive. In the first place, the motor lorries were sent without guides. I understand they lost their way, and some were ruined. The lorries went sent over country without roads, and there has been tremendous waste. I am told that with regard to the way in which these people are put into camp, and with regard to the so-called stores, there are also things going on which should be investigated. When the Minister tells us that he is likely to be called upon for further funds, I am somewhat frightened. The entire amount spent on transport alone is said to be ¬£150,000, and, I believe the additional amount will also be spent on transport. There must be something wrong when it will cost something like ¬£250,000 to transport 250 families. The bulk of these people are still congregated in a camp, and there are all sorts of difficulties with regard to supply. I believe that one Government shop has been erected, and that there is discontent at the way they are getting supplies. They are subsisting at their own expense. They have to buy at the Government store. We are going to spend in the neighbourhood of a quarter of a million wholly on transport, and, after that, we have to put these people on the land. We are entitled to some more definite information from the Minister. What should have been done was to take these people to Mossamedes, put them on a ship and convey them to Walvis Bay and then to send them up-country by train. The thing has been badly bungled from start to finish, and the taxpayers are entitled to considerably more information.</p>

It was an unfair remark of the Minister to suggest that we are against the principle because we want financial information that this money is being expended to the best advantage. We are not hostile.

Their attitude has been one of undisguised hostility. The hon. member over there cannot point to the speech of a single member on this side which has ever done anything but welcome this scheme. I think it is a noble idea and one we should follow. But we want to know, and we are entitled to know, the details of how this money has been spent or is likely to be spent. Our votes are full of grants for various purposes, and in regard to any other purposes for which money is spent we get a full reply. In regard to this sum the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) who is an authority on that particular territory has already told the Minister what is going on. We are now told by the Minister that these moneys will not come before the Auditor-General, apart from coming before this House. Every other penny in these estimates will come before the Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee, and if there has been waste, extravagance or inefficiency that committee will investigate the matter and report upon it; but with regard to this amount we are asked to vote blindly and not knowing <span class="col_1093-1094" refersTo="page_0584"/>whether this is wise expenditure or not. I do suggest that the Minister should have had the information in his portfolio and come prepared to justify these estimates and the expenditure asked for. It is a perfectly reasonable request that this should stand over until he has given us the information. We must not take it from &#x201C;people on the spot&#x201D; that the money has been proporly expended. That is not the spirit in which Parliamentary Government is carried on. If this money has been spent in transport alone, it is a scandal which effects every hon. member, if what the hon. member (Col. Reitz) has just said is true. It is not to the advantage of the Angola boers or anyone else.</p>

<p>I have no objection to the vote standing over. The information I can get; but I must definitely repeat what I said, that this is a grant to South-West African territory to be administered not by any officials under this Government, and I am not prepared to vouch for the details. Parliament must accept or reject this grant for the broad purpose for which it is intended, and under those circumstances Parliament must be prepared to accept that the South-West African administration will be called to account in its own Parliament for any maladministration of this money. How can I take responsibility for this expenditure? The hon. member knows that the South-West African administration is not a government department controlled by this Government. We are making this out-and-out grant for a special purpose for these people in whom we have an interest. The hon. member said that no one was hostile to this. I differ from him. An hon. member said these people are not our nationals, and had to be corrected by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. te Water), who said they were our nationals. That is not the spirit which should be displayed.</p>

<p>My object in mentioning that was to show how nobly we were acting in helping people who were not actually our nationals.

<p>I am quite prepared to let the vote stand over. I have heard so much about waste, extravagance and peculation that had I known what was coming I would have made inquiries into the matter. But I was not prepared for this kind of discussion. I was only prepared to justify this grant on broad lines of policy. It has been suggested that a better method of transport might have been employed, and for this and other reasons I am prepared to allow the vote to stand over.</p>

<p>We very much appreciate the attitude of the Minister, but there is one point regarding which I shall be glad if he will go into, and that is the position of the South-West Administration in regard to this grant. The Minister has told us that Administration is responsible for the expenditure of this money, but I am told that when questions are raised there as to how this money has been spent, the reply of the Administrator is, &#x201C;It is none of your business, it is Union money, and I am not responsible for the way in which it is spent.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If a grant is made to an outside body, no Government department is called to account for any extravagance or waste in connection with the spending of the money. In the very nature of things, it is impossible in the case of an out-and-out grant to call the Government to account for any details of expenditure.</p>

<p>I think we all appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s willingness to get the information which is desired. I think the House will bear in mind that we are to be met with a request for further funds, and surely if there are allegations of the previous grant having been squandered, it is only fair that we should have a statement from the Administrator, who is here, and who is a very able and efficient man. Among the statements that have reached me is one that the purchase of cattle to be supplied to the Angola settlers was intended to be made from the farmers only in South-West Africa, instead of which the officials in the Lands Department have been purchasing monthly from speculators, and in that way squandering the money. Another point is that extravagant transport has been used. In one trip alone a lorry is said to have used up tyres to the value of ¬£120. That is a very expensive kind of transport, and it seems to me that the Minister should give us some information on the points I have mentioned. It seems that a very extravagant way has been adopted of conveying these people into the country.</p>

<p>How long is this vote to stand over? I would point out that the position of the South-West African Protectorate is very-precarious. Germany is demanding almost an immediate return of the mandate, and doing it in such forcible terms that it is difficult to resist the demand. Are the Ministers perhaps supporting that view as another gesture of friendship towards that favoured country. If they are quite satisfied that the South-West Protectorate will decline to join the Union, then the question arises as to whether we should give the money as a free grant. The protectorate may presently be in a position of very great wealth. We have had a welcome surprise in Namaqualand, and the South-West may become enormously wealthy, and this country is not so rich that it can afford to distribute its money to others outside without expecting repayment.</p>
