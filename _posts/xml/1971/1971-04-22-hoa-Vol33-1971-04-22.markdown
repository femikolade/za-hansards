<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and after Witbank, which has furnished further evidence of the decline in popularity of the Government &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; as against a steady progress being made by the Opposition &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; we have to review the position as it is at the moment. We have had two non-controversial although interesting statements from the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;on his negotiations with Zambia and on the <span class="col_4967-4968" refersTo="page_1142"/>Bureau for State Security. What we have not had are replies on some of the most important questions we have put to the hon. the Prime Minister. For instance, we have not heard from him how he proposes controlling the time-table towards independence in the case of those homelands which he has offered ultimately sovereign independence. We have heard that he talks to these people; that his Minister, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, talks to them in his office and apparently gets very angry with them outside, but we have had no indication at all what teeth, if any, there are in those talks. He has not given us any indication of what his attitude will be in cases where they do not agree, nor what his attitude will be if they press for independence as they undoubtedly will in many cases, before he thinks it ought to be accorded to them. In the light of what has happened in the rest of Africa, we should like to have some idea of what his views and ideas are in this regard.</p>

<p>Neither have we had an attempt from the hon. gentleman to grapple with the foreign policy problems, problems in the field of international relations, with which we are confronted. There has been no denial from him that pressures are building up against South Africa. In fact, far from there being an improvement in the situation, these pressures are today stronger than they were. We have had no reaction from the hon. gentleman to the fact that certain unfortunate, and sometimes unnecessary, actions ruin the good work of our friends in embassies overseas. We have had no indication from him what he is doing about that state of affairs, either at home or abroad. Nor have we had any attempt from the hon. gentleman to deal with what is perhaps the most important facet of race relations in South Africa today. I refer to the problem of our urban Bantu population. All we have had so far is a stereotyped reply from the hon. the Deputy Minister, outlining a policy which we have always regarded as being half-baked and which is bound to fail in the end. It is not working at the moment; as a matter of fact, it cannot work because of its inherent contradictions.</p>

<p>Let me remind the hon. the Prime Minister that virtually the worst disturbances we have had in the field of race relations in South Africa have originated in our urban Bantu townships in the White areas.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Under whose regime?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Under the regime of the present Government we have had the worst. I do not think that we have had anything worse than the 1949 riots in Durban, the Rand bus strike in the 1950&#x2019;s, the police murders in Cato Manor, Sharpeville, Langa, Poqo trouble in Paarl, etc. While talking about this, let me ask, what about the warnings in the Snyman Commission&#x2019;s report as to how many of these schemes were cooked up in the bachelors&#x2019; quarters? I want the hon. the Prime Minister to recall these things because of the seriousness of the situation which can develop in those areas. It is not surprising that it should be so because this is the melting pot; this is where constant adjustments have to be made; this is where mistakes and wrong policies can have serious consequences and where Government policy is being applied in its most hurtful form. The hon. gentleman has been closely associated with a lot of these things and he knows the story through the years. It is therefore not necessary for me to recount it. But virtually all our troubles in the field of race relations have started in these urban Bantu townships. These have been the breeding ground for disturbances and the areas where trouble has occurred.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister knows as well as &#x00A1;I do that the best insurance against disturbances in those areas is to ensure that the local population is on the side of law and order against the agitators. Of course, one may get dissatisfaction, people wanting to talk, people making wage demands, people making requests, but agitators do not take over when there is a large section of the local population on the side of law and order. History throughout the world has shown that the best way to retain law and order is to ensure that in those townships a class is developed which stands to lose something when law and order breaks down. These are, firstly, those people who have homes of their own, homes in which they have invested their savings, which they own themselves and consequently do not like to see depreciated in value or destroyed or damaged in any way. The second group are the sort of middle class occupants of any town or country, people who are traders and merchants or professional men who need peaceful conditions to prosper. I think the best safety valve is not purely advisory institutions where people <span class="col_4969-4970" refersTo="page_1143"/>can talk and, if necessary, make irresponsible suggestions but carry no responsibility. The best safety valve is where members of the local population, put there by themselves&#x2014;preferably elected&#x2014;have executive and administrative functions in which they carry a responsibility.</p>

<p>The last safety valve, of course, is a contented and undisturbed family life. Whenever that matter is raised, Sir, we are immediately challenged and asked if we want every Bantu to bring his wife with him. Hon. gentlemen opposite know that that is difficult if not impossible, but by the same token there are many demands today for the labour of Bantu women, both in our rural areas and in our urban areas. There is not the slightest doubt that if more of them were available, work would be available for them, and there is not the slightest doubt that if they came not on short-term contracts but on longer-period contracts&#x2014;man and wife together&#x2014;they could be fitted into the economic scene very advantageously and very profitably for both sections of the population.</p>

<p>Sir, what have we had from the hon. the Deputy Minister? We have had the statement that virtually all these things are denied to them. His argument is not that it is impossible to give them to the urban Bantu population: his argument is that it is against the fundamental ideology of their policy. That is the argument, Sir. He regards them as &#x201C;volksmense&#x201D; who belong to a tribe somewhere, even if born here, even if never likely to visit the homelands at any time unless pressurized out when they are too old or too sick to work here any more; then they have to be taught that they have to abandon loyalty to South Africa and that their first loyalty is loyalty to a Bantustan which is going to be given independence one day, somewhere, somehow. Sir, we are sacrificing our greatest guarantees of maintenance of law and order, our greatest insurances against disturbances of any kind in the event of there being unemployment, in the event of difficult situations arising, not because they are impossible to supply but because they are against the ideology, the policy, of this Government.

<p>The hon. Leader of the Opposition yesterday laid it at the door of the hon. the Prime Minister and this Government that increasing difficulties are arising abroad for us and our friends as a result of this party&#x2019;s policy, and he also said: &#x201C;We must try to reverse this growing danger of isolation&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#kingwell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Do you not agree with that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, after the hon. the Prime Minister had exposed the President of Zambia here to South Africa and to the world, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also mentioned the overtures he had made through friends to the leaders of Black Africa states. Then, if I understood him correctly, he spoke in a derogatory and disparaging tone of the attempts of the hon. the Prime Minister and then, too, the leaders and the people of the Africa states and hinted that we could not really have expected anything else from these people of Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must begin to realize&#x2014;and I think his Deputy on his right cannot but agree with me&#x2014;that there are certain attitudes to be found in respect of South Africa in the outside world. Firstly, there is an attitude of friendship and, secondly, an attitude of hostility, and thirdly, there are the neutrals, the sceptics and those who are ignorant of South Africa. Now, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must realize one thing, which is that these attitudes towards South Africa and towards the Whites of South Africa do exist, and that they are not confined to the National Party or the hon. the Prime Minister as such. These are attitudes which exist towards the Whites of South Africa, and if that side of the House imagines that, particularly in England, there may be a feeling towards them which does not exist in regard to this side of the House because they are the spiritual and lawful successors of the people who won the Anglo-Boer war, then they are wrong and have no sense. [Interjections.] The people who wanted to sell weapons to South Africa and the people who wanted to trade with South Africa, will do so whether there is a National Party Government or a United Party Government in power; the people who wanted to boycott South Africa in the field of trade and the people who do not want to provide South Africa with weapons, will also do so the day that Party, or even the day the Party of the hon. member for Houghton, comes into power.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Who told you that? It is wishful thinking.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from><span class="col_4971-4972" refersTo="page_1144"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>The second thing the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must realize is that the policy of his Party, and particularly the relationships policy of his Party, does not in any way impress either the neutrals, the friends or the enemies of South Africa. The morality of the United Party&#x2019;s race federation, with eight Bantu representatives, six Coloured representatives and two Indian representatives in this House, leaves those people not cold, but stone cold. They see through its falseness as one can see through a clear piece of glass.</p>

<p>What the friends of South Africa and the sceptics in regard to South Africa in the outside world are asking, in England and in Europe, is relationships politics which is morally justifiable on the one hand and feasible on the other. They are prepared to listen to the relationships policy of the National Party and this Government. And I believe that the more it unfolds and the more it is successfully proved, the more it will be accepted in the outside world, and I make so bold as to say that those well-disposed towards us in the outside world are hoping that it will succeed.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect as well which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must fully realize. This is the aspect of the relationships politics of the National Party which is making a very favourable impression on the world outside, namely the relationships politics in respect of Africa which has been applied so dynamically by this hon. Prime Minister in Africa and the world. The mere fact that we are moving into Africa under his leadership gives our friends in the outside world a powerful weapon, it impresses the sceptics and it sows panic among the enemies of South Africa. It is this Prime Minister&#x2019;s untiring, patient and repeated holding out of the hand of goodwill to the states of Africa which impresses them.</p>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Who wrote that for you?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>I wrote it myself; I do not need a person like the hon. member for Yeoville, who writes his leader&#x2019;s speeches, to write mine. Sir, it is his offers of help and his gestures to Africa which fit into the framework of the responsible states in the West in their planning and approach to Africa, and that is what impresses them so greatly. They want to see development, prosperity and growth in Africa, because that, they believe, will keep communism out of Africa.</p>

<p>The fact that President Kaunda last year, while he was leading the OAU mission against South Africa to the principle Western capitals was at the same time engaged in negotiations and correspondence with the Prime Minister of South Africa, will cause repercussions not only in Africa, but also in the capitals of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the relationships politics of the Prime Minister in regard to Africa, which was ratified last year by means of two-thirds majority of the people of South Africa, notwithstanding fierce opposition and vilification of the Prime Minister, is the politics of a statesman. It was confirmed again yesterday at Witbank. This is the kind of politics which is going to thwart the isolationist attempts of South Africa&#x2019;s enemies. This is the politics which is going to give South Africa status and stature in Africa and in the world. This is the politics which is going to yield golden fruit for South Africa and which is going to usher in a glittering era for South Africa in Africa.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I reply to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said, I must first fulfil a duty, as befits one leader of a party to another. I want to congratulate my hon. friend the Leader of the Opposition very sincerely on his having retained North Rand. [Interjections.] If the rules of the House had allowed, I should very much have liked to see one of the Whips rise and say to you, Sir, that the hon. member for Durban Point was waiting to be brought in. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition put certain questions to me. I want to reply to those questions immediately. Some of them I am only going to reply to in passing, because we have been debating them across the floor of this House for years now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>You have never given a reply.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, replies have been given, but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not want to accept them. He does not want to believe them. He wants to be given the replies that he wants. That is why I honestly believe it is a waste of time to debate these matters across the floor of this House again. I am <span class="col_4973-4974" refersTo="page_1145"/>saying this without any lack of respect to my hon. friend on the opposite side.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. the Leader of the Opposition touched upon the aspect of foreign policy. He said that he had not yet received any replies from me in that connection. You are, however, aware of the fact, Sr, that on the occasions when I waited for the hon. member to debate these matters with me, he did not do so. In the debate we are now conducting, he referred to them only in passing. I intended dealing with these matters in any case, and I am going to do so now. Just before I come to it, I want to say that I have been informed by the Press that President Kaunda has said that he may perhaps later today issue a Press statement on what I said. I hope he does so before the discussion on my Vote is concluded, because I should like to react to that in Parliament. In that connection I wish to rectify two matters, I see in my Hansard that I said I had stated at the Press conference that I would expose him. That is of course not the case. I said it during the no-confidence debate. I just want to rectify that aspect as far as my Hansard is concerned.</p>

<p>I should also like, in all fairness to President Kaunda, to rectify another matter. In my haste I forgot to refer to it. I want to state that at all the meetings between my envoy and President Kaunda, he received my envoy with the greatest courtesy. I want to place this on record.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me how matters stand with us in the outside world. He and I both agreed yesterday in respect of our relationships with Britain and America. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of the stirrings there have been in Africa and of the new interest in the affairs of South Africa as far as Africa is concerned. I shall say more about this later. We must now take into account that there are two kinds of opinions on South Africa, viz. an official opinion and an unofficial opinion. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is thoroughly aware of these double standards which apply in the world. Summing up, I may say that as far as the official opinion is concerned&#x2014;and I said this at the Press conference as well&#x2014;one cannot, if one wants to be honest, discern a very great difference in climate. But I want to say that in respect of the unofficial opinion &#x2014;and the unofficial opinion of today is the official opinion of the day after tomorrow&#x2014;South Africa&#x2019;s shares have risen and are still rising. Unofficially South Africa is becoming more and more highly regarded.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>By whom?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>By the thinking people in the Free World. I am surprised the hon. member has not seen it in his crystal ball yet, because it is a fact.</p>

<p>With reference to that question I can give hon. members an obvious example when I talk about the unofficial opinion in respect of South Africa. I can give it to hon. members fresh out of the oven. Where is there a greater topic of discussion at the moment than South Africa, where is more anti-South African propaganda being made at the moment, where is South Africa being slandered to a greater extent by hostile elements at the moment than in Australia? Let us see what effect this had had on the people of Australia. In passing I want to express my appreciation for the attitude of the Australian Prime Minister and others in this connection. But I am now dealing with the unofficial opinion where this extremely malicious propaganda is now operating upon the people. I have here an edition of the <i>Melbourne Herald,</i> dated 30th March. 1971. In this report the <i>Melbourne Herald</i> publishes the result of a Gallup poll held in March of this year. As far as this matter is concerned, the time could not have been more opportune. They contrast the result with a Gallup poll held in November last year, that is, if I am inferring correctly from this report, In any case, they contrast the present survey with the previous survey, and it is of particular significance to us. What do we find? The survey dealt, amongst other things, with the question whether Australia should play cricket against us or not. The <i>Melbourne Herald</i> went out of its way to state in what manner the questions were put to each person. They put it like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Each was reminded that a team of White South Africans was due to play cricket in Australia next summer.</block>

<p>There was therefore nothing obscure about the question the people had to answer. What are the results of the <i>Melbourne Herald&#x2019;s</i> Gallup poll? Last year 73 per cent of the people were in favour of the South African cricket tour. In March of this year, after all the propaganda, 85 percent <span class="col_4975-4976" refersTo="page_1146"/>were in favour of the tour. Last year 16 per cent were opposed to it, and this year only 9 per cent were opposed to it. Last year 11 per cent were undecided; this year 6 per cent were undecided. Now hon. members may say that the Australians are mad about cricket and that this is the reason for the results. In the same Gallup poll, however, a question was put in regard to the question of arms being supplied to South Africa. This is also a very delicate matter, and this question was asked in last year&#x2019;s survey as well. The results of the survey are equally significant in this regard. Last year only 20 per cent were in favour of arms being supplied to South Africa. In March of this year it increased to 35 per cent. That means that the percentage increased by 15 within a few months. Last year 39 per cent were opposed to it, and this year 34 per cent were opposed to it, a decrease of 5 per cent. Last year 41 per cent were undecided, and in March of this year only 31 per cent were undecided. It is difficult to gauge public opinion or international opinion and to determine precisely what it is. Here I now have something concrete indicating the result to me. Can hon. members now understand why I say that unofficially South Africa is gaining ground?</p>

<p>In addition, one still has one&#x2019;s contacts and people pass through one&#x2019;s office every day of the week. Many of them are prominent foreign visitors, and if I have to base my opinion on that, I have to say that, especially unofficially, a greater understanding of South Africa is developing. There is, however, one sector where there is no greater understanding of South Africa and where there is no greater sympathy for South Africa either. There the opposition has increased violently and vehemently. This is in the communist sector. There opposition to South Africa has become razor-sharp. But I have often told hon. members that this would be the case. I have said in Parliament and I foreshadowed in my New Year message that these communist onslaughts and the propaganda against South Africa would intensify to the extent to which South Africa was gaining ground. We must expect this, and we must expect it in future; it cannot be otherwise. But I am not alarmed by it, because I am convinced in my heart of hearts that, as far as South Africa is concerned, time is on our side. I do owe it to this House to say this, even though not everyone agrees with me. I really and truly believe it, because the truth will ultimately prevail. To my mind what is at stake here is not the National Party, but South Africa. Surely hon. members on the opposite side know as well as I do that if they condemn South Africa they are condemning not only us, but themselves as well. Our enemies refer to the United Party&#x2019;s policy as a &#x201C;milder form of apartheid&#x201D;. They do not see the United Party as being separate from us. The judgment passed on us, is passed on the United Party as well. To tell the truth, there are times when they do not even spot the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>In reply now to the question put by the hon. member, I want to say that unofficially I see a breath of fresh air stirring. I do not want to describe it in any other terms here today. I want to say that unofficially we are continuing to make progress. We are making progress amongst those people with whom we want to make progress. If we give in to the demands of the communist world, we will be the most popular corpse there has ever been in the world. But that we do not want to be, and that is not what we are aiming at either.</p>

<p>As far as Africa is concerned, I just want to say that there is a welcome interest in South Africa on the part of African leaders. Hon. members have read it in the Press, and it is not necessary for me to refer to it again. I just want to reiterate for the sake of the record and for the sake of those outside, not for the sake of hon. members on this side of the House, that I am prepared to hold talks with any African leader on the level, as is fitting, of one leader to another. In other words, I am prepared to hold talks with them on an equal footing, as we have done in the past and as we shall do in future as well. I am prepared to discuss any matter with them. I want to emphasize what I said at the Press conference, viz. that the one thing I shall welcome discussing with them is the policy of my Government. I am very keen to discuss my policy. I am prepared to discuss it with anyone and I should like to discuss it with African leaders in particular, because I know what a distorted version they have been given of my policy.</p>

<p>I should like to rectify and place in its proper perspective that distorted version of my policy which has been conveyed to them. I do not mind being pilloried for what I am, but I certainly do not want to be pilloried for what I am not. I shall therefore welcome discussing it with them <span class="col_4977-4978" refersTo="page_1147"/>in this way. I look forward with interest to the Press conference which it has been announced the Leader of the Ivory Coast, President Houphouet-Boigny, if I am correct, will hold next week. He is an eminent and cultivated person, well grounded in politics. I shall find it interesting to see what this West African leader has to say about these matters. These stirrings are not confined to that leader only; there are stirrings in the case of many others as well. I want to give this House the assurance that, as far as I am concerned, I will leave no stone unturned to improve these relationships and to have them run smoothly, if they are established. I think I have shown, with my visit to Malawi, with President Banda&#x2019;s visit to South Africa later this year, with my reception of the Prime Minister of Swaziland and his retinue and my reception of other Black leaders who have been here, that we are doing this in the correct manner, as it should be done.</p>

<p>I believe that all these things we have done, have already yielded and will still yield good results. You see, Sir, there is one point that my hon. friend and colleague the Minister of Foreign Affairs and I have brought home to them&#x2014;our policy of separate development, as we have been expounding it over the years, is not an export product. I have often said in this House that there are many things we want to export, but that our policy has been conceived for circumstances here in South Africa for the reasons I have mentioned in that connection and which we have often in the past debated across the floor of this House. If time allows, I may possibly discuss this again later; but there are still many other aspects I have to deal with. Consequently, when the hon. the Leader talks in his speech about &#x201C;pressures that have become stronger&#x201D;, I want to give him the assurance that that pressure originated from communist sources and not from non-communist sources.</p>

<p>I am grateful that the hon. member referred to the role which agitators could play in South Africa. I want to agree with him wholeheartedly on the matter of the damage they could do. I have since 1961, when I became Minister of Justice, been sounding warnings from time to time. Hon. members can, if they like, go back on my tracks and look up my record; my warnings have never been to no purpose or without reason. I have never cried &#x201C;Wolf, Wolf&#x201D;! simply because I felt like doing so. I want to warn again now that there are certain Whites in South Africa who are doing things that better people than they tried to do in the past, and failed. I want to warn those Whites. I want to issue this warning to a few of the present leaders of Nusas; &#x201C;Remember Adrian Leftwich and others. I have summed you up. You cannot hold a candle to him and others. Do not try to play that same game. You are going to run into very great trouble.&#x201D; But at the same time I also want to warn the parents, as I did last time. Do you know, Sir, I called a few of those parents to my office before the trouble started and said to them: &#x201C;In heaven&#x2019;s name, watch what your children are doing.&#x201D; They did not listen to me. Later, when the children were sitting in gaol, they realized what had been happening. I now want to make an appeal to parents, with all the earnestness at my command, in regard not only to subversive matters, but to all matters. I want to ask the parents: &#x201C;Do you know what your children are occupying themselves with every day?&#x201D; I spoke to one of those boys, and he told me that the reason for his being in his predicament was that his parents did not care a rap what he did and never even asked where he was. Consequently I want to make an earnest appeal to parents. We must not always try to play nursemaid to our children, but we must give our children a chance and occasion to cultivate a sense of responsibility. But every child wants to know that his parents take an interest in him and that in the last instance his parents exercise authority over him. Particularly as far as this question of subversion is concerned, there are young people who are playing with fire at the moment. It is in this connection that I want to issue a serious warning. But not only are there young people who are playing with fire; there are also older people who are playing with fire. To them I want to say that they will go the same way as their predecessors.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also raised the matter of the urban Bantu. This is a matter which has often been argued here. I want to inform the hon. member that he is not the only one who is concerned about the question of families; this side of the House is most certainly as concerned about it as he and his side are. But, Sir, we must be realistic in this connection. After all, hon. members opposite agree with me that we must have influx control, that we cannot allow an uncontrolled influx. The question of housing <span class="col_4979-4980" refersTo="page_1148"/>alone, to leave aside the other factors for the moment, precludes certain things from being done. Surely all of us understand this. Why make such a fuss about it then? What I think is at the back of the hon. member&#x2019;s mind is the question of political rights for the urbanized Bantu. That is a matter on which we differ. The standpoint of this side of the House is that the urbanized Bantu will not get political rights in this Parliament. Surely the hon. member knows that; it has been our standpoint all these years. What the hon. the Leader of the Opposition may also be interested in, is proprietary rights for the urbanized Bantu within the White area. This is also a matter that we have frequently discussed here. In principle we regard it as being wrong; hence this party adheres irrevocably to the standpoint that such proprietary rights cannot be granted. What can we achieve by discussing it further now? My hon. friend says we must grant such rights, and we say that we have considered this matter very thoroughly and that we cannot do so. I think it would be wrong, just as it would be wrong to grant the Whites proprietary rights in any respect whatsoever within the territory of the Black man. In respect of all these things we have a declared standpoint.</p>

<p>I think I have now replied to all the points raised, at least as far as is necessary for the purposes of this debate.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I shall start where the hon the Prime Minister left off. i.e. with the urban Bantu. He stated that his side had always been as interested in family life for these people as we on this side of the House were. He raised the housing problem <i>inter alia.</i> But that, with great respect, is a red herring, and the hon. gentleman knows it. His problem is that he does not want these people to feel that this is their home: he wants them to feel that their only home is in the homelands. That is an ideological approach and has nothing to do with the practical problem of housing. He suggests that I am raising this matter because I am interested in political rights for these people in the White areas. I particularly did not raise that point because I wanted to discuss this matter on the merits of the practical problems with which we are faced, without going into ideological questions. So, this was another red herring of the hon. gentleman. The hon. gentleman also spoke about home ownership and said it was wrong in principle. But according to what principle is that wrong, Mr. Chairman? Why is it wrong for a foreign worker to be able to buy his own home, live in it while he is there and sell it when he goes? Why was it not wrong for the Whites in the Transkei to have home ownership, some still have it at the present time? With great respect, Sir, the Prime Minister has not answered my points on these issues. His general attitude seems to be: We have discussed this before and consequently we are just wasting time in discussing it further. But yet this is one of the most important issues in South Africa, if not the most important one. And it is so from the point of view of the White man and not so much from the point of view of the Black man; because look what terrible mistakes we are making. We have these Bantu in the urban Bantu townships but under the policy of the Government more and more of these are becoming contract Bantu. They are being turned round too frequently for them to receive proper training and so to become really efficient workers. We suffer as a result.</p>

<p>But there is yet another point. Sooner or later they are going to be organized from outside the White areas of the Republic. If any of the Bantustans get independence, they will form their own organization of workers and will make demands in respect of the conditions under which they will be prepared to come and work here in South Africa. We already have it that the Chief Minister of the Transkei complains about the conditions of labour of his own people working inside South Africa. What is going to happen, sooner or later? Sooner or later they are going to organize their own organizations inside the homelands and lay down their own conditions under which they will be prepared to come and work here.</p>

<p>But there is yet a third thing that is happening. Because of the way in which we are running this business at the moment, because of the difficulty of getting replacements, <span class="col_4981-4982" refersTo="page_1149"/>because of all the red tape that is involved, we are finding that in nearly every industry today, particularly so in the building trade, they are trying to carry more workers than they actually need in order to enable them to fulfil contracts when these come along and not be caught in a position where they are short of labour. I think there can hardly be anything more wasteful and inefficient for our industries at the present time.</p>

<p>I have outlined many times before our approach to this matter and the hon. the Prime Minister must be aware of it. He must appreciate that we on both sides of the House have to accept, whether he likes it or not, that we are going to have Bantu workers in our urban townships working for ps permanently, as long as there is a Republic of South Africa. There is no doubt about that. Nothing the hon. the Prime Minister can do, short of closing down all the factories and removing everything into the border areas, can prevent the fact that we are going to have non-White workers permanently inside our White areas; they are going to stay there; they are going to be on our farms, in our factories, on our mines and in our homes. If we want to survive as a White group, there is something else both sides have to accept. That is that we have to treat those Bantu permanently in our White areas differently from the manner in which the Bantu in the homelands are being treated. Do you know, Sir, it is because this Government has for 20 years refused to accept this simple truth and has tried by legislation to avoid facing up to it that we have become so unpopular in the outside world, because of the sort of legislation which the Government has been putting on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>I want to remind the hon. gentleman that in my opening address I said that the time had come for a new approach to this problem. I think in approaching this problem there are certain things we have to accept as axiomatic, and when I say that I am quite confident I have the support of tens of thousands of good Nationalist supporters of the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of these issues. I think the first thing we have to accept is that the theory that separate development is going to remove discrimination is absolute poppy-cook. It is just not happening, Sir, and it will not happen became unless it can move the Bantu from our factories in our great industrial complexes or from the newly established industries on the borders of the homelands, then separate development as applied by this Government demands discrimination against these people. It is only when you face up to that fact that you can decide the sort of things that must be done and properly done.</p>

<p>Sir, I think it is also accepted by both sides that there must be consultation. We disagree as to the manner of consultation; that does not matter. What is vitally important is that there must be consultation with these people as to their needs and requirements. I think we have to make it absolutely clear to them that as far as we are concerned, we believe that there are certain things that ought to be done but a prerequisite is that it must be absolutely clear that we can ensure and will ensure equal justice before the law in South Africa. We know the high reputation of our courts. We know that that is something easy to do, but we have to get away from this belief that there is discrimination against them in our law courts and under our laws.</p>

<p>Then. Sir, we have to provide better opportunities for every person to make the most of himself. We may disagree on how to do it but let us agree that that is a principle that must be accepted. I say again that we have got to build up a property-owning middle class of Bantu as a bulwark against the agitator in our Bantu townships. We have got to give them a real stake in the maintenance of law and order in South Africa. Sir, the way in which we apply influx control and the pass laws at the present time&#x2014;we both agree that influx control and the pass laws are necessary&#x2014;is making many hundreds of thousands of criminals out of comparatively innocent people every year in South Africa. They make acquaintance with the law in that way for the first time. It seems to me that we have got to look at this system again. We had another system in the old United Party days. There were certain groups of people who were given exemption. Why can that not be re-examined, Mr. Chairman? The goodwill which that would engender could be worth infinite sums in dividends to the White people of South Africa. That is something that we can tackle together in this House. Let us look at this system again. If we go on as we are doing, we are making for trouble and bad feeling and we are making for the acquaintance of these people with the wrong side of our legal system and our system of justice in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_4983-4984" refersTo="page_1150"/>Then Sir, it is quite clear that we have got to make our labour force more mobile. I know the hon. the Minister is moving in that direction, but he is moving at a snail&#x2019;s pace in a jet age.</p>

<p>We have got to look at this matter again. We have got to make changes here or we will not get the best use from our labour force. Then we have to look at the education system again. There is a very strong case for better educational facilities, more efforts to give them free primary and secondary education so far as we can afford it, more efforts to make free books available to them, and more efforts to give them a squarer deal. Then there is this business of family life. The hon. the Minister gets up and says that what the Whites get in the Black areas, the Blacks will get in the White areas. With great respect, we all know the difficulties, but can he tell me whether there is a single Black area where a White man cannot take his wife if he gets employment there? Why talk this nonsense in this House? (Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>This afternoon the hon. the Prime Minister mentioned and referred to an official and an unofficial opinion of South Africa in overseas circles. Arising out of that I should like to refer to the case of Mr. Patrick Wall, who illustrated that statement of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s in quite a striking way.</p>

<p>Mr. Patrick Wall is quite well known in South Africa as a result of his interest in African affairs and specifically in South African affairs. He was, and I think he is still, a member of the British Parliament, but in 1962 he was also <i>inter alia</i> a member of the British delegation to the U.N. Now it is Quite interesting to see what Mr. Patrick Wall, as representative of the British Government in 1962. had to say in his official capacity about the policy of this Government. These were his words to the U.N., In an official capacity, on behalf of his Government&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apartheid was morally abominable, intellectually grotesque and spiritually indefensible.</block>

<p>These are the kind of phrases we often hear. These are what is more, phrases one sometimes hears in this country as well. These are phrases, these are statements of opinion, and these are evaluations originating from people who have usually not given any thought to South Africa&#x2019;s problems, or originating from people who represent certain bodies or groups, including political groups. Now it is very interesting to see what Mr. Patrick Wall began to write only a year later in the <i>London Times.</i> Only a year after he had said at the U.N. that &#x201C;apartheid was morally abominable, intellectually grotesque and spiritually indefensible&#x201D;, he was no longer a representative at the U.N. Now he is acting in his private capacity&#x2014;he has given some thought to the problem, and now he has to give a different account in a different manner. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Expediency has governed principles in Africa and as a result not only a small number of Europeans, but a large number of Africans, are now facing a decline in their standards of freedom, security and economy as independent states become politically authoritarian and adopt socialist economies.</block>

<p>Shortly afterwards, in 1964, he writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Four years ago people were thinking of multiracialism as an equal sharing between Black and White, the former contributing the numbers and the latter the know-how.</block>

<p>This is quite close to the policy of the Opposition party. According to this writer people held this opinion in 1960. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the wind of change became a hurricane, it became clear that there was to be no sharing and that as soon as the Africans had a majority of one in the local Parliament, they would demand complete domination, which they could obtain within two years. People say that the Arabs can never push one million Jews into the sea, but the same people seem to assume that 4 million Whites in Southern Africa can be forced into the ocean. Many families have been there since the 16th century. Only with their help can the vast economic potential of the confident be developed.</block>

<p>This is what a man wrote, two years after he had characterized this Government&#x2019;s policy as something which was &#x201C;morally abominable, intellectually grotesque and spiritually indefensible&#x201D;. Subsequently he <span class="col_4985-4986" refersTo="page_1151"/>was, as it were, zealously defining and defending our problems. I think this illustrates in a striking way the statement made by our Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Now I want, with all due respect to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, to make another point. There are a few matters which I find extremely vexing. The United Party accuses us of beating the drum of Black peril. Can they tell me why they are afraid when it comes to the independence of the Bantu peoples? They say that we are afraid of the Black people, but what are they afraid of then? Is it not because of fear that they cannot perform that act of faith? That is my first question.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is some moralizing, and great concern is being expressed about the political rights of the Bantu in our urban areas. The Opposition maintains that these people should be afforded greater stability and that the growth of a good middle-class group of citizens among the Bantu should be accelerated. We are concerned about matters of this nature. There are certain ideals which all of us would like to see realized in this life, but we are working with realities. We are working with historical realities. I take it the United Party will also want to give those people limited political rights, but how can one ultimately say that it is morally correct to do this and then deprive that particular group of people of a political destination? How can one ultimately deprive the millions of people who are being discussed now, of that principle as well. On what moral grounds whatsoever can one refuse this? On the one hand they say that it is for moral reasons that they want to give those people these rights in the urban areas, but where is that morality when it comes to the fundamental political rights, the political and constitutional rights, in terms of which the Bantu. But ultimately work out their own destination? How is the United Party policy going to fit into the South African context? Why do they not reply to the question I put to them yesterday? Why do they not tell us what the effect of their eight representatives here is going to be? How are they going to arrange an election on that basis? There are more than eight ethnic groups among the Bantu. Are the Zulus going to receive 1&#x00BD; representatives, and the Xhosas 1&#x00BE; Why are they keeping up this charade? Why do they not admit that they are standing on a small island surrounded by precipices? On that small island they want to open up the sluice gates, so that we will for a little while still be able to live well economically, and then all relationships between all ethnic groups will collapse. They know it. I cannot imagine that any person who knows that twice two is four can still think that one can in these times keep on harping on that theme. I cannot understand it. I can understand our debating other matters, but I cannot understand how they can still in regard to these basic principles adopt that standpoint. I want to make an appeal to them this afternoon. They say that we should adopt a new approach, but can they not realise that their approach is being rejected by the march of events, both at home and abroad, and that it is our approach which still keeps the wheels turning, even though it creates certain problems. Why do they not try to make a positive contribution in that respect? That is the invitation we are holding out to them.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are very pleased that the hon. gentleman ultimately returned to the issue which is under discussion, because he went overseas to find Mr. Patrick Wall and all sorts of other people to support his point of view. We happen to know Mr. Patrick Wall very well. We have invited him out here frequently in the past. If Mr. Patrick Wall has changed his views on South Africa, I think that this particular side of the House should receive thanks for that.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman now read us a little lecture on the ultimate disposition of all these Black nations and said that we have no plan for them. But may I ask him then what is his plan for the Coloured people and for the Indians? Where are they going to have this ultimate disposition? The whole thing falls completely flat. It has no base to stand on at all.</p>

<p>I should like to return to an issue which the hon. the Prime Minister raised. It really surprised me when the hon. the Prime Minister said that his side of the House has consistently, throughout the years, told not only the people of South Africa, but the whole of the outside world exactly what the policy of his party was. The hon. the Prime Minister is beginning to lose contact with the situation, because this policy of the Government side has gone through a very marked change. Do we not all remember that when Dr. Malan stood here, he told us that the policy of that side of the House was apartheid? Today apartheid <span class="col_4987-4988" refersTo="page_1152"/>has become a swear word; it is never used by that side of the House any more. It certainly was used as a stage to introduce a series of legal enactments which have with almost Teutonic thoroughness been grafted on to our society, so that today the Black man is subjected to more than 80 major laws and dozens of regulations which regulate practically every aspect of his life. Only the other day the Government issued the Venda Staff Regulations running into 28C pages. It is an immense piece of work. All that we are left with are all these laws.</p>

<p>But when Mr. Strydom was Prime Minister of South Africa, he said the policy of his side of the House is &#x201C;Blanke baasskap&#x201D;. That, at least, had the merits of political honesty. But what surprises us today, is that the ardent followers of that gentleman who sat there and supported him so consistently throughout these years, should now have swung around to the extent that they deny the very policy that they shaped. What is worse, is that they should take the worst features of that policy and try and assign it to this side of the House. I want to get to this consistency of the policy that the hon. the Prime Minister refers to. In the early days of Dr. Verwoerd, his approach was quite clear on this issue. I drew attention to this before. When he spoke in the Senate in 1951, he discarded this whole idea of independent Black states in South Africa. He said it was completely impossible. In volume 2, column 2893 of the Senate Hansard he said:</p>

<p>How could small scattered states arise? The areas will be economically and otherwise dependent on the Union. It stands to reason that when we say that the Protectorates should be incorporated in South Africa and at the same time talk about the Natives&#x2019; rights of self-government in those areas, we cannot mean that we intend by that to cut large slices out of South Africa and turn them into independent states.</p>

<p>If words have any meaning, what does that mean? Dr. Verwoerd was diametrically opposed to this policy. He said that one only had to look at the map of South Africa to see that it is impracticable. Then, all of a sudden, he came under foreign pressures and overnight we had this major change. What had been apartheid before, then became separate freedoms.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>It is the same policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Well, that is precisely our problem. Now we hear less and less of separate freedoms, because there is less and less separation and a greater section of the South African community has less freedom. Now that separate freedoms are beginning to run into trouble, the hon. the Prime Minister is trying to introduce a new dimension into this problem. He now says that it is no longer a multi-racial problem that we face, but South Africa must become multi-national. What do these words mean? If I have an African who is my garden boy, who lives in the backyard and who works in my garden, I understand that it is multi-racial. He is subject to all the laws, the rules and the regulations which exist at the present time. Now, if he becomes multi-national, if he becomes a foreign citizen, how does that change his position? This does not make sense to us; this is just a new way of perpetuating the same myth. We must he guided on this issue by the spokesman on these matters, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I want to ask this Committee what we can derive from this sort of statement by the hon. the Minister. Recently he said over the radio that the policy of his Government was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Preparing for the indispensable interdependence among the nations of South Africa which will ultimately be involved in independent coexistence.</block>

<p>Well, this is a kind of political mumbo-jumbo which does not mean a thing. Then the hon. the Prime Minister is surprised that the people overseas are confuted and do not know what the policy of this Government is.</p>

<p>To begin with, there has been an absolute somersault, and secondly, when you are given this kind of directive, nobody knows what it means. The problem which we face is that the Government is trying to reconcile two conflicting elements. In the first instance there is the desire for separation, which is real, but which is also artificially inflated by that side of the House. Secondly, we have economic interdependence, and this seems to have a built-in momentum so that the more we progress, the more intdependent we become. At the present time you could not operate profitably more than six gold-mines in South <span class="col_4989-4990" refersTo="page_1153"/>Africa without the non-White labour which we have. Although you can move factories to the homelands, you cannot move a goldmine to the homelands. All the time we are progressing economically, we are becoming more and more interdependent.</p>

<p>This whole issue was put before us by two commissions, the Fagan Commission and the Tomlinson Commission. We can look today at what the Fagan Commission said more than 20 years ago with almost prophetic insight. In their report they dismissed the policy of total separation and they also said that disregarding colour differences had no future in South Africa. They ended up by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Only a third policy remains, a policy which requires that European and Native communities, scattered throughout the country, as they are today, will permanently continue to exist side by side, economically intertwined, permanent parts of a big machine &#x2026;</block>

<p>Nothing has happened over the past 20 years to change that situation by one bit. The Government had their opportunity. They appointed the Tomlinson Commission and then they killed that commission themselves by refusing to accept its fundamental recommendations. The result is that today we are still going through the motions. It is like a chicken which has had its neck wrung, but is still flapping about, but will never run any more. That scheme never even got under way because the Government lacked the courage to make the fundamental sacrifices that were necessary for its fulfilment.</p>

<p>What does this Government offer to the detribalized, non-homeland Africans who live and who work in our cities? They are told that they will have the inalienable right to self-determination in their own areas. However, this is used as justification for subjecting them to the most blatant form of discrimination in the areas in which they live and work. Their fundamental right to occupational advancement in the areas where jobs exist is circumscribed, but they are told that the &#x201C;sky is the limit&#x201D; in areas where no jobs exist. They are told that they cannot have their fundamental right to have some form of political participation in the areas in which they live. But in turn they are granted illusionary rights in areas where they do not live. How could anybody in his right senses stand up and say that this is a solution to the race problem in South Africa and that it will lead to peaceful coexistence? Then it is even held out that it is a formula for not only ourselves, but it is a magic formula for the whole of the outside world; the mind boggles at the temerity of it all.![Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to start off by telling the hon. the Prime Minister that I take the strongest exception to the insinuations that he made about me last night. He has told us that he is a frank man. He boasted to us that, if anything, he is a frank man. I would very much like to ask the hon. the Prime Minister in future, or perhaps even at the present time, if he intends to make any accusations against me of any kind, to make them in the form I can understand, which other hon. members in this House can understand and to which I will then be able to reply. The hon. the Prime Minister is still used to his role of a sort of super policeman, the man who locked people up without trial, never having to tell them what they did wrong. To some measure he carries this over in his attitude in this House and as I say I take the strongest exception. I want to know exactly what he is accusing me of so that I will then be able to reply and either to admit guilt or to prove my innocence. I think I am at least entitled to that. Of course I listened with the greatest of interest to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s account of the difficulties he has been having in trying to arrange a meeting with President Kaunda. By the way, when he told us all this, he did not mention that President Kaunda, I think it was in 1964, offered to exchange diplomats officially with South Africa. I think I am right when I say that that offer was never accepted, [Interjections] That is not important. The principle of it is important. I am sorry that the hon.&#x00B7; the Prime Minister had all these difficulties. I must say that my own experience, was very different. I did not have the slightest difficulty in arranging a meeting with President Kaunda. It was a very simple matter for a mutual friend to suggest that it would be a very good idea if I met President Kaunda. I also thought it would be a good idea and the matter was fixed very easily indeed.</p>

<p>That hon. Minister must not start making accusations he cannot substantiate. I am quite prepared to say that the fact that the party that I represent is a party which is prepared to reject race discrimination entirely as the basis for policies in this country, may very well have had something to do with the fact that I was indeed able to see President Kaunda so easily. I might say that I too, like the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s envoy, got a very cordial reception, and that it was a very interesting experience meeting President Kaunda. He is a man of great personal charm &#x2026; [Interjections.] Indeed, I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that for personal charm President Kaunda can give cards and spades to most of the members of this House. I want to say this quite clearly. He is also intelligent and outgoing. I also want to say at once that we certainly did not agree about everything. There were many basic subjects on which we disagreed, but the reason, I say, why I was able to see him and why I did get such a good reception was simply because I represent a party which rejects race discrimination as the basis of policy. This is also my personal view and he knew this.</p>

<p>The other day I read in <i>Die Burger</i> that the President of Senegal is also prepared to have dialogue with people who reject race discrimination and he mentioned the Opposition Liberal Party. He meant us of course. I thought the hon. the Prime Minister rather contemptuously dismissed the whole issue of the so-called Lusaka Manifesto, as he called it. when he discussed the whole Kaunda episode. I do not think it is a very clever thing to do, if the hon. the Prime Minister is sincere, as I believe him to be, in his desire to have dialogue with African leaders in other states. By the way, he has now said that he is prepared to discuss apartheid. Up till very recently he has said that he will have dialogue provided that apartheid is not discussed.</p>

<p>It is not nonsense. The interesting thing is that what the hon. the Prime Minister thinks of as discussion may be rather different from what the African leaders are thinking of as discussion. They are thinking of discussing apartheid in such a way that it might be possible to persuade the hon. the Prime Minister that relations with the other African states would be better if at least some deviations were made from apartheid, if at least the direction were changed. The hon. the Prime Minister is thinking of dialogue, of course, in terms of Mr. M. C. Botha&#x2019;s discussion and dialogue. He is going to tell them where they are wrong about apartheid.</p>

But he sees it in terms of the Lusaka Manifesto. The hon. the Prime Minister should not dismiss this manifesto, because it is very important to the African States. I do not believe that very many members in this House even know what the Lusaka Manifesto contains. I wonder how many of them even know when it was issued. I will tell them, because I do not believe they do know. It was issued in April of 1969, as a result of a so-called summit conference which was held in Lusaka and attended by East and Central African states, 14 different countries in all. They adopted this manifesto which, if it is carefully read, certainly contains many condemnatory things about apartheid, South Africa and minority White governments. But I believe also that, if properly read, it contains a ray of hope that some sort of compromise can be reached, particularly as regards the pace of change in the countries which the countries that signed the Lusaka Manifesto felt were discriminating against Black citizens.</p>

<p>U.D.I. was more than five years ago. The conference took place in 1969, for the edification of the hon. the Minister of Sport. They had lots to say, too, about Portuguese control of Mozambique and Angola, obviously. But when they came to the Southern African situation generally, having made it clear that they reject race discrimination as a basis of policy, they made, I believe, an important statement to the effect that they recognize that there are going to be difficulties in the transitional stage where changes are introduced. They are quite prepared to leave the arrangements and the pace of change to the countries concerned. I think that is very important. They also say that no claim is made that Africa belongs only to Black Africans. They do not want to change simply from the present system of White domination to another system of racial domination. They are prepared to discuss terms. Therefore I think it is absolutely essential, if the hon. the Prime Minister wants to have any meaningful dialogue at all with the other African states, as he says he does, that he should direct his attentions to the Lusaka Manifesto.</p>

<p>She knows exactly; it is to be found in Hansard. She argued that President Kaunda in 1964 offered to exchange diplomats with South Africa. But may I remind her that countries do not exchange diplomats from platforms; that is not the way in which it is done. If the hon. member would care to go back and find out what actually happened she would find that that is exactly what President Kaunda did, i.e. he said in public that he was prepared to exchange diplomats with South Africa provided this, that and the other&#x2014;a whole string of things&#x2014; were taken into account. But he never approached us officially; it remained a platform speech only. That is not the way in which to exchange diplomats; for that matter, it is not even good manners.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member&#x2019;s visit to Zambia is concerned, I am sorry to have to disillusion her. I met a journalist who was in Zambia after she had been there. Although I cannot vouch for the truth of it, he told me candidly when I asked him what impression the hon. member made in Zambia, that they laughed at her behind her back. But as I say, I cannot vouch for the truth of it. The hon. member may want to find out whether that is in fact so or not.</p>

<p>*In his first speech on my Vote the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also referred, along with the many other aspects he raised, to the question of sport. I think this is the obvious time for us to devote a few moments to this topic and conduct a fruitful discussion on it.</p>

<p><span class="col_4995-4996" refersTo="page_1156"/>Over the week-end the hon. the Leader of the Opposition held a meeting, subsequent to which he issued a statement on his views on this matter. He was kind enough to let me have, at my request, a copy of that statement so that it would not be necessary for me to rely on newspaper reports. Consequently, before dealing with my own standpoint, I just want to make a few references to the standpoint adopted by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want to read out this statement of his in its entirety, because it is fortunately a short one. The statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on 17th April reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Speaking at the Western Province Cricket Club Annual Awards Dinner at Newlands over the week-end, Sir De Villiers Graaff outlined the United Party&#x2019;s policy on sport and announced certain important additions which, he said, had the full support of his caucus. The statement was enthusiastically received. It is as follows:</block>

<block name="quote">(1) Maintain traditional participation in international sport.</block>

<p>&#x2020;There, of course, I am at one with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In this connection I refer to the statement I made in 1967. I continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(2) Allow all race groups to watch all organized sport, provided adequate facilities are available for Whites and non-Whites.</block>

<p>That, of course, is the traditional standpoint of both sides of the House.</p>

<p>The hon.</p>

<p>member knows what the position was there and how that came about. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(3) Entrust the control and administration of sport in the Republic to the recognized sporting bodies.</block>

<p>Nobody has other views as far as I know&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(4) Accept the principle of non-interference in the realm of international sport and leave the issuing of invitations and the selection of teams to the controlling bodies concerned.</block>

<p>I dealt with that, Sir, in my statement in 1967 and I will again deal with it today&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(5) Recognizing, in the case of both national and international professional sport, acceptable statutory boards of control representative of the sports concerned.</block>

<p>I take that to mean the Boxing Control Board and the Wrestling Control Board, which are old, established boards&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(6) The United Party will not tolerate political interference in sport which may harm our international relations or cause internal unrest.</block>

<p>That, of course, is also to be found in my statement of 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(7) The statement outlined above was made against the background of customs, conventions and existing legislation in force in South Africa. Sport at an international level, however, has ceased to be a mere social activity and has become not only a reflection of foreign policy, but also a matter of national prestige. Accordingly the United Party, if so requested by the national controlling bodies of the various sports, would be prepared to consider a relaxation of any hindering legislative enactments in the same way as the Government has relaxed them in the diplomatic sphere.</block>

<p>I will be pleased if the hon. member will clarify one point for me in the latter part of his statement. In this part of his statement the hon. member says that the United Party will consider making these relaxations, but then the statement goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In respect of the representatives of the Bantu homelands, etc., for example, this would mean that if so requested by the national sporting bodies concerned, we would be prepared to accept South Africa being represented overseas at a national level by mixed teams and would be prepared for mixed trials to select those teams in South Africa. We would also be prepared to accept mixed teams from overseas and would be prepared to see South Africa represented by mixed teams at national level in South Africa.</block>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will do me a favour if, when he speaks later <span class="col_4997-4998" refersTo="page_1157"/>on, he will clarify this one point for me, and tell me whether he and the United Party have already decided that they want this mixed sport or whether they will still consider it if and when they are asked to do so. This a perfectly fair question. [Interjections.] I am not making a point of it; I am just asking for clarity. In the same paragraph he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If so requested by the national controlling bodies of the various sports we would be prepared to consider &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then the hon. member goes on to say he will do this, that and the other thing. I want to know whether what he says at the end of the statement is qualified by the words &#x201C;would be prepared to consider&#x201D; or not. That is all I am asking.</p>

<p>*That is the standpoint of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In the course of my press conference I indicated that I would discuss sports matters in the course of this debate, and, more specifically, that I would on this occasion discuss non-White participation in sport. Now, I want to agree with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that sport is important. I also want to put it to the House as my view that one cannot underestimate the importance of sport. Everyone of us would be making a mistake if we underestimated in any way the national as well as the international importance of sport. Although it is primarily recreation, recreation for the individual or recreation for a group of individuals in a team, it has in our time become more than that. Accordingly one would be making a mistake if one underestimated its importance. But, on the other hand, I also want to state my view that one would abo be making a mistake if one over-estimated its importance. There are certain interests which are more important and are to be prized more highly than sporting interests, namely the interests of a country and of its people. One must make no mistake about that, and in spite of the fact that I myself am a sportsman and like participating in sport, that I have an intense interest in all branches of sport and will go out of my way not only to attend sports meetings, but also to encourage sport. I think we would be making a mistake if we were to put the interests of sport before the interests of South Africa as a whole. I want to make it very clear that I on my part&#x2014;irrespective of what the standpoint of other people is&#x2014;shall not be prepared to put the interests of sport before those of South Africa as I see them, and by virtue of my position I am responsible for them for the moment.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now mentioned it, and I want to associate myself with it. When one states a sports policy, it depends on whether one adopts the attitude that South Africa is a multi-racial country, or whether one adopts the attitude that South Africa is a multinational (<i>veelvolkige</i>) country. I, on my part, adopt the attitude of multi-nationality, and I want to make it clear that I do not stand alone in this regard, but that our forebears, our predecessors in the sphere of sport, adopted this same attitude, although they did not formulate it in this way.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter to me. I do not know whether there is a difference between the two, but I am content to speak of &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D; as the English translation for &#x201C;veelvolkige&#x201D;. That is the way I use it. If there is a better word, I should be glad to receive it from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I believe that I do not stand alone in my views in that regard. I believe that my predecessors and those of all of us viewed it in that light, for this is the way it has been traditionally. Nobody can deny that. Before there was any law or regulation whatsoever against it, in so far as there are regulations and laws against it, every population group practised its sport separately in South Africa. That is how we have developed. That is how it has been over the years. Nobody can contradict me in respect of that cardinal fact. That was the case because they adopted that attitude, and for no other reason whatsoever. If there were other reasons, I should very much like to hear them. For that reason I want to adopt that attitude and apply it to the situation as it exists at the moment. One should like to apply it on the basis <span class="col_4999-5000" refersTo="page_1158"/>of certain branches of sport. Each branch of sport has, in turn, developed along different lines. One cannot, without making alterations, superimpose the set of rules of one branch of sport on another. Each branch of sport has developed in a different manner. From the nature of the case I cannot, in the space of time at my disposal, cover all branches of sport. I can only indicate certain guidelines on the basis of some of those branches of sport.</p>

<p>Let us take rugby and cricket as they have developed here in South Africa, not only a national level domestically, but also with respect to the relations established abroad. The Whites organized themselves into the Cricket Board and the Rugby Board. They established relations, not with the whole world, but with certain countries, such as Britain, Australia, New Zealand and, in the case of rugby, France as well. This was the relationship established by a White body, as it was organized and as it had developed constitutionally, with Britain, New Zealand, Australia and France. That body did not represent the whole of South Africa. The rest of the people of South Africa, i.e. the Coloured people, had been organized into another body. This is something that must be understood very clearly. The two bodies have nothing to do with each other. In other words, the body which established the sports relations was the one which consisted of the Whites as they had organized it. As far as cricket is concerned, it is interesting that notwithstanding the fact that the West Indies, Pakistan and India have been playing cricket for many years and that there was nothing whatsoever in South Africa to prevent the cricketplaying people of South Africa from establishing relations with them, they never did so. There was nothing to prohibit it, but they simply never did so. This is a historical fact which one must take into account.</p>

<p>In the course of my press conference I said I believed the time had arrived for the non-Whites to be afforded the opportunity of participating in international sport: they had to be afforded the opportunity of not only participating in international sport, but also improving the standard of their sport in South Africa, for if one wishes to practise sport it is in the nature of things a case of the better one does it. the better it is. This is not something I have merely been saying as from today; I have been saying it for a long time. There may be people who will differ with me on this matter. They have every right to differ, but I believe the matter has to be improved within the national context of each of those groups. I have thought this matter over and discussed it with sportsmen representing various branches of sport.</p>

<p>The Rugby Board felt that the time had arrived that they, when inviting a rugby team to tour South Africa, such as the British who are coming here next year, suggested to the British Rudby Board that, if it met with their approval&#x2014;it depends exclusively on them&#x2014;provision could be made in the tour programme for a match against the Coloured rugby-playing public here in South Africa. As hon. members know, there is a tour contract in which all these points are stipulated, and they were also prepared to offer to the Rugby Board of Britain to make provision in the tour programme for a match against the Black rugby-playing people of South Africa. Of course, the Coloureds and the Black people have been organized into different associations. They asked me what stand I would take on the matter. I said that I could see no objection to it, and such an invitation has in fact been extended. I understand the match against the Coloureds will be played in Athlone. in the Coloured area. The spectators there, owing to the accommodation problem, will exclusively be Coloureds. The only Whites who will be present there, will be the Rugby Board officials needed in connection with this match. In respect of the Bantu, that match will be played eithed in Umlazi or in Soweto, and the same rule will apply in that regard.</p>

<p>The principle stated here in respect of rugby, will also apply in respect of a cricket team which comes to South Africa, and also in respect of other teams which visit our country. This is another facet which I discussed with the cricket administrators.</p>

<p>No, I did not ask for their views on the matter. I say that I conveyed my standpoint to them.</p>

<p><span class="col_5001-5002" refersTo="page_1159"/>I have said that the various branches of sport have developed along different lines. In dealing with the tennis aspect now, I must take cognizance of the fact that a certain development has taken place in respect of tennis, i.e. that certain international tournaments are being played all over the world. I understand that, in the main, there are three such tournaments. These tournaments are international in the fullest sense of the word, and certain privileges, etc., flow from participation in these tournaments. Hon. members may have seen in the Press that many people are of the opinion that an international sports centre should be established in South Africa. [Interjections.] This is no laughing matter. I should very gladly support such an idea. I think it would be an excellent idea if we could establish something of that nature. I hope that such a centre of a truly high standard will eventually be established in South Africa. There are indisputable examples of the benefits this may hold for a country. But it goes without saying that it will take time and money before such a centre can be established. In that case we have here what A. G. Visser wrote in one of his lyrics, namely &#x201C;If you do not have what you love, then love what you have&#x201D;.</p>

<p>One must examine the situation in a practical and realistic manner. In respect of tennis South Africa has won for itself a reputation in the world, a reputation of which one can be proud. The presentation of tennis here in our country and the trouble being taken by the tennis people are admired, but it is assuming more and more of a definite international flavour. I am told that the Ellis Park stadium can seat approximately 8 000 people at a time. It is therefore well-equipped as far as seating accommodation is concerned. I have discussed this facet with the leaders of the tennis people. If a tournament known as the International Tennis Tournament were arranged in South Africa. I would have no objection to its being held at Ellis Park and to every seeded player, irrespective of his race or his colour&#x2014;for they are seeded according to a certain system&#x2014;participating in that tournament. I want to make it very clear, in order to obviate any misunderstanding in this regard, that this would mean that if the champion of the Coloured tennis players, who at one stage was David Samaai of Paarl, were seeded for participation in that tournament, it would be possible for him to participate in it. The same applies in respect of other Coloured people from South Africa itself.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to athletics. We stated our standpoint previously &#x2026;</p>

<p>Would the hon. member kindly show me the courtesy of affording me an opportunity to speak? As I have said, I shall now proceed to athletics. Our participation in the Olympic Games stems from athletics. I stated my standpoint on this matter in the past. Just as is the case in tennis, a change has taken place in the sphere of athletics in the course of time. I take note of it. Just as one can organize an international tournament in South Africa in the sphere of tennis, so one can organize an international athletics tournament in South Africa. Participation in it will be subject to the same conditions as apply in the case of tennis. It is obvious that in the sphere of athletics South Africa is one of the leading countries in the world at the moment. I have great admiration for the way in which South Africa&#x2019;s athletes are acquitting themselves. I should like to create that international possibility for them to take part in athletics.</p>

<p>As far as I know, we no longer have any amateur soccer of any significance in South Africa. In that respect, as far as I know, quite different rules apply in respect of the Olympiad. Before the hon. member puts the rest of the question to me, I want to make certain things very clear. I accept the international consequences, but I want to make <span class="col_5003-5004" refersTo="page_1160"/>the standpoint adopted by this side of the House very clear. At club level, at provincial level and at national level the position remains as it has always been. In that regard no change is being introduced at all. I take full responsibility for the fact that as far as rugby and cricket are concerned, no South African non-Whites have been included in these teams. In this regard I just want to say that I am very sorry indeed that that decision was ever taken in respect of cricket. I want to accept that it was taken with the best intentions in the world. However, I feel that it has given rise to disadvantages which should have been foreseen. Accordingly, I differ very clearly with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition if that is what he decided, which is still not clear to me. With the exception of athletics, owing to the specific branch of sport with which we are dealing, namely the Olympic Games, which is an inter-state affair, I differ with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition where he says that he is in favour of mixed teams representing South Africa. I differ very strongly with him in this regard.</p>

Furthermore, I want to say a few words about touring teams visiting our country, because I consider it necessary for me to do so. I stated the position very clearly in 1967, and I want to do so again. When any sporting body in South Africa has extended an invitation&#x2014;for invitations are extended by sporting bodies, and the Government has never interfered with such invitations &#x2014;to a country with which we have traditional sports relations, the selection committee of that country selects its team. If that team is selected on merit, we, as far as this side of the House is concerned, do not ask to see the birth certificates of the people selected by the relevant selection committee of that country. [Interjections.] We have never done so, and the hon. member opposite who is being so cynical now, should note that what we have in fact done, is what has now been echoed by his Leader in these words: &#x201C;The United Party will not tolerate political interference in sport which may harm our international relations or cause international unrest.&#x201D;</p>

What is more, what I am doing here in all seriousness, is to make it possible for South Africa and its young people to participate in sport. I am not trying to steal a march on the Opposition. I am not playing them off against this one or that one. What I am doing is to state, as a responsible person, my standpoint on sport, and they are free to state theirs; that is no concern of mine. But I do not know what the hon. member is going to achieve if he wants to cloud the issue immediately and make political propaganda out of it.</p>

<p>I hope and trust that the guide-lines I have indicated will benefit sport in general <span class="col_5005-5006" refersTo="page_1161"/>as well as those taking part in sport in South Africa.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not try to enter into a discussion on sport with the hon. the Prime Minister. I think it is a matter for him and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. But I have risen with the permission of the hon. the Leader to draw the attention of the House to the tactics followed by the hon. the Prime Minister. Up to now the Prime Minister has taken up more than half of the time allotted for discussion on this Vote. We have no objection to that. It is his right and his privilege. But the Prime Minister has been following very transparent tactics throughout, i.e. those of avoiding the real points for discussion raised by the Opposition, of running away and fleeing from the matters of real importance to South Africa, matters on which the future of South Africa depends. He refuses to discuss those matters. In this debate he has deliberately been seeking points and discussing topics on which he knows the Opposition cannot, except in the case of sport, enter into a real debate. He started with an announcement on State security and the report of the Potgieter Commission. [Interjections.] Yes, Sir, that is quite correct.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The report of Mr. Justice Potgieter was not available to the Opposition, although the Prime Minister had had it in his possession for months. In those circumstances we were expected to discuss this matter fully. That is the first point.</p>

<p>The second one is that yesterday the Prime Minister once again tried to steer the debate along an unrealistic course, i.e. by furnishing us with a lengthy account of his negotiations and correspondence with the President of Zambia, knowing very well that we as a responsible Opposition would not attack him on it and would only do what my Leader did at the time, namely to wish him better success for the future. We on this side of the House were desirous of discussing a matter which is of paramount importance to South Africa. But the hon. the Prime Minister refuses to discuss it and has been trying to divert our attention from the realities in South Africa by coming forward with a statement on sport, something which he could have made at any time after that important matter had been dealt with. We have to ask him pointedly, &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; Consider the matters which the Government refuses to discuss. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that hon. members are making it difficult for you to maintain order, but we would not have had this reaction if I had been speaking to innocent people.</p>

<p>The matter which we want to discuss with the Prime Minister, is a matter on which the future of South Africa depends. It is concerned with race relations in South Africa, especially relations with the Bantu peoples in South Africa. We are trying to discuss with the Prime Minister the philosophy, the standpoint behind the policy. But the Prime Minister is either not able to do that, or, if he is, he knows that he cannot persevere with it. That is the first one. The second one is that we want to discuss the inevitable role which the Bantu are playing in the economy of South Africa, something without which South Africa cannot survive on its present basis. But the Prime Minister, who in one of his speeches as Prime Minister admitted in this House that he knew nothing about the economy has been trying to avoid a discussion of this matter. We have been trying to discuss with the hon. the Prime Minister the impossibility of such a policy, the impossibility of defending abroad the policy as it is being implemented today. [Interjections.] We have warned him and asked him to give us guidance on how we are to defend this policy, South Africa &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is matters such as these that we want to discuss with the <span class="col_5007-5008" refersTo="page_1162"/>hon. the Prime Minister. For instance, we have asked him to help us by giving us guidance on how we can defend abroad the actions of the Government in respect of the urban and especially the urbanized Native. My hon. young friend, the hon. member for Waterkloof, had a great deal to say today about morality. But our experience and the experience of other responsible people, such as the members of the S.A. Foundation, people who are devoting their lives to creating the best possible image of South Africa abroad, and who had to report at their annual meeting &#x2026; Mr. Chairman, in the past the hon. the Prime Minister rapped me over the knuckles about courtesy &#x2026;</p>

<p>I have said that the hon. member for Waterkloof had a great deal to say about morality. But the morality of the Government&#x2019;s colour policy collapses when it comes to the treatment of the urban Bantu, the Coloureds and the Indians. It is matters such as these that we want to discuss. However, the hon. the Prime Minister refuses to do so. Instead of doing that he raises others matters, merely to divert attention from the indefensibility of the Government&#x2019;s standpoint in this regard. The S.A. Foundation, which devotes itself to defending the South Arfican standpoint, said&#x2014;and that was not easy, for the chairman said that he wanted to have nothing to do with politics&#x2014;that there were certain matters in regard to which he had to warn the people, matters which are indefensible. It is these indefensible matters which we want to discuss. With what person can we discuss them on that level other than with the Prime Minister himself? But the Prime Minister does not want to; he cannot; he dare not. Sir, just consider the position of the urbanized Native. We had to learn from front-benchers on the Government side, from the Government&#x2019;s propaganda, that the policy of separate development was going to eliminate all discrimination in South Africa; that is the beautiful future for South Africa. [Interjections.] This is what I heard, and the Prime Minister knows that this is being claimed. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs stated this standpoint at UNO; will he deny it? His statement was that the policy of separate development was going to lead to the elimination of discrimination in South Africa. [Interjections.] He says it is quite correct. Let him please say this to his back-benchers. Sir, where is the prospect that discrimination is going to be eliminated for the Coloureds, for the Indians and for the urbanized Natives, for whom there is no livelihood in the Bantu homelands and for whom there will be no livelihood, Sir, as long as you and I and our children live in this country. These are the matters which the Prime Minister should discuss with us if he, as he has said, wants to account to the people through Parliament for his administration and his policy. But he cannot do it. We are now asking him again. I know that it is a decision of my Leader to discuss sport with the Prime Minister now, but we shall come back to this matter; I am giving him fair notice. We shall come back to this matter and we shall give him another chance, for it is essential for the people of South Africa to realize that in these matters of real importance to our future, the Government has no real answer which it can defend before God or man.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville entered this debate because the Opposition realized and saw yesterday what happens here when leader is pitted against leader. The hon. the Prime Minister, the leader of the National Party, got up here yesterday and rose far above any petty politics to emerge as a great statesman. [Interjections.] Sir, we know the members of the Opposition. If you hear that kind of laughter from that side, Sir, you know we are delivering telling blows. Sir, yesterday we listened to the debate here. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition got up and, as usual, touched on a whole conglomeration of subjects. He touched on a whole lot of minor subjects and the hon. the Prime Minister then said we would deal with these matters step by step under his Vote. Sir, let me just refresh the memory of the Committee. The Prime Minister furthermore said that he was going to talk about State security and he then did so as a statesman, as a leader.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>He said, in the second place, that he was going to speak about the purchase of land for the Bantu homelands, and he did so. He started with the legislation of 1936, and he dealt with the matter very explicitly and in great detail, and then proceeded to an international matter, and dealt with the matter of Kaunda of Zambia at great length. I think hon. members of the Opposition ought to be very grateful to the Prime Minister for the systematic way in Which he dealt with these matters of state one by one. I now want to level the accusation at the Leader of the Opposition, at the hon. member for Yeoville and at the entire Opposition, that they did not have the courage to return to and debate these matters on the same elevated level as the Prime Minister did. Yesterday and today they ran away from these matters. They did not have the courage to discuss these matters which are on the minds of everyone. The Leader of the Opposition did not have the courage to discuss sport matters on this occasion. He issued a Press statement and he spoke on an occasion at a sports club. After that there was a whole number of explanations and in every newspaper we had to read another explanation of how faint the telephone lines were and how incomprehensible this or that was.</p>

<p>But he was not prepared to debate this matter thoroughly on this level with the hon. the Prime Minister. Do you know, Sir, what happened this afternoon? Immediately after the hon. the Prime Minister had spoken, the Leader of the Opposition did not see his way clear to making a farce of himself and his party a second time. Consequently he did not get up, but got the hon. member for Yeoville to rise to his feet and to make a hysterical outburst against the Prime Minister and to level accusations at the Prime Minister, accusations which he definitely did not deserve.</p>

<p>Sir, I know I am speaking on behalf of South Africa when I tell the hon. the Prime Minister today that he performed his task here like a worthy statesman. We are grateful for that. Through his actions here he has done South Africa and the whole population a service. We have listened to this debate; we have looked at what happened here. We expected the Leader of the Opposition to come forward here with those matters about which they and their associates usually gossip at elections, but they did not display that courage here. We know of no other country in the world with bigger and more complicated population problems than there are in South Africa. Therefore we expect, on occasions such as this, when the Vote of the Prime Minister is discussed, to get from the side of the Opposition a proper discussion on a high level of these problems affecting our country and our people, but we do not get it. The hon. member for Yeoville jumped up here and levelled accusations to the effect that the Prime Minister was not prepared to discuss colour problems. Sir, over all the years since 1948 and at election after election, the Opposition has lost because of this specific colour problem. Does he think we do not want to discuss it? We would welcome nothing more than just discussing this problem.</p>

<p>But there are other matters which have to be discussed now, and the hon. the Prime Minister has returned to them time and again since yesterday. I ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville to look at the result in Witbank and at the result in North Rand. On all sides the people are rejecting the United Party because of its colour policy. [Laughter.] Yes, Sir, they may laugh about it, but the hon. member for Yeoville is very sore at heart about the result because he and his Press had already created the hope and the expectation that they might possibly take Witbank. No, if there is one subject on which the National Party and the Government are not afraid to conduct a debate, it is their colour policy, because there is only one policy and there is only one programme of principles in terms of which South Africa with its complicated population problems can be governed. This is the National Party&#x2019;s programme of principles based on the policy of separate development. And the Leader of the Opposition and the people of South Africa know this.</p>

<p>I rose in order to say that it was a tragic spectacle that took place here this afternoon. It was an unworthy accusation on <span class="col_5011-5012" refersTo="page_1164"/>the part of the hon. member for Yeoville when he said the hon. the Prime Minister was not prepared to discuss the matters they had raised. On the contrary, the hon. the Prime Minister time and again returned to some of the points raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Whenever we discuss these matters, which are of importance, the question is asked: &#x201C;What about the colour policy?&#x201D; I want to reassure hon. members and put their minds at rest. They need not be concerned about that. The Coloured policy of the National Party will still be discussed in this debate. Not because it is not well known. It is very well known. The late Dr. Verwoerd explained it and our present Prime Minister has very ably explained the direction and the policy. It will be discussed in this debate if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition have the courage to debate with the hon. the Prime Minister on that level.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am indeed pleased at the reaction to the remarks of the hon. member for Yeoville. For some time it has been evident that the hon. the Prime Minister during his Vote attempts to dictate the subjects which are to be discussed and the time at which they are to be discussed. It was never more evident than last year during this very same debate when the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House talked for two hours on one subject while the Opposition was talking on another. We are getting a little tired of this sort of thing. I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that I am very happy to discuss sport with him. I will &#x2026;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I raised the issue. The hon. the Prime Minister knows very well that there was another issue that is not yet exhausted which I shall exhaust with the hon. the Prime Minister in due course.</p>

<p>We have had an outburst from one of the whips on the other side. He could not resist talking about Witbank. He sounded to me a bit like a chairman at the annual general meeting of a company who says to his shareholders: &#x201C;I am happy to tell you that we have again shown a loss. I am confident that we shall continue in this downward direction in the years that lie ahead.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has made a statement on sport which to my mind shows a remarkable lack of faith in the sporting bodies of South Africa. It is a statement which is based on an ideology which has only recently been accepted by the Nationalist Party, namely the idea that we are a multi-national state and not a multi-racial state. May I say that I think we are a plural society. And you can make out of that what you like. It seems to me that what the hon. gentleman has done is that he has sought an ideology to use as a fig leaf for a statement which is a departure from his previous policy. I am not sorry that he is departing from it. I am indeed very pleased. I think that what has happened is that there are signs of movement on the other side. But what has happened? We are told that because we are a multi-national society we will exercise our sports in separate groups, except at certain stadiums, namely international stadiums, where some sports will be enjoyed together. Does the hon. the Prime Minister really think that that is going to have any effect in the outside world? It may affect his own people and their belief in him. But there is no logic in it whatsoever.</p>

<p>We find that in cricket and rugby with which the hon. the Prime Minister dealt specifically there will be no mixed sport unless an outside team comes to South Africa with non-White players in it. But there will be no playing of the game between White and non-White in South Africa in one team, or mixed trials for the purposes of selecting a team. In athletics, however, we shall have at an international stadium meetings, which include swimming, where there will be mixed competition between Whites and non-Whites who are South Africans. That will be allowed in tennis as well. The hon. gentleman was not clear what the position would be if an international athletic team were to visit South Africa. Would it then run against the Whites, the Bantu and the Coloureds, or would it at the international stadium &#x2026;</p>

I want to emphasize that, as far as we are concerned, it concerns national trials and national games. Apart from that, we believe, the various groups would want to continue to play their games as they have done in the past with members of their own groups. The difference between us is quite clear. The hon. the Prime Minister is prepared to accept this principle in respect of certain sports, but not in respect of others. I accept that. I believe that the controlling bodies in South Africa will come to different decisions. I believe that the rugby people will say that they do not want any mixed rugby in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member will remember the cancellation of the tour by South Africa of Britain. Does the hon. member remember what the M.C.C.&#x2019;s final statement was? I gave them full credit that they wanted the tour to continue, but they ended by saying that that tour would be the last tour between South Africa and Britain, either way, unless we bring in multi-racial cricket in South Africa.</p>

<p>No, it was stated that it must be multi-racial cricket. The hon. members on that side try to close their eyes to these things. I have had my arguments with the hon. member for Pinelands who does understand sporting matters. I remember that he once said that I was a dictator of sport. I put him right on that occasion. It was over the summit meeting. He said I was a dictator because I refused to allow the sport administrators to get together. I told him that I did not do anything of the kind and that they could get together as much as they liked. But they wanted me to call the summit meeting and they also wanted the Prime Minister there. I said that I was not prepared to call a summit meeting, but they could have as many meetings as they liked. The hon. member then said that I was the dictator of sport. Then I said he was trying to make a political issue of sport in South Africa and he should beware of doing that. I want to prove this to the hon. members. There is an hon. member in this House, and I think he is the Deputy Shadow Minister of Sport on that side of the House, who blatantly went out of his way to exploit sport politically, I am going to quote him just now. The hon. members on that ride of the House will try to exploit sport to the utmost just in order to get a few votes, or which they believe they will get. The hon. member said:</p>

<block name="quote">South African sportmen should mobilize into a pressure group to force a change in Government policy before the country was totally cut off from international sport, the United Party spokesman on port, Mr. Dave Marais, said in an interview here yesterday. For one thing they have the provincial elections before the end of the year, and there is no better place to lodge a protest than through the ballot box.</block>

<p>If that is not blatant political exploitation of sport, I would like to know what is. I wanted to say to the hon. member for Pinelands, who is their shadow Minister, &#x201D; hat I could not understand of him is that he could go and say to the papers that he supports the walk-off of the cricket players. I can read the statements which appeared in the papers. One of them r &#x201C;Progs and United Party back cricket walk-off&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member can ask any newspaper. They will tell him that the United Party supported the walk-off. I want to ask the United Party whether they have ever considered the basis on which these cricketers walked off the field. First of all I would like to say to them that South Africa has suffered tremendously because of these demonstrations on sporting fields. The demonstrators in England upset our rugby players and the demonstrators in Australia upset our two girl tennis players. In the same way the demonstrators tried to upset our surfing team which visited Australia recently. The one man who supported the cricketers and the United Party&#x2019;s attitude was Peter Hain, because he is the organizer of demonstrations against us on sports fields overseas. That is why I say that I cannot understand the hon. member for Pinelands. Look what the cricketers said:</p>

<block name="quote">We cricketers feel that the time has come for an expression of our own views. We fully support the South African Cricket Association&#x2019;s application to include two non-Whites on the tour of Australia, if good enough &#x2026;</block>

<p>Does that sound like the international cricket field or merit only being the criterion on the cricket field? What does that mean? It means mixed sport on the cricket field.

<p>I said that I believed that there was not a great difference in principle between the hon. the Prime Minister and myself, but I did not have an opportunity to finish entirely what I had to say. The hon. gentleman asked me why in one place we said we were prepared and in another place we said we were prepared to consider. The hon. gentleman will know very well that when a sporting arrangement is made in which there are to be Whites and non-Whites from South Africa, there are various local laws, conventions and customs which it may or may not be desirable to relax. As far as we are concerned, we are not prepared to make a blanket relaxation without knowing what the situation is. I was interested in the hon. the Prime Minister saying that in South Africa the convention had developed naturally, without any laws, that the different groups enjoyed their sport separately. That is correct, Sir. If that has developed naturally, the probability is that it will continue naturally without any laws. That is why one is anxious to leave the matter to the sporting bodies who are controlling sport in South Africa at the present time. The hon. the Prime Minister today in his statement did not again say that he suggested that the non-White organizations should make their own contacts overseas.</p>

Is the hon. gentleman opposed, even in respect of those bodies in which he is prepared to allow mixed sport at an international level, to the representation of non-Whites on the White controlling bodies? He knows that there has been an announcement that the present Olympic organization has given representation to certain non-White athletic bodies on its council.</p>

<p>Then I did want to make one suggestion to the hon. the Prime Minister. He agreed with me, as he has done before when we discussed this matter in this House in 1967, that we would like to have all race groups watch all organized sport, provided adequate facilities are available for Whites and non-Whites. I would appeal to the hon. gentleman not to lay it down as a hard and fast rule&#x2014;I do not say he has done it&#x2014;that where non-White South African teams play White touring teams.

<p>There are just one or two other matters that I would like to raise on this issue. The one concerns mixed trials. I want to make it perfectly clear that we reserve to ourselves the right to decide what are genuine trials and what are necessary for such trials for the selection of a national team. A mixed trial does not necessarily mean that a non-White team plays a White team. I would envisage a mixed cricket trial, perhaps, between 22 players of whom perhaps at the most at the moment two or three might be non-Whites. Nevertheless, it would give an opportunity of judging the standard of those players and of the White players participating in the trials.</p>

<p>The other issue I wanted to raise is the question of non-Whites being permitted to attend international events in South Africa where both White and non-White athletes and White and non-White tennis players from overseas were participating in a tournament.</p>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>It has become obvious to me that the major difference in approach to sport between the Government and the Opposition is to be found in the fact that the Government does not regard sport, as the Prime Minister rightly said this afternoon, as being of paramount importance. The interests of South Africa, both domestically and abroad, must not be made secondary to sport. The Opposition differs with us. When demands are made abroad, we are to comply with them, according to the Opposition. The other basic <span class="col_5023-5024" refersTo="page_1170"/>difference is that they regard South Africa as being a multi-racial country. We regard South Africa as being a country with several peoples, which can also, by making use of sport, promote their own national consciousness and realize it in the best way.</p>

<p>Sir, in general the significance of sport is important to me. I have here a document written by Dr. Hannes Botha, the well-known Springbok athlete, &#x201C;Sport in Perspective&#x201D;, in which he wrote, <i>inter alia,</i> the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sport represents the most outstanding form of recreation and as such it has a wider sphere of influence than has formal physical education. It is a potential educational force, the significance of which is not being underestimated. This significance is definitely giving shape to snorts education as a subject of study. Sport is founded on play, which is a vital form of self-expression in the course of nature in man. At best sport is instrumental in the formation of a positive character and personality.</block>

<p>But then he sounds this warning&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, sport can also be abused so that it exerts a negative influence. This implies a tremendous responsibility which rests on the shoulders of sports leaders.</block>

<p>With reference to this quotation I want to say that in our approach to sport we should always allow ourselves to be guided by these views and not by considerations put forward abroad or elsewhere with objectives which are inconsistent with them. In this regard I should like to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his followers today that in making promises about how international teams will be composed under them, they must bear in mind that those people who are making demands on sport in South Africa, are not sportsmen such as those referred to in this document. They are not only blackmailers; I want to call people such as Peter Hain and Co. terrorists. It is that class of people that are making demands, and when such demands are made, it is not the National Party or the Government that finds itself in the crush-pen, but the whole of South Africa, the Opposition along with us. If the Opposition are of the opinion that they can win the favour of those people through a few gestures or a few half-baked plans, and, as was said by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in his policy statement, retain South Africa&#x2019;s traditional participation in international sport, they are making a grave mistake.</p>

<p>The only way in which one can handle this situation, is to think and act in regard to these matters in terms of principles. That is where the major short-coming on the Opposition side is to be found, i.e. that they did not think in terms of principles and did not appreciate what the implications of that statement issued by them would be for South Africa. On the other hand I want to say that the statement which the hon. the Prime Minister made here this afternoon, and which also affords our own non-White peoples the opportunity of competing whilst following their own course and reaching the highest rung without any restrictions, is the only way in which we, with our situation in South Africa, can approach sport. Sir, this afternoon I want to put a few questions to members of the Opposition with reference to what happened in sport quite recently and does not tally with this approach to sport which I quoted here this afternoon. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not here at the moment; I shall, therefore, put this question to the hon. member for Pinelands. He is a person who played representative cricket and who is still moving in cricket circles. Did the hon. member have talks with cricket people prior to that decision and prior to that walk-off at Newlands?</p>

A statement has been issued here, a statement in which all the talks with the Government are being blazed abroad. These people may have been advised by somebody that this statement would cause fewer demonstrations to be staged against them abroad; perhaps they thought so, but the next moment a walk-off took place, something which is unprecedented in our history of sport in South Africa, and the hon. member for Johannesburg North was the first person to say that he was giving his full support to that demonstration.</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Marais and Springbok Cricket Captain, Ali Bacher, declared their support for the walk-off protest in the Republican Festival match at Newlands.</block>

<p>Sir, there is no need for me to read on. A role was played here which, in particular, does not behave a politician. I want to concede that those cricket players were misled or misguided, but did the people who advised them or expressed their support to such a demonstration, stop to think what harm they were doing to cricket in South Africa and to cricket in the international world, and what harm they were doing to relations between English and Afrikaans-speaking people in this country?

<block name="quote">It has left behind a very bad taste; what those people did, was to deal us as Afrikaans-speaking cricket supporters a severe blow.

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has reacted to the sports proposals so far of the hon. the Prime Minister and he has done so, I suggest, in a most statesmanlike way, seeking to find out what their policy is and to get clarity. I myself would very much like to keep sporting matters like this as far as possible on a very high level, but what have we had from the opposite side? I want to place it on record right now so that there shall be no misunderstanding. When we came forward with our sport policy the other day. what did we find? The Government seized the first opportunity to launch a most vitriolic and unjustified attack upon our policy and to point out all sorts of complications, most of which do not exist, and every single one of which now exists under their policy, and worse. Not only did we have that the other day. when perhaps there might have been a little excuse for it, (although frankly I do not think in these matters there is any excuse for it, even on the eve of the election at Wit-bank); but we now have the leading speaker, apart from the hon. the Minister <span class="col_5027-5028" refersTo="page_1172"/>of Sport, on the Government side coming with the same sort of political attacks and trying to make political capital. I think it is time that the record is put straight before we get back to South Africa&#x2019;s interest in this matter and various other things.</p>

<p>I want, first of all, just to answer the clear insinuation of the hon. member for Stellenbosch, which was that I had been in contact with the cricket players and clearly had counselled that they should walk off the field. Let me say that I regard that with the utmost contempt and I say quite categorically, so that there shall be no misunderstanding, that it was a complete surprise to me. The first thing I heard about it was some time during the afternoon on Saturday, because I was not there in the morning. But it staggers me, where we are speaking on an issue of this kind, that this should be the first reaction of a frontbencher on the opposite side. It is an absolute disgrace.</p>

<p>But let us look at the further things with which they have come in this debate. We have had from the hon. member for Pretoria Central yesterday, and now again from the hon. member for Stellenbosch, this attack that this side has based its sports policy on the demands of outside people. I say that is an absolutely scandalous statement. And let me say that it comes most shockingly from this Government, because if ever there was a Government which the written word proves has in fact set its policy to the demands of outside people, it is this Government. I wish to quote what the hon. the Prime Minister himself said in his sports policy statement of April, 1967, after he had been prodded into making it. First of all, he was quoting from what Mr. Braun stated was the policy in regard to athletics. He quoted with approval Mr. Braun&#x2019;s words, from which it was clear that our Olympic team would be selected by White and non-White sports administrators sitting together. Then the hon. the Prime Minister went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because the Olympic Games lays it down as an absolute condition, the people who are then selected will take part as one contingent under the South African flag.</block>

<p>I shall read that again:</p>

<block name="quote">Because the Olympic Games lays it down as an absolute condition, the people who are then selected will take part as one contingent under the South African flag. That is our attitude in that regard and I think it is the correct one to adopt.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>My point is that the hon. the Prime Minister is told by overseas people that their conditions for our participation in the Olympic Games are that there shall be a mixed team of South Africans and that they shall perform together under the South African flag, and the Prime Minister said: Those are their conditions overseas and I will comply with them. And he said so again today.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_sport_and_recreation">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION</person>:</from>

<p>That is the rule of the Olympic Games.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is the rule, but it only shows that hon. members opposite will modify their principles if somebody tells them that they have to. But the hon. the Prime Minister has said again today, that if the rules of the Davis Cup require that our team should be chosen on merit, then they shall be chosen on merit. I say again that the point I am making here is that I resent, and I reject with contempt, the accusations made against our side that we have shaped our policy to conform with demands from outside. I say that it ill-becomes any hon. member opposite ever to use that argument again.</p>

<p>I want to say that included in this attack we had made upon us by the hon. member for Pretoria Central, there was the allegation that there would be social mixing and there would be integration. I say one thing which is absolutely quite clear to me already about these proposals, and that is that the biggest activity which is now possible in our sport, particularly at international level, is for a White team to play a Black team, or for a White team to play a Coloured team. That is the biggest possibility, because there are all these 22 nations in it. There are nine ethnic groups here, one Coloured group and one Indian group. Now they as nations can all compete on a level together, and indeed, it will work to that end that they shall do so. I use this argument purely because we had this thrown at us that our policy leads <span class="col_5029-5030" refersTo="page_1173"/>to integration. I say the possibility of play between White and non-White South Africans has been multiplied immensely by this proposition, quite out of line with the normal South African tradition. I merely instance the fact that in terms of the Olympic Games idea, all the Olympic sports can be played on a team basis together and so forth. As I say, I use that for that sole purpose because I believe that this sort of proposal should be approached on its merits, but the opposite side has a way of making a political matter out of it and I hope that by answering in this way we will get a good deal less of it.</p>

<p>In the short time left to me I would like to deal with the hon. the Minister of Sport. The hon. the Minister of Sport and the Government always previously took the view that there should be no play between White and non-White teams in South Africa. I want to say and admittedly this is a political point and not a point on the merits, the more we examine these proposals we will see that hon. members opposite have been turning somersaults to such an extent that if it were not such a serious matter, one could describe it as a &#x201C;circus&#x201D; policy rather than a sports policy. To prove my statement on the subject of mixed sport, I want to say this. The hon. the Prime Minister, in his statement of April, 1967, laid it down clearly that there should be no question of mixed sport between White and non-White South Africans. I just happen to have here the reaffirmation of that by the hon. the Minister of Sport on 28th May, 1970, less than a year ago, where he said that the Government also rejects a policy which would allow White teams to compete with non-White teams, whether in South Africa or, as has been suggested, in neighbouring territories, nor will it consider any form of mixed trials.

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am rising to my feet to talk to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the first place. In passing, however, I just want to say two things to the hon. member for Pinelands. Firstly, I want to say to him that the hon. member for Stellenbosch did not make any insinuation against him. He merely asked the hon. member a question, to which he could have replied either &#x201C;No&#x201D; or &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>He said he had reason to suspect what he suspected.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He asked the hon. member whether he had been there or not. However, I leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>Secondly, the hon. member put forward the nonsensical argument that I had allegedly said in 1967 that, as far as the Olympic Games were concerned, I had done that under pressure from the outside world. Did the hon. member not listen while I was speaking? I said that we had been a member of the Olympic Games throughout the years. We had participated in those Games in the full knowledge of what their rules were. Their rules provided that, and because their rules provided that, we had to comply with it. Surely there is a world of difference between the two. And if these were the rules and regulations in respect of the Davis Cup as well &#x2014;and we have been playing in the Davis Cup series since before the rinderpest&#x2014; and we were to decide that we wanted to remain in that competition, we would remain in it on the basis of those rules and regulations. What is wrong with that? Or does the hon. member want to make his own rules and regulations in that regard?</p>

<p>I now want to turn to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. What I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, I say with great respect, because he and I have respect for each other. I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that when he wants to discuss something with me in the future, he must not make use of an errand boy. He must speak to me directly and in person.</p>

<p>I shall now furnish the replies which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me to furnish in regard to these matters. I am grateful for his having reminded me that I had not come to deal with the point of the non-Whites&#x2019; own sporting relations. The world is tremendously large and there are more than a hundred different nations. Hon. members will recall that when I discussed this topic in 1967, I said that we had built up certain traditional sporting relations over the years. I should like to retain those sporting relations. Naturally, as far as most of our branches of sport are concerned, we cannot have relations with the whole of the world. We simply do not have the time and the opportunity for that.</p>

<p>Now. we as Whites, as we are organized in our Rugby Board, in our Cricket Board and in respect of the other branches of sport, have over the years built up traditional <span class="col_5031-5032" refersTo="page_1174"/>relations with countries. We can hardly take more onto our shoulders than we already have in this regard. The entire world is wide open to the Coloured people who are also organized on a separate &#x00A1;basis, to establish their own relations with such other states as are prepared to establish such relations with them. As far as the Black people are concerned, the whole of Africa and the entire world is open to them to establish their own relations according as those people want to establish relations with them. Let me give the hon. member an example. I shall welcome it if, for example, a Coloured cricket team undertakes an overseas tour to any country that wants to invite them. I shall welcome it if a Black team builds up relations with any country in Africa and then goes to play there, or goes to play in any European country which is willing to receive them. I should like the matter to develop in such a way that they can realize themselves fully in that sphere in the international world. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I would be glad if we could dispose of this matter once and for all across the floor of this House. The Springbok rugby team is not representative of the whole of South Africa. It has never been that. It has never claimed to be representative of the whole of South Africa. It is representative of the Whites of South Africa. It has always been that, for the simple reason that it has been organized by the Whites, and that the Coloured people have organized themselves on a separate basis. Surely the hon. member knows that the invitations sent here in the past were not addressed to the rugby players of South Africa. They were addressed to the White South African Rugby Board, which consists of Whites only, and to which the Coloured people and the Bantu have never belonged, because they have their own rugby boards. Is that clear to the hon. member? The South African Rugby Board has never represented the whole of South Africa. The South African Cricket Board has never represented the whole of South Africa. On the contrary, Mr. Howa is the chief of the Coloured people&#x2019;s own Cricket Board and he adopts a hostile attitude towards the White Cricket Board. He is directly opposed to them. He adopts such a hostile attitude that he refused to accept R50 000 from the White Cricket Board for the promotion of cricket among the Coloured people. In terms of the composition of the Cricket Board non-Whites have never been allowed to belong to it. It is that Cricket Board which has established the overseas relations. It is to that Cricket Board that invitations are addressed. It is that Cricket Board which arranged the tours of the past.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question? Can what happened in the case of table tennis, where the non-White body is now recognized by the world table tennis organizations as representing South Africa, not happen here too?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it can happen now as well. I am glad the hon. member has mentioned the example of table tennis. The White and the non-White table tennis bodies were organized on a separate basis, just as the rugby and the cricket bodies are organized on a separate basis. Then the International Table Tennis Union, which is communist-controlled, said that there were two unions in South Africa and that it recognized the non-White union. But at present there are two rugby unions. There are two cricket unions. That is the present position, and it has always been the position. Does the hon. member understand the argument? It can happen now too.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But the non-Whites do not play rugby and cricket at international level.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The very thing I want to do is to afford them the opportunity of participating at international level. I want to afford them this opportunity because it is their right. I want to afford them this opportunity because the outside world is levelling the reproach <span class="col_5033-5034" refersTo="page_1175"/>at us that our non-Whites in South Africa are being hemmed in and cannot get out. I want to make it possible for them to compete at international level, because it is their right. I do not think there is anyone who would quarrel with me about that.</p>

<p>My hon. friend also put a question in regard to spectators in the Coloured areas. He knows how limited the number of seats is at any of our sports stadiums and how difficult it is to obtain tickets. I want to put it to him that, apart from the problems it would create, problems of which he and I are aware, apart from the principle involved, it would be unfair, when a touring side comes to play rugby against the Coloured people, to take away seats from the Coloured people and give them to Whites who have more money than they do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>But what about a stadium like the Show Grounds at Goodwood?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know nothing about the Show Grounds at Good-wood. The Rugby Board has not made any representations to me in that connection. But I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that if a match were played between a touring side and our Coloured people, whether at the Good-wood Show Grounds, if it would be possible to stage it there, or at any other place&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will understand that I am not committing myself at all, because I do not know the circumstances&#x2014;the interest among the Coloured people would be so great that I would positively lay down the rule that, wherever the match was to be played, only Coloured spectators would be admitted, with the exception of the rugby officials. I am not going to inconvenience one single Coloured person by affording a White person the opportunity to attend such matches, because the Whites have plenty of opportunities to see matches.</p>

<p>In regard to cricket I just want to make one matter very clear, with reference to the argument put forward by the hon. the Minister. In our assessment of the cricket situation we must understand very clearly that, when the Cricket Council, which controls cricket, took its decision in regard to South Africa, it decided &#x201C;that they will not play against our Springboks, unless we play multi-racial cricket in the whole of South Africa&#x201D;. I have discussed this matter very thoroughly with the cricket people. I know what I am talking about now.</p>

<p>Their decision was that we had to play &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; cricket. I asked whether that meant &#x201C;interracial&#x201D; cricket or &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; cricket, because the hon. members will appreciate that there is in fact a difference in meaning. The Council made it very clear that they were not even satisfied with &#x201C;inter-racial&#x201D; cricket; it had to be &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; cricket. That &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; cricket must be played at all levels from top to bottom, in other words, at provincial level as well, and at every possible level. Hon. members can now realize what problems we are faced with in that regard. Now, I am not saying the following in a spirit of reproach towards hon. members on the opposite side of this House, but I am saying it in respect of sportsmen and sports administrators outside, and that is that we have to be extremely careful in this regard not to make any promises or not to hold anything in prospect which we know in our heart of hearts we cannot do in practice. If we do that, we shall be turning one devil into two. We shall be creating agitators, we shall be creating dissatisfaction, and we shall be making a rod for our own backs. Therefore I am careful not to do that in this regard. I do not hold out the prospect of anything which cannot be done. I do not hold out the prospect of anything which is not in accordance <span class="col_5035-5036" refersTo="page_1176"/>with the principle that mixed sport shall not be practised here in South Africa, but that sport shall be practised on a separate basis by the various national groups.</p>

<p>That is a problem that will be presented by the Olympic Games, but it is a problem that one can solve very easily. It will not be necessary to hold mixed trials, because, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, there are many branches of sport in respect of which it is not necessary to hold trials. Apart from that, the whole question of trials falls away because one can arrange an international athletic meeting at which it will become very clear who are the best athletes and who are not.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to put a question to the hon. the Prime Minister. What is the position in respect of the team sports such as rowing. basket-ball, hockey and even bowls, which are allowed at the Olympic Games?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No representations in regard to those branches of sport have been made to me as yet. If representations are made to me and I am asked to state my attitude in that regard, my attitude will be precisely the same as that which I have now explained to hon. members in respect of the other Olympic branches of sport. It will be the same, because other Olympic branches of sport&#x2014;and at the moment I do not know what branches of sport are all included in the Olympic Games&#x2014;will, if they want to participate, comply with the rules and regulations in respect of those branches of sport. Then I have to add that many branches of sport do not participate in the Olympic Games. I wish to repeat that from the outset we went into the Olympic Games in the full knowledge that both Whites and non-Whites participate in the Games and, in addition, that it is not done on a team basis, but on a national basis. In other words, if rugby were an Olympic sport, our rugby people would not have qualified, because they are not organized on a national basis, as they represent only the organized rugby team of the Whites. I hope the hon. member understands the difference existing in that regard. If one takes part in sport, one must do so according to its rules.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Yeoville now accuses me of &#x201C;departure from policy&#x201D;, I just want to make it very clear that all I am doing is to apply the policy consistently throughout. All I am doing is to make it possible in the multi-national context, as I see it, without encouraging or practising mixed sport here in South Africa, to afford the non-Whites participation in the international sporting world.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am always one to welcome changes introduced by the Government, particularly when they break away from traditions which I do not believe in any case should be maintained. I must say that I think that in this particular <span class="col_5037-5038" refersTo="page_1177"/>case the hon. the Prime Minister is going to regret very deeply the changes that he has made. They are so complicated and so completely illogical that I do not see how he is going to work his way out of this morass of rules and regulations which he has laid down in the field of international sport. Let us take the answers he gave last year to a question I put, namely whether the trials for the South African Olympic Team were going to be mixed trials? The answer he gave, as I understood it, was that he was going to convert the trials for the choosing of the Olympic Team into a sort of international event. In other words, in order to adhere to the principles that he has enunciated, that no mixed sport would be allowed in South Africa and yet at the same time enable us to send a mixed team overseas to compete in the Olympic Games, this international event would be held inside South Africa.</p>

<p>The Olympic Committee lays down that mixed trials should take place because the best sportsmen representing a country in a particular sport have to be chosen under like conditions. You cannot have a Black team holding a trial for the Olympics on one track on one day and a White team taking part on another track on another day, because conditions are not the same. This would not meet the Olympic rules. So in order to meet this situation, the hon. the Prime Minister is going to have an international Olympic trials competition to choose the South African team. I have never heard anything like this in my life. I do not know whether he is doing it in order to keep the Right-wing critics of his own party quiet, otherwise there would be mixed sport in South Africa, or whether he is doing it in order to try to placate the demands of the overseas sports administrators. It is not going to work either way. There is nothing consequential about this. It is nonsense and illogical from the word &#x201C;go&#x201D;. As for being consequential on politics, the hon. the Prime Minister talks about multi-national teams playing international sport outside South Africa and multi-national teams being allowed to meet international teams inside South Africa, but not another South African team of a different race.</p>

<p>Now, to be consequential is he going to consider all the Africans as one nation for this purpose? This is what I want to know. Is there going to be a Zulu team representing the Zulu nation?&#x2014;Because we are being told all the time that there are eight different Bantu nations. Is there going to be a Xhosa team, a Shangaan team, and so on?</p>

<p>I realize you cannot force clubs to take members they do not want. There are many clubs who do not have Jewish members, and so on. But in principle, one is against that sort of discrimination, and in principle I am against discrimination on racial grounds, obviously.</p>

<p>I would be in favour of South Africans of all races playing sport against each other freely, without any of the restrictions hedged in by the hon. Leader of the Opposition in his new declaration, which I want to say also will not satisfy outside demands. I can only understand that these changes have come about from the Government side on the one hand and the Opposition side on the other hand, purely and simply to meet the demands of the outside world, which have left us far behind as regards the whole multi-racial question. I must tell hon. members that none of these solutions is going to help. The matter has gone too far beyond any camouflage tactics which have been adopted by the Government or by the Official Opposition to be able to succeed. The world thinks we are mad in this respect. The sooner we realize it, the better. If we say: &#x201C;No, we do not care&#x2014;let them think we are mad,&#x201D; then let us stick to our old ridiculous <span class="col_5039-5040" refersTo="page_1178"/>rules and regulations here, but do not think that we are going to be able to break out of our dilemma with this absurd tactical manoeuvre that is being tried. It is not going to work at all.</p>

<p>I was in London last year when the whole South African versus M.C.C. cricket controversy was on the go. I was in England the very week that the tour was cancelled. It will surprise hon. members to hear that I am on record, that I was on television and had newspaper interviews, in trying to get the English public to accept that the South African team should be allowed to come, because I am against isolation. My great fear was that one form of isolation, if successful, would lead to other forms of isolation. This is what worries me more than anything else. I can understand clearly that it is an excellent punitive exercise against South Africa to stop South African teams from going abroad. This is the one thing that really hurts South Africans where they feel it. So I could understand that. But my real objection was that I did not want one form of isolation to lead to economic and cultural isolation. There is a considerable danger that this could happen, if it was successful. I was talking absolutely to a blank wall&#x2014;there was not a hope of that tour going on.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister can make his speech when I sit down. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that it was not just Peter Hain who stopped the South African cricket tour. He started the demonstrations, but by the time that campaign was over the most respectable organizations in England were dead against the tour. There was the Race Relations Board, which, believe me, is a very conservative body; there was the Community Council which was worried about the educational side, the schools and the uproar that would be created in the multi-racial schools in England; there were people like Sir Edward Boyle, who would have been the Conservative Minister of Education had he stayed in politics. Highly respectable people were against the tour, not only wild Left Wing radicals. They were there too, of course,. but very respectable organizations had joined in because the thing had gone well beyond apartheid in South Africa. It had become a matter of British race relations, of what was going to happen inside Britain; it had become a case of Britain&#x2019;s relations with the Commonwealth nations. It had become a matter of law and order in England as well because the police said themselves that it would be an impossible thing to maintain law and order at Lords or the Oval for a five-day test match. I want to tell the hon. member, Sir, that I doubt very much indeed, despite the unbelievably complicated and involved concessions which the Prime Minister has now evolved to get us off the hook, whether the international tours, including the cricket and rugby tours to Australia, will go on.</p>

<p>Sir, really, the hon. member for Houghton may stand and coo with her true feminine loveliness until tomorrow morning, but she does not bluff this side of the House. We know that she advocates a multi-racial government in South Africa, in which the non-Whites will be in the majority. She advocates full multi-racial sport; she endorses what the head of the anti-apartheid movement said. Now the hon. member is keen to state that many responsible people in Britain were also opposed to the tour, and then she even wants to link this up with Peter Hain&#x2019;s conduct. Let us take a brief look at this gentleman, Peter Hain, and his bands of hired demonstrators. The organization that supported Peter Hain in cancelling several tours abroad was, <i>inter alia,</i> the Communist Party. Are these the friends to which the hon. member wants to refer?</p>

<p>No, I listened to the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. There were, <i>inter alia</i>, the following organizations: South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee, Anti-Apartheid Movement, Campaign against Racialism in Sport, Halt all Social Tours, Association against Racial Discrimination in South Africa, the South African Defence and Aid Fund, the Institute of Race Relations and Stop 1970 Tour. Sir, no one would touch most of these organizations with a barge-pole. But, Sir, I shall leave the hon. member&#x2019;s questions at that, because they were more specifically addressed to the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

I now ask: How long was the hon. the Prime Minister supposed to wait for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to speak about sport? Or can the hon. member for Yeoville tell us what the Opposition was afraid of? For two days now hon. members on that side have been speaking about Bantu administration, while they would have the opportunity to discuss these matters under the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. What were they afraid of? Were they afraid of discussing sport while the by-election in Witbank was in progress yesterday? They had two days in which to discuss it.</p>

<p>Last week during the Budget debate they had a chance to discuss sport. No, Sir, the hon. member for Yeoville does not impress anyone with his outburst here. He challenged us to quote the name of any member of the United Party who said he supported this demonstration at Newlands. What did the hon. member for Johannesburg North, who is chewing so nicely there, say according to the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 4th April? The report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Dave Marais, chairman of the National Football League, has declared his support for the cricket walk-off protest <span class="col_5043-5044" refersTo="page_1180"/>and called on sporting bodies to get together and to decide what they wanted to do about non-White sportsmen and the Government&#x2019;s policy.</block>

<p>Nowhere has the hon. member denied his support for this demonstration. The hon. member will probably be the next to speak and then he can give his answer. But there is proof that the hon. member did so. The hon. member for Pinelands was terribly angry this afternoon. It was priceless to watch from this side who the people were on the other side who became angry while the hon. the Prime Minister was speaking&#x2014; from the hon. member for Yeoville in the front benches all the way down to the back benchers on that side. The hon. member for Pinelands lost his temper this afternoon at the hon. member for Stellenbosch, but let us confine ourselves for a moment to a few of the matters the hon. member spoke about. The hon. member says that he expects sports matters to be discussed at a high level. But what does the United Party do? The same Saturday evening and Sunday morning, even before the newspapers had been printed, after this demonstration and walk-off at Newlands, the United Party itself jumps onto the bandwagon. There is no doubt about that. I do not want to stand here quoting passages, Sir, but you may just look at the front page of the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 4th April, and also at the back page of the same issue where the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Pinelands furnish comments.</p>

<p>The hon. member must tell this Committee whether he shares Hain&#x2019;s joy. I shall send the cutting across for the hon. member. Sir, what else do our friends do? Mr. Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira is telephoned to see whether they cannot draw a bit of venom there, but he conducts himself like a decent sportsman. Mr. Gary Sobers is telephoned by them, and he does the same. That same day, of course, the Progressive Party climbed onto the same bandwagon. Unfortunately my time is very limited and I cannot go into that now. The hon. member for Pinelands comes along here and adopts the attitude that there must only be terribly high level discussions about sport here, and when the hon. member for Stellenbosch refers to the players&#x2019; conduct and indicates that they are distorting relationships in South Africa, the hon. member for Pinelands also holds that against him. I want to tell the hon. member that the whole of South Africa has the utmost respect for these cricket players who were playing at Newlands, both as people and as cricket players, but then those people must also see to it that they keep the respect of the South African public; they must not leave the impression with people that gaining a Springbok blazer is so important that a man is prepared to sacrifice his own self-respect and the self-respect of his country. One must not do that and then expect people not to comment on it; then those same cricket players must, in the presence of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, according to the <i>Cape Times</i> of 8th April, 1971 &#x2026; [Interjection.] That is what is reported here&#x2014;</p>

I think it would be very good advice, and I would be glad if the hon. member for Pinelands would share in this standpoint of mine that these cricket players of ours, and any sportsmen in South Africa, must modify their conduct in such a way that we retain our respect for them, and they must leave politics to us and confine themselves to sport.</p>

What one finds even more disappointing is that while two Coloured, well-renowned cricket players conduct themselves so responsibly in their comment in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> our own South African captain, Ali Bacher, comes along and says: &#x201C;I wish I had been there&#x201D;. No, I think that if the hon. member for Pinelands tells us that these matters must be argued at a higher level, hon. members must allow us to argue them according to our view of life applicable in South Africa, and let us look at the clashes in world sport, which are clashes between different views of life; that is the sort of clash we are involved in. We on this side say that our traditional view of life includes, <i>inter alia,</i> the principle of multi-nationality, and with that principle in hand we are prepared to enter the world and test conditions that clash with us against the principle that we have a firm grip on.

<p>I am going to take no notice of the hon. the Minister of Sport. I want to say that every sportsman in South Africa and every sports administrator, and every lover of sport, is concerned with this question of our isolation in international sport. And I believe this is what we should be debating today. It is common cause that we are heading for total sports isolation and it is common cause that not a single sports body in South Africa has been expelled from any of the international controlling bodies because they had in any way contravened the statutes of that body or were not in good standing with that body. In each and every case action has been taken against them because of this Nationalist Party Government&#x2019;s completely outdated, unrealistic and vacillating sports policy. This is absolutely true and I want to say that I am certain that every sports lover waited with bated breath today to hear something from the Prime Minister which would give them hope with regard to South Africa&#x2019;s future participation in international sport. But what did we have from the hon. the Prime Minister? I want to say, with respect, that I believe he loves sport and that he would sincerely like to see us in international sport, but let me say with respect, too, that what the hon. the Prime Minister came up with here today will completely confuse the issue and I believe will nullify any. chance we had of getting back into international sport What the Prime Minister forgets is that the outside world does not believe that this is a multi-national country; they believe this is one country. To come along and suggest that we must give possibly 22 different nationalities the opportunity of playing international sport is the biggest lot of nonsense <span class="col_5047-5048" refersTo="page_1182"/>I have ever heard. I think the hon. the Prime Minister knows that the overseas controlling bodies recognize only one controlling body in a country, and he has put us on a very dangerous path today. I am very glad that the question of table tennis was mentioned, because we know what happened there. The non-White body was recognized and when that same non-White body then applied for permission to play in a world tournament, this Government refused them visas. Is this going to be the pattern for the future? This is possibly the most dangerous step that we have ever taken in sports relations. I know the Prime Minister tends to be very optimistic in his outlook in regard to sport, and I want to say that in that speech he made in Cape Town during the parliamentary elections, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Vorster said there was criticism that South Africa had become isolated as a result of the Government&#x2019;s sports policy. The fact is that during the last couple of years we have had more international sporting teams touring South Africa and more South African teams have left our shores than in the whole decade preceding.</block>

<p>And in reply to an interjector, he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa was still taking part in 35 of the former 40 international sports in which we had once participated.</block>

<p>I would like to hear from the hon. the Prime Minister how he came to this optimistic assessment of our position in international sport, because at that time we had already been barred from two Olympic Games; we had been kicked out of the Olympic Council; we were either suspended or expelled from the sports of football, judo, basketball, fencing, table tennis, and weight-lifting; two cricket tours between England and South Africa had been stopped: and our tennis-players had been debarred from taking part in the Davis Cup. It was against this background that the Prime Minister was so optimistic. Let me say that I think we have to accept the fact that South African sports bodies have been acted against because of the Government&#x2019;s sports policy, a policy which has brought us to the very brink of complete international sports isolation, a policy which has given our political enemies overseas the opportunity to mount attacks against us through sport because it is a very easy avenue, and a sports policy that has given agitators&#x2014;and I say this advisedly&#x2014;like Dennis Brutus and Peter Hain the very sticks with which to beat us out of almost every international arena in the world. What is most important is that this sports policy has resulted in something which is completely out of character with South Africa and completely foreign to our way of life, i.e. demonstrations against this particular policy by eminent sportsmen on the field of play. In passing I should like to say that I am not going to take sides. I am not going to discuss the merits of this particular demonstration. But I want to say that it is a sorry day for South Africa and a sorry day for sport when people of this eminence, people who brought lustre to the name of South Africa, people who have been our best ambassadors overseas, have to resort to that type of demonstration. It shows that there is something very seriously wrong with our whole approach to sport. I have been to four international sport congresses and I know the feeling of hatred and venom which one meets over there. I have gone along there and tried to put South Africa&#x2019;s case and believe me, if we do not adopt the policy as set out by my leader, I want to be prophetic and say that within the next year or two we will be completely isolated in international sport. I know that the hon. the Prime Minister said that sport was important but not as important as many other things. I agree with him. But I believe that we can hold our sports relations, can take part in sport again and that we can be heard again in the councils of the world if the people over there can sincerely assume that any person in South Africa will be allowed to represent his country overseas on merit. That is exactly what the United Party policy will do. I almost want to beg the hon. the Prime Minister to forget about this scheme of a multi-national sports set-up in this country. It can never work, it will be completely confusing and he will get no thanks from non-White or White sportsmen.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the hon. member for Johannesburg North has just spoken. At least he spoke honestly. He is a serious sportsman that wants to see multi-racial sport. He is a person who does not care whom he plays with, how he plays and what results that may have. The hon. member has now totally compromised his party. As far as this policy of his is concerned, he has in <span class="col_5049-5050" refersTo="page_1183"/>the past weeks and months made propaganda for pressure to be exercised on the Government to change its sports policy. [Interjections.] I say that this hon. member is at least honest in telling us that, as far as he is concerned, he believes in multiracial sport.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to something the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said. In reply to the hon. the Prime Minister he said that there were not great differences in principle between us and them as far as sport is concerned. I have never in my life heard such an opportunistic utterance. Everything the United Party has thus far done in the sphere of sport is devoid of principle. Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that there is not a great difference in principle between them and us. There is a world of difference between us and them. The hon. member for Johannesburg North gave a beautiful illustration of this in the speech he just made.

Another people created Lesotho, and if Lesotho can play football and take part in the Olympic Games, why cannot the Tswana also do so? There is surely no difference between the two. Sir, I shall tell you what bothers me, as far as the United Party is concerned. If there is anyone at all who wants to criticize the National Party they can be sure that they will pick up the United Party riding on the back of the wagon of their criticism, and that that party will join them in singing a duet, regardless of the principle laid down, regardless of what the party itself believes in, regardless of what the party has said in the past.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>No. This evening I want to tell the sportsmen: If they pick up the United Party as supporters in any criticism they have against the National Government, they must bear this statement in mind, which is a very true one: If you have the United Party as a friend you do not need enemies. I say so, because if any agitation, or whatever else, is planned, the United Party will make a mess of it. It is the National Party&#x2019;s fundamental political philosophy which has been emphasized again by the Prime Minister this evening, i.e. that we in South Africa are developing here on a multi-national basis and not on a multi-racial basis. It is &#x201C;multi-national sport&#x201D; as opposed to &#x201C;multi-racial sport&#x201D;. Our Prime Minister emphasized it in April 1967, and he said it again today. What is the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint? In 1967 the United Party agreed passionately with the Prime Minister. I now quote from Hansard of 8th April, 1967 (Vol. 20, column 3998). This is what Sir de Villiers Graaff said at the time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Prime Minister has given us the statement on sport which I must say comes very close to the United Party&#x2019;s policy statements made in this House in the Appropriation debate. There may be a few minor differences in respect of internal policy, in that we are inclined to leave more to the discretion of the bodies that manage sport in South Africa, as it has been left to their discretion in the last 200 years.</block>

<p>That is the only difference in principle, Sir. He agrees that we should not participate in multi-racial sport, and I wish the hon. member for Johannesburg North would remember that. Now I want to quote what the hon. member for Yeoville said. That hon. member spoke almost like a National Party member when he made mention of the M.C.C. This is what he said on 8th February, 1967 (Vol. 19, column 926)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we want to invite the M.C.C., let us respect the right of the M.C.C. to choose their team.</block>

<p>We also say so. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We ask them to respect our rights to choose our team. If they were to insist that we should include non-Whites in our team, we would resent it.</block>

<p><span class="col_5051-5052" refersTo="page_1184"/>Sir, it was not National Party members who said that, but a United Party member. What do they say now? Over the week-end the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made a statement on sport. Here is the essential part of his statement, and I want hon. members to note how far he deviates from his 1967 policy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We should be prepared to consider a relaxation of any hindering enactments to facilitate the selection of mixed South African teams and to enable them to play in South Africa and abroad.</block>

<p>He has now come back completely to multi-racialism. Let me just give him the final proof of that. I quote from this morning&#x2019;s <i>Burger.</i> I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this: I do not. of course, know whether this report is correct, but he is sitting here in the House and he can tell us what the position is. In this morning&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> a report appears of an interview conducted by telephone with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The relevant portion of the report refers to an interview he conducted with a certain Paul Raffaele of Sydney in Australia. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In an exclusive interview with P.M. (the name of the radio programme). Sir de Villiers Graaff said that a boycott of South African sportsmen would only impede progress towards multi-racialism in South Africa. He spoke only a few minutes ago by telephone to Paul Raffaele in Sydney.</block>

<p>If that is not complete recognition of multi-racialism in sport, then I do not know what is.</p>

<p>I accept the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave Sapa a correction. I should like to know what that correction is, because if he did not say it, how does he get round this policy where he nevertheless said in a Press statement to the South African Press:</p>

<p>&#x201C;&#x2026; to facilitate the selection of mixed South African teams and to enable them to play in South Africa and abroad&#x201D;. This is now surely &#x201C;mixed teams- in South Africa.</p>

<p>No, first reply to the question about the U.P.&#x2019;s position. The trouble with the U.P. is that it has no political philosophy. They move from point to point.</p>

<p>But what did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition say in the House today. He said that he would allow the sports administrators to tell him how far he must go. I am amazed at the fact that a political leader in South Africa can go so far as to leave an important matter such as the race relations of his country in the hands of sports administrators alone. If they were to ask for a mixed South African team to play in South Africa he would concede to this. In other words, they have no policy; nevertheless the United Party accuses this side of the House of not having any principles. The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s explanation of our sports policy is one that ought to satisfy everyone. In addition it is also based on principles. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Prinshof said that there was a very great difference between their policy and ours in that theirs was a &#x201C;veelvolkige&#x201D; policy and ours a &#x201C;veelrassige&#x201D; policy. It seems to me that, whatever differences there may be. merely calling them by different names, does not make them so. It is quite clear from what the hon. the Prime Minister said that under their policy there can be a mixed South African Davis cup team chosen on merit. That is what is achieved under our policy, perhaps in a different way. The hon. the Prime Minister falls back on his words, but they have no meaning. The same applies to the Olympic team Under their policy a mixed Olympic team could be chosen. Indeed, if it is so simple to avoid having a mixed situation by calling it &#x201C;veelvolkig&#x201D;, then one wonders why the Nationalist Party continues with any of their social separation measures; because, strictly speaking, if you can overcome everything, if you can change a mixed situation into a non-mixed situation by calling it &#x201C;veelvolkig&#x201D;, why can it not be done in regard to social separation in all the other spheres in South Africa? We would be glad to hear from the hon. member for Prinshof on that point.</p>

<p><span class="col_5053-5054" refersTo="page_1185"/>Where we have had these important policy statements, one feels inclined to overlook some other important matters which are not directly in point. I do not think we can fail to bring one matter to the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister in regard to the recent handling of the plans for a tour by our South African cricket team to Australia. It seems pretty clear, and I hope the hon. the Minister of Sport will take the opportunity to make it clear, that the South African Cricket Association, in fact, asked to be allowed to select a team on merit in order to tour Australia. If the hon. the Minister of Sport would clarify the position, then I would know precisely where I stand. But the hon. the Minister may prefer to say it in his own time.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Very well. At any rate, it is quite clear to me that the South African Cricket Association, in dealing with the matter, asked that their request to the Government for such a trial, be resubmitted. What startles me about this, is that it should have been refused in the light of this new development in the Government&#x2019;s sports policy. In terms of the Government&#x2019;s sports policy, if a body insists that certain conditions be complied with, then the Government concedes the point. Apparently, if it is merely a request from your own association in order to facilitate their position in international sport, then the Government is unhelpful. I suggest that this is a ludicrous state of affairs. The same applies to the &#x201C;second-best&#x201D; request of the Cricket Association, in other words, to allow two non-White members to accompany the team. Now this is clear to me, and I hope the hon. the Minister will take us into his confidence, but if he does not want to, one can prove it up to the hilt if he is not prepared to discuss it: In fact this was only the second-best suggestion, which was put forward by them when the Government was not prepared to look at a method of choosing our best team on merit. That is even more startling in the light of the new Government policy. Even in the light of their old policy one would have thought they would have permitted it, because the statements of our tennis representatives to the Davis Cup meeting, made it perfectly clear that the Government had given permission for our Davis Cup team to be chosen on merit.</p>

<p>So it would be a complete somersault for them then to deny that right to the cricket team. I suggest that they did do a somersault and now they have done a further somersault.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to another matter which I think should be drawn to the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister. That is what is known as &#x201C;Waring&#x2019;s challenge&#x201D;, the challenge of the hon. the Minister of Sport to cricket people. Either the hon. the Prime Minister guided the hon. the Minister of Sport in issuing his challenge, or it is what they call in law, a &#x201C;frolic of his own&#x201D;.

<p>I suggest that the inference is completely clear that the hon. the Minister was quite prepared to allow this and certainly prepared to consider <span class="col_5055-5056" refersTo="page_1186"/>that there should be multi-racial sport at club level. He clearly showed a willingness to take this to the Cabinet. This proves the fact that this was an inference that can be drawn. I suggest that it implies clearly that the hon. the Minister of Sport believes that the Cabinet would consider the matter seriously for possible acceptance. The hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation smiles. The hon. the Minister reveals by his smile, and the other hon. member revealed by his interjection about calling their bluff, that he was playing politics. We politicians knew that he was playing politics, and I said in a statement that he was being childish. I think he was. But quite a large number of the public were misled. There was a hurry and a scurry and everybody from top to bottom were then sounded as to whether they would agree to this or to that. The hon. the Minister was playing politics and if I may say to him, because he is a rugby player of renown, in rugby parlance this was a piece of dirty play. [Interjections.] I am a referee and I know that to boo the referee is extremely bad form, but it is even worse form to play dirty. I have much sympathy for people who boo a player who plays dirty. I want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister whether this was done with his consent because if it was, I would like his explanation. If it was not done with his consent, I would like to report the hon. the Minister of Sport to him for indulging in petty politics in regard to a most important matter. I trust that the hon. the Minister of Sport or the hon. the Prime Minister will clarify the matter, because there is no doubt that great harm was done to our situation in international sport as a result of this. A great upset was caused amongst clubs locally, none of whom have asked for this. May I end by saying that United Party policy makes provision to relax our legislation when at the national level the sports bodies ask us to be allowed to take certain action. It does not contemplate in the slightest what goes on at lower levels and for anybody to suggest the contrary is to be wide of the mark in regard to our policy.</p>

<p>I heard exactly what the hon. member said. I now want to read out to the hon. member the first statement I made when the Cricket Board published their statement, which I had advised them not to publish because it would do a lot of harm to cricket in general. My statement was published in the newspapers and I will only read the last part of it. It read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Waring also pointed out that the South African Cricket Board of Control had on a number of occasions made it clear that it did not accept separate White and non-White cricket in South Africa, but only multi-racial cricket. This was diametrically opposed to Government policy.</block>

<p>The hon. member referred to my statement saying to the cricketers that if they say that they want multi-racial cricket at all levels I will take the matter to the Cabinet. I did not say this to the Cricket Association, but to the cricketers. I now want to read the cricketers&#x2019; statement. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We cricketers feel that the time has come for the expression of our views. We fully support the South African Cricket Association&#x2019;s application to include non-Whites on the tour of Australia if good enough and furthermore subscribe to merit being the only criterion on the cricket field.

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Before returning to a discussion of the position of the urban Bantu, there are one or two remarks I would like to make in connection with the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s sports policy. One has now had an opportunity of thinking deeply over it since it was released yesterday afternoon, and I must say that the more one thinks of it, the more complicated it seems. I can understand the problem of the hon. the Prime Minister. He has to try to satisfy his own people, for whom this is a very new departure and a big change, and at the same time he has to consider the interests of sportsmen in South Africa. My fear, quite frankly, is that he may fall between two stools and find that he has satisfied neither his own people nor sporting bodies overseas. I cannot help but think how much simpler it would have been if we could have persuaded the hon. the Prime Minister to accept the sports policy of this side of the House. Because of its simplicity and lack of complications, it would have been easily understood, and I believe would have solved most of the problems for him.</p>

<p>We are in the position that under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy, as I understand it, although they are not called mixed trials, there will in fact be what amounts to mixed trials in a very large number of sports. And also in those sports mixed teams will be allowed to represent us overseas and will be allowed to represent us here in South Africa when the Olympic Games take place in South Africa, if they do. Sir, the two sports that seem to be left out in the cold are rugby and cricket. Rugby has its own plans, and certain concessions have been made to it. I leave it there. It is possible that their position will not be unduly affected.</p>

<p>But the sport that seems to come off worst is cricket, strangely enough the sport at which we stand out most brilliantly in the sporting world today, compared with all other sports. We stand out in cricket perhaps even more than in rugby.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It is a matter of opinion, Sir. Perhaps the time will come when that hon. member will support me in this regard, if the present cricket tour is allowed to take place. Although certain concessions are made to cricket, my worry is that cricket may never be put in the position to enjoy it. He said that overseas teams will play games against non-White sides in South Africa, and they will be allowed to do so, but I wonder whether they will tour under those conditions. The hon. the Prime Minister mentioned yesterday the question of the Cricket Council. There are two bodies. There is the English Cricket Council which controls the sport in England, and there is the International, or is it the Commonwealth, Cricket Conference to which the various members who play international cricket are affiliated but to which I do not believe we belong at the moment, although they do lay down rules for their members. The English Cricket Council, through its secretary, Billy Griffiths, said that the final decision &#x201C;op &#x2019;n perskonferensie in die be-roemde &#x2018;Long Room&#x2019; van Lords bekend ge-maak is en het daaraan toegevoeg dat die raad die Suid-Afrikaanse Krieketvereniging in kennis gestel het dat geen verdere toets-reekse tussen Engeland en Suid-Afrika sal plaasvind nie tensy Suid-Afrikaanse krieket voortaan op veelrassige grondslag gespeel en sy spanne op di&#x00E9; grondslag gekies word&#x201D;.

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister is better informed than I am in that regard. But it does seem that on that basis there is not much chance of another visit by an M.C.C. side to South Africa and I do not know whether there is a chance of a South African side touring England. Therefore I want to conclude my remarks on the subject of sport by saying to the hon. the Prime Minister that no <span class="col_5061-5062" refersTo="page_1189"/>legislation is necessary to bring about changes which might be acceptable or which might offer a plan which would make it possible for us to continue in the field of international cricket. It is an administrative matter, a departmental matter in which he has the final say, and I would urge him very earnestly to give this matter further consideration. He tells me he consults with the cricket authorities concerned. I accept that. Perhaps further discussions may reveal some method by which it is possible that these very valuable connections could be retained.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>To sum up this sports matter now&#x2014;I take it the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has finished with it&#x2014;there are certain observations I want to make. In the first place, representations for the establishment of a board of sport have been made to me by many sportsmen. I want to say at once that I like the idea, but I do not want to commit myself at this stage. What I want to say at this stage, is that I shall continue receiving representations on the matter. I shall think the matter over and I shall consider it very seriously. It seems to me the appointment of such a board of sport, would have obvious advantages. The sportsmen who submitted the representations to me may be assured that they will be very seriously considered by the Government.</p>

<p>In the second place, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and I will just have to differ on this. He says he does not like my plan; he thinks it is going to cause many problems and solve few, if I understand him correctly. We will just have to differ on that. I have no illusions whatsoever about the fact that, whatever plan you adopt, you will encounter problems in the future. That goes without saying. Whether we adopt my hon. friend&#x2019;s plan or mine, we shall encounter a multitude of problems in the future, because we have a very complex situation to deal with here. The problems will be legion, but that does not mean that we should not do this. I on my part believe that my plan is based on principles. I believe that my point of departure is right. I on my part think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke too hastily. He put forward a half-baked thing which he had not considered in all its implications. I do not think he consulted about it, while I on my part consulted about it very widely. But I leave it at that now. It does not matter what he thinks of my plan, or what I think of his. What is important, however, is whether we want to do what is best for sport in South Africa, and I do not think there is a single hon. member opposite who will ever accuse me of not wanting to do my best, in the light that I have, for sport in South Africa. I want to give the hon. members the assurance that I see it in that light and that I shall act in that way. I want to tell hon. members that my door, as well as that of my colleague, the Minister of Sport, is open to sportsmen at all times. I want to tell hon. members that I very frequently consult with sportsmen. They know that they can come to me. The cricket people, the tennis people and the rugby people have been to see me. Since this Parliament commenced, all kinds of sports people have been to see me. They know that they will get a sympathetic hearing from me when they come to discuss their problems with me. We do not always see eye to eye, but we tell each other frankly where we differ with each other. All of us accept that we want to act in the best interests of sport.</p>

<p>The difference between the hon. member, sports people and me is just that I bear the responsibility for good order and peace in South Africa. I am responsible for handling the racial situation in South Africa. I have to take that responsibility into account in making decisions. With regard to my policy, my hon. friend said that I was not going to satisfy sports people abroad. We must understand each other very clearly on one thing. My point of departure is that I am not adopting a policy to appease the world, but that I am adopting a policy for the people of South Africa and for the situation as it develops in South Africa. I am not insensitive to the attitude of the outside world. I am perfectly prepared to take it into consideration, because only a fool would not take it into consideration. However, I am not prepared to lay down a policy which would satisfy the Anti-Apartheid Movement. I cannot and do not want to lay down a policy which would satisfy the Sports Council of Africa. I am not prepared to lay down a policy which would satisfy the communists. After all, my hon. friend knows what happens there. Western countries tell us that they have no objection to playing against us, or to our attending this or that sports meeting of theirs. They say their problem is that, if we attend, the communists say that they are not coming. Therefore they <span class="col_5063-5064" refersTo="page_1190"/>cancel our invitations. I can do nothing to prevent that. In cases where we have been kicked out, it has not, except in isolated instances, been the Western countries which took the initiative or which were in favour of it. It has been blatant blackmail by the communists. In the case of tennis, for instance, it was blatant blackmail, by the communists. I could mention so many examples of this.</p>

Then they cancelled our invitation and said we could not come because they could not guarantee the safety of our people. I can do nothing to prevent that. If the people of the West are so weak that they yield to these threats, I can do nothing about it, except to deplore it and to hope that the day will come that people will take a stand and will be prepared to take a stand.</p>

<p>Sir, let us now look at the Australian situation objectively. I have already mentioned the Gallup Poll figures. Eighty-five per cent of the people of Australia are prepared to play against a White South African cricket team. Nine per cent are not prepared to play against us. Are the 85 per cent going to yield to the 9 per cent? Are we reaching the stage where a handful of people are going to dictate to the vast majority what they are to do and what they are not to do? This is the question facing the Western world.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the British want to play rugby and cricket against us. Are they going to yield to the small group of trouble-makers? Sir, I do not want to criticize those countries. It is their own affair. They must decide whether they want to deny their law-abiding citizens those privileges or not. It is their own affair, but I want to make it very clear that if South Africa allows any sporting group to come to this country. I shall regard them as the guests of South Africa and I shall not allow any Dick, Tom and Harry to molest them.</p>

<p>In my opinion this is the course of action to be followed in that connection. I am grateful that, as far as this matter is concerned, I can also speak on behalf of my hon. friend opposite. This is a choice that has to be made by the Western world. Must we return to the jungle, and are individuals and vocal minorities to dictate what is to be done by the masses? If the majority of the Australians or the British say they want nothing to do with us, then I say: &#x201C;Very well. That is your business. You are free to decide that you do not want relationships with me.&#x201D; But the majority do want those relationships. My hon. friend says we must strengthen their hand. I want to strengthen their hand, because people have the idea, as I said yesterday, that our non-Whites are hemmed in here and that only our Whites enjoy the privilege of taking part in international sport. I want to make it quite clear that I wish the non-Whites of South Africa to have the same opportunity of taking part in sport on an international level.</p>

<p>When it comes to those people who are really interested in sport and who are not prepared to be intimidated by individuals like Hain and others, and those people who really have the interests of sport at heart, I believe that not only abroad, but locally as well, they are co-operating with me to make a success of this dispensation which I have announced, in spite of the problems I foresee.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that cricket was worse off than rugby. That is not so. They are in exactly the same boat. What applies to the one, applies to the other. Where cricket is worse off. is where it comes to the decision referred to by my hon. friend, a decision taken under pressure from the Wilson Government.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to put it very clearly to the hon. member that I discussed this very point with Mr. Jack Cheetham. I asked him: &#x201C;Does this decision of the Cricket Council&#x201D; &#x2014;to which the Leader of the Opposition referred&#x2014;&#x201C;mean that you must play interracial cricket?&#x201D; He replied: &#x201C;I am afraid not. Sir. I went into that question and they do not want inter-racial cricket. They want multi-racial cricket.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this does not refer to the team that is to play against Britain. It refers to the playing of cricket in South Africa. They have taken the liberty of dictating to us how we are to play in South Africa. The decision does not apply only to the team which is to play against them. Does the hon. member see the point? I think it is presumption of the worst kind to dictate to us and to say: &#x201C;Before you do this, that and the other in South Africa, we shall not play with you. We shall pick up our marbles and go then&#x201D;&#x2014;just like children. Surely this is the purest nonsense. I do not believe that giving way to people who take such presumptuous decisions is going to serve sport in any respect whatsoever. I want to repeat that cricket is not in a worse position than rugby as far as this is concerned. I trust that the Cricket Council will alter that decision which they took under pressure from the Wilson Government. I hope that the policy which has been announced, i.e. that, if the British come to this country, they will be able to play cricket against the Coloured people and the Bantu, will help them to reach that decision, but &#x201C;you can lead a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink; you can give a man a policy, but you cannot make him think&#x201D;. I therefore do not know what will become of it.</p>

<p>I now want to leave this point at that. In the light that I have, I have laid down certain guide-lines which can lead to the preservation of our traditional sport relationships. In spite of the problems existing in this connection, these may clear the air in future. I just want to put it very clearly once more, because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to it, that every branch of sport has its own distinctive character. What is valid for one, is not valid for the other, and we shall have to proceed within the framework of the guidelines I have laid down. We shall have to iron out the problems as we go along.</p>

However, I want to examine that aspect and receive representations. The details and the principle still have to be considered. All I can say about the principle is that the Government is sympathetically disposed towards it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I was very interested to hear this further statement by the hon. the Prime Minister, but we understand that this is to be the end of the discussion on the question of sport. In regard to the question of a sport advisory board, my leader asked the hon. the Prime Minister how this board would be constituted. In our party we have discussed the question of such a board to advise the Government on difficulties in connection with international sport, difficulties which are cropping up so frequently. One of the questions now is how this board would be constituted. In our view such a board ought to be constituted out of representatives of the separate sports associations and not merely be appointed by the Government. Consequently we shall be interested to learn what further information the hon. the Prime Minister can give us on this question once he has given it further consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister also said that it was a pity that my leader came out with his sports policy and said it was &#x201C;onbekook&#x201D;. But I want to say that even the horn the Prime Minister has to admit that our policy is a simple one. [Interjections.] It is very simple to understand. Against that no person who has so far expressed a view on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy, with the exception perhaps of the tennis spokesmen, could say that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy satisfied them and whether it is going to assist them to get into international sport. Everyone has to give it further consideration, because it is very complicated. For instance, let me raise one point. The English rugby team coming out here will be allowed to play a game against the Coloureds and against the Bantu. But which Bantu? Which Bantu nation is it going to play against?</p>

<p>Let me explain first. As I was saying, there are only three rugby bodies at present: The White Rugby Board the Coloured Rugby Board, and the Bantu Rugby Board. These are the only three rugby bodies existing in South Africa at the moment. Consequently arrangements will have to be made with the Coloured Rugby Board or with the Bantu Rugby Board, as the case may be. There are not, as has been suggested, 22 Bantu rugby boards, but only one.</p>

<p>Then there is another small matter, if the hon. member will allow me to raise it. Yesterday evening I had to leave before the time, and I informed the hon. the Leader of the Opposition accordingly. I want to express my regret about the words used in my absence by the hon. member for Pinelands, as reported to me by the Minister of Sport. I am sorry that the hon. member for Pinelands used those words, because in doing so he did not, in my opinion, serve the cause of sport or of anyone.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>At the present moment there is only one Bantu Rugby Board. It stands to reason that once the Transkei becomes independent, they are out of this altogether. Even if they want to form their own board before the time, that is their privilege. But at present I still have to deal with the situation as it is now. I do not think for one moment that the Transkei will form its own board; they will have nothing to gain at this stage by doing so.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister has explained that there are only three rugby boards at present. I raised this question because he might have seen that a prominent man in the rugby world has recommended that the Transkei should form its own union and as such play against international sides. He was surprised at the quality of the rugby in the Transkei. Mr. George Matanzima, the Minister of Justice of the Transkei, in the discussion last week in the Legislative Assembly said they wanted to have their own sports body. But they are not independent yet.</p>

<p>May I reply to you now? You can get another chance to speak after this. Let us look at it from a practical point of view and let us suppose the Transkei forms its own rugby board. In that event we shall have two Bantu <span class="col_5069-5070" refersTo="page_1194"/>rugby boards. If the White Rugby Board should then invite a team to come over, all other rugby boards will have to negotiate with the White Rugby Board if they want a game and it is up to the White Rugby Board to say whether such a game can be fitted into the tour. In other words, it will be an arrangement entirely between themselves. If the Transkei forms it own rugby board and they want to go and play anywhere in the world, it is their right to do so. There is nothing in their way.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we cannot go on in this way, by putting questions and answering them. I want to go over to another matter in regard to which we have not had any satisfactory reply. By this I do not suggest that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s reply in regard to sport has been satisfactory. However, I should like to go back to the problems we raised in connection with the Bantu policy of the Government, especially in regard to the urban Bantu. [Interjections.] We have not had any reply. I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister certain other questions which only he can answer. It is not only with the urban African I want to deal but I want to put certain other questions which only the hon. the Prime Minister can answer. I just want to say in reply to the Deputy Minister and other speakers on the Government side that it is no good saying that their policy has a moral content which satisfies the outside world. The outside world is not satisfied with a policy which may only satisfy a minority of the Africans. What the outside world is concerned with is the majority of the Africans living outside of the reserves who have no rights. Sir, Chief Kaiser Matanzima, in his speech before his Congress the other day, mentioned that they were no longer going to be satisfied with second class citizenship, and that is all that the Africans living in the reserves have&#x2014;second class citizenship. They have not got proper citizenship. It is no good the hon. the Prime Minister saying to us on the advice of his Ministers that there are no unemployed in the Transkei. Chief Matanzima himself in the same address referred to the unemployment in the Transkei and expressed his dissatisfaction with the labour position.</p>

<p>Sir, whether it is justified or not, the Prime Minister knows that there has been a clash between the Chief Minister of the Transkei and the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and that does affect relations in the reserves. The continued presence of the White entrepreneur in the reserves is important. The Prime Minister has invited entrepreneurs to go to the reserves and to invest money there on an agency basis. But, Sir, after the speech of Chief Kaiser Matanzima, and in the light of what was almost an invitation extended by the hon. the Prime Minister last year to the Bantu reserve leaders to approach him and to negotiate for independence, there is a feeling that the pace towards independence is being quickened.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The mere fact that the report has appeared gives uncertainty to the people living in the area. The Prime Minister last year made a special announcement in this House in which he indemnified industrialists who established themselves in the homelands on an agency basis against any loss suffered by them as a result of a Black homeland becoming independent and taking political action against such industrialists before the expiry of their agency contract. That was done in order to encourage industrialists to go into the reserves. With this feeling <span class="col_5071-5072" refersTo="page_1195"/>that there is now a quickening in the pace towards independence, those traders and industrialists who are already established in the reserves, not on an agency basis but on their own account, are worrying as to what their position will be. I want to ask the Prime Minister if he will not give the same assurance to the people who are already established there and who have remained in the reserves, especially in the Transkei, without offering their businesses to the Government, that if they stay on and suffer any loss through any political action by an independent homeland Government, they will be indemnified in the same way as a White entrepreneur who goes there on an agency basis. Sir, this is important because if they do not get an assurance of this nature, they may have to consider the advisability of offering their businesses to the Government now, as they can do in terms of the White Paper issued some years ago. They can offer their businesses to the Adjustment Committee. All they seek, Sir, is some assurance, some guarantee, from the Prime Minister in the same terms as the assurance which he gave to industrialists who go in on the agency basis. The hon. the Prime Minister was quite definite in his statement as to the persons to whom indemnity would be given and I would like him to give the same assurance to these other people.</p>

<p>Sir, the Whites in the Transkei are naturally very concerned about the relations between the Government of the Republic and the Transkeian Government because relations have always been good between the Whites and the Blacks Outsiders visiting the Transkei have often remarked upon the peaceful nature of the country and the manner in which the different races have co-operated. This has been due largely to the good understanding between the traders and the Bantu over the years gone by and also the good understanding between the administrators and the Bantu. If there is any rift in these good relations, Sir, it will be the responsibility of this Government.</p>

<p>The task of maintaining these good relations will now fall on the shoulders of the few traders who are left there but mainly on the officials of the civil service, of the Railways, of the Post Office, of the Department of Road Motor Transport and especially the Police. All these officials will now have to be more careful in carrying out their duties, more especially since there has now been a complaint from Chief Matanzima about the discourtesy shown to his people by some officials. I am sure that they are in the minority but I am also just as sure that there are probably some grounds for complaint. As I say, the attitude of these officials is most important from the point of view of maintaining good relations. The ordinary administrative officials, generally known as the civil servants, in the Departments of Justice, Education and Roads and the other departments handed over to the Transkeian Government&#x2014;have an inducement to stay on in the Transkei and to carry out their duties there to the advantage of the Republic as a whole in that they are given a special territorial allowance and also a housing allowance. As I say, this is an inducement to other civil servants outside the Transkei to go there. But, Sir, the officials of the Police, the Railway Administration, Road Motor Transport and the Post Office, do not have this inducement, and I submit that they come into more direct contact with the Bantu. They serve the Bantu more directly and they have more onerous duties, and I say it is wrong that they are not put on the same footing as the other officials. Sir, I have raised this question with different Ministers on various occasions, but it seems to me that the Minister of Transport in charge of Railways dominates the Cabinet on this issue because the Minister of Finance was very sympathetic and he in fact did pay this allowance to his audit officials.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member who has just sat down, received a reply to certain of the matters he touched upon here, and it is not necessary for me to follow up on what he said in that connection. Sir, the attitude of the Opposition is an interesting one. They want to create a general psychosis of uncertainty in regard to a variety of subjects, but particularly in regard to the Bantu policy of the Government. What emerged clearly here this morning, is something I can describe as the obvious disappointment of the hon. member for Transkei when he found that a report in the newspapers, which was important to him, was incorrect. He suddenly saw certain possibilities in the fact that this incorrect report was published. Sir, the leadership of the National Party in this country and of this country is clear and certain, and the attempts of the United Party to create a psychosis of uncertainty will always remain stillborn. On 9th February the hon. member for Transkei made a speech on the non-White policy of the United Party in which he made certain remarks, and other speakers have spoken along similar lines. I should like to contrast it with the speech made yesterday or the day before yesterday by the hon. member for Yeoville, when he discussed the Bantu policy of the Government. On that occasion the hon. member for Yeoville said that the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development could be a good policy if it was feasible. He said that if it had been possible to carry it out in practice, the United Party would have had to take a second look at it. He said that in principle&#x2014;this is the message his words conveyed to me&#x2014;he had nothing against that policy; the problem he had with the policy was that it simply could not work out in practice. In other words, as I understood the hon. member for Yeoville, if it were possible for the policy of the National Party to work in practice, and if he could believe that it could work, hon. members on that side of the House would have been in favour of that policy. This is a point of departure which is in conflict with the standpoint of the hon. member for Transkei, as it appears from his Hansard of 9th February, where he said in regard to the Bantu Homelands Constitution Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We reject this Bill because in the first place it is folly to embark on a policy which will divide South Africa into eight, nine or ten separate states, leaving the so-called White South Africa ringed with a horse-shoe of foreign states, which the Government hopes will be friendly towards us but which may in fact be hostile.</block>

<p>In other words, he objected to this policy on principle, and the hon. member for Yeoville had a practical objection to the policy. I wonder whether hon. members opposite would not perhaps like to thrash out the matter among themselves, and tell us whether their objection to the National Party policy is one of principle or whether their objection is merely because they believe it to be impracticable.</p>

<p>In this House we have on various occasions now debated the matter of the urban Bantu, and the Leader of the Opposition, so it would seem to me, would like the House to return time and again to the position of the urban Bantu. It would seem to me that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has suddenly overnight begun to have confidence in this policy in regard to the urban Bantu. The United Party&#x2019;s policy in regard to the urban Bantu is quite definitely one of the weakest points in the United Party programme of policies. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition feels that he can successfully satisfy the urban Bantu with a few things. He says: &#x201C;We must give them a stake in the country,&#x201D; so that they can feel that they have something to lose if things go wrong. And he feels that he can solve this problem by giving the Bantu proprietary rights in the first place, and a better family life in the second. Now I have no doubt whatsoever that the United Party has the wrong impression altogether if it thinks that there is any temporary solution, even in that direction.</p>

<p>The United Party has no solution to the problem of the urban Bantu if it thinks that that is the solution. The United Party denies that the non-Whites as well will one day ask: We want to develop to our full potential; our full national consciousness must be developed; we also want what everyone else in the world has; we also want the right to vote and to be able to elect a government on an equal basis. [Interjection.] I must interrupt what I am saying <span class="col_5075-5076" refersTo="page_1197"/>to inform the hon. member for Turffontein, who is putting a question to me in regard to the Coloureds, that he has already had an invitation from this side of the House to discuss the Coloureds. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to discuss the Coloureds we will do so but we are now discussing the Bantu. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition denies that the non-Whites will want the franchise. The perfectly simple question is just this: Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition think that it is possible for the United Party to keep on denying the national aspirations of the non-White peoples of South Africa?</p>

<p>There are two basic differences in intention between the National Party and the United Party in regard to our policy towards the non-Whites. The National Party policy is geared to continual differentiation, to making distinctions since we want, on a long-term basis, to afford the non-Whites every possible opportunity. The United Party policy is geared to continual discrimination. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on what grounds, practical or moral, he is able to say that it is right to give the Bantu eight White representatives in the House of Assembly and six senators in the Senate? On what grounds can this be practically and morally justified? On what grounds does he think that it will in the short term be able to satisfy the non-Whites. Every non-White who comes to this Government and asks this Government to be allowed to develop to the full as a citizen of the country, will not receive a reprimand from this Government, a slap in the face, but the United Party wants to give the non-Whites a slap in the face and they want to keep on doing so in years to come.</p>

<p>In this House we have heard of the Black Power and Brown Power movements which are developing, and I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this? Does he not think that with his policy, which will be placing an airtight lid on the non-White peoples of South Africa, the only way in which the non-Whites will be able to make any progress under his policy will be to organize themselves into a Black Power movement? I want to ask hon. members on that side of the House whether they have ever considered whether their policy will not only be the breeding ground, if that policy is to be put into operation, for non-Whites to organize themselves into Black Power movements. Surely it is very clear that this is in fact precisely where it must lead to. But we know the United Party. They are people who give in easily; they are people who are unable to adhere to any principles, because that Party is not based on any principle. Now we have this problem with that Party: We definitely believe that that Party has already established the basis of something the end of which can only be a Black government over the whole of South Africa. We note in this yellow booklet of the United Party: &#x201C;The answer, you want it we have it&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We have now, since yesterday, heard so much about multiracialism in this country that I am now becoming afraid to talk about multi-nationalism. In regard to the sports policy, so much was said about multi-racialism that we kept as far away from multi-nationalism as the devil from holy water. The hon. member for Pretoria Central said here that we were actually most disappointed when we heard that there were no grounds for the Press statement that the Ciskei had said that they wanted their independence in two years&#x2019; time. Allegations of that kind are scandalous. Does the hon. member not know that ours is the Party that does not want the Bantu to ask for independence? Does he not know that we are opposed both in principle and in practice to the attainment of sovereign independence and the fragmentation of South Africa? I am surprised that the hon. member could make such an allegation.</p>

<p>I do not want to focus the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister on the urban Bantu in the White areas, but on the cities which are being established under the leadership of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration within the Bantu areas. I want to come back to the Ciskei, which the hon. member for Transkei was discussing a moment ago. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this Government is able to supply, under the policy which it has established, the many un-employed people who are at this stage in the Ciskei area with work. This would apply to the Transkei area as well. We know that Chief Matanzima said in this <span class="col_5077-5078" refersTo="page_1198"/>regard that the Government must stop sending people, who have no work, out of the Republic and settling them in the Transkei. This could be said even more emphatically of the Ciskei.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. the Prime Minister has full knowledge of the position there. I do not know whether the hon. the Prime Minister knows that the target of Mdantsane is a quarter million, while at the moment there are officially 80 000 or 90 000 people there, and unofficially 125 000. Does the hon. the Prime Minister know that the target at Dimbaza. which is the place to which Bantu from the Coloured area are being transferred and which is situated on the line between Humansdorp and Burgersdorp is 40 000? Does he know that a new township is being laid out at Gulu, the target of which is also 40 000? This great concentration of Bantu, many of whom are entirely without work, creates a very great problem. Many of them have been moved across the line of the Coloured area to that division.</p>

<p>There is something else I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister. I then want to suggest what could be done there. The East London harbour has been neglected to such an extent over the years, and particularly in recent years, that it is difficult to credit it. I should like to quote to the hon. the Prime Minister a few statistics in regard to the harbour. I shall be brief. In 1955 the East London harbour handled one million tons. Up to 1969 this increased to 7 million tons. In 1969-&#x2019;70 it dropped again to H million tons. The decrease of one million tons handled there is due to the failure to export maize which should have gone through that harbour. Durban, on the contrary, has increased its total from seven million tons in 1955 to 24 million tons in 1970. Apart from that there are always a lot of ships lying outside Durban harbour, just as is the case in Cape Town, while only approximately 60 per cent of the capacity of the East London harbour is being utilized. In addition, Durban handles 57 per cent of all the shipments, while all the other harbours handle so much less. I want to point out that the Ciskei-Transkei complex, which has to be the show-window of the Bantustans the Government is establishing, is dependent upon the East London harbour. We have made repeated representations to the hon. the Minister of Transport to make the tariff between East London and the Witwatersrand equal to that which applies between Durban and the Witwatersrand, to such an extent that East London will also be able to attract additional shipping. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister to the fact that one of the best suppliers of labour for the Bantu one can find is perhaps a harbour and rail system which will bring a great deal more material to the East London harbour and will result in larger imports and exports at East London. Since the new Iscor was not established at East London, I should like the hon. the Prime Minister to give particular attention to the question of whether it is not worthwhile having a completely new harbour at East London with better facilities for dry docks, tankers and everything pertaining to that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not talking about the Railway debate. I am talking about the supply of work to the Bantu within their areas, which we are now discussing at this stage. I am talking about the supply of work to Bantu who are idle in the Transkei with its population of more than two million. I am also talking about those who are idle in the Ciskei and of the large areas which are being established by the Department of Bantu Administration with a view to development. I do not know whether the hon. the Prime Minister knows what the situation is in regard to the employment of Bantu in the urban areas which are being established within the Bantu areas. I do not know whether he is aware that a large proportion of these people have not been employed. The position is simply being allowed to continue. This is due to the policy in terms of which Bantu are being removed from the Western Cape with a view to the Black-Brown ratio. As long as this policy is continued there will be an excess of Bantu labour in that division, dissatisfaction among the Bantu in this connection, and the endless and boundless incidence of cattle and other theft. I want to draw the specific attention of the hon. the Prime Minister to this matter and ask them to go into it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what I want to say now, I am not saying out of discourtesy. Hon. members <span class="col_5079-5080" refersTo="page_1199"/>know that I do not do that kind of thing. However, I want to make an appeal to hon. members not to discuss local matters with me under this Vote. I shall listen to what they have to say. It is my duty to do so while my Vote is being discussed. Local matters may be discussed thoroughly under other Votes, where they really belong I am just saying this in general.</p>

<p>As far as the Eastern Cape is concerned, I may just mention that I am from the Eastern Cape. To tell the truth, I think the best people in South Africa come from there. Be that as it may, I have a very soft spot for East London. Hon. members know that with the establishment of the third Iscor, I personally felt very strongly that if it was in any way economically possible, it should be established there. As a matter of fact, I called for a special investigation. This special investigation was instituted in order to determine whether, in spite of everything, it was not possible to establish it there. That is how strongly I felt about the matter. But the economic considerations were overwhelmingly against this. Consequently I had to allow myself to be guided by them. The hon. member is aware of the fact that in the Berlin complex and other complexes in East London a great deal has been done, as regards both water supply and the provision of an infrastructure, to encourage industries there. I want to state it as my standpoint here, a standpoint of which my colleagues are aware, and which is in fact the standpoint of the Government, that optimal development of that area must take place. But one is restricted by certain factors. It is not necessary to discuss those factors now. I want to state it as my standpoint here that if it is economic, and all things being equal&#x2014;even if they are not altogether equal&#x2014;preference should be given to the East London area. This is essential, for very good reasons.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei put a question to me in regard to the White traders in the Transkei. He wanted to know whether I would give them certain undertakings. It is not necessary for me to give them certain undertakings. The hon. member for Transkei is aware of the fact that they are afforded adequate protection in the White Paper dealing with them.</p>

<p>I am talking about after independence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If that position develops after independence, I will be prepared to discuss the matter with them. The hon. member knows that it has been made possible for them to sell. They have not been left high and dry. They know precisely what their problems in that connection are. Their case is covered in the White Paper. The hon. member is aware of the fact that a special adjustment committee has been appointed to take over the interests of the Whites there. This is the so-called adjustment committee of which the hon. member is aware. At this juncture it is not necessary to go further than is necessary. If problems crop up in future, I am prepared to discuss those problems with these people and give a decision. However, I see no need whatsoever at this stage to take any further decision in that regard. These people are organized and if they want to make representations to the Government in any connection, they can make them through my colleague, the hon. the Minister, and those representations will receive my closest attention.</p>

<p>Arising out of what I said by way of an interjection, I am just pointing out again that, according to a report in all the newspapers this morning, the Ciskei have asked for their independence in 1973. I have been informed that no such resolution was adopted in the Ciskei. What the Ciskei did in fact resolve was to request representative government as the Transkei has at present. That is something entirely different to independence. A statement in that regard, so I have been informed, will be made in the course of the day.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet, there are a few matters I want to deal with. In passing I want to refer to the press reports by unnamed persons which have emanated from Zambia. Of course, I do not feel myself called upon to reply to press reports by unnamed persons. If the unnamed person has said that what I said here was a fabrication, it is obvious that the letters from which I quoted must have been written by Father Christmas. Then I do not know either how it came about that my envoy, a few Saturdays ago, met the President of Zambia, on invitation, at Chipata, not even in Lusaka. Then I do not know either how it came about that my envoy was invited to go to Lusaka. Then I cannot understand that. In any case, I do not want to react to what unnamed persons have <span class="col_5081-5082" refersTo="page_1200"/>said. I shall give my considered reaction if and when the President of Zambia himself discusses this matter.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to another press report which appeared this morning, according to which I allegedly committed a breach of confidence. I want to make it very clear that this is by no means a confidential matter. I committed no breach of confidence whatsoever. I have knowledge of many confidential matters in regard to Africa and the world. I have never yet, nor do I intend doing so in my public career, committed any breach of confidence whatsoever. I have never yet been guilty of that. Nor do I intend doing so. Those people, wherever they may be in the world, whose secrets have been entrusted to me, may be certain that these secrets are absolutely safe and that I shall commit no breach of such confidence. This matter concerns the particularly important interests of Southern Africa. I think all hon. members will agree with me that it was necessary for me to handle this matter in the way I did.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet, I also want to say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred during the course of this debate to the urban Bantu. I furnished him with certain replies. We have, over the years, debated this matter across the floor of this House. It seems to me now that we will have to go on debating this matter across the floor of this House for many years to come. If we were to devote too much time to debating this matter under my Vote, I think we would run the risk of subsequently being forced to ask the Chairman to put the Vote of my colleague, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and my Vote simultaneously. Then we would simply deal with the two Votes simultaneously.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that he gets no satisfaction, I can tell him that he does. The difference of course is that my hon. friend is on the Opposition side and my colleague and I are of the Government. The two of us agree on these matters. We will simply have to agree to differ on this score, for please note, this Government is not there to satisfy the Opposition. It would of course be the wrong approach for my hon. friend to adopt that attitude.</p>

<p>But in that connection I just want to make certain observations. I have already told the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that, as far as local facilities are concerned, we are, to the best of our ability and taking into consideration the finances at our disposal, meeting the needs of those people. I have not yet had the opportunity of seeing these things for myself, but I have heard a great deal about them. I have heard, not only from my own people, but also from foreign visitors who visited me in my office, that the facilities which have been provided in the Bantu areas for recreational and other purposes, are unique. I have heard from eminent people in the world that they have seen facilities in Soweto, Umlazi and other places which they envy and which they would like to see in their own countries for their own people. We are aware that these people must have those facilities and that it is a good thing to give them those facilities. We shall, as I have said, taking into account the circumstances and the finances at our disposal, provide those facilities. To sum up again, if what my friend has in mind for these people are political rights in Parliament, that possibility can be ruled out. We have argued this matter time and again, and therefore I do not want to use the time of the House for that purpose again now. When it comes to rights, those people are entitled to local authority rights, and that they already have. Prior to 1961 these people had local authority rights in the form of advisory committees, committees which were partially elected and partially appointed. But my hon. friend is also aware of the fact that in 1961 the then Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, felt that they should be given something more than mere advisory committees. Thus the 1961 Act made provision for Bantu urban councils which consisted entirely of elected members, elected therefore by the inhabitants, to function within the area of the local authority in question, and to which certain powers could be entrusted or delegated by the local authority in question&#x2014;in other words, a statutory body which, in my humble opinion, satisfies the need existing among the Bantu for local government. City or town councils may, as I have said, transfer certain powers of a local nature to these councils. This is in fact being done.</p>

<p>On a local level, as I say, these people therefore have representation. That is the position as it is today.

I shall listen to what they have to say then.</p>

<p>In passing I also want to draw attention to the standpoint which is often adopted by hon. members opposite in regard to the so-called detribalized Bantu, the Bantu who are supposedly suspended in mid-air. I do not pretend to be an authority in this field. But I grew up on the borders of the Transkei; I have been interested in these people, in the Bantu in general, all my life. I have discussed this matter widely with authorities on the Bantu and with the Bantu themselves as far as it was possible to do so. I was told that there is no such thing in South Africa as a detribalized Bantu. In fact, it is from the nature of the case not possible for a Bantu to become detribalized. To tell the truth, I do not know one who has not remained loyal to their language; I do not know one who has not remained loyal to his particular tradition.</p>

<p>He will, according to their customs, become a member of one of those two groups. Surely the hon. member knows that as well as I do. But in this connection I also want to refer to the Bantu Citizenship Act. These people are not, therefore, suspended in mid-air, but are citizens of some or other homeland. One need only talk to these people to find that even if they have never yet seen their chief, they know precisely who he is; they may not have seen him, but they know who he is and they speak of him with great appreciation. This has been my experience, and I have no doubt that it has also been the experience of those hon. members opposite who know the Bantu.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the reproach which is levelled in regard to consultation. On local authority level there is already the closest consultation between the Bantu advisory councils and the local authorities. On the national level there is also the widest consultation between the hon. the Minister and the leaders of the various Bantu peoples; there is also consultation with me. The opposite side has on occasion levelled the reproach that we speak only of consultation with foreign Bantu; in fact, one of the English language newspapers published an article in which the question was asked, &#x201C;What about our own Bantu?&#x201D; Let me say it again: During the past three/four years there has been far more consultation, on a high level, with the actual leaders of the Bantu than there was for decades prior to that. Do you know why hon. members opposite are annoyed with us in this connection? They are annoyed because we do not want to consult with some or other avowed leftist. They are angry at us because we talk to the real, the natural, the proper leaders of the Bantu. That is what it is all about. [Interjections.] This applies in particular to my hon. friend, the member for Houghton, who has grown old together with me in this House.</p>

<p>The relationship between the hon. member for Houghton and myself is the same as that of the lift attendant who behaved rather grumpily towards an old lady in the lift. When she asked him whether he always behaved grumpily towards ladies, he replied: &#x201C;No, only towards young ladies&#x201D;. In any case, the Citizenship Act ensures that no one need be suspended in mid-air. On a local level, as I have said, there is consultation with the local authorities, while on the national level there is all the necessary consultation which should take place from time to time.</p>

<p>Let us now take the case of the Transkei when it comes to exercising political rights. Hon. members are aware that Transkeian Bantu living and working outside the Transkei are able to participate in elections <span class="col_5085-5086" refersTo="page_1202"/>in the Transkei; they can be registered there in order to participate in elections there. The question is of course, because they must have themselves registered before they can vote there, whether or not they are interested. It was a matter of great importance to me whether or not these people attached value to the fact that they could be registered in the Transkei, in spite of the fact that they do not live or work there. Consequently I called for the figures, and these indicate to me that within the Transkei, in round figures, 661 000 voters are registered, and outside the Transkei, 246 000.</p>

<p>But now we come to the question of land, and in dealing with the question of land, I want to leave a problem in the lap of my hon. friend, the Leader of the Opposition, for him to solve. I think he owes it to his party and to the country to adopt a standpoint in regard to this matter. I have said that I am not, from the point of view of principle, prepared to concede that Black people can get land-ownership rights in White areas, and that Whites can get proprietary rights in Black areas. This to me is a matter of principle. I want the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to repeat that statement he made in haste, if he meant it, for to my mind it was an outrageous thing to say. If it was a mistake, I am prepared to accept it as such. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said by way of interjection that he saw no objection to any foreign worker who comes to work here, purchasing land in White South Africa. [Interjection.] Yes, he said it by way of interjection. I do now know whether he was over hasty in saying that. I should like to give him an opportunity of expressing a well-considered opinion in that regard, because as it stands now, the Rhodesian Bantu, the Malawians and any foreign worker can purchase land here.</p>

<p>I want to lay a second problem in the lap of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But they had it before that time, and it was transferred from time to time. That Act was passed in 1913. I now want to know whether it is the policy of that side of the House that Whites should be given land-ownership rights in Bantu areas indiscriminately. It is important to know this.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I want to leave a third problem in the lap of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The Bantu (Urban Areas) Act of 1923, which was handled by General Smuts personally in this House, initially contained a provision which would have granted Bantu proprietary rights in the White areas. That provision appeared in the original Urban Areas Act of 1923.</p>

<p>I am talking about General Smuts now. In 1923 General Smuts provided in that Act that Bantu would be granted proprietary rights <span class="col_5087-5088" refersTo="page_1203"/>in White areas. There was fierce opposition from General Hertzog and his people. General Smuts then deleted that provision from the Bantu (Urban Areas) Act of 1923 and accepted that Bantu would not be granted land-ownership rights in White areas. I should like to know from the Opposition whether they want to return to the standpoint adopted by General Smuts in 1923 before General Hertzog convinced him that it was wrong. I think we can conduct a fruitful debate on these aspects.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister put certain questions to the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the right of the Bantu to purchase land. What I find strange is that the hon. gentleman puts this question and at the same time refers to what happened previously, as part of the history of South Africa. But, Sir, I do not really want to refer to South African history; I want to refer to what happened only last week. I want to refer to a speech made by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development. He made a speech in Kroonstad, and what did he say on that occasion? He said that if someone like Chief Kaiser Matanzima, or any other Bantu, wanted additional land in South Africa, after we had met our obligations under the 1936 settlement in terms of which a certain quantity of land had to be given to the Bantu, they would have to purchase that land themselves. I should immediately like to put this question to the hon. the Prime Minister: If he is so opposed to the idea that certain responsible Bantu, as the Opposition put it, should in fact have the right to own property in White areas, why does the hon. the Deputy Minister then say that if those people want additional land, they will have to purchase it in South Africa? I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether he differs with his Deputy Minister. Was the Deputy Minister speaking without his permission? Did he not have the Prime Minister&#x2019;s approval? But the hon. the Prime Minister put these questions to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and I think the right thing would be for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who has the replies to them, to furnish those replies himself.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. gentleman is also concerned about the question of land. The party on that side accepts the permanency of the Bantu in our urban areas. They are setting aside separate residential areas for them here. But if one has set aside separate residential areas for these people&#x2014;and this will remain the position in South Africa <i>ad infinitum</i>&#x2014;and if they are living in those areas as a group, as they lived near Johannesburg under President Kruger at one time where they were given proprietary rights, then I cannot understand the logic of hon. members on the opposite side if they are not prepared to give those rights to certain responsible Bantu who are permanent residents in our White urban areas.</p>

<p>But the hon. the Prime Minister has already intimated in his speech that he is going to give this House some information in regard to certain new developments in connection with the Coloured population. The Prime Minister promised that he was going to tell us what forms of contact there would be between us and the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. You see, Sir, there is no other matter in this country in regard to which there is greater confusion than the political future of the Coloureds in our political constellation. The multi-national principle can only be of significance if every race group is entirely separate, and as we see it, it is impossible to have every race group entirely separate. Then, too, it is essential even if they are entirely separate, to have contact between the various races. But it seems to us that, even if they are entirely separate and there is that contact, it does not necessarily mean the end of discrimination under the policy of the National Party. The greatest danger we see in this principle of multinationalism is that it has inherent in itself the furtherance of conflicting nationalisms.</p>

<p>South Africa has over the years, conventionally, developed another approach to the Coloured population, and has done so in a natural way. That approach can be summed up by saying that we, the Whites, want the Coloureds as close as possible to the White group. But it does not in any way mean that we expect the Coloureds to lose their identity, or we ours, under those circumstances. So, when the circumstances of South Africa are looked into, it is very clear that we cannot allow a separate Coloured state to be established in this country. But we should like to know from the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon whether he agrees with some people in his Cabinet, and whether he agrees with certain elements outside this House that are well disposed to his party, whether he agrees with that idea that a separate Coloured state should be established in South Africa. I want to refer the hon. the <span class="col_5089-5090" refersTo="page_1204"/>Prime Minister to speeches which he himself made. The hon. gentleman said on a previous occasion that he was not in favour of it, and that it was not practical politics to establish a separate Coloured state in South Africa. The hon. gentleman reiterated in 1966 that the roads of the Coloureds and the Whites should be divergent ones. At a later stage he intimated that the Whites and the Coloureds should enter the future together, as the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs also said last year. But last year, at the National Party congress, the hon. the Minister of Defence made it very clear that he was not in favour of a policy of a separate state for the Coloureds. The reasons he mentioned were that we had progressed too far along the road of pluralism, that we had the Coloureds with us, near us in their own residential areas, and that it was impossible for them to establish a state for them. Thereupon the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development made the next speech when he addressed a conference of his own party on the Rand, and what did he say on that occasion? He said: Recognize the Coloureds as an inherent, separate nation-in-the-making, and then you realize that they also have a course and a destination of their own, not closer to that of the Whites, but away from it. Then the hon. the Minister said that the consequences of multi-nationalism help us to see clearly the own separate destinations of the Bantu peoples. And the motivation for these statements of his was that there were numerous peoples who spoke the same language and adhered to the same faith, but who were nevertheless separate peoples, such as the Germans, the Austrians, the Spanish-speaking people in South America, and the English-speaking people of Australia and New Zealand. The obvious deduction one must make from that is that these people do not have a separate existence either, unless they have their own separate territory. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration whether he means that although the Coloureds speak Afrikaans and English, although in their traditions and conventions they remain as close as possible to those of the Whites, they will not be able to occupy their full-fledged place in South Africa unless we give them a separate state? And if that is not his attitude, what is the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s attitude then? And while I am dealing with him, I also want to ask the hon. the Minister of Information something.

<p>We have an interesting phenomenon here. In all fairness the Prime Minister asked questions in regard to the subject the Opposition itself elected to argue about all morning. He put fair questions to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, but the Leader did not rise to reply. The hon. member for Newton Park rose and floundered about for a while and eventually, after spending five minutes in an attempt to reply to the Prime Minister, said that he could not go any further because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had not replied; but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not rise to give the replies. Sir, I am afraid that something has been left in his lap which he cannot get rid of.</p>

<p>As with all the other population groups, we also gave the Coloured population group a new dispensation in South Africa. I think that, with what we have given them, we have also given back to them their self-respect and their sense of human worth. Today the Coloureds are no longer the political foundlings of the Whites. We have set them on their own feet to do those things which people must do for themselves and their people. We have given them political rights for the first time in history. For the first time in history the Coloureds in South Africa have been given work to do for their own people. Today the Coloured population is to a very large extent being governed by its own people. They are governing their own rural area. They are responsible for the social services for their own people. Today it is the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Council which is responsible for Coloured pensions, and no longer the White Government. It is the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Council itself which is responsible for education in every sphere. If there was one sphere in which the Coloureds were bitterly neglected, it was the sphere of education, particularly by that Party in all the years they were in power. In the Provincial Council of the Cape, they were in power from 1910 to 1954. They are the people who neglected the Coloureds in that sphere. Today the Coloureds are, on all levels, controlling their own education.</p>

<p>I want to say that there is little which will not, in due course, be transferred to the Coloureds. I can think of scarcely any department which they will not, in due <span class="col_5091-5092" refersTo="page_1205"/>course, take over. There are a few exceptions. It does not seem to me that they will be able to take over the Departments of Defence or of Foreign Affairs. I think that these are the only two they will not be able to take over. As far as those matters are concerned, links will be established. I do not want to anticipate the hon. the Prime Minister, because he gave us an undertaking at the outset that he was going to speak about these links and to inform us as to the extent to which progress has been made with these links. From time to time there will have to be talks, and there will have to be round-table talks, because we are dealing here with people. The problem of human relationships cannot be solved, because it is a perpetual problem which one has to deal with from day to day and from time to time.</p>

<p>Normally we talk about separate development, for the Coloureds as well. It is not the policy of the National Party to give the Coloureds a separate state. They are not going to get one. The hon. member wants to make a case of this. A statement was issued by the Cabinet to the effect that the policy of the National Party did not include a separate state for Coloureds. That is why I want to suggest this morning that we do not in future talk about separate development for the Coloureds. We shall talk about parallel development. Because the Coloureds are never going to get a separate state, the development we envisage for the Coloureds is in fact parallel development.</p>

<p>I want to lay it at the door of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in particular that there is no such thing as petty apartheid.</p>

<p>All steps which have been taken and are being taken, are taken to preserve good relationships. It is a fact that there are vandals on both sides of the colour line. It is the duty of the State to protect those vandals against themselves. The decent and civilized people on both sides of the colour line will not clash, because people who have self-respect, respect one another. These steps are therefore being taken to protect the vandals against themselves. As I have said, we have created a new dispensation for the Coloureds.</p>

<p>What is the United Party doing? What prospects are they holding out for the Coloureds with the representation they want to give the Coloureds in this Parliament? The United Party are holding out to them the prospect of what we have already had for 100 years in this country, i.e. integration. There used to be political integration between Whites and Coloureds. There used to be no separate residential areas, and no Immorality Act. I want to tell hon. members today that integration has failed. The Coloureds made no progress, they retrogressed. They are the most neglected group of people in this country. That is what became of them under the system of integration. Do you know where they ended up? They were only given recognition on polling day, and after the election no further mention of them was made. They ended up in the backward areas and the slums of South Africa. It is this National Party Government which fetched them out of there, under the new dispensation. We still have one striking example of those slum conditions. We are still sitting with District Six. This is another example of integration over a period of 100 years between Coloureds and Whites. I say that integration has failed. Physical integration has also failed. Although there are people who try to imply that there was movement back and forth across the dividing line between Whites and Coloureds on a large scale, it is an interesting fact that a census was held at the Cape in 1795. At that time there were 3 000 more slaves than Whites at the settlement, apart from the Hottentots and other non-White races here in South Africa. Integration was not prohibited by law. In 1853 integration was a normal occurrence, when the then English Colonial Government placed the Coloureds on the same voter&#x2019;s roll as the Whites. I repeat that it has failed. The United Party, with the policy of race federation which it now advocates, and in terms of which it wants to allow six Coloured representatives into this House, wants to lead the Coloureds back to a state of affairs which has already proved to be a failure.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Malmesbury tried to make a case out of the fact that I, instead of the Leader of the Opposition, spoke just after the Prime Minister. I just want to tell the hon. member that the reason why I did it is because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was kind enough to allow me to do so because I cannot be here this afternoon.

<p>Sir, what did the hon. member for Malmesbury say in this debate? He said that we must not speak about separate development or about separate freedom in respect of the Coloureds, but that we now again have to use a new name, i.e. parallel development.</p>

<p>Yes. but if we now have the term &#x201C;separate freedom&#x201D; in respect of the Bantu, why do we then have the term &#x201C;parallel development&#x201D; in respect of the Coloureds? Why is there not separate freedom in respect of the Coloureds as well? Is it because we must again observe the spectacle of a Nationalist Party which, in the course of time, makes a twist and a turn in the direction it is heading? These are the same people who at one stage said &#x201C;The sky is the limit&#x201D; for the Coloureds. Then they had the idea of separate freedom for everyone. Now it is again a question of parallel development. The hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs says that the roads of the Coloured and the White man must go together and that they must work out the future themselves. That is what he said last year. Now that hon. member speaks of parallel development. If one draws two lines, the one next to the other, it means that they will never meet. What is the hon. member for Malmesbury&#x2019;s intention? He says that the integration we had 50 or 60 years ago in respect of the Coloureds, failed because we had no legal separation in this country. Those are the people who have, throughout the years, told us how dangerous integration is. From the hon. member himself we must now hear that integration failed. The hon. member is, of course, quite correct. Why was integration such a failure? It failed because certain conventions had been built up in this country that no-one could do anything about, conventions that will remain unchanged. Every group likes being among its own people. Shortly and to the point, those are the circumstances of this country.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the hon. the Minister of Information. According to the <i>Star</i> in December last year that gentleman made a speech which was reported as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Information, Dr. C. P. Mulder, claimed in a speech to the Brakpan Rapportryers that constitutional institutions leading to the political maturity of a people could not give satisfaction if geographical content were not given to them. Two separate peoples with separate Parliaments could not develop to full freedom, sovereignty and maturity without this geographical content of some form. The only alternative was that one people and their Parliament would be permanently subjugated by the other.</block>

<p>Surely this means very clearly that if the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s philosophy for the Coloureds is interpreted correctly, he advocates that they should have a land area of their own where they can have a Parliament that will not be subordinate to ours, and which would be exactly the same as ours. Subsequently a statement is issued on behalf of the Cabinet in which the Government rejects integration as well as a homeland for the Coloureds.</p>

<p>It is about this statement that I should like to say a few things. The hon. gentlemen made this statement after they realized that there was disunity in their own ranks. Then they said that they rejected a separate homeland and also integration. Sir, if you read carefully what is contained in that statement of the Cabinet, what do you find? There it is stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the other hand (that is after they had dealt with the question of integration), a homeland is impractical, but the following things will have to happen: The Coloured Persons Representative Council is elected in constituencies covering the entire surface area of South Africa. This council is obtaining increasingly more overall control of the townships and rural Coloured communities.</block>

<p>That is the first point. That is why they do not advocate integration or a separate Colouredstan, Then they continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Local authorities for the Coloured townships are established and will have to liaise with White local authorities.</block>

<p>The verb is used in its dual form. They &#x201C;will&#x201D; &#x201C;have to&#x201D; liaise with the local authorities. They reject integration, but if one has a link between the Whites and the Coloureds, this can surely not take place <span class="col_5095-5096" refersTo="page_1207"/>independently. It takes place, as the hon. member for Malmesbury said, at a round table. I now want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister: Is this a policy that will not result in a form of integration? I do not differ with the hon. gentleman about this. I think it is a good and a sound state of affairs. There is nothing wrong with that. But how can this Government make a statement in which they say that they reject both a Coloured homeland and integration. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The whole system, as it is developing, presupposes manifold, uninterrupted liaison between the Coloured and White authorities, of the Coloured Council and its organs with the Government, provincial authorities and the local authorities.</block>

<p>They suggest that here should be liaison at every point and that there will be a form of integration between the Whites and the Coloureds and their bodies. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is furthermore the intention, as already announced, that the Government, after consultation with the Coloured Persons Representative Council, will establish a link between this council and Parliament where consultation, when necessary, can take place.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Defence suggested on this point that the representatives of the Coloureds with a seat in the Other Place should form the link, that they should form the core of the link that they want between, this Parliament and that body.</p>

I think the hon. the Prime Minister ought to state clearly to us what this form of contact is that they have in mind. He must tell us whether it will be a permanent committee of which the Senators will form the core. Or does the hon. the Prime Minister have something else in view with this contact he speaks about? If that is so, did it take place after consultation with the Coloureds, or must the consultations between the Cabinet and the Coloured Persons Representative Council still take place?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a Government which wants to discharge its calling in this country must, in the first place, be orientated towards maintaining racial peace between the various population groups in this country. It is probably its primary task to ensure that there is harmonious co-existence among the various population groups in our country. When the hon. member for Newton Park now asks questions about how Liaison will take place between the Coloured body and this White Parliament, and asks whether this should take place inside or outside Parliament, these questions must be answered from certain basic standpoints. When one is confronted with a problem of possible levels of friction that may exist between the various population groups one must, in the first place, orientate oneself in respect of what one&#x2019;s basic standpoint is in relation to this matter. One cannot simply enter upon a situation haphazardly and make a rule that now fits the case, but will not do so in a year or more. One must adopt a basic standpoint. With reference to that I want to remark that if there is one party in this country which is equipped to maintain racial peace between Whites and Coloureds, between Whites and Bantu and even between Coloureds and Bantu, then it is the National Party. This is because the National Party takes into account certain realities of the population set-up of South <span class="col_5097-5098" refersTo="page_1208"/>Africa. The National Party has a basic policy which gives us a code of conduct according to which we can lead our people, a code of conduct which will result in good relationships being maintained, not only between one population group and another, but also between one person and another in our fatherland.</p>

<p>I shall come to that. The hon. member for Maitland must just display a little patience. We say, and hon. members opposite know it, that by their natures people form groups on an ethnic basis&#x2014;for cultural reasons, or because they belong together. It is a basic fact that has been encountered throughout the world since the time when they wanted to build the Tower of Babel. The need for people to group in a national context is a basic reality that we in the National Party take into account. But I fear that it is something the United Party does not take much notice of. I shall come back to this viewpoint at a later stage. Let me take as an example the Basques of Spain. After centuries of living together, they still have a longing for their own identity, for their own interests, which could not be destroyed throughout the years and which drove them to insurrection last year. This feeling of personal identity was never destroyed, although they have, for a very long time, been a minority group in Spain. Where a group, whether it be a majority or minority group, has the longing for a personal identity, it is natural that that identity should be protected. Under its policy the National Party gives every group the opportunity to protect its own identity.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will also have an opportunity to make a speech. I say that within the framework of the National Party we give recognition to the identity of majority and minority groups. One of these minority groups is specifically the Coloureds. We accept that they are able to identify themselves as such, and we are creating an opportunity for them to develop their own group pride. That is the foundation on which we base our code of conduct, a code of conduct which applies not only between one group and another, but also as between one individual and another. According to this we do not begrudge any group and any person the right to maintain individual self-respect and at the same time to evidence mutual respect for others. We in the National Party undertake to develop that sound basis in national relationships in South Africa, and we also carry this code to our people for the furtherance of sound relationships between one person and another and mutual respect between Brown and White, and <i>vice versa.</i></p>

<p>My problem is to determine where the United Party stands in this situation. It apparently does not accept that the Coloureds are a separate people or a separate people in the making. It apparently does not accept that there is a group feeling and a feeling of identity on the part of the Coloureds, that they want to develop to eventual nationhood. In their political language they sometimes speak of a &#x201C;race&#x201D; and sometimes of a &#x201C;class&#x201D;. It is now not very clear to me whether they see the Coloured nation of South Africa as a separate race with an individual identity, or merely as a separate class, a class which at the moment still falls under the guidance of the Whites, which is a mere follower of the Whites and which will, in the course of time, be integrated or assimilated piecemeal.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the second half hour. Earlier in this debate I raised the matter of the urban Bantu with the hon. the Prime Minister and outlined to him my conviction that in order to have a satisfactory relationship with them, it was necessary that they should have a measure of security in their family lives; that it was right that the responsible Bantu who are South Africans should be permitted under certain circumstances to have home ownership in those Bantu townships; that we should strive for the emergence of a Bantu middle class; and that there should be institutions whereby they have executive and administrative responsibilities cast upon these bodies which I hope would be wholly elected. The hon. the Prime Minister has indicated that in his view there is no such thing as a detribalized Bantu. Well, Sir, it is rather typical of the Nationalist Party that when it is faced with a problem it says that the problem does not exist and acts as though it is not there at all. I am afraid the hon. gentleman is going to find, as indeed the Fagan Commission found nearly 24 years ago, that there is a permanent urban Bantu population. Sir, when you have a permanent urban Bantu population then you require policies to deal with that permanent urban Bantu population and it is no good trying to treat them as though they are temporary sojourners or visitors from a foreign state. I believe that this is the fundamental mistake this Government is making in its dealings with that section of the community.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has suggested that Gen. Smuts was not in favour of giving these people home ownership in the Bantu townships in 1923. Well, Sir, 1923 is a long time ago; it is nearly half a century ago and, as you know, Sir, in that time there have been developments. One of the most fundamental developments was noted by the Fagan Commission when they found&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die stadwaartse beweging van die naturelle is eenvoudig &#x2019;n ekonomiese verskynsel wat ook en na verhouding tot hulle getalle in nog groter mate by die ander rasse voorkom.

<p>Sir, I wish this Government had learned the lesson of the wisdom of that statement before it started promising that from the year 1978, or some such time, they would reverse the flow. It went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons moet dus die feit aanvaar dat daar &#x2019;n permanente stedelike naturellebevolking is.</block>

<p>That, Sir, is the approach of the United Party in this regard. I believe it was the approach in the days of the old South African Republic, because certain of the townships created by them provided for ownership rights by the Bantu in those townships. I think we today face a situation in which the need for such home ownership is far greater than it has been at any time in our history.</p>

<p>Now the hon. the Prime Minister comes back at me and says: &#x201C;If you are going to give the Bantu rights of home ownership in the White areas, what about giving the White man the right to ownership in the Black areas?&#x201D; What about it, Sir? There is not an awfully large area set aside for the Bantu. I believe that it is right and proper that we should protect their ownership rights in those areas. We know what the dangers are if the Europeans are allowed to go in there and buy and speculate in land. Therefore I am not in favour of changing the law in that regard unless it is absolutely essential for the establishment of industries for the economic development of those particular areas. I want to say that as far as we are concerned, we believe that the right to home ownership of Bantu of South African origin who have become permanently urbanized and have, I believe, in most cases lost their tribal affiliations, is a very necessary guarantee against the agitator, and it is a guarantee for stability in the maintenance of law and order in those areas.</p>

<p>As I have indicated, I believe that at the same time an undisturbed family life plays a very big role in that regard as well, and I deplore the manner in which the Prime Minister&#x2019;s present Minister is doing his best to move people of that kind back to the Bantu areas. I believe that it is vital that there should be opportunities for consultation for those people. The hon. the Prime Minister has outlined the existing machinery. Let me tell him, although I do not want to go into details, that that machinery has just not worked. Virtually no powers have been delegated to these Bantu urban councils, and they exercise virtually no executive or administrative authority.</p>

<p>We believe that what is necessary is a fundamentally new approach by many South Africans to the question of race relations. One must remember that when we talk of the urban Bantu, we are talking of nearly 4 million people. We are talking about a very large section of the South African population. We are talking about perhaps the biggest problem which affects our day to day lives in our homes, on our farms and in our industries. If things go wrong there, things will go wrong for the whole economy of South Africa. That is why I have raised this issue again and why I have pressed for some new thinking on this subject. I was most interested to read what the editor of one of the newspapers supporting the Prime Minister, <i>Die Burger,</i> said in an article published on 27th March this year. He called for a revival and a renewal of thinking inside the Nationalist Party. They want matters such as the Coloured policy and the position of the urban Bantu, and the economic priorities of the future, to be extensively studied by strong commissions on policy because solutions once sought were not working out as they had been expected to. I wonder what solutions sought were not working as they were expected to? If I had my guess, I would say that one of them is the question of the urban Bantu. I believe that in the new approach the Government would have to be prepared to bury many of yesterday&#x2019;s ideas. And I think they deserve a formal death. This Nationalist thinker feared that the Nationalist Party was exhausting its intellectual reserves because they had been in power so long. I hope the Prime Minister will not take it amiss that he has a frank critic within his own ranks in this regard. Sir, the hon. gentleman likes straight speaking. Let me tell him that as far as I am concerned &#x2026;</p>

<from><span class="col_5103-5104" refersTo="page_1211"/>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if that is the sort of thing that passes for wit in the Nationalist ranks, then, quite frankly, I must say that the editor of that paper has all my sympathy. It seems that after the last Prime Minister went, who was a thinking machine in himself, they have not had a single new idea since.</p>

<p>One of the things they spoke about was the urban Natives and the other was the Cape Coloured people. This was raised by the hon. member who spoke before lunch and who unfortunately cannot be with us this afternoon. I want to say that as far as we are concerned, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s dispensation for the Cape Coloured people seems to give them the worst of two worlds. They no longer have representation in Parliament. They have been given their own Council, a large portion of which is nominated by the Government. Because they have no homeland, the hon. the Prime Minister says blandly that he cannot see the end of the road for them, but infers that they must press on meanwhile, hoping that something will turn up. In the meantime individual members of the Cabinet seem to have arrogated to themselves the right to air their personal views. We had a number of those views outlined before lunch. We have heard about the views of Dr. Connie Mulder, the Minister of Social Welfare and of Information. He appears to be in favour of a Colouredstan. The Prime Minister said firmly that that was not practical politics. Then we had the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hilgard Muller. He concedes that the Coloured people could develop politically only to a limited extent under the Government&#x2019;s present policy and that in this respect they had less freedom than the Bantu people, despite being the most developed section of our non-White population. Then we had the hon. the Minister of Defence, who in a thoughtful speech to his own congress suggested the canton system for the Coloured people, apparently on the Swiss basis, and indicated that the liaison between Parliament and these people might be through the Senators nominated for their knowledge of non-European affairs as the nucleus. There was a statement by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, a purist in Nationalist thinking, who believes that their development should be away from the White people of South Africa. Indeed, the hon. the Prime Minister himself is on record as indicating that the Coloured people&#x2019;s development should be away from the White people. Then finally we have the statement of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, Mr. Jannie Loots, who said with the authority of the Cabinet that any policy or lack of one which could lead to integration, on whatever basis, as between Whites and Coloureds is rejected. On the other hand the idea of a specific homeland for the Coloured people is impracticable, firstly because such a homeland is not available in the historical context, and secondly because the policy of providing urban and rural areas for Coloureds in the various parts of the Republic has already progressed too far. He apparently concluded his statement by saying what the hon. member for Malmesbury said this morning, that the Government is firmly committed to the principle of parallel development and indicated that the work ahead, with the best will in the world, could occupy a lifetime to fulfil the plans they already had.</p>

<p>Sir, that is all very well, but what is parallel development? Quite clearly, the Coloured people present the Government with a riddle they cannot solve. From that side of the House we have always heard that there are only two alternatives, complete integration or complete separation. Now, integration is out and a Colouredstan with complete separation is out, and now we are going to have parallel development. How does that fit into the Government&#x2019;s philosophy? It does not seem to me that they have room in their philosophy for the Cape Ooloured people. It seems to me that as far as the Government is concerned, the Coloured people seem to be destined to remain suspended between heaven and earth, and since their development is parallel they can go neither up nor down. Yet we have the hon. member for Moorreesburg indicating that they must come into fuller partnership with the White people of South Africa. He was immediately attacked by Dr. Treurnicht of <i>Hoofstad,</i> and there are various statements made indicating disapproval of that approach. We now find certain representatives on the Coloured Council again talking about the possibilities of an independent Colouredstan. Finally, we have an interesting statement made by Prof. Rhoodie. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is there at the moment a senior spokesman of the party who could present the public with a clear exposition of the manner in which White and Coloured <span class="col_5105-5106" refersTo="page_1212"/>relations will be organized over the next thirty to forty years&#x2014;an exposition at least as clear in detail as our policy with regard to the Transkei? Prof. Rhoodie said there was a reasonable measure of consensus among informed Nationalists that our Coloured policy is not formulated and motivated with the same self-confidence and decision as with our Bantu policy, especially on the concept of future relations.</block>

<p>It is all very well for people to talk like that. In the meantime there are a couple of million of Coloured people. The question of their future is something which is exercising their minds; a sense of dissatisfaction is developing amongst them. It is developing even amongst those Coloureds who support the policy of the present Government. They are becoming very vocal indeed on the injustice to them, as they see it, of work reservation, disparity of wages for the same jobs, housing shortages, general lack of facilities and the failure to enforce compulsory education. They have had to bear the brunt of replanning under the Group Areas Act. Many more thousands of Coloured families have been moved than have White families. Some, I will concede, have been moved to better homes than they had before, but a great many have been moved to areas where they are very unhappy indeed, and where they do not feel they are in the right surroundings at all. They do not find those areas congenial. Those people, too, are the section of our community, with the urban Bantu, who feel the full weight of the hurts, the stupidities and the indignities of what some people call petty apartheid and others call unnecessary apartheid.</p>

<p>Let me tell the hon. the Prime Minister too that even those who are supporting him on the Coloured Representative Council are dissatisfied with the Government&#x2019;s treatment of this Coloured Representative Council. They are very conscious of the fact that, although they are the most developed group amongst the non-European population, they can in fact not develop as far as the Bantu people can. Some of their leaders are already seeking liaison with the Bantu leaders. Others are warning of dissatisfaction and frustration. There was a statement published concerning Mr. Tom Swartz, who is Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Coloured Representative Council. I see that he says that he did the Government a favour by taking office. The article says:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Die Regering moet die onregte en speldeprikke verwyder waaraan die Nie-blankes in Suid-Afrika blootgestel is,&#x201D; het mnr. Tom Swartz, voorsitter van die Uit-voerende Komitee van die Kleurlingraad, oor die naweek aan die Engelse pers ges&#x00EA;. Mnr. Swartz het gewaarsku dat in &#x2019;n toestand wat onregte en diskriminasie toelaat, &#x2019;n baie onlojale en ontevrede deel van die bevolking kan ontstaan in vyfde kolonne.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to warn of their dissatisfaction and to speak about the difficulties that they have and the things about which they are unhappy. I believe that at the moment we are in the position that there are many thinkers on the Nationalist side and many White intellectuals, who feel that the time has come for a new deal. I think what we want to know this afternoon is whether the Prime Minister has any answer. He has indicated across the floor that he has an answer to the problem of liaison with that council. I would be interested to hear what it is. He knows my views on the Coloured people. He knows, in outline, the policy that we on this side have put across. I am prepared to match my policy against his at any time.</p>

<p>The ignorance of the Prime Minister horrifies me. He says that he would like to hear it, but he has heard it so often. We do not change our policy daily. I think what we want to know is whether there are adaptations and changes envisaged because we, too, feel that the present road, which the Government is following, can only lead to disaster in the relations between White and non-White in South Africa.</p>

<p>I indicated to the hon. gentleman earlier that, as far as we are concerned, there are certain economic aspects bound up with this issue as well. I indicated that there are certain economic aspects which are worrying us. We are in this position that the Government&#x2019;s difficulty in seeking solutions to our economic problem is bound up with the fact that it cannot divorce economic policy from its ideological approach to the problems with which we are faced. The result is that they persist in emphasizing and concentrating upon the negative aspects of their policy while our economic problems get worse. As long as the use <span class="col_5107-5108" refersTo="page_1213"/>of labour is restricted, they will have to restrict spending and investment and reduce the growth rate. They will have to apply hurtful taxes and restrict credit. They will have to throttle back the economy because they dare not stimulate it by using the human resources that are at our disposal, to a fuller extent. The problem is that they dare not concentrate upon the positive aspects of their policy.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says &#x201C;what nonsense!&#x201D; I have challenged the hon. the Prime Minister before and I challenge him now again to let his Economic Advisory Council work out for us what it will cost to develop those homelands up to a point where they can provide a future, not only for the natural increase in the reserves, but for those whom he wishes to send there. Let us tell the public of South Africa what it will cost. I challenged the hon. gentleman before to give us an idea of that. What is the reply we received? The reply was that it would be done, no matter what it cost. But the public has never been told what it will cost. The result is that the flow-out from the reserves continues just as it did in the past. If only those figures were available, the public of South Africa would realize how impossible a fulfilment this pipe-dream of Government policy is.</p>

<p>The crucial fact that this Government has to face is that if we rely to such an exaggerated extent only on our White human resources, even if supplemented by the Coloureds and the Indians, we cannot sustain a rate of growth in our economy to absorb the total increase in our population adequately. That means trouble and the hon. the Prime Minister knows it.</p>

<p>In the Budget before this one the hon. the Minister of Finance mentioned the possibility of dialogue with industrial leaders on the subject of the use of our manpower resources and the more effective use of the labour that is available to us at the present time. That offer was made meaningless by the activities of the terrible twins, the hon. the Minister of Labour and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. What happened then? We had the Riekert Commission on manpower, the recommendations and findings of which are not before us. The need for dialogue is now more urgent than ever it was before. I was very interested to note that in opening the Rand Easter Show, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs hinted that there was something afoot. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">Searching efforts are being made to find conciliation between your understandable desires and the equally understandable reservations on the part of the Government with respect to issues of decentralization of the use of Bantu labour. I do not say that we shall be able to meet your wishes, but there is a general desire to seek common ground.</block>

<p>What we would like to know is what is that common ground? Where is it going to come in? Will it be the Government dictating to the industrialists that they move into border areas and then will get labour? And, in the meantime, are our existing industrial complexes going to be throttled through shortage of labour? There are many of us who do not believe that the growth rate under this Budget will reach a level which will keep unemployment from reaching dangerous proportions. I think the time has come for the hon. the Prime Minister to take a hand and give us his views. We have the views of the hon. the Minister of Finance. We have had the views of the two hon. the terrible twins on the labour issue and we have had a statement from the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, but we are not much wiser. I have no doubt whatsoever that this problem goes to the root of our economic development and the well-being of our people in South Africa at the present time. I believe the hon. the Prime Minister owes us an answer on this issue.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, after I had put some questions on Bantu affairs to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, we found the hon. member for Newton Park discussing Coloured affairs. Now, at the start of this debate the hon. the Leader referred to Coloured affairs, and as this is such an important matter, I did at least expect the hon. the Leader, having asked for the privilege of the half-hour, to discuss this matter. But for a few references made in passing, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had nothing to say about this matter. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition simply used an endless flow of words, and he referred in passing to a &#x201C;new deal&#x201D; which would have to be introduced. Then, of course, I pricked up <span class="col_5109-5110" refersTo="page_1214"/>my ears to hear what this &#x201C;new deal&#x201D; actually was that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was envisaging for the Coloureds.

<p>No, I cannot understand something if it is not stated. If the hon. member wants to state it, I shall be very pleased. In the course of his half-hour speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition read out to us a lot of words and referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the &#x201C;negative aspect&#x201D; of our policy. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in all seriousness, and I am prepared to debate this matter with him for days, to tell us what the Coloured population of South Africa has which is of real significance and which has not been given to them by the National Party Government. Then my hon. friend refers to the &#x201C;negative aspect&#x201D;. I want to put the question to him in a different way. If they were in power in South Africa, what would the Coloured population of South Africa have had today? Furthermore, I want to ask the hon. members what they did in respect of the Coloured population during the years when they were in power. What did they give them? What were they prepared to give them, apart from making a football of them every five years when elections were held? What thing of lasting value did the hon. members opposite ever do for the Coloured population of South Africa? If there is one thing we must not do, and this is something the hon. members on the other side of the House have been doing all these years, it is to blow hot and cold when it comes to the Coloured population of South Africa. They must not hold things in prospect when it suits them and make insinuations and promises which they do not intend carrying out, and which they know only too well they will not be able to carry out.</p>

But when one asks them, or when it is election time, they propagate quite a different story. Hon. members need merely think of their own changes in policy and the role they played in regard to the Coloureds and the voter&#x2019;s list to appreciate to what extent they have been blowing hot and cold in this regard.</p>

They are offering them six representatives in this House, representatives who can be elected on a separate voter&#x2019;s list and may be either Whites or Coloured persons. Politically that is the grand total of what they are offering the Coloured people.

<p>They are worth more than is the hon. member who has made the interjection, for he is worth nothing whatsoever. They are worth much more than that hon. member is. In fact, that is what the voters of Queenstown told him when they chased him right into East London. Here, for the first time, the Coloured people were given a representative council. For the first time they were given a budget on which they could decide. For the first time executive powers were conferred on them in respect of such matters as have been delegated to them. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who makes such a fuss here, will remember very well that two years ago, if my memory serves me correctly, I said in this House that the leaders of the Coloured population had requested that local authorities be transferred to them. At that time I stated very clearly the attitude adopted by this side of the House. It stands recorded in Hansard that when I had asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to state his attitude on the matter, he said that he first wanted to study the documents, and that he would then give his reply. To this day he has not yet given a reply. To this day he has not yet taken a stand on this matter. I am still waiting for him to give us his standpoint after studying the matter for so long. In respect of Bantu affairs he was at least able to find a standpoint between one and two o&#x2019;clock, but in respect of this matter we are still waiting for the hon. the Leader to give us a reply. Today I again want to ask him what his standpoint is. A meeting was held in the City Hall of Cape Town, and I know that some of his members were present there. However, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has not yet taken up a standpoint in this regard. Our standpoint was very clear. We said that it was a reasonable request on the part of the Coloured leaders, i.e. that local authorities be transferred to them to an increasing extent. That is our policy and we shall do it. We shall do so not only because it is right, but also because we know that those local authorities can be entrusted to the Coloured leaders as they have the necessary responsibility to carry out that task. As far as provincial councils are concerned, hon. members know that attention is being paid to this matter. However, I want to know where the United Party stands in this regard.</p>

<p>I read, but I have never read that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition took up a standpoint in this regard. If he did say it, he did so softly in the hope that nobody would hear it and, in any case, that I should not hear it. I gave the hon. members the undertaking that if and when the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council had been <span class="col_5113-5114" refersTo="page_1216"/>elected, I would consult with the leaders in order to establish liaison between Parliament and them. I honoured that undertaking. Immediately after the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council had been constituted, I had talks with their Executive Committee. But I did not only have talks with the Executive Committee; I also considered it my duty to have talks with the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Arendse, on this matter and other general matters concerning the Coloured people. Since the establishment of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council I have had talks with the Executive Committee and the leaders of the Coloured community on three occasions. My hon. friend the Minister has had many more talks with them. We invited the leaders of the Coloured community&#x2014;not only one political party, but all of them&#x2014;to establish a committee which could deliberate with us on this matter of liaison. All the leaders of the various political parties were agreeable to this, with the exception of the leaders of the Labour Party. They did not want to take part in such talks. The others did meet. I told them they had to consult with one another prior to those talks in order that they could then approach me with proposals in that regard. I want to repeat here what I said on a previous occasion. Our dilemma in South Africa is that, on the one hand, one is dealing here with the Whites and, on the other hand, with the Coloured population, the Coloured nation, and that those two have to live together in one geographic area. One&#x2019;s dilemma in this regard is that, on the one hand, one has this Parliament and, on the other hand, the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. The situation with which one is faced, is that the two have to develop on lines running parallel to each other. That is not always easy. But irrespective of whether or not it is easy, one has to face up to the situation. We, on our part, have not only stated our standpoint in theory, but also implemented it in practice. We have implemented our standpoint from top to bottom. Educationally, socially and in all the various spheres we have implemented and followed through our standpoint in practice. But a fundamental problem which we must face is that, on the one side, we have the Whites and their Parliament, which has control over matters relating exclusively to the Whites, and, on the other hand, the Parliament of the Coloured people, which has control over matters relating exclusively to the Coloured people. Under no circumstances am I trying to run away from that. Furthermore, there are the broader issues which affect both of them and on which deliberations take place and laws are made in this Parliament. That is the position. I cannot escape from it even if I wanted to do so, and that is where the question arises. This is not only a question which I have asked myself, but we are seeking liaison in that regard. It is a question on which we have asked the Coloured leaders to deliberate, for it is, after all, a matter which affects them very intimately. They met and considered various alternatives. They did this on their own, without my presence or that of the Minister. They thrashed out the matter for themselves. The result was that when, a month or two ago, the Minister, the Deputy Minister and I met the members of the Executive Committee and the leaders of the other political parties, excluding the Labour Party, they had already decided unanimously on a standpoint. They had rejected the alternative possibilities of committees, select committees and even representation in the Senate, and had arrived at the unanimous decision that the link between this Parliament and the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council was to be the Executive Committee. On that occasion I put a question to those members of the deputation who were not members of the Federal Party. I asked them, &#x201C;As non-members of the Federal Party, what is your standpoint in respect of this matter? Are you in agreement with it?&#x201D; Their standpoint, just as that of the others, was that they were all in agreement with it, because they adopted the attitude that nothing was to be done to disparage the status of the Executive Committee. In the second instance, those leaders who were not members of the Federal Party said that they were sufficiently confident that the Executive Committee would present the case of the Coloured people in general and would look after their interests in general, although they themselves were not members of that party.</p>

<p>Their standpoint was that the Executive Committee was to be the link. I then proceeded to ask them in what way they thought liaison should be effected, and their unanimous finding was that in the beginning of the year, after the opening of Parliament, the Executive Committee and such other leaders as may be co-opted by them were to have a formal meeting with the Prime Minister in order that general matters might be discussed with him. Later on there could, if necessary, be more meetings. I agreed to that. They went on to say that, as additional liaison, they envisaged a meeting every two months with the Minister of Coloured Affairs and his Deputy, with an agenda, in order that matters of general interest may be discussed with them. They requested that if and when it might be necessary, another Minister whom they would request to attend, should be present at that meeting. That request was acceded to as well. The hon. the Minister has already had such a meeting in terms of that agreement, and further meetings are to be held, and then the Minister of Community Development will also be present since his presence has been requested in order that Coloured housing matters may be discussed with him.</p>

<p>That is the Coloureds&#x2019; own standpoint in respect of the liaison they want to have. Not for one single moment do I want to say&#x2014;in fact, I do not think the members of the Coloured community can say this conclusively at the moment&#x2014;that this will be the liaison for all time, because times and circumstances change. But I told hon. members that if and when there was a representative Coloured opinion, I would settle this matter with them. The recommendation that was made by them, was accepted by me just as it was. I believe it will work very satisfactorily in practice. I believe it will work in practice for many years, but as is the case with any agreement, if any of the parties to it feel that the time has arrived for it to be reviewed, they will be free to review it, and then it will be done. I do not have the slightest doubt that over the years it will be reviewed from time to time, until one will have found the ideal formula and a fixed formula. That is what I meant when I said that I could not at the moment say what the end of the road would be. Of course, at that time hon. members seized upon it, and I see the members of the Labour Party, Mr. Curry and others, are also taking up the standpoint from time to time that I had allegedly said that I did not have a solution to the Coloured problem, that our children had to solve it. But surely this is not what I said. I am pleased the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not say it here today, but this has been said on occasion by some of his members. I said that in respect of this liaison which exists, in respect of this reciprocity which, must exist, I did not see the end of the road, and that nobody could see it. I said the final stamp would be placed on it by our children. That is the way it was recorded in Hansard, and you can read it for yourselves. But I made it very clear that I was laying the foundations on which we were to build in future, and hon. members will remember very well that when we debated the matter in this House, their standpoint was that the Coloured people and the Whites had to be interwoven. That was their standpoint. My standpoint was that we were not to be interwoven, but that we were to develop away from each other. My standpoint was that each had to develop along his own course, parallel to each other. That was our standpoint. Our standpoint was not &#x201C;closer to each other&#x201D;, as hon. members said at that time, but &#x201C;each standing on his own legs in his own right&#x201D;. As I have said, the liaison machinery existing for the moment, is not my creation. It has developed as a result of the suggestions and the standpoint of the Coloured people themselves and, as I have said, it will have to be reviewed from time to time, as time passes on. For the moment this solves that problem for me. It solves for me not only that problem, but also the fundamental question posed in connection with it, i.e. the co-operation in respect of the broader terrain over which the Coloured people have no authority, i.e. their own views on this co-operation and on how it is to be implemented in practice. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout wants to put a question to me.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not put forward to those members any proposal whatever. Nor did my hon. colleague the Minister of Coloured Affairs put forward any formal proposal to them. The proposal, as it reached us, is one on which they themselves deliberated and which they submitted to us as the result of their deliberations. I believe that Coloured interests will be served best along those lines.</p>

<p>Now I want to make a few general comments on a matter which affects White-Coloured relations, Coloured-White relations, White-Bantu relations, i.e. all the people in South Africa, irrespective of their race or colour, the matter to which the hon. member for Transkei referred when he used the word &#x201C;discourtesy&#x201D;. I am not saying this in a reproachful sense. There is no reason for the hon. member for Transkei to raise his eyebrows. I want to agree wholeheartedly with him. One sees in certain letters in newspapers that blatant examples of rudeness on the part of one person to another are called apartheid. I now want to put a stop to this once and for all. No White person has the right to be rude to any other White person or to any other person. No Coloured person has the right to be rude to any Coloured person, any White person or any other person. I am not quarrelling with the hon. the Opposition about it, but I honestly think that the attitude should emanate from this Parliament that all people are entitled to respect, that all people are entitled to their human dignity being taken into consideration and that rudeness to one another should be squashed. Rudeness does not come from one side only. In reading certain English newspapers, one would fully believe that the Whites are the only people acting in this manner. But it comes from all sides. The sooner a campaign is launched against rudeness on the part of anybody to any other person whatsoever, the better it will be for our society here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Now, if I honestly and frankly tell not only the Coloured people, but also the Bantu that I believe in apartheid, that I believe that I should have my facilities and that you are entitled to yours, that I believe that I should have my residential area and you should have yours, that I believe that I should have my recreation facilities and that you should have yours, it is so easily construed that I am insulting them by saying these things. It is so easily construed as an insult when I adopt the attitude that I want my own and at the same time grant them their own. In my time I have had many talks with Black leaders. Similarly, I have in my time had many talks with Coloured leaders. But I now want to make it very clear that on all those occasions I never hesitated to state my policy and my standpoint. I have never seen one of them who felt insulted because I took up such a standpoint. I have never come across one of them who told me that I had insulted him by taking up such a standpoint. I have always adopted the attitude that we are different from them. The hon. member for Simonstown, who has just mumbled a comment on this matter, is one of the &#x201C;veldskoen brigade&#x201D;, as <i>Die Burger</i> calls them, who spreads stories about the National Party at by-elections, stories to the effect that the National Parts is enamoured of the Coloured people, and then comes to the House of Assembly with pious stories.</p>

<p>As far as this matter of relations is concerned, it is <span class="col_5119-5120" refersTo="page_1219"/>the National Party which has stated its standpoint very clearly so that every Coloured person living in South Africa today as well as every Coloured leader may know precisely where he stands with the National Party. The uncertainty which prevailed amongst hon. members opposite on the question of whether or not the Coloured people were to be absorbed into the ranks of the Whites, that day-to-day standpoint taken up by hon. members opposite in respect of the Coloured people, is something of the past now. Today the Coloured people know what is in store for them. They know precisely what course they must follow. They know precisely what course the Whites are following. They know that the Government is in earnest about providing them with the necessary facilities. They have a backlog as regards the amenities that are to be provided by the Government, and they have a backlog as regards amenities owed to them by the local authorities. However, they also know that those matters are being attended to. They know that economically and in other spheres there is a historical difference between them and the Whites, but they also know that it is our policy to eliminate that difference gradually, depending on the circumstances and the amount of money available. One thing I want to make very clear. The leaders of the majority of the Coloured people who accept and support separate development, are not &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; of this Government; they are leaders of their people in their own right. They accept that policy not because they think they can gain something for themselves by doing so, but because they know that by doing so they can achieve the maximum for their people and that they can do best for their people by adopting that attitude. They know that they have permanently left behind them the time when they brought up the rear, when they were only consulted under certain circumstances and When only some of them were allowed to enter through a certain door.</p>

<p>It has now been changed so that everybody can enter through the same door.

After all, we know that.</p>

<p>Let me now tell the hon. member for Transkei myself that there was, after all, a time in our history when only the Cloetes and the Van der Byls were good enough, but when the Van Rensburgs and the Venters were not good enough. After all we know that. [Interjection.] Now it seems to me as though only the Bronkhorsts are good enough. After all, we know, and the hon. member for North Rand himself knows, that there was such a time in our history in the distant past. They have not learnt anything from history. Incredible as it may seem, they are still playing the same game with the Coloured people today. Since we are arguing about Coloured affairs today, there is one argument which I want to reject with all the emphasis at my command. It is the so-called argument which one often hears from so-called intelligentsia in this country. Their argument is that as far as the Coloured people are concerned, the cream is to be skimmed off the top and taken for oneself.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not accusing the hon. member of that, but I say that there are intellectuals in this country who are saying that. There may even be people on the other side who support such an argument. I say I want to reject that argument with all the emphasis at my command. It reminds me that in the past the same standpoint was adopted in respect of my own people. Our policy should be aimed at doing everything in our power to uplift the Coloured people socio-economically and at ensuring them a better existence worthy of a human being. On the one hand this requires action on the part of the Government, and this Government has never lagged behind in taking such action. On the other hand it requires action to be taken by the Coloured leaders and the Coloured people themselves. One cannot uplift a person if he does not want to be uplifted, or if he does not want to lend his co-operation. One cannot uplift him if he does not have leaders helping him to improve his position. I am very grateful for the knowledge that as a very result of the policy of this Government, there have emerged today Coloured leaders who have the real interests of the Coloured people at heart, who realize that this has to be done and who are also doing it in practice. I am very grateful for the knowledge that there are <span class="col_5121-5122" refersTo="page_1220"/>competent Coloured leaders who can carry out this task for their people. But we must not make their task any more difficult for them than it already is. We must not make their task any more difficult for them by driving in a wedge between them and their people. We must make it possible for them to do that unliftment work for their people with the means placed at their disposal. That this must be done for the benefit of not only the Coloured population, but also the whole of South Africa, is certain and clear. But if we bring about discord in the minds of people, if we hold up to a population group promises which we know we cannot carry out in practice and, what is more, do not intend carrying out, then, surely, we are not acting justly towards that population group; then we are committing a crime against it.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to make it clear that we on this side know what our duty towards the Coloured people is. We know the backlog, the circumstances under which they are living. The will is not lacking on our part; on the contrary, we can say with great pride that what has been established for them here, from their schools to their university, has been established by us, under this policy of separate development. Under that policy we shall continue to do our share for the Coloured people. As far as this matter is concerned, there is no need for anybody, either inside or outside this House, to read us a sermon on how we are to act towards the Coloured people.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this has been a most interesting statement from the hon. the Prime Minister. Apart from the issue of the liaison between Parliament and the Coloured Representatives&#x2019; Council, it is quite clear that no progress has been made at all. That is quite clear, because the hon. the Prime Minister in his statement has completely failed to recognize the conflict in philosophies which exists among the members of his own Cabinet on the issue of the Coloured&#x2019;s future. There is nothing whatever as to what their future will be. Quite clearly, he is not able at this stage to reconcile those philosophies.</p>

<p>Now we are faced with a position where there is liaison between the Coloured Representative Council and Parliament through the Executive of that Council. But that Executive is elected by a majority which owes its existence to those members nominated by this Government. What has happened, is that the Government has nominated its people to the Council, its people have chosen the Executive, and this is now the liaison between the Executive and Parliament. May I say at once that I do not regard any liaison with a Minister or a Prime Minister as being liaison with Parliament. That is liaison with the Executive, not with Parliament. The only proper liaison with Parliament there can be is (when there is liaison between members of the governing party, members of the Opposition in this House and members of the majority and minority parties in that Council. Are we ever going to hear through this hon. Minister of Coloured Affairs what the views of the minority party, the Opposition in the Coloured Representative Council, are? Are their views going to be put here and fought for as they should be if there was proper liaison, if they carried the support of a large proportion of their members? This is making a farce of the whole thing. What have we had from the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of the future of the Coloured people? He tells us that he is giving this council powers, that they are getting a Budget and they are going to get more and more powers. The one thing that was recommended by the Select Committee was that they should have the power of taxation. That has been turned down by the Government. The hon. the Prime Minister cheerfully turns round and asks &#x201C;What would their position be if you had been in power?&#x201D;</p>

They would have a communal council which had powers of taxation. They would have had a communal council which had meaningful powers and they would have known that there were six representatives in this House of the Cape Coloured people, who could be White or could be Coloured, and who would put the views of minority and majority in that council. They would have known something more, namely that they had representation in the Other Place as well. The hon. the Prime Minister asked &#x201C;What Coloured leaders support you?&#x201D; Where was this Nationalist Party in the elections that were held for this House and the provincial <span class="col_5123-5124" refersTo="page_1221"/>council before they deprived them of the franchise? I will tell you. They forfeited their deposits in almost every constituency. Then the hon. the Prime Minister turns around and says &#x201C;Who supports your policy?&#x201D;. He nominates the leaders today. The Chairman is a man who lost his own election but was then nominated by the Government. He is now the mouthpiece for the Coloured people. What is their position today? The hon. the Prime Minister says that they have given them political rights all over South Africa. What are those political rights worth compared with the political rights we want to give them?</p>

I will repeat it in my way, which is this: I want to remind this House that the Nationalist Party Congress of 1959 in the Cape was not prepared to accept the parliamentary role for municipal franchise purposes. They considered it would be doing an injustice to the Cape Coloured people, and the gentleman who became Administrator of the Cape before the present one, was one of those most deeply opposed to it. And then, Sir, what happened in 1963? In 1963 a Cape Provincial Ordinance was passed and it was provided under that Ordinance that Coloureds entitled to register as municipal voters in other local authority areas would not be entitled, as and when they became registered voters in the Coloured local authorities, to retain their right to vote in the municipal areas when those new local authorities created under the Ordinance became management committees and not just consultative committees; in other words, when there was a meaningful alternative.

This is one of the more disgraceful things done to the Coloured people. It is another one of the long line of instances of deprivation by this Government of the rights that the Cape Coloured people had in the past, and this, Sir, is the trouble. You now have the existing body with no really meaningful powers yet; you have a nominated group inside it which helps to form the majority; you have liaison through a Minister, a Deputy Minister and the Prime Minister at certain times, but what do we know about the feelings of the Opposition or the vast mass of the Coloured people who elected 26 of the elected members of that Coloured Council? Sir, the hurts of the Coloured people continue; that is the point. The way in which job reservation is applied to them, the way in which they are discriminated against in wages when they are doing the same work and taking the same responsibility&#x2014;those are the things that worry them. There is the general lack of facilities which the Prime Minister recognizes. He came a long way today towards admitting that the heaviest yoke of the Group Areas Act has fallen on the Cape Coloured people here in the Cape. One of the big reasons for the shortage of housing among the Coloured people today is the fact that housing has had to be provided for those whom they have moved out of White areas and who already had houses at the time. l[Time expired.]</p>

<p>Sir, I want to make it very clear that my experience of Mr. Tom Swartz is that he is equipped for the task he has to carry out. I also want to make it very clear once again that he is not a &#x201C;stooge&#x201D; of mine or of anyone else, but that he is a person who thinks for himself, that he has and will have the courage of his convictions to tell me when he differs with me, that he will submit the needs of his people to this Government irrespective of personalities, and that we shall deliberate on them. As I said the other day, I now want to repeat that there will be times when I shall not agree with the Executive Committee, or when they will not agree with me, and that we may differ with each other in private or in public, but that is not important. What is important, is that they and we are co-operating for the good of the Coloured people, and that they and we are deliberating together in order to achieve the best for the Coloured people here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to make political capital out of so-called different standpoints among National Party leaders.

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I get the opportunity to do so, I should like to come back later to the question of relations between the Coloured people and the Whites, because it is very clear to me that the Prime Minister makes the mistake of confusing two aspects of this matter. In the first place, there is the relationship between person and person, which we have always said can be free. Nobody should be forced to do anything together with another person which he does not want to do. However, when it comes to the question of petty apartheid, the State is implicated, because then it is the State which is discriminating against a section of its own citizens. There are two completely separate problems, but as I have said, I shall come to that.</p>

<p>In the first place, I want to refer to the question of liaison. Let me say at once that if a mountain has ever brought forth a mouse, we have seen it here this afternoon. I am saying this with all due respect to the Prime Minister, but it was one of the most disappointing statements I have ever heard. After we had been hearing for two to three years of a liaison which was to be instituted between the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and Parliament, absolutely nothing happened this afternoon. The Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council has always had the right of coming to see the Prime Minister. He has sat in conference with them already. They have always had the right of consulting with the Minister of Coloured Affairs. All the Prime Minister said was that they were now again going to get the right to come and see them. What he gave them this afternoon, is not liaison between the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and Parliament; it is contact between the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and the Government, something which already exists.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No. If the hon. the Prime Minister is so keen to follow their view, I shall tell him now what he should do. He should accept the decisions of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. Look, Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister will be fair enough to admit that when this matter was discussed here when the Coloured representatives were removed from the House of Assembly, the hon. the Prime Minister said that as compensation for the removal of their representatives in Parliament, there would subsequently be liaison between the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and Parliament. And this was our impression.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I said I would deliberate on the matter with them, and now they have decided.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but now you must bear in mind that they have lost an important right. I do not want to go into detail on this now, but the council they are getting is one which from the nature of the circumstances has never had and never can have any real or fundamental powers. Now the position is this. The Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council has stated very clearly what kind of liaison it wants with Parliament. The Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council decided unanimously&#x2014;and this includes Mr. Tom Swartz&#x2014;that the only sound liaison with Parliament is representation in this Parliament. This is what it has said, and we should now view the Prime Minister&#x2019;s offer against that background. They have made their first choice. Now, I know it is not the policy of that side; it is our policy that this would be the only proper liaison. I listened to the hon. member for Malmesbury today. He spoke about a round table. Why is the Prime Minister or the Minister of Coloured Affairs going to sit around a round table with the Coloured people? What is this Parliament but a round table? What is the difference? If he may sit there, why may they not come and sit here? Let us hear the reply to that. What is the real objection? We have not yet heard one good objection why the Coloured population cannot get direct representation here at the round table of this Parliament. This was rejected, and what have we received in its place? Ordinary contact between the Executive Committee and the Government, something which already exists. We cannot object to there being <span class="col_5131-5132" refersTo="page_1225"/>contact between the Government and the Executive Committee, but if it were to mean anything, I think the Government should have given them certain guidance. If the Prime Minister were to get up today and tell the Coloured Council, or only the committee, the people who had met him: &#x201C;Look, people, over and above the liaison you have by means of the contact with the Government, I am prepared to give you liaison by means of a Select Committee of Parliament&#x201D;, I am convinced they would not reject it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But they have rejected it. I have just told you.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, and we do not have the correspondence, of course, but I am certain that what was rejected was liaison by the Coloured Council as a council. If I were sitting in the Coloured Council, leaving aside its composition now, I would be able to appreciate that there could not be liaison between the Coloured Council as a council and Parliament over the heads of the Executive Committee. I can understand that, but my point is this. The crux of what they said to the Prime Minister&#x2014;and this is very clear to me from what he said here &#x2014;is that the Executive Committee should be the mouthpiece of the liaison. One can understand this; it is not unreasonable, because it would be an impossible position if persons not sitting on the Executive Committee were to come and liaise with Parliament. But I am convinced that if he were to make the offer that that executive committee should liaise with a Select Committee of this Parliament, they would accept it. I would be astounded if they rejected it; and if they rejected it, I am convinced they would not at all be reflecting the view of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. Therefore, I must say that we are extremely disappointed with what has been offered here this afternoon and with the way in which the hon. the Prime Minister now says that this is what the Coloured people want. I want to repeat that this is not what they want. It is only what they are prepared to accept in their tragic circumstances. What the Federal Party and all the other parties want, is liaison &#x2026;</p>

<p>My opinion is based on the other facts, i.e. that they formally decided that the liaison they want is representation in Parliament, and I do not think there can be any dispute about that.</p>

<p>However, I just want to raise a few other points with the hon. the Prime Minister now. These are in connection with the arguments he put forward this afternoon. He again put forward the same story, i.e. what has been given to the Coloured people which has not been given by the National Party? Sir, I want to put it in this way to the hon. the Prime Minister. If he were to hold a referendum today among all the Coloured people and ask all of them in South Africa whether they wanted to revert to the old dispensation with the power of growth they believed it had and which it did have, as opposed to the apartheid dispensation of today, the mass, the large majority, would reject apartheid. I want to state very clearly today that there is not one single Coloured leader who accepts apartheid in principle &#x2014;not one. When the Government says every time that they support parallel development or separate development, they support it because it is the best they can do under the circumstances. In other words, they are prepared to accept it a-s long as this Government is in power, but this is not support. I dispute it, and Mr. Tom Swartz himself has said so in speeches. There is no Coloured leader who accepts the principle of apartheid. They are prepared&#x2014;and this applies to the Bantu as well&#x2014;to co-operate with the Government within the existing framework, Which they cannot change. I think this is probably the most sensible thing they can do under the circumstances. But if they were to vote to choose between the old dispensation and the present one, they would reject the present one.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said here that they did not regard the Coloured people as an appendage. Who regards them as an appendage? We certainly do not.</p>

Does the hon. the Prime Minister regard the English-speaking people as an appendage of the Afrikaners? Certainly not, but the English-speaking and the Afrikaans-speaking people are prepared to co-operate. When we say we want to cooperate, we are not rejecting the identity of the Coloured people. We are not regarding them as an appendage. We maintain that, because we have been thrown together in a political unit which cannot be changed, there should be co-operation between the White and the Coloured people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave quite a bit of attention to the liaison of the Coloured Persons Representative Council with Parliament or the Government. They implied that this afternoon they were actually surprised at what was announced by the Prime Minister. I should like to point out that we must take note that here we have, in the first place, the selection of the Executive Committee of the Coloured Persons Representative Council itself. I want to emphasize that it is clear that the members of the Coloured Council&#x2019;s Executive Committee insisted that they do not again want an intermediary between themselves and the Government, but that as representatives of the Coloured Council and of the Coloured population, they themselves prefer to consult with the responsible Minister and with the Government, to present their own problems and to state their viewpoint directly on behalf of their own people. I think it is a sensible choice. I am convinced that by these means the Coloured Persons Representative Council can continuously, as it has been stated here, and periodically conduct direct discussions with the Government.</p>

<p>It amazes me that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition can think that instead of this direct liaison, these people will be satisfied with a Select Committee, which will supposedly have more power or give them a better opportunity to state their case. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition- pointed out that members of the Coloured Persons Representative Council do not have an opportunity of stating a viewpoint as representatives of the standpoint of a minority group. But liaision with Parliament or with the Government is very definitely not an opportunity for them to state minority viewpoints. That is what the Coloured Persons Representative Council is there for. It is not a body that convenes in secret, it is a body that does so in public and whose proceedings are reported. It enjoys wide publicity in our public Press. In other words, there is sufficient opportunity for members of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council, who would like to state minority viewpoints and who would not be represented by members of the Executive Committee, to state those viewpoints. There is sufficient opportunity to make that standpoint known to their own people through the Press, as is the case. That is why it is an argument which, in my opinion-, does not hold good. We are convinced that this liaison, as announced by the hon. the Prime Minister and preferred by the Executive Committee itself, will be one that will show itself to be very profitable in the future because provision is being made, one may almost say, for a meeting-programme, a programme of direct discussions with the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs and with other Ministers dealing with other Departments. For example, the hon. the Minister of Community Development deals with a matter affecting the lives of these people. They can liaise with him directly. As was already apparent, when the members of the Executive Committee want to speak to the person with the highest executive political authority in the country, the Prime Minister, they can do so directly. Therefore time will again teach us that not only have the Coloured leaders made a sensible choice here, but practise will also indicate that a profitable channel has been opened here for the development and the promotion of the interests of the Coloured population.</p>

<p>I want to point out that in the past the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party tried to serve the interests of the Coloured population, so easily by saying <span class="col_5135-5136" refersTo="page_1227"/>that they also advocate apartheid; but their policy is based on the principle of voluntary apartheid. (If we look at what the Coloureds possessed in the past, where they stood and what social position they occupied, we see that in the platteland certain areas were reserved for them as areas which, through the agency of certain missionary societies, were reserved for the Coloured population in co-operation with the Government. We find that they had limited proprietary rights in cities and towns, but that the overall majority of the Coloured population in cities and towns were people who lived in rented houses, in back yards and in slums. The hon. the Prime Minister referred to that, and I do not want to go into it in detail. If we now take into account that the Coloured population has doubled during the past 30 years, if we bear in mind that in the Peninsula, for example, the Coloured population has trebled and probably increased four-fold in the past 30 years, and since we want to serve the Coloured population, I ask myself what would have happened to them and what would their social position have been if they had to realize themselves by means of voluntary apartheid? What would have happened to them if they had to find housing in terms of voluntary apartheid? Mr. Chairman, we cannot get away from the fact that not only would we have had an untenable housing situation in the Cape Peninsula, but that many thousands more Coloureds would have found themselves in corrugated iron shanties. If the United Party were in power Windermere and many other Windermeres would still be in existence today under voluntary apartheid. Where would the Coloured population have obtained the money to provide for their housing needs with the present economic set-up? Where would they get the money to obtain land, because on the open market the land is sold to the best buyer, to the man offering the best price? In this set-up the Coloured population simply could not realize themselves, maintain themselves or grow and develop. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give us an account of this matter. What would happen to the Coloured population&#x2019;s housing needs under his policy of voluntary apartheid? There is one fact that protects the United Party and that is the fact that for 22 years they have not been in power. If they had been in power the Coloured population would today have been pointing a finger at them. If they were to have allowed these conditions to develop under their policy of voluntary apartheid, the Peninsula would have been one of the most appalling places in South Africa. That would have happened if the Coloureds had to buy places for themselves on their own initiative.</p>

They want to grant the Bantu the right to bring his family to the place where he lives and works. With respect to the Coloured population I now want to ask the hon. member what protection he would then offer the Coloured population of the Western Cape? I could even reduce the distance and speak of the Peninsula. Do hon. members know what it would mean if this policy of his is carried through, the policy of voluntary apartheid, where people obtain proprietary rights on a voluntary basis, where Bantu obtain proprietary rights and where they will be able to bring their families to the cities? It would mean that about half a million Bantu must live within the smaller Western Cape area, in other words from Swellendam to the Olifants River.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat spoke of slums and of tremendously poor conditions that would develop if we were to be in charge of affairs. My hon. Leader has just asked him who created Athlone here in the Cape. That hon. member then remains silent and does not reply to the question. It becomes quite clear to me that this Nationalist Party Government, in its process of philosophical development, has philosophized itself into a corner. This Government&#x2019;s philosophic development, from apartheid to White supremacy, further to separate or parallel development and eventually to multinational <span class="col_5137-5138" refersTo="page_1228"/>development and the newest multinationalism, has reached a breaking point. This great ideology and this great philosophy which the Government members present with so much vigour and feeling, and which they ostensibly want to apply to the Bantu, should, for just one moment, be applied to the Coloureds of South Africa. In so doing they would see the joke of it. When the Nationalist Party has to make practical politics of these philosophical terms in South Africa, I take it that this philosophy must be made applicable to all South Africa&#x2019;s people. This means that it will have to be made applicable to the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu. We know that every Nationalist Party Prime Minister has had, and still has, a slogan. Thus we know that the present Prime Minister spelled out &#x201C;fulfil your calling&#x201D; as his slogan. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, however, could not wait long enough, and he came along with a slogan &#x201C;carry out your national task&#x201D;. Therefore one can perhaps accept the fact that this hon. Minister finds himself in such deep water. Now the hon. the Prime Minister could possibly throw more light on the matter in connection with what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development had to say in the House. We know him to be an outspoken person, and we have frequently heard him, here and outside, philosophizing high up in the clouds about the concept, the philosophy, of separate development. In this House he said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party&#x2019;s policy of integrating the non-Whites with the Whites into one whole with a strong, thick ceiling over the Bantu peoples so that they cannot rise to the top is no policy of security, but an explosive policy.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, arising from this fine philosophy one may just ask them&#x2014;can the Coloureds of South Africa, in terms of the Government&#x2019;s policy, rise to the top without coming up against a strong, thick ceiling that is held over them? Or does the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development adhere to his statement: &#x201C;We do not want to share our independence with the Coloureds, in case that little hon. member does not know it yet.&#x201D; In the course of that Session I presented this statement to the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs. His reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am not going to repudicate another Minister, but I think that the independence and the freedom which we gained for South Africa, are for the Whites as well as for the Coloureds.</block>

<p>In other words, the Coloureds do not have a separate homeland. That is also what the hon. the Prime Minister said this afternoon. South Africa is also the homeland of the Coloureds of South Africa, &#x201C;one undivided South Africa, this great South Africa&#x201D;, they tell the Coloureds &#x201C;is also your country, with one love and loyalty towards South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But if I begin talking like this, these words seem very familiar to me. At one stage last year the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs also waxed philosophical here about the concept of separate development. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If one makes the offer that it will be one country with one community in which one devotion and one loyalty will apply, you are in fact saying to those people to whom you are making this offer that all those tokens and all those privileges which a citizen of that country will receive will inevitably accompany it.</block>

<p>The question now is, is that the offer the Government is making to the Coloureds of South Africa? What does the hon. the Minister say are the privileges?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you offer them an undivided country and if you expect them to serve that country loyally, if you say to them that that country is their fatherland and that it should comprise one greater community which must live together in peace, love and loyalty, then one at least has the right to demand citizenship of that country of yours, with everything which goes hand in hand with that citizenship.</block>

<p>Is that what the Government offers the Coloureds of South Africa? What does the Minister say goes hand in hand with that citizenship?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It follows that one will have to give them the political rights of that citizenship. It follows that one must accord them an opportunity of giving expression to the citizenship socially and economically.</block>

<p><span class="col_5139-5140" refersTo="page_1229"/>Are those the privileges the Government presents to the Colourds of South Africa? Or is there a thick, strong ceiling over the Coloureds so that they cannot get to the top? Is that the approach? Is this Government&#x2019;s policy a policy of security or an explosive policy, in terms of the question the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development asked us? Where is the morality of this policy? The Nationalist Party preaches one philosophy in respect of the Bantu and then they apply another philosophy in respect of the Coloureds in South Africa. But they call both philosophies multi-national development, or multi-nationalism. White supremacy, Sir, the beginning of the philosophy of the Nationalist Party policy, has remained behind, stuck to the Coloureds, while multinationalism is being applied to the Bantu of South Africa. The joint Cabinet decision. through the mouth of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, is surely a strange one. Both integration and separate homelands for the Coloureds are rejected. In other words, the golden mean is being followed. Not integration, nor segregation &#x2014;in-between a way out has to be sought. How many times has the United Party not been told in this House that there are only two roads in South Africa&#x2014;either integration or segregation. Now they reject both and parade the golden mean before us. Perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister could shed more light on this matter for us.</p>

<p>The entire philosophy of multi-national development, of multi-nationalism, crumbles to its very foundations when it is made applicable to the Coloureds of South Africa. There was frank recognition from the hon. the Minister of Information when he spoke of the position of the Coloured Persons Representative Council as an &#x201C;outstanding, temporary stage&#x201D;, i.e. that it could not offer permanent satisfaction without geographic content being given to it. The hon. the Minister accepts that it is not practical politics, and he said as much in this House. However, he said that a separate Coloured State remains his ideal. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development says that he does not want to share our independence with that of the Coloureds in South Africa. As far as the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs is concerned, South Africa obtained its independence and its freedom for the Whites and for the Coloureds. The hon. member for Moorreesburg, and I am sorry that he is not here now, adheres to his standpoint that there should be a fuller and more efficient partnership between the Brown people and the White people of South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Defence advocates a narrower and closer movement, and even speaks of the canton system. The Cabinet says: &#x201C;Neither integration, nor segregation&#x201D;. The closest the hon. the Prime Minister came to the matter was in 1966 when he also adopted the approach of the more right-wing groups by saying that he sees the future of the Coloureds as apart from that of the Whites. The words of a well-known Coloured leader sum the matter up for me very well: &#x201C;No Nat clear thinking.&#x201D; Obsessed with the concept of multi-national development and the extension of multi-nationalism, this entire philosophy of the Nationalist Party nevertheless remains the biggest of farces when one wants to apply it to the Coloureds of South Africa. Last year the hon. the Deputy Minister of Coloured Affairs also said something in this House which does not make sense to me in terms of Government policy. He said: &#x201C;First things first. First the socio-economic aspect, then the political.&#x201D; That was the viewpoint of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I now find it strange with respect to Coloureds of South Africa on the one hand and the Bantu on the other, that the Government has conflicting priorities. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not know who wrote out that speech for the hon. member, but it seems to me as if it was written out before the hon. the Prime Minister spoke this afternoon, and that the hon. member then did not have the sense to adapt his speech to the information which the hon. the Prime Minister gave repeatedly to the House. The hon. member for Turffontein is too young in years and too new to politics to know what the conditions were under which the Coloureds had to live when his party was in power. I want to accuse the United Party of a gross political swindle of the Coloured people in the years when they were governing. I want to add that this National Government and the National Party are not ashamed or afraid to also believe in an ideology as far as the Coloureds are concerned.</p>

<p>This afternoon it was very clear to me from the speeches of hon. members opposite that they saw an evil in the fact that the Afrikaner has the political power <span class="col_5141-5142" refersTo="page_1230"/>in South Africa. They begrudge the Afrikaner political authority in this country. They told us a lot about the six M.P.s who would sit in this House under their policy. They have been told many times that it would form a political bloc in this House. Now they deny this, but I want to remind them of the position in America. There are 12 Negro members in the House of Representatives. Recently these 12 formed a bloc in the American House of Representatives. At first President Nixon would not give them a hearing, but now he has given way. I just want to quote a few sentences in this connection from the <i>Argus</i> of 24th February, 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Black caucus &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is what it is called&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; 12 Negro members have scored the first victory since their decision to embark on the new politics of confrontation by acting as a bloc.</block>

<p>One of those 12 said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Today I inform my colleagues that the old Black politics of accommodation has been replaced by the new Black politics of confrontation. Those Black politicians who are subservient to White controlled political machines cannot possibly stand the kinds of pressure which will come when the new Black politics launches the campaign for total Black equality in all areas.</block>

<p>Sir, that takes place in a country like America where integration is forced on the people. I want to predict that if six Coloureds or Whites come to this House to represent the Coloureds, one would have a repetition&#x2014;no, much worse&#x2014;of what we had in the past when these people were used and abused. Sir, in this yellow booklet.</p>

<speech by="#palm">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>I myself. I do not use other people to write out my ideas for me. In this yellow booklet the United Party says with respect to its Colour policy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured people pose no problem that cannot be handled by a Government that uses its common sense.</block>

<p>Sir, can a party be so na&#x00EF;ve as to say that these I million people, who have their own aspirations and who are being helped by this Government to realize their aspirations, are no problem to them? They state further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We will work to live in peace and harmony with all South Africa&#x2019;s races in one centrally controlled State.</block>

<p>Sir, those are fine words, but what do they mean? Do they mean assimilation by and through the Whites? Hon. members on that side must please reply to this question. Does it mean social and political integration? They must tell us what it means. The hon. member for Newton Park says that he advocates the preservation of Coloured identity; the hon. member for Transkei says that the non-Whites and the Whites are fellow-citizens of South Africa. Sir, fellow-citizens must surely enjoy full and equal rights in all spheres, and if the United Party brings the Coloured in here under their policy, they must surely give him full and equal rights in all spheres. But the hon. member for Hillbrow also says, in setting out his party&#x2019;s policy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For non-Whites there would be the fullest possible participation at the local and regional levels within each community, to be followed by greater involvement at the national level.</block>

<p>Sir, again fine words, but this afternoon I have not heard a single word from that side of the House about the meaning of these things. Who is now right? If hon. members on that side tell me that they believe in the maintenance and development of the identity of the Coloureds, then surely they cannot integrate with him socially and politically. Sir, this is typical of the double-talk of the United Party about Which the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> wrote that it is this cheap opportunism which, more than anything else, gives the United Party such a dilapidated appearance on broken-down idealism and intrigue. There I agree with the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> for once in my life. Sir, in the past the Coloured was a political punnet. I still remember the time when U.P. supporters drove the Coloureds in their cars, on election day, to the polls where they were given a cup of tea and embraced; I saw it, and subsequently the United Party forgot them for five years and never thought that these people also <span class="col_5143-5144" refersTo="page_1231"/>have aspirations and ideals and, what is more, also have needs. The Opposition blames this Government for the fact that there is a backlog in housing and other things.</p>

<p>In 1948 this Government not only had to break down a cracked house to its very foundations, but it also had to start building from scratch on this sturdy foundation of separate development. This Government had to clear up the Windermeres, the Kensingtons and the slums in which the people lived, even in the face of the fiercest opposition from city councils that were in United Party hands. Sir, as the hon. member said this morning, it cannot be denied that the United Party ruled in the Cape Provincial Council from 1910 to 1954. Most of the big city councils were also in their hands at that time. What did they do in that period? What was the picture at that time? As a young boy I remember the rioting and the dissatisfaction of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>No, I am not prepared to reply to a question. The hon. member may make his speech at a later stage. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>*The PRIME MINISTER. Mr. Chairman, if I understood the hon. member for Bezuidenhout correctly, he said that Mr. Tom Swartz and the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council had adopted a unanimous resolution to be represented in this Home. Of course, that is not so. No such resolution was adopted by the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council or Mr. Tom Swartz at any time. What the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has in mind, is something quite different. In the old days there was a Union Coloured Council.</p>

</speech>

<p>It was the same people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was an old, meaningless council, and at that stage the Coloured people were still being represented in this House by four Whites. The motivation of that Union Coloured Council for their resolution was as follows: &#x201C;If we are to be represented in this Parliament, we do not want second-hand representation by four Whites. In that case we want to be here ourselves.&#x201D; I do not blame them for having adopted such a resolution. I find it quite logical that any person with self-respect would argue that way. Surely, if one is to be represented on a council, one can represent oneself much more effectively. Why should one be represented by other people? That is in fact the weak point in the United Party&#x2019;s policy, for they say that they will grant the Bantu representation by Whites in this House. Surely <span class="col_5145-5146" refersTo="page_1232"/>the Bantu can represent themselves much more effectively here than Whites would be able to do on a second-hand basis. After all, there are enough well-equipped Bantu to do this. If one decides in principle that the Bantu or the Coloured people have the right to be represented in this Parliament, it is morally no more than correct to say that in that case they should be here themselves. Then they should not be represented here by other people, on a second-hand basis.</p>

<p>That hon. member made such a fuss about petty apartheid, but what did he say in his definition of &#x201C;petty apartheid&#x201D;? He said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Petty apartheid is pernicious and must be done away with. It is the name given to every practice of separation and discrimination where skin colour is the determining factor &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>That is only one part of the definition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Very well. There is no &#x201C;or&#x201D;; it consists of paragraphs, but I shall now read out everything to the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) Which is enforced by a White authority by means of penalties without recognizing the wishes of the non-White population groups affected by it.</li>

</ol>

<p>The &#x201C;rider&#x201D; which he then has between brackets, does not apply. The hon. member will grant me that I need not read it&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(3) Which is commonly humiliating to some group of people or other and has virtually nothing to do with honest development.</li>

</ol>

<p>I shall now take all three of them and come to the policy which the hon. member endorses, i.e. that the Black people should be represented here in this Parliament. Now he makes a law and says that in spite of the fact that the Black people can be represented here, they may not be here, but must be represented by Whites. Now he discriminates against that person because his skin is black. Then there is the second point. The fact that the Bantu may not enter through this door, is enforced by him with penalties. Does he now want to tell me that it is not humiliating to the Black man if one says he may be represented but he may not do so himself; he must have it done here by a White person? [Interjections.] Would the hon. member now grant me that this by itself knocks the bottom out of his whole definition?</p>

<p>I shall reply to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But I want to proceed. I want to put forward a more pertinent example in respect of these three conditions laid down by him. The law provides that a child who has a black skin, must go to a certain school. If the non-Whites could choose, they would all want to go to the same school; they would want to go to our schools. That is obvious, but because their skins are black, they may not go to a White school. Is that petty apartheid?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is not humiliating to have one&#x2019;s own school.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely then it is not humiliating to have a cinema of one&#x2019;s own either. Then it is not humiliating to have one&#x2019;s own entrance to a building. Then it is not humiliating to have one&#x2019;s own facilities in every respect. But when it suits the hon. member, he applies humiliation in this way, and when it does not suit him, he applies it differently. The hon. member says it is not humiliating to say a White person should attend his White school and a Coloured person should attend his Coloured school, but if one says a White person is only to get married to another White person and a Coloured person is only to get married to another Coloured person, it amounts to the crudest form of petty apartheid that exists. What logic or morality is there in that in regard to this matter? It is easy to indulge in fine-sounding words when discussing things of this nature, but it is a different matter when one has to apply them in practice.</p>

<p>But I am now coming back to what the hon. member said. The hon. member said he was amazed at this resolution which was passed by the leaders of the Coloured Council. Sir, surely it is their own handiwork which they are now laying before us here. But what is the history of this matter? The history of this matter is that the Coloured Persons Representative Council, both appointed and elected members, unanimously decided, by way of a motion <span class="col_5147-5148" refersTo="page_1233"/>in that Council, that the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs was to appoint a committee from their ranks to negotiate with the Government on this matter. The Labour Party, still under the leadership of Arendse at the time, unanimously agreed to this motion. The Minister demurred by saying that it was not his function to appoint such a committee. However, they told him that that was the resolution they had passed. The committee which the Minister subsequently appointed, consisted of the five members of the Executive, the chairman of the Council, a member of the Republican Party, a member of the National People&#x2019;s Party and two members of the Labour Party, who themselves unanimously requested the Minister to appoint such a committee. When the Minister also nominated the two members of the Labour Party, they said that they no longer saw their way clear to participating in these negotiations. In other words, the committee was appointed on a motion agreed to unanimously by the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council, by both elected and appointed members. They deliberated <i>inter alia</i> on a select committee, a standing committee and representation in the Senate by Coloured persons. Such a motion was introduced. However, they rejected all those motions and passed this resolution unanimously. As this is not what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout wanted, he says that the mountain has brought forth a mouse. Now he blames me for the fact that, having said that liaison would be established and subsequent to the responsible leaders having said that this was the type of liaison they wanted, I accepted it. What would the hon. member have done in my position? He would probably have told these people that their motion was absurd and that they had to go back and seek another link, whereas they, as adults who had deliberated on the matter, had said that this was in fact what they wanted. After all, I have been in politics long enough to know&#x2014; and that is why I said it to this House today&#x2014;that even if it is good enough and satisfactory at the present moment, I anticipate that a time will come when it will not be good enough. Then we shall deliberate on it once again and establish other liaison machinery in order to keep up with the times, with due regard to the wishes and desires of those people. Why must we disparage it now? Why must we censure and condemn it?</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that, if we were to hold a referendum amongst the Coloured people, the large majority of them would reject separate development. If we were to hold a referendum amongst the Coloured people and if we were to ask them whether they wanted the right to live wherever they pleased, including Milnerton, I want to assume that the majority would say that they did of course want to live there. But would the hon. member for Bezuidenhout be prepared to allow that? I want to return to his definition. Not only the Act of this Parliament, but also the Act which Mr. Japie Basson, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, helped to pass when he was sitting in these benches, namely the Group Areas Act &#x2026;</p>

The hon. member also said that, if, contrary to the Act, any person were living where he was not allowed to live, he would enforce this provision by means of penalties.

<p>Mr. Chairman, unfortunately 10 minutes is too short a time in which to deal with all the points raised by the hon. the Prime Minister. I just want to refer quickly to the decision of the Coloured Council at the time. In any event, that was not the last decision concerning representation in this Parliament. Mr. Tom Swartz and his party were in control of the Union Coloured Council at that time as well, and that decision was taken just before the Council adjourned in order to take on the appearance of the new Council. Subsequently, all the political parties of the Coloureds in the new Council decided time and again that they were in favour of representation in this House.</p>

If he were to ask Mr. Tom Swartz, he would tell him so personally.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of petty apartheid, I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that, like the <i>Burger,</i> he has now taken a section from a definition.

<p>It does not matter. I am not running away from something. But how did it originate? The point is that this definition which I have given, originated when I was asked with reference to the speech I made on the difference of opinion in the National Party, what people who debated petty apartheid, meant by it. This is my definition of it.</p>

<p>And what you said here in this House?</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to make it clear that it was not a statement of policy of mine. But in my opinion and as far as I am concerned, it is a description of petty apartheid. Every now and then extracts are made from that definition. The definition is very simple. It concerns colour. All apartheid concerns colour. It concerns coercion. All apartheid is coercion. How can one define petty apartheid without saying first what apartheid is? Apartheid is colour separation, enforced separation, and in addition to this, if there is humiliation for the people and no development (to distinguish it from separate development) petty apartheid arises. I must tell hon. members that in my opinion this is a good definition.</p>

<p>It was not only <i>Die Burger</i> and I who came forward with petty apartheid. I can quote people sitting on the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s side in Parliament who have spoken about it. Now the hon. the Prime Minister is refusing to reply to the question I put to him. I have already replied to the questions he put to me. Now I want to reply to him another time. I want to tell him that there are important people sitting in his party who are saying this sort of thing, namely that there are forms of petty apartheid which should be abolished. For instance, there is the hon. the new Minister of the Interior, who said the following in a statement of which I have the report of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa will also just have to change its pattern of human relations &#x2026; With the acceleration of the application of separate development, the need for more negative aspects of small or petty apartheid will disappear.</block>

<p>Now I am asking the hon. the Prime Minister what his hon. Minister meant? In an interview with <i>Dagbreek</i> the hon. member for Pretoria Central said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must not introduce any separation measure simply for the sake of separation. Then one gets petty (<i>kleinlike</i>) apartheid. &#x201C;Kleinlik&#x201D; is the correct translation of &#x201C;petty&#x201D;.</block>

<p>He went on to say that there were aspects of apartheid which had to disappear. Even the hon. member for Bellville, Mr. L. A. Pienaar, said when he was a member of the provincial council that there were aspects of colour separation which had to disappear. The hon. member for Moorreesburg said the greatest dilemma of the Government in this country was colour discrimination. In the same way I can quote what Mr. Paul Sauer, an important man in the National Party, said. He said the following in an interview with the <i>Argus</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We will have to put a stop to such nonsense as separate lifts for the different races. We must do away with measures like these in order to create less friction.</block>

<p>In the same way I can quote Adv. Dawid de Villiers as well and one important man after the other. He should simply consult his own newspapers, because for a few weeks already an extensive debate has been conducted in them about forms of offensive apartheid which should be abolished. I was pleasantly surprised, and I am saying this to the credit of the hon. the Prime Minister, when the hon. the Prime Minister said in Stellenbosch that there were measures which passed for apartheid, but which were unnecessary measures. I do not want to misquote him, and for that reason I shall quote his words as they appeared in <i>Die Burger.</i> He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is often labelled as petty apartheid, mostly concerns matters which have nothing to do with apartheid. Then people think of measures which are not necessary for the sake of protecting identity or which cannot or do not want to prevent friction and stand in the way of chances and opportunities. That is a debatable point. If it is not necessary for the sake of retaining identity, then it has no right of existence.</block>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Would the hon. the Prime Minister then be so kind <span class="col_5153-5154" refersTo="page_1236"/>as to rise and tell us what forms he thinks are the unnecessary ones and do not have the right of existence? However, we simply receive no reply.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that there is a very easy way of doing this. I am not asking him to accept my definition, because it concerns the difference of opinion on the side of the Government. I want to put the matter to the hon. the Prime Minister in the following way. All he need do in order to establish what is humiliating and offensive in the apartheid set-up, is to put himself in the place of a Coloured or non-White. The hon. the Prime Minister said this afternoon that the ancestors of the English-speaking people had been in power in South Africa. Suppose the Afrikaner is playing second fiddle and an English government is in power here. The English government then decides that an Afrikaans teacher may not be paid the same salary as an English teacher. Would it not be humiliating? That this was being done merely because he was an Afrikaner? Those of us in this House who are Afrikaners may ask ourselves this question. In addition the English Government decides that Afrikaners should sit on the top deck of busses in spite of the fact that an Afrikaner&#x2019;s foot may be in plaster of Paris. He may not sit on the lower deck because the English-speaking people sit there. If the English government decides that an Afrikaner may not use the same entrance as the English-speaking person in order to buy a stamp at the post office, is that not humiliating? He may not buy a stamp at the same counter at which the English-speaking people buy theirs. He may not sit on the same bench. He must sit behind a partition when he attends a symphony concert in the Cape Town City Hall. I want to put it like this. Let an Afrikaner place himself in that position where notices are displayed everywhere which read, &#x201C;You, Afrikaner, may not enter by this door&#x201D;, or &#x201C;You may not do this or that together with an English-speaking person&#x201D;. If this had taken place under an English government in the olden days, there would have been a revolution, and I should have liked to have taken part in that revolution.</p>

I am not charging the Government with this either. Nobody sitting on this side maintains that we should abolish everything overnight.

<p>One of these is rudeness; I have told you so.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with him. Rudeness is something which does not necessarily have something to do with the policy, and I agree 100 per cent that rudeness between races and people is indefensible. Under his Government&#x2019;s policy, however, there are things which are not based on rudeness as such. For example, there are matters such as the fact that a Coloured person, a White person and a Bantu person may sit together in the same aircraft of the South African Airways, but when they enter the hall of Jan Smuts Airport, they are segregated; the one group must go to one side and the other group to the other side. In addition, there is the case of the separate swearing-in boxes in the courts which revolted certain of our Judges to such an extent that they decided to abolish them. For all I know, those separate swearing-in boxes may still be an institution in other parts of the country. There is another ridiculous matter, and that is the train bridge at Hutchinson. Whites and non-Whites must go up and down the bridge separately, but on top of the bridge they are together again. Who can defend that? Surely it is completely impossible to defend.</p>

<p>The bridge at Hutchinson. I listened with interest to the hon. the Minister of Finance when he spoke about what Confucius had allegedly said about this and that. At the time the question occurred to me whether it had occurred to the Government that if Confucius ever had to apply for a visa to visit South Africa or if he had tried to come and live here in South Africa, they would have kicked him out and would have treated him like other members of his own race.</p>

<p>Where we are approaching the end of this debate, it is clear to me that there is a decline and collapse in the party on the opposite side. We witnessed this in connection with their Coloured policy, as we have just heard it. There are indisputable differences of personal opinion in that party about the future of the Coloured people. The hon. the Minister of Information told me across the floor of this House that it was his personal opinion that there should be a separate homeland for the Coloured people in the future. He knows he said it. Is it true? The hon. the Minister is admitting it. Therefore there is a difference of opinion. I admit that the official opinion is one opinion now. The hon. the Minister of Information wants to eat cake, the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs wants sweets, and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development wants to eat bread, but the hon. the Prime Minister says: &#x201C;No, we must all eat wormwood together.&#x201D; Very well, let them all eat wormwood together, but that is not the personal wishes of those hon. members. We witnessed the same thing in regard to the Native policy which was discussed here. As yet there has been no conclusive answer regarding the future of the Bantu in our urban areas in South Africa. They are detribalized people, who are becoming more detribalized and presenting a growing problem to us year after year. There will come a stage when they will belong to a homeland as little as that hon. member belongs to the homeland of the Dutch and I to that of the French.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In regard to sport we really had a strange spectacle. But let us agree that at least in the statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister there was a change, and a change for the better, in the attitude on the Government side. I sincerely regret that we did not have an opportunity of hearing more from the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation.</p>

<p>I am quite serious, because I believe that he had something to contribute to this debate, and I am very sorry that he did not have the opportunity of doing so. I am sure that he knows why he did not have an opportunity of doing so. I say this seriously.</p>

<p>I am glad that there has been this step forward in regard to sport, but it is such a complicated step that, frankly, I cannot <span class="col_5163-5164" refersTo="page_1241"/>understand a great deal of it. I suggest that the hon. the Prime Minister should erect a computer in the Lobby. That computer should be programmed first of all for the 102 nations of the world; secondly, for the 92 different types of sport; thirdly for the eight different races in our country: the Bantu, Coloured, White, Asiatic, Malay, Chinese and honorary Whites. Then it should be programmed for the seven or eight different types of group areas we have in this country, including the new group area known as the International Stadium. It should also be programmed for two types of international sport, that on the Olympic level and that on ordinary level. It should also be programmed for controlling bodies which are White, which are non-White and which are mixed. With that variation a poor person such as myself who cannot understand all the finer points of this policy, will simply be able to press one of the buttons in the computer and get an answer on whether a certain sporting event would be permissible. With all these variations, I have calculated that there are 45 million different answers.</p>

<p>I now come to the vacillation on the part of the Government, which I only want to mention in passing. It would not be a speech of mine, if I did not mention this matter, as hon. members will agree. This Government has had in its possession the report of the Television Commission for months and months. Why has the hon. the Prime Minister not taken this opportunity of giving us an indication of what the plans of the Government are in this regard? Why is he leaving it to a junior Minister, whose Vote he knows will only be discussed in many weeks&#x2019; time? And why is he thereby delaying the matter further, and possibly deliberately? I ask him please to give us a reply, or is it the case that at this late stage they have not yet decided whether television should be introduced in South Africa?</p>

<p>*All the same. Sir, I do not want to say that there was dissension about all matters in this debate. There was one matter on which all of us on that side and on this side agreed. We were all very satisfied with the result of the Witbank by-election. I want to congratulate that side on their joy about the retrogression which took place in Witbank as far as they were concerned. They expected a catastrophe, and now they are satisfied with a tremendous set-back instead of a catastrophe. Let us analyse the facts now. This time there was a larger percentage of votes in Witbank than in October. If that increased percentage were to be applied to their majority, they really ought to have had a majority of 3 700. Instead of that, they had a majority of only 2 500. Their majority dropped from 4 300 in April last year to 3 000 in October, and to 2 500 now. I know that this is an extreme case, but let them calculate the following figures on a piece of paper for each of their constituencies: In Witbank, the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s number of votes dropped by 1 000 in one year &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we already know from experience that if nothing new can be said in a debate, the hon. members for Durban Point and Orange Grove are brought into the debate. Yesterday afternoon the hon. member for Yeoville made a terrible fuss because the hon. the Prime Minister had introduced certain highlights point by point into the debate. The member for Yeoville was the one who reproached us for jumping from one thing to another, but when have we seen more of that than this afternoon? The hon. member who has just spoken, discussed seven subjects within a matter of nine minutes. I just want to ask him whether they won Witbank with that reduced number of votes? According to yesterday&#x2019;s newspapers, their people had predicted they would. North Rand has not even been dragged into this debate, but at least the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has received a word of congratulations in this regard.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. This afternoon he took up the standpoint that if we were to hold a referendum among the Coloured people, they would reject separate development like one man, or overwhelmingly. He spoke sneeringly about Mr. Tom Swartz&#x2019;s standpoint. If I may not say that, I withdraw it, but that is how it struck me.</p>

<p>But you stand by what you said? Very well. Now I want to tell the hon. member what Mr. Tom Swartz said. The question was put to him: &#x201C;Where is the Coloured heading?&#x201D; He replied: &#x201C;As far as I can see the road which is being opened up here, it is the road ahead towards our becoming a nation&#x201D;&#x2014; and he said this after he had made two other very important statements. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where is the Coloured heading? In my opinion, the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development will guide the Coloured to a point where he will be competent to stand on his own two feet and will be able to handle his own affairs.</block>

<p>Is this not an acceptance of the policy of separate development? He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is an indisputable fact that a people numbering nearly 2 million souls, can make a successful and fine existence from among its own ranks.</block>

<p>What was the result of the Coloured election? The result was that the vast majority of the votes cast were in favour of the idea of apartheid or separate development, admittedly in different parties, but parties which had all openly expressed themselves as being in favour of separate development.</p>

<p>The hon. member has a particular way of thinking. In all his debates on the Coloureds, the hon. member tries to create the impression that there is tremendous humiliation in the way in which the Coloured people are being treated by the Government, but surely this is not true. If the hon. member would look around him, he would see this. Let us just take the question of the clothing of the Coloureds and their general appearance. Take one example where we have the best exhibition of what is being done for the Coloured, namely the publication Alpha, and look at the photographs which appear in it. Does it really create an impression of humiliation?</p>

<p>The hon. member tries to do something else as well. He tries to create the impression here that the time has arrived for us to &#x201C;re-build&#x201D; some things. But what has this Government broken down? Of what has this Government deprived the Coloured people without its having given something in place of that? Sir, we shall come back to this under the Vote of the hon. the Minister. I just want to read one small paragraph to him in which the member of the Executive, Mr. Bergins, said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first school for Coloureds was established in 1658. Subsequent to that the Coloured child has largely been neglected.</block>

<p>He jumped from that date to 1964 and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the education of the Coloured became the responsibility of the Department of Coloured Affairs in 1964, a new era dawned for the Coloured child.</block>

<p>Here we have many examples of admission from the mouth of the Coloured person that this Government is treating him well. I could mention many figures in the field of welfare. In addition, the Government has gradually guided the Coloureds from the stage of common voters&#x2019; rolls to separate voters&#x2019; rolls, to the Union Coloured Council, to their representatives in this Parliament, and now eventually the Coloured Persons Representative Council, the council in which political leaders of the Coloured people are brought together. It is true that differences exist. If one read the debates of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, one would see that there are sharp differences, but the governing group, the people who gained the majority of the votes cast, are convinced, as Mr. Tom Swartz has said in this, that this Government is guiding the Coloured person along the road of separate development and that he supports this wholeheartedly.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Listening to the hon. member for Westdene on the subject of Witbank, he reminded me of a man who thought he was dead, but woke up to find that he was only dying.</p>

<p>In the course of this debate the hon. the Prime Minister and I indicated an <span class="col_5167-5168" refersTo="page_1243"/>agreement to examine the terms of the BOSS Commission to decide what should not be published for security reasons. He indicated who his members would be on that committee. I would like to inform the Committee that, with myself, there will serve the hon. member for Durban Point, Mr. Vause Raw, and the member for Durban North, Mr. Michael Mitchell.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister accused me of having attempted to denigrate Mr. Tom Swartz, the Chairman of the Coloured Representative Council. Let me give him the assurance that there was no intention of that kind whatever. I do not think that there is any denigration whatever in saying that a man is nominated as opposed to saying that he was elected.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has indicated that in so far as coloured affairs were concerned, his Cabinet had only one policy, which has been stated by the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, Mr. Jannie Loots, That is not my trouble. My trouble is what it means. He talks of parallel development and of hard work for a lifetime. Nowhere does he tell us where he is going. That is the difficulty we are faced with.</p>

<p>Then the hon. gentleman has criticized very strongly rudeness or &#x201C;onbeskoftheid&#x201D; on the part of one race to another and one human being to another. He said that that is often connected with apartheid. I agree with him. I am very glad indeed that he has given that warning. Let it at least go out from this House that there is agreement between both sides that every human being in South Africa, regardless of his race or colour, should be treated with proper regard for his person and his dignity.</p>

<p>I think we have reached the stage where this debate has come to an end. The hon. the Prime Minister and I have agreed to disagree on whether or not he is controlling the timetable to independence adequately in the Bantu homelands; we have agreed to disagree on one of the most important questions in South Africa, namely his policy in respect of the urban Bantu, about which I am still extremely unhappy; we have agreed to disagree on the question of sport and I am afraid that only time will show who has had the correct approach. I think we have also agreed to disagree on the question of the proper use of labour and manpower, which I believe is of such vital importance in our economy at the present time and we have agreed that we have different approaches towards the Cape Coloured people. I think that the discussion has been a fruitful one and I hope that, in disagreeing, we have at least from each side been able to put our views and put them in a manner which will reflect well on this Committee to the public outside.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My sole purpose in rising is to refer, with your leave, Mr. Chairman, to certain formal matters. In the first instance, the House will permit me to refer to a report in an editorial in the British newspaper <i>The Guardian,</i> which is an influential publication in some circles in Britain. In that article the statement is made that I intentionally chose this debate at this stage to make these disclosures about President Ruanda, because I want to influence President Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast in regard to the press conference which he intends holding next week. For the sake of the record I just want to point out formally that I stated in the course of the Budget debate that I would take this opportunity to make these disclosures, and that at that stage there was no talk of a press conference being held by President Houphouet-Boigny at all. This is therefore a deliberate false report which is being sent into the world by <i>The Guardian,</i> because they are also aware of these facts.</p>

<p>The second fact which I just want to put straight for the sake of the record, is that on 12th and 13th November last year the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council discussed a motion introduced by Mr. Arendse in which he proposed that a judicial commission be called for to give consideration to the restitution of full political rights to the Coloured people. That motion was voted down and an amendment introduced by the Federal Coloured People&#x2019;s Party was accepted, an amendment requesting that the Coloured people avail themselves of all the opportunities afforded to them for self-advancement. That was the view taken by the Coloured Council.</p>

<p>With reference to what my hon. friend said in respect of Witbank, I want to state formally here that, in view of the circumstances under which the election was fought, in view of the fact that it was a provincial by-election, I as the Leader of the National Party am very proud of the Nationalist voters of Witbank.</p>

<p><span class="col_5169-5170" refersTo="page_1244"/>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that he himself, the hon. member for Durban Point and the hon. member for Durban North would be members of the Committee. I shall make the report available to those three hon. members on Monday so that they may study it.</p>

<p>Then the hon the Leader of the Opposition concluded by saying that we had now conducted a very fruitful debate. I want to agree with him. That there are many matters on which we did not agree, is also true. There will still be many opportunities for debating them, for my hon. friend will still be sitting in the Opposition benches for years.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer the hon. the Deputy Minister to the question of airports. We were pleased to note the very substantial increase in the amount voted under subhead H&#x2014;Purchase and Installation of navigational aid equipment and purchase of equipment and tools. This amount was increased by R2 570 000 to R3 842 000. Unfortunately we do not have much detail as to where this navigational aid equipment will be installed. But we do know that there are some of our airports if, I remember correctly, particularly the Schoeman airport in East London, which has been waiting a number of years for additional navigational equipment to be installed. We are pleased to see that the amount voted for the installation of safety aids at our airports, has been increased. I would like to go on to deal with the very divided control which we have at our airports. We find that the planes belong to the Airways, but the airports themselves are conducted and managed by the Department of Transport. While we have the highest praise for the way the hon. the Minister of Transport runs his Railways and Airways, I am afraid to say we cannot say the same about the airports. We take one example which is very close at hand, the D. F. Malan Airport. We have warned the Minister over the years about the necessity of adding to this airport the necessary facilities to bring it up to international airport standards and we have told the Government to accept the fact that this must become an international airport. Today we still have these very out-of-date facilities.</p>

<p>And at times we have there, as my hon. friend says, chaos. At the present moment passengers coming to Cape Town are directed to the international hall and their friends cannot meet them. Elderly people have to carry their bags themselves. I was there one day when a very senior member of the Other Place arrived there, but he was not able to go in himself to meet a friend. That is not my only complaint. The general facilities leave much to be desired and I do not think that there is any excuse for this because the hon. the Minister has been warned over the years by this side of the House. It is therefore no good coming to this House and saying that passenger traffic and air travel have suddenly grown, overnight. It did not. We have warned the Minister over the years that something has to be done to our airports.</p>

<p>Hon. members know what happened at Jan Smuts Airport. It was this side of the House which had to jog the Government into activity to do something at Jan Smuts Airport. Today, after many years, we are going to see an airport of the size and with the conveniences which would be suitable for the passengers there. However, they are taking so long that that may even be out of date by the time it has been finished I know, from my own experiences, that whenever I visit Jan Smuts I am always greeted by red dust and corrugated iron. Wherever you go you find barbed wire, corrugated iron, dirt and dust and nothing which is really very pleasant. This has been going on for years. The increase in the number of passengers did not happen overnight. The Government knew this.</p>

<p>This shows a terrible lack of planning. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport laughs now. but we would like to hear from him, by way of a statement, what the future plans are for say the next ten years. We will say ten years, because we know air travel is such and it is expanding so fast that you cannot take longer periods. We would like to hear what the <span class="col_5171-5172" refersTo="page_1245"/>hon. the Minister is planning to take care of the very modern planes we will have and the enormous inflow of passengers and tourists which we will have to handle at these airports.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the D. F. Malan Airport again. There are people who say that it will not grow much bigger than it is and that it can take the 707. I predict that the 747s will be landing there. I also predict that other international airlines will be using that airport. Then we will feel ashamed when we have to ask our visitors to land at a second-rate airport. After all, we would like to see an airport here at the tip of South Africa which is up to full international standards and which has adequate runways and adequate facilities to cope with the passengers at this particular airport.</p>

<p>Then let us hear from the hon. the Minister what happened at D. F. Malan Airport when they started building and then suddenly had to dismantle half the building. What went wrong there? Who is to blame for that? What about the terrific cost? What are we going to write it off to? Surely that shows up a lack of planning. I want to come back to the old hobby-horse of mine. Is it not time for the hon. the Minister of Transport to have a good look at this position, and is it not time for him to take over the airports which his aeroplanes are using, because the ground services are being run inefficiently by the Department of Transport. Surely, the whole position shows up a terrible lack of planning. I know my colleagues here, who have travelled backwards and forwards, can tell you that. Naturally we get it, because we are Cape members. They ask &#x201C;can you not do anything about the facilities we have at D. F. Malan?&#x201D; It is a disgrace. Every time I go out there and I look at it, I am ashamed of the D. F. Malan Airport. I see the paltry bit of building that is going on there. It is a disgrace to think that they had to put un a prefabricated building to meet international standards. I ask the Minister to give us a report about exactly what he is doing. Let us get a complete report as to what he expects to do. He is planning a new airport in Durban. Let us hear about it. Let him make a statement in his Vote as to what his plans are to improve our airports in this country. Do not let us just have intermittent laughs from him. In that very thick pile of his he must have the answers. If he does not have the answers, it is time we asked the Government or the hon. the Minister of Transport, to replace him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think the hon. member for Salt River really expects me to follow up on the arguments he advanced. The speech the hon. member made was typical of a Friday afternoon speech. If one does not have a subject on which to make a speech on a Friday, one simply speaks about lack of planning and one notices everything that is bad. I prefer dealing with something of a different nature. This concerns a matter which received considerable publicity in our daily newspapers recently, i.e. the transport services which cater for our Coloured resettlement areas. This matter enjoyed publicity for various reasons in recent times&#x2014;and in Port Elizabeth for one particular reason. When speaking about Port Elizabeth, I trust that the United Party representatives of the City of Port Elizabeth will certainly discuss this matter in this debate. I hope in particular that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central will again find someone to prepare a speech for him in this connection. It is a fact that people wrote about and reports were published on this matter recently in the Cape Peninsula as well. Allow me, by way of stating the background to this matter, to say that the major resettlement areas in the Cape Peninsula are actually situated in my own constituency. For that reason I am intimately associated with this problem. On 25th March of this year a report was published in the <i>Argus</i> under banner headlines reading as follows: &#x201C;Poor transport blamed for man-hour loss&#x201D;. This report, in fact, dealt with a speech made by Prof. S. P. Cilliers of Stellenbosch at the monthly meeting of the South African Institute of the Boot and Shoe Industry. I now want to quote a few extracts from this report in order to show that learned people who are often recognized as experts in other spheres can make a slip in this practical field when speaking on a matter such as this. In this report Prof. Cilliers was reported to have said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An improvement in transport services for industrial workers in the Peninsula could relieve some of the manpower difficulties, the head of the Department <span class="col_5173-5174" refersTo="page_1246"/>of Sociology (Prof. Cilliers) said in Cape Town last night. Prof. Cilliers called on employers to seek such an improvement by approaching the authorities concerned.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It had been estimated that about 18 per cent of the industrial labour force in the Peninsula regularly arrived late for work because of transport problems. This meant that many man-hours were lost as a result of inadequate transport facilities.</block>

<p>The crux of this statement is that the position of the manpower shortage is even further being deteriorated as a result of poor transport services. The learned professor thereupon offered a very simple solution for this problem according to the report concerned. He is reported to have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prof. Cilliers called on employers to seek such an improvement by approaching the authorities concerned.</block>

<p>I want to say today that the time has possibly arrived for us to be frank in our discussions on matters of this nature. It is particularly essential for us to start being frank with our industrialists in the Western Cape in regard to this matter. I definitely cannot be accused of being unsympathetic towards industries in the Western Cape. As a matter of fact, I try to plead their cause on every occasion, as I have done during the Railway Budget debate. The crux of the matter as presented in the report I quoted, is naturally not one of poor and inadequate transport services. It is much rather a case of the existing transport services being utilized most ineffectively. If the position is deteriorating at present as is being alleged, it is actually the industrialists in the Western Cape themselves who are in no small way responsible for this state of affairs. They are responsible in that all their business undertakings have to start working at the same time in the mornings. They have constantly refused to make any changes as to the time their factories have to open in the mornings and close at night. The majority of these industries&#x2014;and I want to say almost all of them&#x2014;are organized in local associations, where matters of common interest are discussed from time to time. In this way, an association exists in the Epping industrial area which caters for that area alone. This applies to Paardeneiland as well and possibly also to the other parts of the Cape Peninsula. If these industries in specific zones could come to an agreement for some of their factories to begin work earlier while others begin work later, we would find that our transport services, our buses and our trains, could be utilized much more effectively. If the industries could come to such an arrangement, it would not only mean a considerable saving in travelling time, but it might also influence the passenger fare structure. It would also have the desired effect that full use could be made of manpower. From an economic point of view, it is unthinkable that when 70 additional passengers want to use public transport, there should be a capital outlay to the tune of R17 000 in each case for the purpose of purchasing a bus. Such bus will only be used for 40 minutes during the peak hours in the morning and will have to stand idle for the rest of the day until the peak period of 40 minutes in the afternoon. Surely, hon. members will admit that it is too much to expect that additional vehicles should be acquired only to be used economically for 1&#x00BD; hours per day out of the 24 hours. The position is that hundreds of thousands of our people want to use transport services simultaneously only twice a day. This is attributable to the fact that all our industries, our &#x00A1;business undertakings, office organizations and often our schools start at the same time in the mornings. For the rest of the day there is a surplus of buses standing idle. Not only that, also the crews of such buses are idle during slack periods. In other words, whereas we want to save manpower with additional bus services on the one hand, we want to waste it through the slack period during the day. My status probably does not permit me to appeal to our industrialists today to assist by taking active steps in adjusting the closing times of their business undertakings. However, I want to ask whether the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot make such an appeal. Would it not even be better if Prof. Cilliers himself could make such an appeal instead of trying to solve the problem by simply suggesting to industrialists &#x201C;to approach the authorities concerned&#x201D;. Sir, there are <span class="col_5175-5176" refersTo="page_1247"/>many more associated practical problems which time does not allow me to deal with, problems such as the traffic congestion we have to cope with to an increasing extent as a result of bus services during peak hours, the safety aspects associated with those problems as well as many other aspects which time does not allow me to deal with now. Sir, these are problems which exist at the moment and which will not be alleviated, but which, in fact, will be aggravated incalculably when a large-scale expansion of those services is asked for. If the hon. member for Simonstown thinks that I am pleading the cause of the bus services here because I am a shareholder of one of those bus companies, I want to save him the trouble of looking up the share registers by telling him that I do not have any shares in a public bus company.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Tygervallei has raised a very interesting question. There are two aspects of this matter that I wish to deal with because it involves the operation of the Road Transportation Board and its activities and determinations in regard to the granting of permits and licences. I want to make an appeal through the hon. the Deputy Minister to the hon. the Minister to have a look at the local Road Transportation Board and its functioning under the Act and to see whether that Act should not be reviewed in some respects. In doing that, Sir, I want to bring two instances to the attention of the hon. the Minister to illustrate my point. I do not think there is any question that in the Cape Peninsula, as in other areas, there is a grave shortage of bricks needed for housing schemes undertaken not only by Government agencies and local authority agencies, but also by private enterprise. Sir, there is a certain brick manufacturing company in the Cape, whose name I will not mention, that has been before the local Transportation Board, and was able to convince the Department of Bantu Administration of the urgency of increasing its staff and of increasing its functioning. It was accordingly allowed to recruit a labour force of 210 Bantu from the Transkei and to bring them down into the Cape area. These Bantu were to be housed at the company&#x2019;s expense at Nyanga Bantu township. The company operates some miles away from that particular Bantu housing scheme. The company was then faced with the problem of transport. It wished to work three shifts during the 24 hours. It also had different types of shifts working at different hours, and it then investigated the question of transport from the factory area, which was at Killarney, to Nyanga. It found that it could itself establish its own bus service so as to keep the labour force in a happy and contented state. There would be no hanging around for public transport; as soon as the shifts were over the Bantu were to be taken back to Nyanga. This company found that it could provide transport for these employees at a cost to itself, which it found economic, of R18 720 a year or R1 440 per four week month. It was prepared to do this. But the company, as the Minister will know, had to go to the local Road Transportation Board. Before doing that, however, application was made to one of the licensed bus companies. As against a cost of R18 720 a year to the brick-making company, this company quoted R58 608 a year for the installation of a bus service. Sir, that figure was more than three times as much as it would have cost the manufacturer to provide his own service. It was estimated that this R58 608 a year would be appreciably higher because there would have to be additional trips because of the nature of the undertaking, and in any case, certain additional employees would have to be employed by the bus company at a further cost to themselves. Eventually when this brickmaking company decided that this was an unreasonable figure, it had further negotiations and the passenger transport company was then prepared to come down to a figure which was only twice as much as it would have cost the brick-making company itself. This company&#x2019;s application for a licence to transport its own employees was refused. Sir, there may be some explanation, but for the life of me I cannot see and no industrialist in Cape Town can see why this application should have been refused. Sir, I am mentioning this to the hon. the Minister because I think the hon. the Minister should give further consideration to the question as to whether this system is working correctly.</p>

<p>I now want to go on to another matter and that is the recent increase of bus fares in the Cape Peninsula. As you will be aware, Mr. Chairman, if a company makes application for an increase, it notifies the local Transportation Board; the board then advertises that it has received such an application <span class="col_5177-5178" refersTo="page_1248"/>and then sits to hear the application. The parties in this application are the bus company concerned, the board which is to determine the application and what I might term the amorphous mass of the general travelling public, which is not an organized body or a particular person who can be cited &#x201C;you are going to be charged more unless you come and appear before this particular tribunal and show why you should not be charged more&#x201D;. Well, what happened was that on the 1st July, 1970, City Tramways Ltd. which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tollgate Holdings Limited, lodged an application for increased bus fares. On the 17th July, 1970, a notice was published in the Press to the effect that the application could be considered on the 31st July, 14 days later. Ratepayers&#x2019; associations, even if they wanted to do something about it, could hardly call the necessary meetings within 14 days. This application was heard on the 31st July and on that day an <i>ex parte</i> schedule was put in by the company, setting out the reasons why it thought that there should be an increase. There were one or two members of the public who inarticulately tried to express their objections, and on that very same day approval was granted for the bus fares to be increased. The fares varied from one cent to two cents per stage and there were various alterations in the stages in the Cape Town municipal area. The company which made this application was involved in something like 100 million passenger journeys per annum. There were some reductions of fares in certain areas but on the whole the fares were increased, and an increase of one cent on each of the 100 million passenger journeys netted an extra R1 000 000 per annum for the company. Sir, my point is that this decision was made on the same day on <i>ex parte</i> statements put in by the accountant of the company concerned. The case of City Tramways, in brief was that it was facing an increase in its wage bill of approximately R600 000 per annum. Sir, to cover that, an increase of less than one cent per passenger journey was sufficient. It seems from the record&#x2014;and I will quote portions of the record to you, Sir&#x2014; that this was a very hurried decision and that the Board, apparently quite correct legally, did not deem it its duty to analyse the accounts of the company concerned to satisfy itself as to the necessity for these increases. An appeal was noted in that matter on the 4th September, 1970, by a ratepeayers&#x2019; association and by one of the persons concerned in one portion of the area affected by these increases. That appeal was heard five months later, on the 1st February, 1971. Sir, the board gave its reasons for the increases, as it had to do for the purpose of the appeal, and it gave the following reasons&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reasons for the Board&#x2019;s decision were, firstly, that the Industrial Tribunal having made an award prescribing increased wages and improved conditions of employment for members of the Tramways and Omnibus Workers&#x2019; Union, Cape, which award incorporates substantial increases in wages for members of the said union, in addition to which the applicant company has to adjust the wages of other employees who are not members of this union, the applicant company will in the near future also have to adjust the wages of other employees who are not members of this union. This wage increase will cost the company an amount of R413 591 per annum. This figure is for the first year of operation only. Thereafter the cost will be higher &#x2026;</block>

<p>The board then went on to record certain other factors, which brought the total to roughly R600 000. Then the board gave as another reason for its decision &#x201C;that the company will not be able to meet the additional expenditure and provide an adequate return on capital unless the fares are increased&#x201D;. With all respect to the members of the board, one wants to know how they applied their minds to a question of this nature, affecting almost every bus route in the Peninsula, on the same day that they received a memorandum. No detailed, audited or company accounts were placed before the board, and yet on that very same day they found that the company would not be able to meet this additional expenditure.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Salt River spoke about certain facilities at airports. We had the same old story again to the effect that the planning was inadequate, and so forth. If the hon. member had done his homework properly, he would have been much more satisfied with what this side of the <span class="col_5179-5180" refersTo="page_1249"/>House and our Ministers had done to bring about an improvement in this matter. I think I may fruitfully leave this matter in the hands of the hon. the Minister, because there are other matters in which I am interested and which I would like to discuss. The same applies to the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>In regard to planning, there is one matter which has interested me a great deal and with which I was closely associated in the past. This concerns the civil aviation subsidy scheme, which was introduced on 1st September, 1954. I was one of the first applicants who was able to make use of this scheme. I think that I would be failing in my duty this afternoon if I did not say a few words about this scheme and also indicate what progress has been made in this field. I also want to indicate of what value this scheme is. This scheme is being administered by the Department of Transport in conjunction with the Department of Defence, the Aero Club of South Africa, the Commercial Aviation Association of South Africa and the Aeroplane Owners&#x2019; Association and the Pilots&#x2019; Association of South Africa, of which I had the honour to be a founder member. During the first five years of its existence, since 1954, the intention was to train pilots and since then it was established on a three-year basis, which means that it has been in existence for an uninterrupted period from 1954 up till the present. The scheme provides for the training of private pilots, for the initial issuing of private pilots&#x2019; licences, the renewal of licences after advanced training, for commercial pilots&#x2019; licences and diplomas for instrumentation and for instructors as well as the subsidization of the purchase of glider aircraft and parachute equipment. These grants are made on a certain basis. The conditions vary, but I have no fault to find with these conditions, and owing to lack of time I shall not discuss this matter in great detail.</p>

<p>However, I just want to mention that these grants for the subsidies for the 1970-&#x2019;71 financial year have already been made. 370 candidates are benefiting a great deal through these grants. Provision has been made for training at 46 different training institutions. Private pilots&#x2019; licences have been issued to 101 persons for the first time. 232 persons are having their private pilots&#x2019; licences renewed, 24 persons will receive their commercial pilots&#x2019; licences, seven persons will receive their instructors&#x2019; diplomas and six will receive diplomas for instrumentation. Furthermore, seven clubs have been selected for parachute subsidies, while one club has been selected for a glider craft subsidy. The last mentioned two awards were made on the recommendation of the Aero Club of South Africa. Sir, I say that when one considers these awards that have been made and the particularly important position that flying occupies in South Africa, and also the high demands that will be made on pilots in future when flying and the aeroplane as we know it in South Africa will gain full recognition, you will appreciate that planning did, in fact, take place in this field. I should like to mention that up to the present the substantial amount of R523 835 was made available for this purpose, 1 940 candidates were trained for their private flying licences, 2118 were able to renew their private licences during this period and that 234 persons were able to obtain commercial licences and diplomas through this scheme. I say this is one of the methods that has been employed within the Department to bring about the necessary planning in order to cope with this great need which is going to arise in the Republic of South Africa as far as pilots are concerned.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the hon. the Minister announced during the previous Parliamentary session that an inter-departmental committee of inquiry into the planning of airports in South Africa would be appointed. This does not include State-owned airports. As far as I understand, this committee has been appointed. The Departments of Transport, of Finance, the Treasury, of Planning, of Community Development and of Defence and all the provincial administrations are represented on this committee. In other words, by giving representation to all these bodies on this inter-departmental committee, matters pertaining to airports in the country are being thoroughly investigated. The first meeting has taken place and it is recommended that interested parties should submit their representations. We are aware of the fact that there is a great need for civil aviation airports, particularly in our major cities, but also in the rural areas. This matter will be properly investigated by this committee, which will also determine the priorities in order to plan this whole question of airports also as far as South Africa is concerned. We are aware of the fact that there are major problems particularly in our major cities such as Cape Town, where only <span class="col_5181-5182" refersTo="page_1250"/>Rondevlei is available for this purpose, which is not very suitable and, in addition, Fisantekraal, which is situated approximately 25 miles from Cape Town and you know Sir, that private pilots, when using these airports, want them to be within easy reach. We know that on the Rand the smog at certain of our airports, such as Rand Central and Germiston, is so thick that it actually constitutes a danger to private pilots. We do not want to discourage those private pilots who are not capable of doing instrument flying as yet, and since land is becoming so expensive around our cities and since these airports should actually serve the purpose of satellite airports for our State-owned airports, we are very glad that the necessary planning is being undertaken in this field as well and that the Department of Transport has appointed this Committee to go into the whole question of airports in the Republic. One of its major tasks will be to make the necessary arrangements in regard to finance. According to the report of the Marais Commission local authorities will be responsible for the finance. This will naturally place a heavy burden on local authorities, particularly on our smaller local authorities. For that reason I would really appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could tell us something more about the financial aspect of this matter. I do not know what progress has been made in the matter; these are important matters. I should be glad if the hon. the Minister could give us an indication of what progress has been made in regard to these services as well as those other services as far as civil aviation is concerned.</p>

<p>I trust that the hon. member for Heilbron will forgive me if I do not follow his subject. I wish to complete what I was saying to the hon. the Minister with regard to the application of the City Tramway Company of Cape Town for increased fares. As I have indicated, when the local Transportation Board met, they had no accounts of the company before them. The City Tramways Company is a company within a group of companies known as Tollgate Holdings. I have been furnished with an analysis of the groups, accounts, which includes the accounts of the City Tramways. I might also mention for the information of the hon. the Minister, that at the hearing for the appeal, the attorney appearing for the Ratepayers&#x2019; Association asked whether he could have the audited accounts of the company to see that the increase was justified. His request was refused. The accounts were never produced and they never appeared before the National Transport Commission in dealing with the appeal. I sent an analysis of these accounts to the hon. the Minister last year. As he correctly indicated to me at that stage, the matter was <i>sub judice</i> and consequently he could not comment on the figures at that stage, as he was awaiting the outcome of the appeal. The appeal has, however, since been concluded.</p>

<p>What does the analysis of the accounts of this group of companies, which would be in such dire stress if it did not get the substantial increase in tariff in the City of Cape Town, show? I will quote some brief extracts from the analysis of the accounts. Firstly, I want to deal with the question of wages. This group has progressed with the development of Cape Town and, naturally, its passenger journeys have increased. One finds that, whereas in 1962 salaries and wages represented 60,4 per cent of the general expenditure, by 1969 salaries only represented 50 per cent of expenditure. There were other undertakings within this group. The group carries its own insurance, houses its own vehicles and tends to its own garaging. All this is done on an inter-company basis. When one looks at the company&#x2019;s profits, the net profit in 1962, after tax had been deducted, was R774 000. In 1969 the net profit was R1 654 000.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I will give you the figures percentagewise. If one looks at the net earnings of the ordinary shares in cents the figure was 14 cents in 1962 and 27,4 cents in 1969. The dividends per ordinary share in 1962 was 4,8 cents and in 1969 10 cents per share.</p>

<p>The shares have been split. I will come to that in a moment. Originally they were R2 shares. They have since been divided into R1 shares and certain capitalization shares were issued as well. On a percentage basis, the figures are 4,8 cents in 1962 and 10 cents in 1969.</p>

<p>It was 4,8 cents to 10 cents per share between 1962 and 1969. I want to give you the net worth of the ordinary shares too. It was 83 cents in 1962 and 193 cents in 1969. This is an analysis done by an outside, chartered accountant. He has drawn attention to these factors and I draw attention to them, because I believe that they are factors which should be regarded as material by the Road Transportation Board in considering whether or not an increase of the tariffs is justified.</p>

<p>Yes, I will get to that. What I am getting at is that whatever the figures, are, the figures here indicate that the company has progressed over these years. Whatever they were, neither the local Transportation Board itself nor the National Transport Commission sitting as a board of appeal considered these accounts. They accepted the <i>ex parte</i> statements which had been presented by the accountants on behalf of this company.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister can ask me one other question, and that is whether any accountant in Cape Town or in South Africa can look at these group accounts and analyse them on the same day as the application is heard and then also grant the application on the same day. Let me go further. The networth of the ordinary shares improved from 83 cents in 1962 to 193 in 1969. That indicates a growth factor of 132 per cent, or 19 per cent per year. Compare this with the economic growth rate of 5 per cent per annum. I will give hon. members some other figures. I have mentioned the deficit already. In 1966 there was a free capitalization issue of 5 for 7, which was made to shareholders in this company. Under the trackless tram system this company had to pay 7 per cent of their profits to the Cape Town City Council. That has gone; this figure does not allow for that figure any more since the company now runs diesel buses. The Cape Provincial Administration, as the hon. the Minister is aware, made a grant of R320 000 to this company to assist in the financing of the changeover into separate White and non-White buses. To my mind, and to the mind of the public of Cape Town, it seems quite apparent from the above that there was no justification for these increases. However, if one goes further, and if one wants to know what the chairman of the company has said in presenting the annual accounts, I read more or less what he has said since I have not the exact words at hand, one finds that the City Tramways made a substantial contribution to the profits of this company. The chairman said so himself in presenting his annual report. As I said, I sent this information to the hon. the Minister and at the time he replied to me and he said that the matter was <i>sub judice.</i> In this letter from his private secretary, dated the 2nd November, 1970, there is a paragraph which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For your information, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the National Transport Commission is a statutory autonomous body and in accordance with <span class="col_5185-5186" refersTo="page_1252"/>the provisions of the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, its decision is final in matters of this nature.</block>

<p>That is correct; that is the correct state of the legal position. However, if that is so, then I believe it is our duty to the travelling public to see that there is machinery whereby they are properly represented to deal with applications for increases. If the board is going to sit purely in judgment and if it does not act as a auditing scrutineering body, then there must be some other means whereby the general public can be represented. It is wrong that the general public should be expected, somehow or another, to get together in 14 days, brief counsel, engage attorneys and arrange representation in order to have their case properly argued.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister. This has happened before. In this particular case there were one or two persons present. When the appeal came before the National Transport Commission, the matter was dealt with in the best way it could be dealt with on the information which was before the commission. However, I still want to know &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>They could still ask for an extension of time.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister is not getting my point. When an application is made for an increase of bus fares, it affects the general public. If I am going to ask a certain group of persons or a certain lessee to pay more rent, he knows that it affects him directly. Is the pensioner in Green Point constituency, who is struggling enough as it is, to go to an attorney, say that he would like to be represented before the Transportation Board? Another point is that there is a break in the procedure whereby there is no adequate representation of the general public as such who will be affected by any decision of the board. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister. This has happened before. He may find that a similar position has occurred elsewhere. I do not know because that matter is still <i>sub judice</i> and therefore I am not sure of the position. There is no formal representation, some public accountant for instance, to deal with the matter on behalf of the public, to see that the case before the Transportation Board is properly considered.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the final conclusion. the most extraordinary one in this record of proceedings. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">The Board took cognizance of the fact that the appeal involves only the grant of the increase of fares on the Cape Town&#x2014;Bantry Bay route whilst the increase in fares is in respect of all the routes served by the Respondent Company, and that a reduction in fares in respect of this particular route would have been impracticable, having regard to the fact that what is effective here is a five-stage fare and that this route is the most patronized route operated by respondent company.</block>

<p>In other words, because one group of users had appealed, they must be penalized because the other groups in other parts of the municipality did not appeal. Perhaps the hon. the Minister could look into this matter. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Green Point will understand if I do not folllow up on what he said, not because I am not interested in the matter he has raised but because I want to use all my time to discuss this particular matter I am about to raise.</p>

<p>This question of road safety is one which was dealt with during a discussion of a motion in this House earlier this year. However, I regard road safety as of such great national importance that I am taking the liberty of raising this matter once again this afternoon in the knowledge that the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister also have this matter at heart. In the course of my address I shall try to focus attention on two matters, i.e. that <span class="col_5187-5188" refersTo="page_1253"/>there is a fundamental need for knowledge of this matter and, secondly, that there is a fundamental need to make motorists aware of their responsibilities towards society. May I once more remind hon. members of the serious nature of this matter. The C.S.I.R. estimated in 1968 that road accidents are costing us R96 million per year, 37 per cent of which represents costs in respect of victims alone. The annual cost is equal to five disasters of the magnitude we had at Ceres. In addition, we must take into account the fact, for example, that it was found by one insurance company that the toll of human lives is the highest in the age group 16 to 30 years and represented 60 per cent of all claims dealt with by that company. According to the finding, the number of deaths as a result of motor accidents is four times the number of deaths as a result of other causes. In spite of this, road accidents receive very little attention and it matters very little when people are killed in the prime of their lives. It matters very little when intimate friends may be involved in road accidents, because we have not made people conscious of their responsibilities.</p>

<p>For that reason the second object of my address constitutes a dynamic campaign on a national level. We are aware of the fact that there are co-ordinating committees and that a certain amount of liaison is taking place between the provinces in those committees in regard to this matter. We are also aware of the important work which is being undertaken by the South African Road Safety Council. Notwithstanding all this I suggest that there is a need for a dynamic road safety campaign to be launched on a national level such as, for example, the Water Year. If we could conceive of the ideal of an accident free situation, it would have to have the following components: a perfect traffic communication system, control measures in respect of the flow of traffic, perfection of the ability to drive a motor vehicle and perfection in regard to the control of the standardization of motor vehicles and their roadworthiness. The construction of roads and safety factors in regard to roads, for example, flexible lamp posts and traffic signs, should also be perfect. However, we realize that all these components I have mentioned can only be obtained in the long term through planning and great expenditure. I suggest that, as far as the driver of motor vehicles is concerned, we are able to obtain material results in the short term. Surely, one can make a better driver of a person by appealing to his conscience. Surely, we can affect better control of a person&#x2019;s emotions by applying spiritual therapy. We can obtain material results in the short term. We can obtain these results at the least possible cost. I am asking myself the question: How can a campaign such as this be launched? The campaign will probably have to be launched by a sub-committee of the Department of Transport. This will also have to be done with the co-operation and coordination of all four provinces and South-West Africa. Finally, this can be done with the assistance of a special force of reservists which could be established. This matter has been advocated before and to my mind this is practical and realistic and this is a factor which may be of assistance in such a dynamic campaign. In regard to the long-term, it is interesting to note that during an international conference on road safety in London in 1966, all the speakers said that they knew of no country in the world which had a fundamental and intimate knowledge of road traffic. When syllabuses are drawn up for universities by planners, these syllabuses mainly concern the technical aspects of the environment, the construction of roads and bridges, and so forth. An intimate knowledge of traffic and the inter-actions between traffic and the human being do not, as far as their knowledge goes, constitute a subject for special study. I therefore believe that a university could fruitfully consider the possibility of establishing a Chair of this nature.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I rise, Sir, to place on record certain facts and at the same time to give certain hon. members the privilege of proving their <i>bona fides</i> to me. If they fail to do that, they must accept that from now on they will be <i>personae non gratae</i> in all discussions with me in future.</p>

<p>On 9th March, three members of the Opposition requested an informal interview with me with the object of discussing the Port Elizabeth transport problem. I granted them this interview. At the discussion they informed me that they were in full agreement with the letter written to the member for Walmer. This letter reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I write in connection with your letter of 3rd March, addressed to Mr. Eksteen of Cape Town regarding your inquiries about an increase of bus fares in Port Elizabeth. My reply thereto is as follows:</block>

<p>In terms of section 6 (1) (c) of the Motor Carrier Transportation Act. 1930, as amended, it is the function and duty of a local road transportation board to receive and consider applications for motor carrier certificates or for amendment of such certificates and, subject to the provisions of the Act, in its discretion to refuse such applications or to grant them in full or in part. Furthermore, in terms of section 7 (2) (b) of Act No. 39 of 1930, a local board is empowered to lay down the scale of charges upon the grant of a certificate and in its discretion on application by the holder of the certificate, to alter such charges.</p>

<p>The National Transport Commission will only deal with a matter if an appeal is noted against the local board&#x2019;s decision.</p>

<p>A local board considers such applications on merit and gives judgment thereon with due regard to the provisions of Act 39 of 1930 and any representations that may have been submitted to it in support of or in opposition to such application.</p>

<p>The application for the increase of bus fares in Port Elizabeth was published in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> dated 22nd January, 1971. Any person interested in the proposed increase of fares could have gained access to such further information as may directly have affected him and which may have been furnished by the applicant in connection with the application. Any such person would also have been allowed to appear before the local Road Transportation Board. Port Elizabeth, and to make representations verbally at the meeting when the application was considered.</p>

<p>In conclusion I may add that local road transportation boards and the National Transport Commission are autonomous bodies and neither the Minister of Transport nor the Deputy Minister can interfere with their decisions.</p>

<p>Sir, I also want the hon. member for Green Point to note the relevant provisions of the Act. I also informed the three hon. members that since this letter had been written I had received certain information from the Secretary for Transport. I actually read this information out to them. It is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have now been advised that the two appeals against the local board&#x2019;s decision have been lodged this morning.</block>

<p><span class="col_5191-5192" refersTo="page_1255"/>This letter is dated the 9th. It continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This matter is therefore <i>sub judice</i> and any further representations in this connection should be directed to the National Transport Commission in Pretoria.</block>

<p>I therefore informed the hon. members that this case was <i>sub judice.</i> Let me now quote a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 14th March, 1971. This report refers to the Coloured township of Gelvandale. Let me read only the following paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But what about the first part of the story? What about a rise in bus fares that is nicely fixed up over the heads of Coloured passengers who are given no legitimate means of expressing their objection?</block>

<p>*Sir, if ever a lie was sent out into the world, then it was this one in which the <i>Sunday Times</i> told the world that an increase in bus fares had been granted over the heads of the Coloured people. This was actually done in a dishonest manner, as is insinuated in this article, without the people who have to pay those fares, being afforded any opportunity of expressing their objections. That is how I know the <i>Sunday Times,</i> Sir. It is no wonder that some people are calling it the &#x201C;Sunday Liar&#x201D; nowadays.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to come back to the hon. members to whom I have already referred.</p>

<p>The next morning I tried to contact the three members, but only the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central was still in Cape Town. He disputed the report and even went so far as to mention that he phoned the newspaper reporter and in no uncertain terms denied the correctness of the report. This was done by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central.</p>

<p>*I told the hon. member about my Press statement, and I think I should give it to this House so that hon. members may know in future what the functions of the National Transport Commission are. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This morning the Deputy Minister of Transport, Mr. Martins, vehemently denied a front-page report in the <i>Cape Times</i> under the heading &#x201C;Minister to Probe P.E. Bus Troubles&#x201D;. This report creates the impression that he has allegedly been interfering with transport matters falling exclusively under the relevant local road transportation board, Port Elizabeth, and the National Transport Commission. The Deputy Minister admits that he had an interview last night with Messrs. Kingwill, Myburgh Streicher and Cillie, United Party members of the House of Assembly, at their request. The Deputy Minister informed the deputation that the application for an increase in the bus fares &#x2026;</block>

<p>And you should note the dates, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; had been lodged with the local road transportation board, Port Elizabeth, on 5th January, 1971. In terms of the provisions of the Motor Carrier Transportation Act the application was published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 22nd January, 1971, and considered by the local board, Port Elizabeth, on 23rd February, 1971. Prior to and in the course of the hearing no objection, neither orally nor in writing, was lodged against the application. Having examined the whole matter fully, the local board considered and approved the matter on its merits and with due regard to the provisions of the Motor Carrier Transportation Act. Furthermore, the Deputy Minister explicitly informed the deputation that two appeals had been lodged against the decision of the local board, and that at that stage the whole matter was <i>sub judice.</i></block>

<p><span class="col_5193-5194" refersTo="page_1256"/>The National Transport Commission, under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Transport, would hear and dispose of these appeals at any time. Furthermore &#x2026;</p>

<p>And it is important for you to listen to this, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he made it very clear to the deputation that the National Transport Commission and the road transportation boards were autonomous bodies, and that neither the Minister nor the Deputy Minister had any power to interfere with the decisions of the said bodies. They had never done so, nor would they do so now. Replying to the deputation&#x2019;s question as to whether the National Transport Commission had the right to investigate whether the existing transport matters in any area were satisfactory and adequate, the Deputy Minister explained that the Transport Commission investigated any matter relating to transport in the Republic of South Africa and made recommendations to the Minister in that regard. In conclusion the Deputy Minister sharply criticized the impression which the <i>Cape Times</i> had tried to create, i.e. that he would go to Port Elizabeth in order to resolve the dispute about the bus fares, and said that it was devoid of all truth. What he had in fact said, was that if it would serve any good purpose, the Mayor of Port Elizabeth was free, if he so wished, to discuss with him the entire transport complex in and around Port Elizabeth, and that he would be prepared to do so, but under no circumstances would he discuss with anybody the efficiency or inefficiency of individual transport enterprises. Even if he were to give a hearing to the Mayor on transport matters in general, he would nevertheless request him to make his representations in writing.</block>

<p>I want to say that hon. members were entitled to say that I was going to Port Elizabeth and that I would be prepared to have talks there with the Mayor or the City Council on the overall transport problems in Port Elizabeth, but not on this matter of bus transport. But after I had said this to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central and he had shown me in writing what the thoughts were which hon. members had conveyed to the local newspapers, and with which I agreed, I nevertheless found the following report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> the following day&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, it is not a case of &#x201C;shame&#x201D;; it is a fact. Hon. members of this House of Assembly should not put into the mouth of a Deputy Minister words which infringe and cast doubts upon the autonomy of the Road Transportation Board and the National Transport Commission, for then the Act does not mean a thing. At a later stage I shall come back to the functions of the Road Transportation Board and the National Transport Commission when I reply to the charge made by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>Sir, now I come to the hon. member for Salt River, who was the main speaker on the Opposition side at the start of this debate. The hon. member made three points: He said that the South African Airways had to take over the control over our airports; secondly, he requested that more navigational aids be made available by the Airways, and, thirdly, he made the charge that there was no planning at our airports. Sir, I have never heard a more unpatriotic speech being made in regard to our airports in South Africa. In connection with our airports the hon. member said. &#x201C;It is a disgrace.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, now he allows the Whip to dictate to him: he does not listen. Sir, may I please have the attention of the hon. member for Salt River? The Railways, the Airways and the Post Office are run on a business footing. I want the hon. member to take cognisance of that. The Railways builds its own railway lines and stations. Unlike the Railways, which has a monopoly of railway transport, the Airways is but one of the many other airlines using the airports. It has no more say than has any of the others, except for the fact that we see to it that, where possible, our own Airways has preference. The Airways is out and out an airline. It has to build hangars for housing its aircraft and maintaining them. However, it would be wrong if the country&#x2019;s airline also had control over the airports, whilst there are numerous other airlines which are also using the airports. Unlike the Airways an airport is not a business concern, but a national or international organization which, on an equitable basis, provides in the needs of all the other airlines which have acquired rights locally. That is the principal reason why the airports ought not to be linked with a specific airline, but why the State, i.e. the Department of Transport, should provide such airlines with these facilities. I want to say at once that there is no lack of the necessary and essential co-ordination between the South African Airways and the Department of Transport in regard to our airports.</p>

<p>Sir, before reacting specifically to the charge made by the hon. member, I want to refer very briefly to the navigational aids which the hon. member requested. I am going to mention only a few of them. I think that South Africa can be very proud of the navigational aids that have already been provided. South Africa compares well with all the other countries in the world. It is essential for this to be placed on record, for this matter concerns the safety of our entire airline in South Africa. I am only going to take three airports as examples.</p>

<p>In the first place, we have at Bloemfontein (at the J. B. M. Hertzog airport), a flight information centre. I want to explain the abbreviations now and merely refer to them later on, for these are international terms. NDB (main), with high power, is in service there. The abbreviation stands for non-directional beacon. Secondly, VOR/DME means very high frequency omnidirectional range and distance-measuring equipment. Then there is the abbreviation TACAN: tactical air navigation system. I just want to mention <span class="col_5197-5198" refersTo="page_1258"/>that all this equipment is already in service at those airports. VDF, very high frequency direction-finding equipment, is also in service there. SRE is the surveillance radar element. The order for that equipment has been placed and it will come into operation in 1971-&#x2019;72. We are still dealing with Bloemfontein only. R/T means radio telephony, and that is connected with aerodrome control, route and long-distance BHF. At the moment we have both the low and the high power in service at all three of these airports. A teleprinter from that airport to Jan Smuts, Cape Town, Kimberley, Maseru, Port Elizabeth, Upington. Keetmanshoop, Windhoek and Welkom is already in service. A W/T (radio telegraphy) point-to point system with high power, is already available. Telephonic communication from this airport is already available to Bloem-spruit, Jan Smuts, Kimberley, Port Elizabeth and Welkom. This is already in service. Runway lights of low intensity are already in service at both runways. VASI (visual approach slope indicator) is already in service at runways 02 and 20. Those at runways 12 and 30 will be installed in 1971-72. I am not going to deal with the airport at Durban. I am only going to point out what we have at the D. F. Malan and Jan Smuts airports.</p>

<p>At Jan Smuts we have the following equipment. I have already furnished the relevant abbreviations. NDB, high power, in service. Localizer with low power is in service at Hartebeestpoortdam, Meyerton and at New Largo. VOR/DME, i.e. very high frequency non-directional beacon distance measuring equipment, is in service. VOR (Hartebeestpoortdam) will be installed in 1971-72. ILS, i.e. instrument landing system, is already in service. TACAN, which I have already mentioned, is already in service. VDF is already in service. SRE is already in service. SSR, i.e. a secondary radar element, is being planned for 1972-73. Furthermore, aerodrome control with low power and Route (with SELCAL) and long distance BHF, with high power, are also in service. SELCAL is the selective calling system. All of these are already in service. A teleprinter is in service from that airport to, for instance, Bloemfontein, Durban, Gabarones, Cape Town, Louren&#x00E7;o Marques, Matsapa, Phalaborwa, Pretoria ABL, Salisbury and Waterkloof. In addition a radio telephone to Kinshasa is already in service. Telephones to Bloemfontein, Dunnottar, Durban, Germiston,</p>

<p>Pretoria ABL, Pietersburg, Swartkop, Waterkloof and Wonderboom are already in service. The W/T, i.e. point-to-point radio telegraphy with high power, is already in service there. Two runways have high intensity runway lights in service, whereas one of them has low intensity runway lights in service. In this way the centre-line lights on the main runway will also be put into service in 1972. Approach lights (full Calvert in southern approach to main runway) will be installed in 1972. VASI is already in service at runways 21, 09, 27 and 33. It will be installed at runways 03 and 15 in 1971. Then there is also the light beacon service. I am only mentioning these two airports. If there are any questions on the D. F. Malan airport, I shall gladly deal with them. I am mentioning these safety navigational aids because the hon. member cast doubts on the navigational aids which we have in South Africa. I want to tell hon. members that the aids which we have in South Africa for navigational purposes, are not only on a par with the best, but also amongst the best in the world. That is Why we have this fine record of safety and safe landings in South Africa.</p>

<p>Now, the hon. member for Salt River also referred to planning, etc. I want to tell hon. members that I believe that in all the years during which I have been in this House, I have never listened to a debate which commenced on as low a level as the level on which the hon. member for Salt River introduced this debate. The hon. member started so low that he could not descend any lower, but could only go higher. However, he never went any higher. He started by launching an attack on the inefficiency of the airports and concentrated on the D. F. Malan and Jan Smuts airports. He said they were a disgrace. As hon. members are aware, major building operations are in progress at both of these airports. As a result one must expect to find some red dust, sheets of corrugated iron, etc., there. Such things are to be seen anywhere in the world where building operations are in progress. When the Jan Smuts airport was planned, and after that, experts of my department often went abroad in order to make a study of the airports of the world.</p>

<p>In fact, I myself had the opportunity to take a look at three of these airports.</p>

<p>In that case I say it is untrue. If the hon. member were as interested as all that, he had the opportunity of going to the Department of Public Works and asking for the plans so that he could see what was being done at the D. F. Malan airport. If he had done that, he could have come to this House with positive criticism. But he did not do that. He does not know what is being done there at all. He simply wants to level criticism here, without being able to substantiate it. It is a fact that certain parts of the building had to be altered so as to adapt to circumstances which nobody could have foreseen. That does not only happen here. As I have tried to explain, those things happen owing to the rapid development in the sphere of aviation, and they take place all over the world. What does the hon. member want us to do? Should we, having received a projection of the new developments, simply have ignored them and proceeded with the building, as it was at that stage, only to be saddled later on with the further increased costs entailed in building again, or should we have kept pace with these developments? After all. an airport is a living organism which grows along with the Airways. The costs incurred in respect of the alterations made to the building, were essential and are justifiable. If hon. members ask me for them, I can furnish them with the figures. It is not a question of &#x201C;lack of planning&#x201D;, as was said by the hon. member, but a question of constant adjustment in order to adapt the building operations, as they progress, to the requirements of circumstances, so that the building may not be obsolete by the time it has been completed. The hon. member also said, &#x201C;I am ashamed of the D. F. Malan airport; it is a disgrace. I see the paltry bit of building that is going on there. It is a disgrace to think that they have to put up a prefabricated building to meet international standards.&#x201D; These are the words which the hon. member used here. That merely goes to show up the hon. member&#x2019;s ignorance. In the first place, the international hall is not a &#x201C;prefabricated&#x201D; building but, on the contrary, a very sophisticated pre-constructed building. [Laughter.] The hon. members are laughing, but that shows up their ignorance once again. This is a building which complies with the best standards. And then the hon. member refers to &#x201C;a lack of facilities&#x201D;, without specifying what &#x201C;facilities&#x201D;. All I have received so far was praise and appreciation for those parts of the building which are in service already.</p>

Then there will also <span class="col_5201-5202" refersTo="page_1260"/>be time for hon. members to make speeches. While the existing building is being converted so as to meet modern requirements for aviation, the international hall is being used, when there are no international flights, for letting through incoming, domestic passengers. This is being done very successfully and has greatly relieved the position at the existing building, where the building operations are still taking up certain parts of the building.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is what the hon. member says, yes. The hon. member should rather listen. Incoming passengers, from both domestic and international flights, are processed through the airport, from the aircraft, within a minimum of time. It has never taken international passengers longer than 20 minutes to go through the airport. Can hon. members show me any other place in the world where this is being done within a shorter period of time? In this manner between 100 and 139 passengers are being taken through the airport procedure, and if one thinks of all the formalities, i.e. customs, visas, etc., that have to be finalized, this is indeed a feat. By way of interjection the hon. member said that those building alterations were being made with considerable inconvenience to the passengers. It takes domestic passengers between 12 and 15 minutes to dispose of all the formalities at the airport.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River said that one could not meet one&#x2019;s guests in the hall. That does not happen anywhere in the world. All over the world passengers have to go through all these procedures first; in other words, they must go through the customs and other departments before they can be met by their people. However, we are only using this procedure temporarily. Secondly, nowhere in the world are people allowed to meet passengers on the runway.</p>

<p>From a safety point of view this is not desirable, especially as a result of the hi-jacking of aircraft in recent times. Now I want to give hon. members an example. Last Friday 96 passengers were taken through that building within 13 minutes, with all the procedures that involves. I hope the hon. member will remember that. I think this is a feat of which other airports can be jealous. Now the hon. member says that the people are carrying their own suitcases. I want to tell hon. members that there are enough porters, and if at some moment or other one is not available, one can merely wait two to three minutes until one is available. But this also shows me how ease-loving people are. I do not mind carrying my own suitcases, and in the rest of the world everybody carries his own suitcases. It is only here in South Africa where we are so ease-loving and where we no longer want to carry our own suitcases.</p>

<p>As an international hall, the pre-constructed building has already proved itself most adequately, so much so that similar buildings are already being planned at the Louis Botha airport at Durban. I want hon. members to take cognizance of that. These will be similar buildings, and we are not ashamed of them. While I am speaking about the pre-constructed building, I want to point out to the hon. member for Salt River, who is apparently unfamiliar with the requirements for airports, that this is the type of building which will in future be built at airports to an increasing extent; not only in South Africa, but also all over the world. It has been found that as a result of the rapid development of aviation, adaptations are necessary all the time, and that an airport soon becomes obsolete. Airports which can be amortized after ten or 15 years, appear to be the answer. By that time they can make room for new ones which can fit in with modern requirements. Once the building operations at the D. F. Malan airport have been completed, it will be an airport which will be able to meet all the needs for the next eight or ten years. It will, if necessary, even be able to handle the Jumbo jets, which, according to the hon. member&#x2019;s prediction, will come.</p>

<p>The Jan Smuts airport should be viewed in a different context, for this airport is the gateway to the Republic of South Africa. Care is being taken to ensure that this will be a prestige airport of which we as South Africans will be proud. Once the airport has been completed, it will undoubtedly be possible to compare it with the best airports in the world for its size. In a moment I shall quote statistics to indicate what is being done. It is obvious that when alterations are being made to <span class="col_5203-5204" refersTo="page_1261"/>buildings, one will find this dust about which the hon. member complained so much. It is very clear to me that the hon. member did not know what was happening. I cannot omit to point out to the hon. member that I think he obtained his prejudice to this airport from a press report which was coupled with the thesis written by a certain architectural student on this airport. I want to give the hon. member the same reply which was prepared by my department when this person, a certain Chalmers, wrote his thesis. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One can have but little regard for the opinion of any man for that matter, if he has the audacity to criticize without having acquainted himself with the true facts of the subject. I have made inquiries and have been informed that those who have the custody of the plans of the extensions to the buildings, were neither asked for the plans by this man nor consulted. Bearing this in mind, the article in the newspaper is not worth the paper it is written on and really does not warrant a reply. One cannot help but think that this is a case where a fool rushed in where angels feared to tread.</block>

<p>I think that in regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s charge about the D. F. Malan airport, I can say the same to him.</p>

<p>In order to indicate how my department is keeping abreast of the development of air services in South Africa, I should like to quote a few figures. I think it is proper for hon. members to take cognizance of these figures. I have made an analysis of the past ten years, i.e. of the aircraft on South African register from 1959-&#x2019;60 to 1969-&#x2019;70. I shall quote various figures in this regard. The first item is aeroplanes eligible for certificates of airworthiness&#x2014;633 as against 1 922, a growth of 12 per cent per year; single-engined aeroplanes&#x2014;551 as against 1 638, a growth of 11,5 per cent per year: twin-engined aeroplanes&#x2014;33 as against 171, a growth of 18 per cent per year. Let us take a look at the staff for a moment. In this respect the figures for the same period are as follows: Valid air crew licences&#x2014;student pilots; 179 as against 834, a growth of 16,15 per cent per year; private pilots: 939 as against 3 452, a growth of 14 per cent per year. The hon. member for Heilbron also expressed his gratitude for the subsidizing in respect of training, etc. However, these are not the only figures which are impressive. Let us take a look at these other very impressive figures: Total licences&#x2014;1 530 as against 5 228, a growth of 13 per cent per year. The department has to provide many services in this regard, such as that of inspection, etc. Let us take a look now at airports and aerodromes (other than State-owned). First of all there are licensed civil aerodromes&#x2014;144 as against 185. That represents a growth of 30 per year. In respect of civil licensed aerodromes, the figure is 171 as against 281, a growth of 65 per cent over this period of ten years. In respect of licensed civil aerodromes the figure is 315 as against 466&#x2014;a growth of 50 per cent over these ten years.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at the runways. The total distance of runways of airports other than State-owned airports is 185 miles as against 273 miles, a growth of 47 per cent per year. Now I should like to take a look at our State-owned airports. The figure in respect of international aircraft movements &#x2014;landings and take-offs, and I want hon. members to listen to these figures, is 6 000 as against 14 000, a growth of 9 per cent per year. As far as our domestic flights are concerned, the figure is 43 000 as against 191 000, a growth of 16 per cent per year over these ten years. The total is 49 000 as against 205 000, a growth of 15 per cent per year over the past ten years. I want to mention the last figures, because they are very important.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Passengers handled (excluding transit) on international flights, amounted to 146 000 as against 674 000&#x2014;a growth of 16,5 per cent per annum over the last ten years. This compares favourably with the rest of the world, which only shows a growth of 12.5 per cent per annum. As regards domestic flights, the figures are 580 000 as against 2 389 000&#x2014;that is nearly 2 500 000&#x2014;which constitutes an increase of 15,5 per cent per annum for the last ten years, which compares more than favourably with the rest of the world, which shows only an increase of 10 per cent per annum. If you look at the total, you find that the figure is <i>i</i> million passengers as against nearly 3 million, which is an annual increase of 15,5 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>*I can continue in this way and furnish the various other figures. I just want to furnish hon. members with the latest figures. Let us look at the projected service in the future.</p>

<p><span class="col_5205-5206" refersTo="page_1262"/>&#x2020;On the assumption that the domestic passenger traffic growth over the next ten years will be approximately 16 per cent per annum, that of international passenger traffic to 18 per cent per annum and that of freight traffic to 20 per cent per annum, you will have in 1979-&#x2019;80 a figure for international passengers handled of 3 250 000 and for domestic passengers handled 12 500 000, a total of 15 750 000. The figure for freight handled, will be 300 000 000 kg.</p>

<p>*These figures indicate the growth.</p>

<p>The hon. member now says there is no planning. Let us look at an analysis of the position at Jan Smuts. Hon. members should listen to this. We are going to spend a total of R49 million at Jan Smuts until the terminal and other associated services have been completed. This applies only to this one airport. Time does not permit me to make an analysis in respect of each item, but this in itself is a good indication. At D. F. Malan this new development alone will cost a total of R4 600 000. Then the hon. member had the temerity to allege that there was no planning in South Africa as far as Airways were concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Tygervallei made an appeal to our industries to see to it that their working hours are staggered in such a way that we will be able to handle these passengers with greater ease. It is essential that we should consider this criticism, because it was dealt with in the Press under the following heading, &#x201C;Poor transport blamed for man-hour loss.&#x201D; The hon. member has indicated what has been done in regard to bus transport. Let me say this to the House. In 1970 we had 4 143 suburban trains per week on our suburban train services and they were running on time to the extent of 94,3 per cent during the whole period. In 1971. up to March, they were running on time to the extent of 92 per cent throughout. In other words, over the last one and a half years our suburban trains in South Africa were running on time at an average of 94,9 per cent. No other country has a record nearly as good as this. We are proud of this service which is being rendered in such a way.</p>

<p>I now come to the final point. The hon. member for Green Point referred to the two local road transport matters and he tried to use this House as a platform for the consideration of applications for road transport certificates. I should like to point out that, without using this Committee as a court, I am in a position to furnish the hon. member with the details of the various matters raised by him, but I must make it clear to him that I am doing so simply to help him without interfering with these two autonomous bodies. In the first place, the hon. member referred to the application of a large brick-making concern for the purpose of transporting their own employers. This matter still has to be dealt with finally by the National Transport Commission.</p>

<p>How long is it still going to take? Will this also be <i>sub judice</i> for months?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The whole matter is consequently <i>sub judice</i> and I am therefore not in a position to discuss it any further in this Committee. But it has not been <i>sub judice</i> for 12 months. The hon. member knows, and he made that objection himself, that people who want to lodge objections are not given sufficient time to prepare their evidence. There is also the question of the legal provisions in regard to the advertisements, and so forth, and the period for lodging an appeal with the National Transport Commission.</p>

<p>The second matter concerns the increase of bus fares of the local company. In this case what the arguments of the hon. member have actually boiled down to is a rehearing of the application, and without interfering in or associating myself with this matter, I just want to tell the hon. member briefly what the whole procedure before the local board and the National Transport Commission is. In short, this is what happened. The application for an increase in tariffs was submitted to the local board on 1st July, 1970, and on 17th July, the application and the existing and proposed increased tariffs were published in the <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>

<p>Particulars of the expenditure and revenue, together with a balance sheet, were submitted to the local board on 20th July, 1970, and considered for approval on 31st July, 1970. In other words, the board had those nine days in which to analyse the balance sheets.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>May I just ask whether that balance sheet was available to the petitioners against the application?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from><span class="col_5207-5208" refersTo="page_1263"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the first instance, no, because it was submitted to the Road Transport Board in support of the application. I am coming to that. The local board acted strictly according to the provisions of the Motor Transport Act and the regulations. For example, in terms of the regulations a board is compelled, <i>inter alia,</i> to wait 10 days after the publication of the application before considering such application in order to afford the interested parties time to lodge an objection. This objection was, in fact, lodged and taken into account by the board. The hon. member also made the uncalled for accusation that the National Transport Commission was simply acting as a rubber stamp and that it based its decision on <i>ex parte</i> allegations. I want to tell the hon. member that all the documents before the local board were also before the National Transport Commission and that the balance sheets were carefully analysed by the cost accountant. We have an official cost accountant who analyses the balance sheets. The hon. member also alleged, basing his allegation on an extract from the balance sheets of Tollgate Holdings, that the company was making considerable profits. Sir, it is necessary for me to have these facts placed on record. The statements the hon. member has at his disposal, reflect the total profits of the group, for example, profits from its tourist service, its private charter service, its fuel service, its advertisements, its properties, its insurance and its passenger transport.</p>

<p>The hon. member is therefore not in a position to make any deduction from this figure in regard to the profits or looses of the bus company in question, which is responsible for passenger services. If one looks at the balance sheets only, one is misleading oneself; if one merely takes the balance sheets into consideration without analysing each facet separately, one is misleading oneself and has no grounds at all for coming here with a complaint of that nature. The hon. member also said that the local board, in the reasons it had advanced, referred to the fact that an appeal had only been lodged in respect of the Cape Town-Bantry Bay route. I do not want to comment on this, because I would then have to go into the merits of the case and I am not competent to do so. I do not have the documents in front of me. Sir, on 2nd November, 1970. the hon. the Minister informed the hon. member that the local road transport board and the National Transport Commission were autonomous bodies and that their decisions were final. Neither I nor the hon. the Minister is able to dictate to those bodies as to what they should decide. The hon. member said that the Act was wrong. If the hon. member is convinced of the fact that the Act is wrong, he should come forward with suggestions as to how the Act should be amended. However, I am not prepared to consider that.</p>

<speech by="#kingwell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister is obviously in a very touchy mood this afternoon. The touchy manner in which he answered the speech of the hon. member for Salt River makes me think that there must be a considerable amount of truth in what the hon. member had to say.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. the Deputy Minister again. He raised the question of the bus fare increases in Port Elizabeth and accused me and the hon. members for Port Elizabeth Central and Newton Park of not acting in the best interests of the country in this particular matter. I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that I am indeed surprised that he raised this particular matter in this Committee this afternoon. Sir, if the hon. the Deputy Minister had realized what an important problem we were dealing with and how much an amicable settlement of that problem <span class="col_5209-5210" refersTo="page_1264"/>is in the best interests of this country, then I do not think he would have raised these petty matters in this Committee this afternoon. Sir, it leads me to believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister is not fully aware of the difficult circumstances that appertained in Gelvandale. He is not aware of the hardships that the people in that particular area are suffering, and I simply cannot understand how he can allege that the three United Party Port Elizabeth members acted in a way that was not in the best interests of the country. I want to say to the Deputy Minister that on the 3rd March I wrote to the Secretary of Transport to get further information about the operations of the National Transport Commission and I received a clear-cut reply from the Secretary in which he set out what the position is. The hon. the Deputy Minister has read that letter out to the Committee. Sir, we were fully aware of the position, but we went to the Deputy Minister fully realizing what an urgent situation we were dealing with. I wrote that letter of the 3rd March because I knew something would happen. We saw what happened in Gelvandale. I believe steps could have been taken and if taken timeously could have prevented what transpired, leading to the Police having to be called in to deal with rioting. We went to the hon. the Deputy Minister to ask him to intervene in the matter because, after all, he is the Deputy Minister of Transport and the man whom we should approach. I must say that he was most reasonable at our first interview, but I simply cannot agree with the attitude that he adopted once the matter got to the Press. I want to tell this Committee that we asked the hon. the Deputy Minister to make a statement to the Press to the effect that he was going to Port Elizabeth, not to interfere in the &#x00A1;bus dispute but to have a look at the overall position of transport as it affected the Gelvandale complex in Port Elizabeth. He agreed to do this and this is what we told the Press. The fact that it was published in the Press in a slightly different manner certainly has nothing to do with us. So I hope that when in future the hon. the Deputy Minister has dealings with us on a matter just as serious as this, he will not allow it to become a petty affair, as he has obviously tried to do this afternoon.</p>

<p>My interest in the operation of the National Transport Commission springs directly from the recent increase allowed by the local Road Transportation Board in Port Elizabeth. I just cannot accept that this matter is <i>sub judice.</i> According to the rules of this hon. House, the only matters regarded as being <i>sub judice</i> are those dealt with by courts of law. Consequently I feel at liberty to speak on this bus fare dispute. Let me briefly relate the history of this case. An application for an increase in bus fares by the Port Elizabeth Passenger Transport Company was made on the 5th of January. The application was published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of the 22nd of January and was considered by the board on the 31st. The application was agreed to by the local board and the new tariffs came into operation on the 1st of March. There was, in other words, no delay; in fact, the application was most expeditiously dealt with, without any delay. But now when an appeal has been lodged, we find a long delay. I do not believe that this is in the interests of this problem. Even at this stage, more than six weeks after the appeal was lodged, the National Transport Commission has not met. As a matter of fact, if an announcement I read in the Press is correct, it will only meet on the 10th or 11th of next month, i.e. about two months after the appeal was lodged. In view of the fact that the increased bus fares have caused so much unrest, justifiable unrest amongst the Coloured community there, the matter ought to have been tackled more expeditiously. The Coloured community have to use that bus service; the only alternative is to walk. In the circumstances the matter ought to have been dealt with as quickly as possible and the hon. the Deputy Minister ought to give us an explanation of why there has been all this dilly-dallying. There are also other aspects which make the hearing of this appeal even more urgent.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, the City Council was not consulted in the matter; they were completely by-passed. Previous boards did consult the Town Council. What is more, I consider that a local transportation board ought to have a nominee of the City Council on it. In this particular case, there is no nominee of the Council on it. There is a councillor on it, but he is a Government nominee. I say that the Council ought to have the right to nominate a representative on the board, especially in the case of a large City Council like Port Elizabeth. What makes the matter even worse is that, according to the letters I have received from the Department, this matter is <i>sub judice.</i> If it is, no one has the right to <span class="col_5211-5212" refersTo="page_1265"/>discuss it according to what the hon. the Deputy Minister has said. Therefore the whole situation is aggravated if the matter is <i>sub judice</i> and no one can discuss it. Then the Transportation Board takes the liberty of postponing the sitting to suit itself, without having regard for the urgency of the situation. Furthermore, not only is the matter <i>sub judice,</i> but the National Transportation Commission is an autonomous body. As the hon. the Minister himself admitted, not even he can intervene, even when the matter is as serious as it was at Gelvandale. With regard to these matters, I believe that we have every right to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to look into them and to make a statement.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister in future not to deal with responsible M.P.s as a bunch of school kids, when he gets a deputation from them to deal with a matter which is obviously serious. We knew the problem and were earnest in our deputation to him. We acted all the time in the best interests of the situation. I want to say to him that every statement that I have made to the Press, has been relevant and responsible. I am quite sure that my other colleagues will deal with the accusations which the hon. the Minister made with regard to the statements they have made.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>I regret that the hon. member for Walmer tried to create the impression here that the Local Road Transportation Board does not know its job or supposedly did not act bona fide. The hon. member cast this aspersion on the Local Road Transportation Board to the effect that it is not constituted properly and that they decided there in favour of the bus company. I just want to say that before the increases in fares took effect in February-March of this year, the previous fares had been maintained since 1966. Since 1966 there were no increases. Anyone with sound common sense can understand that since then there have been considerable increases in wages and in the cost of motor vehicles and buses. The bus company expected a serious shortage in their current expenditure this year. That is why they wanted the increased fares to be introduced as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It may possibly be argued that the City Council and the Coloured Persons Advisory Committee should have taken note of the increased fares before they were put into effect. But I also know of the fact that since 1940 Port Elizabeth&#x2019;s municipality has held an option to buy out that private bus company. They held that option until 28th January, 1971. Then they finally relinquished it. That is also proof to me that the profit made on those buses is not such a terribly large one. Today I also want to make the allegation here that the increase of bus fares was not <i>in toto</i> the cause of the dissatisfaction and rebelliousness that took place there. It was perhaps the argument that was used to launch these things. But there were also many other reasons. There were many other elements, organizations and individuals who prepared the Coloureds for such a confrontation with authority. I was informed that with the increase in the price of bread certain people had already tried to incite those Coloureds to revolt against authority. That is what the responsible Coloured leaders themselves told me. But no success was achieved in arousing such feelings. Then the people were systematically prepared for the announcement of the increase in the fares.</p>

<p>I now want to say in all honesty that if one followed the reports in the English Press from when the increase was announced to when this rebellion came out into the open, one comes to the conclusion that although they were not specifically intent on creating unrest, the manner in which the entire matter was handled definitely created a sense of grievance among these people. The <i>Eastern Cape Post</i> is actually the newspaper which is read in that area by the Coloureds. The day before the boycott began the following appeared in 11-inch letters in the newspaper: &#x201C;Fares and shock bus boycott fears.&#x201D; Then the idea of a boycott had already been aroused in them. The report continued: &#x201C;P.E. commuters are expected to stage a bus boycott after the shock announcement that fares are going up, some by more than a third.&#x201D; That was altogether wrong. The fares were increased by about one cent per trip.</p>

<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>These bus fares were increased by one cent per trip. On 27th February the following heading appeared in the <i>Evening Post</i>: &#x201C;Higher bus <span class="col_5213-5214" refersTo="page_1266"/>fares unjust.&#x201D; It was also stated: &#x201C;Government resettlement of Coloured blamed.&#x201D; The Government is now blamed for that. On 1st March, in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> editorial it was stated: &#x201C;Paying for their yoke.&#x201D; The article continues:</p>

<block name="quote">It is understandable that the mass of wage earners and more especially the Coloured workers of Port Elizabeth, should be highly incensed at the increased bus fares which came into effect yesterday.</block>

<p>All of this created the impression among these people that they were wronged and that they should do something about it.</p>

<p>But apart from this there was a great deal more incitement, which I know of, initiated by the Progressive Party and its kindred spirit, the Labour Party.</p>

I went there after feelings had calmed down. I held two days of peaceful discussions with the Coloureds. I talked to all sections. There is no doubt in my mind that the Progressive Party is using the Coloured Labour Party to launch a hate campaign there among the Coloureds, not so much against the Whites, but specifically against the Afrikaner. That is regrettable. Hate breeds hate. It cannot be a good thing for the Coloureds there. If they have the interests of the Coloureds at heart they will stop this.</p>

If action is to be taken, I should do so. And that is what I did. These hon. members entered that area and made statements to the newspapers. I think I should blame them for that. I must specifically reproach the hon. member for Walmer, who is usually a very responsible man. He also told the story that it is the Government&#x2019;s fault and that it happened because the Government resettled them miles from their place of work. That is perhaps a real grievance that could have cropped up among the Coloureds. There are some of them who were resettled, and there is a large percentage of them now living far from their place of work.</p>

<p>I also want to lodge a plea here that the Government should consider subsidizing these people as they do in the case of the Bantu. This kind of problem cannot be overcome by agitation when feelings are running high. Neither can it be done by making statements in the newspapers and thereby adding more fuel to the fire. It must be done by proper representations and discussions. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central went even further and spoke of &#x201C;drab housing conditions spilling into disreputable slums, where crime and violence are bred&#x201D;. That is regrettable, because that is the language of the agitator. That is the language used by the agitators among the Coloureds. The hon. member and the English clergymen in Port Elizabeth speak of slums. Instead of helping with spiritual welfare and with the many social problems, the clergymen walk through the streets in their long apparel in order to draw attention and thereby they rouse the feelings of the Coloureds so that they smash more buses, with the result that the Police had to pick up two of these clergymen and take them away.</p>

<p>I say it is becoming customary in this House for hon. members on the other side, and I might add that I am not excluding Ministers, to make accusations which they do not substantiate and for which they bring no proof whatever. They do not even say exactly what the accusations consist of. It is a smear campaign and I take the strongest exception to this. The hon. member for Algoa has just done exactly the same. He has stated that he knows for a fact that it is the Progressive Party which is instigating Coloured people, the people of the Labour Party in particular, in Port Elizabeth to stir up disturbances. There is not a word of truth in this. Again, he is contemptuous, as hon. members on the other side always are when they think about non-White people and their ability to reach decisions by themselves. Let me tell the hon. member for Algoa that the Labour Party members for Port Elizabeth need no instigators: they need no advisers; they are educated and intelligent men who can think for themselves. Those people know exactly what they are doing. They do not need me or any members of the Progressive Party to tell them about the miserable conditions under which they are living. I wonder if the hon. member for Algoa has read the report that was recently submitted for the Municipal Council of Port Elizabeth by Mr. Cleary.</p>

<p>I do not need it; I have read it. The hon. member should rather read it. This report depicts the conditions under which the Coloured people in Port Elizabeth are living. It states, <i>inter alia,</i> that more than 50 per cent of the male householders, the wage-earners, earn less than R67 per month. That is the figure. Let me tell the hon. member for Algoa that when you are trying to live on R67 per month, with which you have to pay your rent, with which you have to bring up your family, with which you have to feed them and with which you have to clothe them, this amount of R67 does not go very far.</p>

<p>I am not your &#x201C;dear&#x201D; and I doubt very much whether I am on speaking terms with you at all. An increase of one cent either way on a bus fare is a very considerable amount when you are already trying to live above the poverty datum line, on R67 per month. I wonder if the hon. member will recollect reading in that report, if he has read it, that the Coloured families are living in over-crowded conditions, with several families to one house, and several people to one room. I wonder if he has taken cognizance of the fact that the Port Elizabeth Coloured population was moved from one end of the town to Gelvandale which is several miles outside of town. If it is the policy of apartheid to move people around like that, they deserve to have their transport subsidized and such a move should not be made until adequate provision has been made for subsidized transport. These people will then be able to get to and from their work without having to pay these extra fares. I wonder if the hon. member has also read the conclusion of that report, where Mr. Cleary says that he has no doubt whatsoever that unless conditions are improved for the Coloured people similar incidents will occur again <span class="col_5217-5218" refersTo="page_1268"/>and also elsewhere. I do not happen to know this, but no doubt the hon. member for Algoa knows whether or not Mr. Cleary is a member of the Progressive Party. I wonder whether the hon. member for Algoa can tell me this.

<p>It has everything to do with it. It ill behoves the Government to sit back and to say that there is nothing wrong in Port Elizabeth, nothing wrong in Soweto, or Langa or in any other area and that incidents are only due to agitators from the Progressive Party who tell the Coloured and African people that things are not right and that their conditions are miserable. If the Government had any brains which it clearly has not got. it would have instituted a proper judicial commission of inquiry to go into the matter of conditions at Port Elizabeth. It would have instituted a proper commission of inquiry into the riots that took place, because there are conflicting reports of what happened at that meeting which was assembled in order to protest against the rise in bus fares. There are conflicting reports from people who were present, from onlookers, from people who participated in the meeting and also from the Police who attended that meeting and who ultimately opened fire on those people. But the Government does not have any brains. It prefers to think that everything is all right, that Africans, Coloured people and Indians are accepting their policy of apartheid, that you can shift them around at will and that you do not need to provide transport. If they are provided with transport the Government does not care whether it is utterly inadequate and whether people have to get up at 4 o&#x2019;clock in the morning in order to get to work. Unless the Government takes the blinkers off its eves and smarts worrying about the conditions in these urban townships for Coloured. African and Indian people and sees the way in which they are living, we are in for troublous times in South Africa. It will not be due to agitators, and I want this on record, but will be due to the primitive, unhygienic and thoroughly uncivilized conditions under which the vast majority of non-Whites in this country are living. It will most specifically be due to poverty. It is high time that the Government takes note of this.</p>

<p>It is very clear to me that we are now living through a period in which, as the hon. the Prime Minister warned the other day, we must be very careful that we do not incite Whites against non-Whites in this country. I am very sorry to have to say that I think the Progressive Party is playing this role in South Africa. These people are inciting the non-Whites against the Whites, and I wonder whether many of them would not prefer to employ their efforts in the country of their origin, telling of the injustices that are going on. I find it so strange that we now have to exploit what took place in Port Elizabeth to the extent that the hon. member for Houghton has done. Right enough, she may know everything about that, but she also knows about everything that takes place in Zambia and also about everything that takes place in the Bantu states. It is so strange that she knows everything about everything. [Interjections.] Why does the hon. member for Houghton not come along this afternoon and tell us what this Government has done for housing for the Coloureds in Port Elizabeth? In the past few years R12 900 000 was spent. More than 10 000 Coloured houses were built, but she does not tell us about those beautiful schools and the libraries that were built, and about the sports fields, the tennis courts and other facilities. She is now inciting non-Whites against Whites. It appears to me as if we are now again witnessing the old days in Port Elizabeth, and we are again back into Bethelsdorp history, the days of the Black Circuit, when we had the incitement of a Read and a Van der Kemp. But I want to tell the hon. member that we. the Whites of South Africa, are getting tired of the incitement, by the Progressive Party, of non-Whites against the Whites, and I find it a tragedy in this present day that this House is used as a place where they can continue with that propaganda.</p>

<p>We had the incident of the increased bus rates, but strangely enough, those three hon. colleagues of mine sitting there who today want to wash their hands in innocence <span class="col_5219-5220" refersTo="page_1269"/>and say they had no part in it, and who want to imply that they did not seize the opportunity for making some political capital out of it &#x2026; [Interjections.] They did do so. They know that when there is a matter of common interest, it is a principle in Port Elizabeth that the mayor calls together our five representatives before the House of Assembly begins and that we then discuss the matters in a brotherly fashion. We make representations when it is in the interests of Port Elizabeth as a unit. This was also a matter of common interest, and what do they do? At the first opportunity they go to Port Elizabeth and issue statements. The hon. member for Walmer must not shake his head; I have his Hansard here. In the Railway debate he said that this was the result of the Government&#x2019;s policy of resettlement. In my speech I reacted to that, and here it is.</p>

<p>Sir, there was no truth in it at all. It was also the result of the natural increase in the number of Coloureds. Just as we have a natural increase in the number of Whites, so too with the Coloureds, but one also had the influx as a result of the droughts. There was an unnatural influx of Coloureds to Port Elizabeth, and those people had to be accommodated. Those people had to be given accommodation, and that is why Mr. Cleary says that there are four to five families in one house, because one does not have influx control for the Coloureds in Port Elizabeth. That is what the position is, Mr. Chairman, and now those hon. members come along and blame the Government, as the hon. member for Algoa said, for the poor housing conditions. Sir, never has so much been done for Coloured housing as is being done at present in the city of Port Elizabeth. But I want to go further. Those same people come along today and complain about the salaries and wages of the Coloureds. They are the people who advocated cheap labour for the factories. They said that preference should not be given to Coloured labour; that we should throw open the labour market for the Bantu. They acted in the interests of the industrialists.</p>

<p>Hon. members on that side want more money for the Coloureds so that they can pay those bus fares, but they did not give the Coloureds that opportunity. They wanted to take the bread out of the Coloureds&#x2019; mouths, and now they blame the Government for those low wages. It is, after all, not this Government that determines the wages. Sir, in the Budget debate I pointed out that it was because of agitation, in which certain English-speaking clergymen took part, that that terrible rioting took place in Port Elizabeth. Hon. members on that side attacked me left, right and centre about that. I just want to quote what the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> wrote in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He was obviously referring to a Press photograph of two White priests talking informally to a group of Coloured people.</block>

<p>After those disturbances they professed that two priests were innocently engaged in conversation with the innocent Coloureds. That is their story. But 13 of them went to the bus terminus in order to lead processions through the streets of Port Elizabeth. Here is a picture in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> of 26th March, 1971, and below it the caption&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Conversing at the Baakens Valley bus terminus shortly before they set out on their long walk to the Coloured townships of Gelvandale and Schauderville are&#x2026;</block>

<p>And then the names of the two priests are mentioned. The heading of the article reads&#x2014;</p>

<p>Buses stoned as priests &#x201C;walk&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The English-language Press is unashamedly and obviously deceiving the country by saying that those people did not take part in these marches. Here it is clearly stated that they &#x201C;walked&#x201D;. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5221-5222" refersTo="page_1270"/>Five buses were stoned in Gelvandale and two priests held briefly by Police following a token walk through the city yesterday by members of the minister&#x2019;s fraternal serving the Coloured areas of Port Elizabeth.</block>

<p>They were arrested in broad daylight, and then the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> comes along and states that no such thing ever happened; that Potgieter was only referring to two innocent priests who stood talking to the Coloureds.</p>

<p>Sir, this is not a matter of bus fares. Three things took place; firstly, there were organized meetings in opposition to the bus fares; immediately after that the agitation, the walk-outs, followed when the Minister of Community Development opened a large housing scheme there. That day the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> told of how the clergymen walked out while the Minister was speaking. But what happens now. I have here a heading from the <i>Argus</i> which reads: &#x201C;Coloured Council walk-out&#x201D;. They go along and meet the city council, and you must remember, Sir, that it is a United Party city council. They go along and meet the city council, and do you know, Sir, what happened there?: &#x201C;Coloured Council walk-out&#x201D;. The same report goes on to state&#x2014;</p>

<p>He added &#x2026;</p>

<p>That is the mayor now speaking&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the recent bus riot and subsequent Cleary report had underlined things the Management Committee had been saying for six years.</block>

<p>For six years they fought about the conditions which, according to them, existed. Sir, this is not a matter of bus fares; it is incitement that is going on in Port Elizabeth on the part of certain English clergymen. and not only in Port Elizabeth, but throughout the entire country. Throughout the entire country they are inciting the non-Whites against the Whites.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I want to tell the hon. member for Port Elizabeth North that he should be ashamed of himself for having tried to drag the clergy into this debate once again. He was reprimanded once after having tried to do so, and today he tried to do so again. In the second place I want to tell him that I am one hundred per cent in agreement with what was said by my hon. friend the member for Walmer, and that I wish to underline it, namely that it is the circumstances of those Coloured people in Gelvandale, i.e. that they live a long way from their work, that the transport facilities are inadequate, and that, as a result of their low wages, almost 50 per cent of them live below the breadline, which caused the increase of one cent in bus fares to result in those serious disturbances.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I would like, in passing, to refer to the opening remarks of my hon. friend the member for Tygervallei, when he made his speech on Friday. He made certain uncalled for remarks about my speech in the Budget debate. To him I would like to say, with apologies to Shakespeare:</p>

<block name="quote">There are more things in heaven and earth, hon. Van Breda, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.</block>

<p>Then I want to come to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport. I want to record my regret that he has chosen to perpetuate an inaccuracy. I want to recount the facts of this matter in a nutshell. The three United Party members of Port Elizabeth were granted an interview by the hon. the Deputy Minister. During the interview he made three points. Firstly, he said that the Transportation Board was an autonomous body, and he could not interfere with their decision, which we accepted. Secondly, he said that he was prepared to instruct his senior officials to investigate the problem <span class="col_5223-5224" refersTo="page_1271"/>of transport in the Port Elizabeth complex. Thirdly, he said that, since he was going to be in Port Elizabeth on the 19th April, he would be prepared to discuss the transport problem&#x2014;not the bus tariff dispute&#x2014;with interested persons if he were invited by the Mayor of Port Elizabeth. I actually kept notes of our interview. At the termination of our interview, we asked the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he would make a statement to the press. He said &#x201C;No, you can make a statement&#x201D;. We made that statement, and the next day my two colleagues, the hon. members for Newton Park and Walmer, departed. I stayed behind and he asked me to meet him in his office, which I did. I showed him my notes, and he could not find fault with them. But he issued a statement, denying firstly that he was prepared to go to Port Elizabeth. He then said that the Mayor had to come to him. Secondly, he denied that he would give instructions to his officials to investigate this problem. I deny those two inaccurate allegations, but I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he must stop playing petty politics. This is an extremely dangerous situation which has developed in Port Elizabeth. In fact, the position in Port Elizabeth is only symtomatic of what the Coloureds throughout South Africa are suffering at the hands of Government policy. I want to make an appeal to this hon. Deputy Minister to try and influence the Cabinet to subsidize Coloured transport in the same manner as Bantu transport is subsidized, because these people simply cannot come out on the wages that are paid to them with the continual rise in the cost of living. This is an extremely serious affair.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister of Community Development, when he recently opened a Coloured housing complex in Port Elizabeth, said that he would be very receptive to any such plea and that the Government favourably considers the subsidization of Coloured transport. I want to make that plea very earnestly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall react to your suggestion and bring this debate back to transport matters again. In the few minutes at my disposal I want to air a few thoughts about the alignment of the coast road and the problems it entails for my constituency. The road goes through my constituency for at least a 100 miles and you can therefore understand that the interests of my voters could suffer. When I raised the same matter last year I brought the position of the beach resort, Puntjie, to the attention of the Minister. Puntjie is one of the most natural and idyllic beach resorts we have in this country. It is situated where the Duivenhok River enters the sea and has architectonic characteristics that we find nowhere else. For example, we have the roof-truss houses there, a style we find nowhere else; in fact, this is regarded as being so exceptional that the area has been declared a national monument. The original alignment of this road would have entailed a portion of this beach falling victim to the operation. However, the hon. the Deputy Minister has given me the assurance that the road there will be diverted so that Puntjie can remain intact. On behalf of the Provincial Administration and those people who use Puntjie as a beach resort, I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister how glad we are that this will be done. The change will mean extra expense for the Department because the road must swing in towards the land; the bridge they will have to build over the Duivenhok River will also probably cost more. But all of us who love nature are glad of this concession.</p>

<p>If we look at the alignment of the road further ahead we come to Still Bay, a small place that is developing into one of the biggest and most modern of beach resorts. There is continuous development, and this entails the creation of an infrastructure for the beach resort. The provisional alignment is such that the road goes straight through Still Bay, in other words, it more or less cuts Still Bay in two. The local authority of Still Bay is continuously asking me to obtain clarity from the Minister and the Department about the actual alignment of the road in the vicinity of Still Bay, i.e. whether it will go straight through Still Bay or whether it will go around it. I am not going to express myself now on the merits of the case, because if it goes around Still Bay, other bodies will again be affected. All I now want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister is to clarify for us the alignment of the road through Still Bay so that development there need not be hampered unnecessarily. At present the municipality is developing a large Coloured beach there; then the Divisional Council has another Coloured area at Melkhoutfontein. All these areas must have access roads and they must develop further, aspects very closely connected with the alignment of the proposed coast route. I would therefore appreciate it very much if the hon. <span class="col_5225-5226" refersTo="page_1272"/>the Deputy Minister could clarify the matter for me so that I can convey the information to the bodies concerned. It would be very much appreciated by them.</p>

<p>When a road such as this is planned there are, of course, many aspects that must be taken into account. For example, efforts must be made to find the shortest possible road, or to make the road as safe as possible and to keep costs as low as possible. All these considerations must be taken into account in the planning of a road.</p>

<p>There is also the matter of soil erosion which has recently been brought to my attention very frequently in my constituency. When a broad road with at least two lanes is planned on an incline or gradient and a great deal of rain falls, such a road catches up a great deal of the water. That is one of the aspects we must bear in mind. Particularly with respect to the portion of the road from Gouritz River to Mossel Bay, the local controlling bodies, who have soil erosion and so on under their control, have called for me on various occasions to show me how, in their opinion, that road was not planned properly. I am not going to say anything more about that, because the people concerned are all my voters. I just want to ask that soil erosion should be given proper consideration when such a road is planned.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion I also raised the question of fencing that section of the road off against game. The Minister then told me that the matter was, in fact, being considered by them. I should just like to examine this point more closely. I want to point out that the portion between the Breede River at the White Sands beach resort and the Gouritz River is the portion of the road where small game breed very rapidly. One is almost inclined to say that it is a nature reserve for them there. We shall also have to give proper consideration to this game as far as the building of that road is concerned. When it rains, even if only a light rain falls, the water that falls on the road runs down the side and a green strip springs up there. Hon. members who know game and who know how sensitive to smell they are, will know that they can smell that green strip from very far off. I can imagine them coming to the road and walking beside it and on it in search of the green grass there, while at other spots it is dry. Hon. members will be able to understand what happens when the small buck stand beside the road grazing, with fast-moving traffic going to and fro. Not only will the small buck be killed, but serious accidents will take place as a result. I want to ask the hon. the Minister that when that portion is fenced off against game it should be done in such a way that it is effective. I cannot think of any more effective way than that the bottom portion should be enclosed with wire netting. Wire netting to a height of four feet would, in fact, be adequate. If only ordinary wire, as we know it, is used, the small buck will slip through and it would then have little or no effect. There must be another two foot of wire above the wire netting, and the fence must be provided with a small wire projection, facing away from the road, to prevent the small buck from jumping over the fence. In order to fence the road off efficiently against game would probably cost quite a bit more, but I believe that if it is done properly it would, in fact, be worth while, particularly for those of us who would like to conserve nature and who in particular have a very soft spot for our small buck and other animals of the veld.</p>

<p>If the matter which the hon. the Deputy Minister broached today was not of such a serious nature I would definitely have laughed in his face at the attitude he adopted here. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that if the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central, the hon. member for Walmer and I do not put a certain matter right for him he would not in future argue or speak about any subject affecting Port Elizabeth, for example. And what are the facts of the matter? As the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central said, we asked that hon. gentleman himself to conduct the interview with the Press. After the report appeared the hon. the Minister corrected it. When I came back here the first time and after I had seen that report I went to the hon. the Minister to consult him. I told him personally that I was sorry that that impression had been created by the Press report. What is the hon. Minister now dissatisfied about? The hon. Minister is dissatisfied about the fact that the Press could say that he is prepared to go to Port Elizabeth in order that the relevant &#x2026;</p>

<p>Wait, listen now. The hon. the Minister was dissatisfied because the Press could say that he <span class="col_5227-5228" refersTo="page_1273"/>would go to Port Elizabeth to investigate this problem, i.e. the increase in the bus-fares. The Press actually flattered the hon. the Minister, and that in spite of the fact that they had made a mistake. This increase of bus fares in Port Elizabeth was undoubtedly, as Mr. Cleary stated in his report, the last drop in the bucket. The hon. gentleman ought not to regard it as criticism against himself. He should in fact regard it as a talent he has for ascertaining the facts of a problem. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister says that he is not satisfied that he ever said he would go to Port Elizabeth to investigate those increases in the busfares.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister very clearly gave us the impression that he was prepared to go to Port Elizabeth to investigate the general transport problems of that area.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that he is quite satisfied with that. Why is he therefore so terribly dissatisfied about the question of the increase in the busfares, because they mentioned it. I cannot understand the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attitude at all. Surely the increase in the busfares has a great deal to do with the trouble in Port Elizabeth. Let me just quote what the hon. the Minister of Community Development said. A while ago he was in Port Elizabeth and the <i>Oosterlig</i> and other newspapers had the following to say about him [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Coetzee also announced that he was engaged in a thorough investigation of transport facilities for Coloureds in Port Elizabeth. He began with the investigation as a result of recent dissatisfaction about increased busfares in the city. He says that he is working towards a Government subsidy for Coloured bus services similar to that already being paid in respect of Bantu transport facilities.</block>

<p>And then the hon. the Minister makes the following important point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Bantu can get it, I see no reason why it must be kept from the Coloureds.</block>

<p>If the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s colleague in the Cabinet regards it as a serious problem, and regards it as having given rise to the difficulties in Port Elizabeth, what is the hon. the Deputy Minister then dissatisfied about? It seems to me as if the hon. the Deputy Minister tried to seek publicity, which was altogether unnecessary. He should rather have adopted the attitude of his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Community Development. He was, it is true, prepared to investigate this matter. I do not need to do so, but I should like to quote to the House what Mr. Cleary said. I am not quoting from the report, although this also appears in the report. I am quoting from a summary of his report as it appeared in <i>Die Burger.</i> There it is stated very clearly [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From research which he conducted in the Coloured community, it was evident that one big reason for dissatisfaction is the Government&#x2019;s resettlement programme.</block>

<p>I shall now skip a few paragraphs and quote further&#x2014;</p>

<p>The increased expenditure &#x2026;</p>

<p>That is in connection with the bus services&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is, according to the report, largely the result of the inevitable increase of the cost of transport to the city centre for purchases.</block>

<p>One surely cannot argue this away.</p>

<p>Now the hon. members for Algoa and Port Elizabeth North think they have made a point by saying that the English clergymen, the Progressive Party the Labour Party and the three United Party M.P.&#x2019;s of Port Elizabeth are the parties who incited the people. But here are the facts of the matter. Any Government that is worth its salt would, when such problems develop, come down to the actual cause of the problems and try to correct them. If that were done it would not create an opportunity for agitators to incite the people. No, a Government that is worth its salt would immediately try to correct the matter. What a responsible Minister of Transport ought to do when something like this develops, and if he is aware of the reason why it has developed, is to go to that place immediately <span class="col_5229-5230" refersTo="page_1274"/>and to institute an investigation. We told the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I hope he will bear this in mind&#x2014;that before a local transportation board again makes such an almost fatal decision, I hope we shall have a chance to amend the Road Transportation Act so that the hon. the Minister can review such decisions. It is wrong to leave these decisions entirely to such a body that does not consider all the circumstances when it makes such a decision. These people must, after all, certainly have realized that with the fantastic increase in the cost of living during the past few years, together with the results of the resettlement programme, their decision would bring about great dissatisfaction among the Coloured population. They nevertheless made such a decision within a matter of 24 hours. Now they blame agitators and English clergymen, etc., for this situation. No, we must realize that we are faced with a difficult problem here.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not. I am now dealing with the causes that gave rise to the bus boycott. I disapprove of a decision being taken without the circumstances and background being given proper consideration. I therefore say that I hope that in the course of time we shall be able to amend the Act. so that we will be able to go to the hon. the Minister, as was our intention, to ask him to review the decision of the National Transport Commission. But the hon. the Minister did not have the power to do so. It is wrong if someone else, in the name of the Government, can make a decision of this nature which could give rise to trouble at a later stage. That is why I say that it is wrong that hon. members on that side of the House want to look for the fault in someone else.</p>

<p>No, I shall tell the hon. member where the real fault lies. Any local board that ought to have known the circumstances, ought to have realized at the very beginning that an increase in the bus rates would have upset those people because at present the background is not condusive to such increases. The Government has already been warned about this, not only by us, but also by its own newspapers. I remember that very recently Dawie wrote in <i>Die Burger</i> that as a result of present-day circumstances we must be careful when such price increases are considered.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I think we should view this matter in its proper perspective. Let me say in the first place that the Department of Transport is not responsible for the transportation of Coloured people, Bantu or Whites. The Department of Transport has absolutely nothing to do with the transportation of persons. The function of the Department of Transport, in terms of the Act, which has been on the Statute Book for 35 years, is to approve or reject applications for the increase of bus fares. Then provision is made for appeals from the Road Transportation Board to the National Transport Commission, and the decision of the National Transport Commission is final. This is what the Act provides, and it is an Act which was put through Parliament by those hon. members. This is the first time it has come to my notice that there are complaints about the Act all of a sudden. Now the hon. members all of a sudden want a right of appeal to the Minister. But it would be silly to do a thing like that. It would mean that all the political pressure could be brought to bear upon the Minister by any interested party, which is quite wrong. For that reason Parliament in its wisdom decided 35 years ago that the decision of the National Transport Commission would be final. That is as the matter stands.</p>

<p>Let me take Port Elizabeth now. It is not the responsibility of the National Transport Commission or the Department of Transport to go along and institute inquiries. The Department of Transport has absolutely nothing to do with the riots which broke out in Port Elizabeth. If inquiries <span class="col_5231-5232" refersTo="page_1275"/>are to be instituted, it must be done by the Department of Justice, which is responsible for it, and not by the Department of Transport. But now, is the crux of the matter not the fact that, as that hon. member said, the Coloured people of Port Elizabeth, the employees, are not being paid a decent wage? And who is responsible for that? The Government?</p>

<from>*The. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, most of the employers there are supporters of that hon. member&#x2019;s party and of the United Party. [Interjections.] There is nothing to prevent those employers from paying their employees decent wages. The Coloured people of Port Elizabeth who are in the Public Service, or in my service, are a very small minority. The vast majority are employed by private employers, and those private employers can pay decent wages if they want to. The charges of the hon. members are against those employers and not against the Government. What the Government in fact does is to provide proper housing for those Coloured people and, to be able to provide that proper housing, it must necessarily be quite a long way from their places of employment. I think it is an entirely wrong principle that the transport costs of any employee should be subsidized. He should receive a proper wage so that he can afford to pay for his transport. My advice to those hon. members and to the hon. member for Houghton is to go and tell their friends, the employers of Port Elizabeth, to pay their Coloured workers decent wages; then there will be no complaints if the bus fares are increased.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the House has replied very effectively to the charges made by that side of the House. I shall therefore not go into this matter any further, except to say that this is what the United Party looks like after the Leader of the House has spoken.</p>

<p>My real purpose in rising is to associate myself with what the hon. member for Bloemfontein West said in this debate last Friday in regard to a matter which I believe fills all hon. members on both this side and that side of the House with the greatest seriousness and concern. I also believe this to be a matter which not only fills those of us assembled in this House with great seriousness and concern, but also fills every responsible person outside of this House with great seriousness and concern. This matter is the increasing number of road accidents occurring on our roads in South Africa.</p>

<p>I am aware of the fact that there was a private motion earlier on in the present session of this House, on which occasion this matter was discussed very fruitfully, but I want to tell you, Sir, that I am offering no apology whatsoever for once again raising this matter during the discussion of this Vote, because it is definitely a matter which is causing great concern in South Africa.</p>

<p>A year or so before coming to Parliament, I attended an international congress on road safety and road engineering in London on behalf of the City Council of Welkom, in co-operation with the Provincial Council of the Orange Free State. Sir, let me tell you right at the start that at that congress I came to the realization that road accidents are not only a problem we are faced with in South Africa, but that road accidents are by their nature really a world phenomenon and that not only we in South Africa are trying to do everything in order to reduce road accidents to a minimum; we find that throughout the world every civilized country is trying to reduce accidents to a minimum. But, Sir, what fills me with grave concern is the fact that our road accident rate in South Africa is one of the highest in comparison with other countries of the world. Sir, if time would allow me, I could give you many examples in order to show that the road accident rate in South Africa is one of the highest in the world, but unfortunately time does not allow me to do so.</p>

<p>However, I want to content myself with a comparison between South Africa and America on this very serious and difficult problem. We find there were 90 million vehicles in the U.S.A. in 1968. America has a population of 195 million, in round figures, and the death toll was 55 000 in that year. In the Republic of South Africa we find that there were some 2 million vehicles in 1968 and in South Africa, with a population of approximately 20 million, the death toll was 5 300. Therefore, in America, ten times more people died on the roads than in South Africa, but we have to take into consideration that there are approximately 55 times more vehicles in America than in South Africa and that there are 13 times more inhabitants than we have here in the Republic of South <span class="col_5233-5234" refersTo="page_1276"/>Africa. Moreover, just to substantiate this argument of mine further, available figures show that in that year 5 fatal accidents occurred per 100 million road miles travelled in the State of Nebraska. In the Republic of South Africa there were 10,2 fatal accidents per 100 million road miles, almost twice as many in South Africa as we find in the State of Nebraska in America In this way, Sir, I can continue to give you other examples.</p>

<p>While talking about this subject, I want to state that this matter causes us grave concern. One sometimes gains the impression that our people in South Africa simply adopt the attitude that these road accidents occurring on our South African roads, just have to be accepted as part of our pattern of life; that they are simply part of the cross we have to bear in life. Sir, I wonder whether we are not fighting a losing battle. I wonder whether we are not throwing in the towel. Every day one reads in the newspapers of some serious road accident having occurred. The front page of <i>Die Burger</i> this morning again carried a report about road accidents which occurred over the last week-end in the Cape Peninsula. But these reports simply pass one by. When a road accident affects one personally, of course, one takes note of it, but for the very reason that there are so many road accidents these reports just pass one by. Sir, I wonder whether we are giving the necessary serious attention to this question of road accidents in South Africa. A few weeks ago we in this House were shocked when a serious accident occurred in which a good friend and colleague of ours, the hon. member for Brentwood, and his wife were involved. I just want to say I am glad to learn there is some improvement and I want to express the hope and I trust that the hon. member will be able to resume his place in this House shortly.</p>

<p>The question arises whether road accidents in South Africa can be prevented or not. I want to make it quite clear, Sir, that I realize that this problem, is a complex matter, that it is not the easiest problem on earth to solve, because one has to do here, in the first instance, with human factors and with a thousand and one factors which cause accidents. I think the hon. the Prime Minister put this very strikingly under his Vote. He said one can bring 6 economists together and each of them will give you a different explanation of how the financial problems of South Africa are to be solved. I now want to tell hon. members I am convinced that even if we were to get a thousand people together and ask each one how the problems in respect of road safety were to be solved, each one would suggest a different solution. Therefore I cannot but express my greatest appreciation and praise to the Road Safety Council. I wish to do the same in respect of all the voluntary bodies which are doing everything possible to combat this phenomenon. However, I wish to say&#x2014;and I am not saying this to disparage the praiseworthy work being done and efforts being made by those numerous bodies&#x2014;that I believe many of the bodies in South Africa are fumbling in the dark in trying to solve these problems. I am by no means speaking as an expert in this field, but I want to tell hon. members that I believe road accidents in South Africa can be combated if we approach this alarming problem in a more scientific way, backed up by an efficient and thorough policy of law enforcement.</p>

<p>It is obvious, and it is imperative, to have intimate knowledge of a problem before one can solve it. I may tell hon. members that the United States realized this early in the twentieth century. They established a traffic engineering department in 1925 for. <i>inter alia,</i> making traffic studies. In addition, they had to study surveys, planning, the design of roads, traffic regulations, traffic accidents and so forth. In this way they also had to study town planning. among other things. I may tell hon. members that in the traffic division of the City of Welkom there is a subdivision for scientific research, which determines scientifically how accidents occur in that city. Perhaps this has contributed towards the fact that Welkom received the President Trophy for the second consecutive year for the city in the Republic in which the least number of accidents occurred. I want to plead for the establishment of a central traffic bureau. I know the C.S.I.R. does a great deal of praiseworthy work in this regard, but I nevertheless hope and trust that a traffic bureau will be established which will make a proper analysis of every accident occurring in South Africa, I hope this information will be sent to such a traffic bureau and that this will also contribute towards reducing the number of road accidents in South Africa.</p>

<p>I should also like to touch upon another aspect of this whole matter. The penalties in respect of road accidents in South <span class="col_5235-5236" refersTo="page_1277"/>Africa leave much to be desired. The penalties we have in South Africa no longer serve as a deterrent to our people. I can substantiate this fact for hon. members by just mentioning a few examples of penalties for traffic offences in other countries of the world. In Austria, for example, the Austrian Government recently published a Bill which provides for maximum penalties. In the case of a serious traffic accident in respect of which a driver is found guilty as a result of negligent driving, or a driver was under the influence of liquor, the penalty is imprisonment for three years or a maximum fine of R10 000.

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am most grateful for what the hon. member for Welkom has said about road safety. During my speech I hope to mention a few points in connection with what he has said. Several fatal civilian aeroplane accidents have taken place in the Province of Natal during the last few years. They usually take place during misty weather and in mountainous regions. The impression which had been gained according to the Press is that the accidents are the result of the lack of navigational aid installations at suitable points on the longer routes that these aeroplanes normally fly. I would like to know what the findings are of the boards which inquire into these accidents. I should also like to know whether they substantiate this. According to the Budget R24 million has been set aside to purchase and install navigational aid equipment. Will this include equipment for the civilian aeroplanes which fly in these areas? If, on the other hand, it does not provide for this, should provision not have been made for these aids for civilian aviation? I am not trying to find fault with the hon. Minister, but I am merely asking him for elucidation. If my lines have crossed with his high-tension wires, it is merely on account of lack of knowledge of electronics.</p>

<p>I notice that an amount of R1,5 million has been set aside for the elimination of level crossings. As the costs of eliminating a single level crossing must have increased considerably during the last year or so, I wonder if this amount is sufficient. I do think that we should do something drastic to eliminate these death-traps throughout the Republic. We have just read about the very nasty accident at Coligny where a heavy cement-carrying vehicle crashed into a train and actually knocked it off the lines. I believe these vehicles use this crossing regularly and it would be very interesting to know whether the Road Safety Council or any other body has made representations to eliminate this crossing, because here it was quite clearly a case of familiarity breeding contempt. I also noticed that the Road Safety Council grant has been increased from R300 000 to R380 000 this year.</p>

<p>At the outset I would like to find fault with this increase, because I would rather have expected a decrease following upon the debate that took place in this House during February this year. My very genuine appeal that road safety should be removed from the political arena seems to me to have fallen on deaf ears. May I ask when we can expect the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Road Safety Council? Must we now wait for another year before we can criticize the findings of that committee?</p>

<p>I have always said that road safety is a provincial matter and not a national one. Here again it has been conclusively proved by the recent circular sent out by the Chairman of the Road Safety Council in connection with the Pedestrian Campaign for this year and which, I believe, commenced on the 19th of this month. I would like to read out a few extracts from this circular. Paragraph 5 on page 3 reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The co-operation of the following is a prerequisite to success. The provincial M.E.C.s and their traffic departments are requested to undertake the following two functions, namely the distribution of pamphlets to scholars of all races. Provincial and regional heads of traffic, in collaboration with officers in charge of city and town traffic control are requested to determine in their respective regions the number of schools existing for each race and the number of scholars in each school and to obtain the requisite number of pamphlets from the nearest regional secretary of the South African Road Safety Council, and to arrange for the distribution thereof to the different schools. The provincial regional heads of traffic will take the lead in their regions to ensure prompt completion of this part of the campaign. A letter to the principals of schools will be available, together with the number of pamphlets earmarked for each school. Pamphlets <span class="col_5237-5238" refersTo="page_1278"/>for the Bantu are available in the following languages: Pedi, Xhosa, Zulu and South Sesuto.</block>

<p>On page 6, the following is stated:</p>

<block name="quote">The provincial heads of traffic are requested to take the initiative by activating all traffic officers, whether serving in cities or towns, to pay special attention to pedestrians who are transgressing traffic rules or are conducting themselves in a manner prejudicial to their own safety, to reprimand the transgressors tactfully by explaining to them in what way they have erred. Much can be achieved in this way, particularly in the case of the Bantu, who as a rule accept the word of a traffic officer without question.</block>

<p>The provincial traffic officers and the traffic officers of local authorities will have to distribute these pamphlets to all scholars of all races in schools throughout the Republic. I wonder whether the chairman of the Road Safety Council can imagine the colossal task he has given these officers. Can hon. members imagine going to all the schools in the Drakensberg, for instance, or those in the Bushveld, miles and miles away from a national road? I would like to know what the staff and the secretaries of the Road Safety Council, with its fleet of motor vehicles are going to do during this period. As far as I can see, they are going to act in an advisory and a supervisory capacity, and as liaison between themselves, the Press. the radio and the South African Police. This will be done weekly. What are they supposed to do during the rest of the week? Each Provincial Traffic Department could have carried it out in their respective provinces without an assistance from the Road Safety Council or the distribution of pamphlets.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that motor vehicles still play the most important part in the campaign. They are not mentioned. If a pedestrian is killed or injured, there is a motor vehicle responsible. If we can control the motor vehicle drivers, the pedestrian campaign will automatically be a success. The suspension of drivers&#x2019; licences of those implicated in serious accidents is the only solution, but it is avoided. May I know why? What has the Road Safety Council done as regards this important matter? It is an entirely provincial matter. Again I say it was conclusively proved during the Easter holidays when thousands of motor vehicles from all adjoining provinces converged on Natal, especially in Durban and the coastal areas. I must congratulate our Chief Traffic Officer and his staff on what they did during the Easter holidays to keep down accidents. They even had a doctor in a helicopter patrolling the main routes. I say that it could have been done without pamphlets. Showing the traffic officer&#x2019;s uniform, the only authority that motor drivers understand, would have been sufficient. This applies to all provinces.</p>

<p>In conclusion it would be most informative if the hon. the Minister could tell us what he has finally decided about the Road Safety Council set-up as it is a very urgent matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not follow up the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City any further. He has put his questions to the hon. the Deputy Minister, and I think he will get a reply to them.</p>

<p>The part played by transport in general and by certain aspects of transport in the rapid development of our country, cannot easily be over-emphasized. The transport links are the arteries of our industry and economic development. Transport links are the most important component of the infrastructure and form the most important communications network in the country and with the neighbouring states. In a rapidly developing country with unlimited possibilities, such as South Africa, vision and farsightedness are of the greatest importance. As the poet puts it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek sien wel duisend stede<br/>Verrys vanuit die grond.<br/>Ek sien ons volk tevrede<br/>Herenig en gesond.</block>

<p>It is actually a pity that this poet was not a member of the United Party at the time he wrote this poem. At that time, in the formative years, when the foundation for future development was laid, he might have been able to bring them some light in their darkness. became they are people who have no faith in the future. They did not even believe that South Africa could become an industrial country, nor even in the future of our own nation. To them this poet&#x2019;s vision of &#x201C;a thousand cities rising from the earth&#x201D; was an illusion. That is why we are faced with this situation today. <span class="col_5239-5240" refersTo="page_1279"/>The foundations of our cities that were laid in those days, were not properly planned and as a result we have the problem of traffic bottlenecks in our cities. I want to plead that we should plan far ahead for the future.</p>

<p>Just in passing I want to associate myself with what has been said here about road safety, by just mentioning one aspect of it. We know our national roads are constructed with a view to road safety and the prevention of accidents. In the construction of national roads to airports, care has been taken to ensure that motorists may drive along those roads in safety, in that there are a limited number of entry points. Nevertheless pedestrians flock across the roads on certain occasions, something which most definitely can cause serious accidents. On Sundays some of the Coloured people play football there and they even plant their goal posts next to the clover-leaf intersections. This most definitely is highly dangerous. I wonder whether we cannot employ our traffic constables more usefully in putting a stop to such offences, offences which are highly dangerous, rather than to have them check parking meters to see whether a person has parked his car for too long.</p>

<p>Advance planning is the key to the matter. Particularly in view of the fact that the National Transport Commission is going to build all national roads, I should like to plead with the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider preparing a master-plan of the national roads they intend constructing. This can be made available to the provincial authorities, municipalities, and local authority bodies so that they may take this into consideration timeously in preparing their local road construction programmes.</p>

<p>In recent years cities have grown up, and the transport links have grown along with the cities. These transport links from the arteries of our economic development and industrial growth. As I have said, there was no planning because a United Party Government was in power at the time. These important roads cannot even provide properly for the increasing growth which has taken place in the meantime. Therefore it is essential for by-passes to be built at our larger towns. The road network actually forms the arteries of the national economy. Now these arteries are blocked on both sides of a town and taken past by means of a by-pass which is actually only a small tube to prevent the body from dying completely. These major roads form a very important part of the infrastructure. I now want to address a plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>We know the policy has been changed recently, that these municipalities no longer receive assistance from the State in respect of national roads running through their areas. I want to mention an example here. I want to refer specifically to the circumstances at Bloemfontein, because I know them very well. I apologize for mentioning them here, but this is the easiest way of illustrating the position. Of the major roads reaching Bloemfontein, particularly the big main road from the south to the north forms a two-mile long bottleneck in the central city area, because the streets are too narrow to carry the traffic. A 16 mile long road bypassing Bloemfontein is now being planned. This will result in numerous flyovers having to be built. Land will have to be expropriated for this purpose. All these things will entail enormous costs. The main roads are beautifully constructed, but there is just this bottleneck. I want to plead that the cost of building and maintaining this 16 mile long ring road should be passed on to the municipality. I want to plead that the Municipality of Bloemfontein be directed to construct flyovers or subways through the city itself or to expropriate land in order to construct a road according to the standards of the National Transport Commission which will be able to accommodate the traffic properly. This will obviate the disruption which is caused when a road is diverted from its normal route, as it was planned, and which has come to form part of the city.</p>

<p>There is another danger which I want to emphasize in this regard. We have witnessed the development of honeypot urban complexes where ring roads are built in America. At the moment such development is prohibited. But at the junctions with the ring road, service stations, motels, restaurants and so forth will be erected. We must bear in mind that America, for example, places ten million new vehicles on its roads annually. We must plan for at least one million new vehicles on our roads. As the number of vehicles on our roads increases, the facilities at junctions will have to be doubled and quadrupled, with the result that these facilities in themselves will constitute small towns at such junctions. These are called honey-pot towns. Such towns develop at the expense <span class="col_5241-5242" refersTo="page_1280"/>of the existing urban development. Therefore I want to plead with the hon. the Deputy Minister to consider, allocating, not additional funds, but at least the amount which has to be spent on providing those facilities, to the municipality for building that through road.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down must forgive me if I do not follow the particular point he raised. I would like to deal with another matter. Before I do that, I would like to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that I found his remarks at the beginning of the debate this afternoon very strange. They were strange from the point of view that members, such as the member for Port Elizabeth Central, would be <i>persona non grata</i> to him in future, because of a certain matter which occurred. I want to remind the hon. the Deputy Minister that he is a servant of the State. As a servant of the State, it is his duty to answer the questions which any member on this side of the House or that side, for that matter, puts to him. If the hon. the Deputy Minister takes exception or believes that remarks published are not quite accurate, he is at full liberty and entitled to deny those remarks and to point out where, according to him, they were inaccurate. But for the hon. the Deputy Minister, or any Minister, as far as I am concerned, to say that any member on this side will in future be <i>persona non grata</i> with him, is absolute rubbish! And if he does not want to deal with a member of this side of the House on that basis, then it is about time that he made way for another Minister who is prepared to do it. We are sick and tired of this sort of thing. It has happened in the past. I have had letters from Ministers on that side of the House saying the same thing. I should like them to know that when they do so I am at liberty to tell the public just what I think of those particular Ministers. I will certainly do so in the future.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the question of third party insurance. In the past I have said that the Third Party Insurance Fund was making excessive profits. I should like to repeat that allegation this afternoon. I have obtained certain figures over a period of five years by way of questions in this House. One sees very little published about this particular fund. The time has come I am sure that the public is entitled to statements by the fund of its figures and how it is working. Be that as it may, the answers to questions I have had across the floor of the House indicate that in the five-year period the fund has collected no less than R95 676 000. In that period it paid claims of R45 million odd while the allowance for claims that have been notified but are still unpaid, amounted to R46 million. I realize that one has to make provision for claims notified but as yet unpaid. But looking back over the figures which have been supplied to me I come to the conclusion that the estimates for these claims are very accurate. In this respect the fund is to be congratulated in that they are not unduly overestimating unpaid claims. In the period 1966-&#x2019;67 premiums paid as against claims estimated and paid almost balanced. In fact, there was a slight improvement of R400 000. This was followed up in 1967-&#x2019;68 by very accurate figures again. As I have said the fund is certainly keeping estimates within reason. The interesting feature is that within this five-year period premium income as opposed to claims paid and claims notified but unpaid shows that the fund has made a profit of R3d million. This is during a five-year period. In addition to this, they have at present invested a total of no less than R54 million. If one were to take the interest earned on this money, calculated at a reasonable interest rate, this gives at least another R2&#x00BD; million interest earned. So in a period of five years this fund has accumulated profits of R6 million. And when I say therefore that this fund is running up excessive profits I think I am quite justified in saying so. Surely the time has come then for the fund to reduce its premiums. There is no reason on earth for the fund to continue to operate at the present premium because one now has the experience of the claims received and the claims paid. This leaves us still with a tremendous balance of R6 million profit over a period of five years. It must be borne in mind that these are public funds and the public are therefore entitled to whatever benefits are received.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister something rather pertinent in regard to this. In answer to a question earlier in the Session the hon. the Minister showed how the investment of the fund is taking place. This showed that a figure of R21 million odd was invested as at 31st December, 1969, in banking institutions. At the end of December. 1970, the figure had risen to R31 million. I hope the hon. the Minister is listening to what I have to say otherwise <span class="col_5243-5244" refersTo="page_1281"/>he will be <i>persona non grata</i> as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to explain to this Committee why there was a change in investment with these banking institutions. The Bank of the Orange Free State had at the end of 1969 an amount of R2 050 000 invested. At the end of 1970 that figure had dropped to R510 000. The Rand Bank at the end of 1969 had R3 475 000, and at the end of December, 1970, it had R10 million. Sir, there must be some explanation for this, because surely the amount of interest is the same for either bank, or very nearly the same, and surely it does not warrant a switch from R3,5 million to roughly R10 million to that bank&#x2019;s advantage. But the most extraordinary thing is that the Trust Bank had at the end of 1969 R3,5 million, but by the end of 1970 that investment had dropped to R550 000, a reduction in one year of no less than R3 million to an old established institution. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister in all seriousness this question: Has this change in the investment patterns&#x2014;because one would assume that the rates of interest are very much the same-&#x2014;-been brought about because the Chairman of the Board of the Trust Bank is making certain noises which are not favourable to the governing party? [Interjections.] I can come to no other conclusion but that this is the reason, because it shows further down as well that the Western Bank had R3.2 million at the end of 1969, and at the end of 1970 it had R7,5 million. There is some pattern going on in regard to these investments. I say again that this is public money. Therefore the public is entitled to know why this fund suddenly loses confidence in one institution and places its confidence in another institution. particularly in the case where it is moving from an old-established and highly reputable banking organization like the Trust Bank, where you find that R3 550 000 in 1969 had dropped to R550 000 in 1970.</p>

<p>When it comes to the building societies, the same pattern does not occur and the investments appear to be fairly consistent. Therefore I say to the hon. the Minister that he owes this Committee an explanation as to why this has taken place. All I can suggest to him, failing a reasonable explanation. is that this change in investment patterns is being brought about for political reasons. I would also say to the hon. the Minister that the 16 very favourably placed companies made last year a gross profit of R1 316 817. The only thing here is that there is no business in South Africa whose profits are guaranteed to this extent, because from these profits is only taken the agent&#x2019;s commission of 5 per cent, and there are no risks in so far as claims are concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister will probably deal with the aspects which the hon. member has just touched upon. All that surprised me was that he should look for a political issue in this matter which has nothing to do with politics, and I wonder whether he is not displaying the same tendency as the hon. member for Simonstown with his stories about the fishing industry. But I do want to concede this to the hon. member, that if he was able, with his speech, to bring it to the attention of the public that the new third party discs must be on their motorcars as from Saturday, then he succeeded. [Interjections.] If the hon. member would stop prattling, I shall proceed with my speech.</p>

<p>I want to broach a matter with the hon. the Deputy Minister, which is perhaps of limited scope, but which can nevertheless become very important. I am referring to the introduction about a week ago in my constituency of what is now known as the &#x201C;wine route&#x201D;. This is a series of roads which bypass approximately 18 farms on which estate wines are being produced, and which have now been organized under the Cape Estate Wine Producers&#x2019; Association. From a tourist point of view this route is of particular importance. If one took into account the interest and the number of persons who were present at the inauguration of that route, then one can picture to oneself what it could mean for us in future from the point of view of tourism. Sir, my point is that the association in question, in order to advertise this route, in order to enable tourists to visit these separate farms, has designed an emblem and has also drawn up a route map which has been very tastefully prepared. The emblem, with the permission of the local authority, the divisional council, appears alongside the roads which give access to these farms in question. But now it so happens that at the two national road routes, which pass on both sides of the area, there is restricted access by means of traffic intersections to the wine route in question which is situated between the two national roads. I know that it is the policy of the National <span class="col_5245-5246" refersTo="page_1282"/>Transport Commission not to allow advertisements along national roads, nor at points where there are traffic intersections. But I nevertheless want to make a plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister and ask him whether consideration cannot be given to displaying the emblem of this association, which is associated with the wine route, at the traffic intersections in question. I think there are only three of them along the route between Cape Town and Paarl, and one or at most two along the route between Cape Town and Somerset West. Sir, I want to suggest that this emblem, which I think the hon. the Deputy Minister has already seen where it appears on the farms, cannot in any way be associated with an advertisement as provided in the Act, because it does not advertise the products of any specific person. It can only be associated with a particular route and a particular region. I would be very grateful, not only on behalf of the wine industry but also on behalf of the tourist industry, if the hon. the Deputy Minister could take this matter under consideration.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Strictly to taste it, Sir.</p>

<p>Sir, I wish to raise a matter with the hon. the Deputy Minister which arose out of a tragic occurrence which took place in my constituency on the 11th November, 1969, when the aircraft piloted by Mr. Denis Pharazyn, of Pacair crashed. I want to say that as far as we in Pietermaritzburg are concerned, Pacair was beginning to develop into the sort of charter and civil aviation company for which we had been looking for a very long time. In fact, I had hoped to be able to approach Parliament for members to be able to use this as an easy means of getting to Johannesburg. Today, if you want to travel to Johannesburg you have to travel from your farm for an hour and a half in order to be at the airport half an hour before the flight takes off: which mean two hours of travelling and 40 minutes of flying to get to Johanneburg. Sir, this would have meant a saving of an hour and a half for us in travelling time, but as a result of the crash, I think this matter has been put off for some time. I would like to have a chance later on to approach the hon. the Deputy Minister in this regard. But the point that I wish to make is the delay which took place between the appointment of the commission of inquiry, the submission of the report to the Minister and the Minister&#x2019;s approval of it and the settling of the claim by the insurance company, which enabled this company to resume or to have some prospects of resuming the service which they were offering to Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, in view of the increasing importance of civil aviation in South Africa, whether it is not possible to have, somewhere within the department, a permanent board which will go into the causes of accidents. In this particular case the accident took place on the 11th November. The board of inquiry was appointed on 19th December. Its first meeting was held on the 22nd April. Its next meeting was held on the 16th June. Between the 22nd April and the 16th June the test flight was carried out which attempted to find out the reasons for the crash taking place. The report was submitted to the hon. the Minister on the 15th September. I must say that once it was submitted to the hon. the Minister, the process of approval took place very rapidly indeed. However, even after having been accepted by the hon. the Minister, the pay-out of the insurance moneys to the company concerned was delayed. It seems to me that there is no reason why some permanent body consisting of members of the department, could not exist which could start the investigation immediately and could expedite the inquiry which has to take place after such an aeroplane accident.</p>

<p>I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to explain one point to me which arose out of the inquiry. At this inquiry there was present counsel that represented the insurance company. During the course of the proceedings, counsel for the insurance company cross-questioned witnesses. I do not know the procedure and I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will explain to me on what basis such a counsel representing an insurance company which might later be involved in legal proceedings takes part in the cross-questioning of witnesses and in the actual workings of the commission <span class="col_5247-5248" refersTo="page_1283"/>of inquiry appointed by the hon. the Minister. I do not quite see how this can happen with fairness to all parties. I believe something should be done in this regard. I believe this is something which puts the insurance company itself, to my mind, in a false position should litigation arise from the results of the inquiry as approved by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the question of facilities at this Pietermaritzburg aerodrome, the Oribi airport, was touched upon by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City. With the growing importance of Pietermaritzburg, I believe, that the department should consider the siting of at least two additional beacons to aid aircraft coming in from Johannesburg. The problem is that these aircraft have to descend virtually all the way when coming in to this airport. The practice is for them to fly over New Hanover where there is a beacon. From New Hanover they have to turn to get down to Pietermaritzburg. This allows pilots to fly from high ground down to low ground coming in to Pietermaritzburg. There is a non-directional beacon on the aerodrome at Oribi. If pilots fly over the F.M. beacon at Hilton Road, they then fly towards high ground and then have to drop down to land at the airport at Pietermaritzburg. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to investigate the siting of the beacons at the Oribi aerodrome. It is, as anybody knows, a very difficult section of the country. Mist prevails there. Without these navigational aids, civil aviation in the Pietermaritzburg area will be hindered very severely indeed.</p>

<p>Therefore, my plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister is that steps should be taken to expedite the appointment of a commission of inquiry. The submission of the report and the approval to allow insurance payments and so forth, should take place with the utmost rapidity.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, to end the debate on this side of the House, I want to return to where we started this afternoon with the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s hour-plus address to this House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister spent a great deal of time and went to a great deal of trouble to tell this House that there has been an increase in air traffic in South Africa. Rip van Winkel waking up! We all know that. Everybody knows that there has been an increase in air traffic. Even the Airways knows there has been an increase in air traffic. But the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport tells us this afternoon that there has been an increase in air traffic and are we not all clever boys. Our argument is that the Department of Transport has not kept up with that increase and not that there has not been an increase. Of course there has been in increase. In fact, there has been a terrific increase and it is only recently that the Airways themselves have caught up with demand. Before they had been lagging behind the demand, so that there were long wait lists. However, they have not caught up with the delay on the ground. Let me take the question of navigational aids. The hon. the Deputy Minister quoted at great length today to show how well served we were with navigational aids, but he chose the three international airports. He chose Jan Smuts Airport, Bloemfontein, which is the over-fly for international flights which have to over-fly Jan Smuts, and Cape Town. Why did he not talk about East London, Port Elizabeth and Durban? Why did he not tell us that time after time one or other of those navigational aids is out of order and that pilots complain continuously of the risks which they have to take? The hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport, however, comes with long lists of aids at three international airports, where, of course, we know there are aids. Some of them are not yet satisfactory. Take Durban today. Does he know how far his radar control covers from Durban? With modern jet aircraft it is a matter of a few seconds flying. With modern aircraft and the speed at which they travel, we cannot have radar with a 20 to 30 mile radius and say that we are equipped with radar. We have to have more and more modern equipment. Last year I queried the fact that only R1 million had been voted for navigational aids. Then we were told that we have all the aids we want, and that everything is under control. This year the Deputy Minister comes back and he puts on R3 million, whereas last year we were told that the position was perfectly satisfactory. Suddenly they found it was not so satisfactory, and therefore R3 million has to be voted this year.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to the buildings themselves. I do not want to embarrass the hon. the Minister too much in this regard. However, we remember his gaffe with terminals and which terminal he happened to be on at a particular time last year. But I would like to ask him to look up in a <span class="col_5249-5250" refersTo="page_1284"/>dictionary so that he can see the difference between &#x201C;prefabricated&#x201D; and &#x201C;montasiebou&#x201D;. I think he will find that they are not so far apart. At least, if he is correct, the hon. the Minister of Community Development, who has been talking about &#x201C;montasie&#x201D; housing for a long time, does not know what he is talking about.</p>

<p>Let us look at the situation. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister assure this House that when the jumbo jets start flying at the end of this year, Jan Smuts Airport is going to be ready to receive them? I say this because we are only voting R8 million this year for this purpose. An amount of R20 million still remains to be spent before the Jan Smuts programme is completed. I want to make a prediction that when the jumbo jets start flying, Jan Smuts will not be ready to handle them with all the planned advances and buildings which are required. That is why we say that the department on the ground is not keeping up.</p>

<p>Let us take Durban. The situation in Durban is impossible. I looked at the timetable for today. Today, Monday, 28 flights will arrive at and leave Durban. That is just for today. The situation is already chaotic. The South African Airways staff and the staff of the Department of Transport are working under impossible conditions. The way they handle people going through that building is incredible. The facilities they have are insufficient, the equipment is insufficient, and they do not have the space to work. What is the position these? We have a staff which is working itself to death, whereas only R300 000 is voted for additions to Durban. An amount of R4 million is unspecified and I hope that the hon. the Minister will tell us what the amount of R4 million under Loan Vote &#x201C;L&#x201D; is for and what the details of that expenditure are. I have looked at the plans for Durban and even if those plans are put into effect, it will still be unsatisfactory. At the moment the situation is chaotic and I want to plead with the hon. the Deputy Minister not to let Durban suffer any longer under a situation of having to handle too many passengers with unsatisfactory facilities. I hope that the situation will be reviewed and that Durban will also become an international airport as the other airports like Cape Town and Jan Smuts are. I do not have the time to take this matter further, because I want to deal very briefly with the arrival of passengers at D. F. Malan Airport.</p>

<p>What I want to say is not hearsay. At the outset I want to pay tribute to the courtesy of the South African Airways ground hostess whom I went to see. My children, and the children of many other members on this side of the House, and I assume also on that side, arrive by air at D. F. Malan. I asked permission to go in and to receive their luggage. I was told that not even for an invalid, a cripple or an old lady are you allowed in. She said that she would have liked me to go but that there was the ruling of the Department of Transport against it. She said that the ground hostess would see the children through. Of course she did not, because there was no ground hostess to see them through. I then asked for a porter to be sent in to carry their luggage because they could not carry their own luggage. They said that they would see about that, but there was no porter and nobody was sent in to help them. The ground hostess then said that there was nothing she could do about the matter. What sort of attitude is this where parents are not allowed, for the sake of stupid red tape, to meet their children. Because it is an international terminal, and because there is an international arrivals notice up nobody may go in and meet their own children, with the result that they have to find their own way through? I want to say again that the Airways hostess was very courteous but she said that there was nothing she could do about it.</p>

<p>Finally I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he will explain to this House what it is about Cabinet Ministers which makes it impossible for them to drive in motor-cars with a GG number-plate. I raised the question of 17 motorcars which had their number-plates changed for three days, from the 10th November to the 13th November, to convey Nationalist Party Cabinet Ministers from their hotels to a Nationalist Party Congress. There are only 24 Ministers, 18 Ministers and six Deputy-Ministers, and they were not all at the Congress, but of the 17 of them who were there each had to have his own motor-car. They could not take three Cabinet Ministers from one hotel to the conference room in one motor-car. They had to have three motor-cars each conveying a Minister. They could not take them in an ordinary Government Garage car. Since we picked them out last year about expenses running into hundreds and hundreds of rand for bringing cars from Bloemfontein, <span class="col_5251-5252" refersTo="page_1285"/>Durban and East London to Port Elizabeth, they decided this time not to bring motor-cars from all over South Africa, but to use local Government Garage cars. They could not use them, however, because they had GG number-plates. Mr. Chairman, have you ever heard anything so idiotic and ridiculous? Members of the Public Service then had to go and license and register motor-cars for three days only, take out a new registration and then had to go to Messrs. Motor and General Supplies and buy 17 pairs of number-plates. These number-plates had to be fitted, then taken off again. They also had to change the discs for three days! They had to do all this in order that Ministers would not be insulted by having to be driven in a motorcar with GG number-plates. It was the same motor-car and the same driver. At the end of the three-day conference it all had to be undone. They say it only cost R2-10 per motor-car &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>We know the hon. member for Durban Point to be the jester in this House. Let me first say something about the GG motor-cars he had such a lot to say about. The hon. member is aware that there was an article about this in the <i>Daily Dispatch.</i> The <i>Daily Dispatch</i> was subsequently invited by the Department of Transport to substantiate the allegations in that article. The newspaper explained that the information, i.e. the information the hon. member for Durban Point used across the floor of this House, was obtained from officials and that if those officials could be granted indemnity against any steps which might be taken against them as a result of the fact that they had made the information available, the newspaper would produce the evidence. Well, written indemnity was granted on the understanding that the newspaper would produce the evidence supporting the allegations of the hon. member for Durban Point. But we are still waiting for it.

Danger beacons are already in service at two places, etc. I am proud of the navigational aid services we are already providing. For example, we have the best calibration aircraft in the entire world, an aircraft which we bought for R1 million while other countries have to purchase it for R2 million today.

I come now to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth and the hon. member for Walmer. I have no quarrel with the hon. member for Newton Park. He rectified the matter; he came and told me that this was wrong. The hon. member for Walmer said: &#x201C;It is a pity that it was published in a slightly different manner&#x201D;. But when something is published in a slightly different manner, a completely different impression can be created, a different connotation can be attached to it. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central admitted this, but the hon. member still ran to the Press and said that the statement made by the hon. the Deputy Minister was incorrect. I do not accept his explanation, and I want the Committee to know this. I received a letter from the hon. member for Walmer in which he apologized for the incorrect newspaper report. That gives me all the more right to call this newspaper to order. The hon. member for Algoa, and I think the hon. member for Newton Park as well, advocated that we subsidize Coloured transport, in the same way as in the case of the Bantu Transport Services Act, (Act No. 53 of 1957), as amended. The hon. member for Newton Park referred to the fact that the Minister of Community Development is already investigating the matter. To accomplish this, however, would entail passing legislation in order to have those employers making use of Coloured labour pay the same levy and in order to work out from time to time to what extent the scheme would have to be subsidized. But, as has been said, the matter is being investigated and when this has been done, the Government will give consideration to it.</p>

<p>Those hon. members who put up such a fight here, alleged one after the other that these increased bus fares were simply the last straw which broke the camel&#x2019;s back. But, as the hon. the Minister correctly said, why do hon. members not go to their supporters there, to the employers, and ask them to pay their employees a worthwhile wage? No, they come and attack the Government and shift the responsibility for the unfortunate state of affairs which developed there onto the shoulders of the Government instead of where it belongs.</p>

<p>On the one hand hon. members opposite are advocating that the Government should spend more, that it should subsidize bus services, but on the other hand they try to defend their supporters, the employers, because they do not want to pay their employees a worthwhile wage. They do this by trying to hide behind inflation. That is a very poor show.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Houghton is concerned, I am not prepared to reply to her. In any case, she did not discuss transport, but merely tried to be an intercessor for incitement; we know that to be typical of her.</p>

<p>To the hon. member for Walmer I want to say that they cannot discuss a matter here which has still to be heard. Should they try to do so, they would be prejudicing the case. If the information which hon. members have at their disposal, information in favour of a decrease in the fares, is true, they must plead the matter when the appeal is heard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mossel Bay had a lot to say about the coastal road. Arising out of representations we have received from various sources against the alignment of the proposed coastal route, and an inspection <span class="col_5255-5256" refersTo="page_1287"/><i>in loco,</i> the National Transport Commission has decided to investigate alternative alignments between Somerset West and Mossel Bay first, before arriving at a final decision. Sufficient information in regard to possible alternative routes is expected to be collected in 1971-&#x2019;72 to enable the Commission to decide on the final alignment of the route between the Strand and Bot River. Between Bot River and Mossel Bay various alternative proposals are at present being surveyed in order to determine the best route between Bot River and Bredasdorp, and at Puntjie, De Hoop Valley and Still Bay. We shall give thorough consideration to the representations he has made. I think that we are as anxious to preserve that beautiful natural scenery there.</p>

<p>The hon. member has also admonished us in regard to soil washaways. I should like to inform him that under the new Act we are making provision for every possible step to be taken to prevent soil washaways and to see to it that with the alignment and the construction of the road, that flow of water can be regulated in such a way that there will be the least possible, or no soil washaways. We are all aware of this problem.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about fencing and measures to keep the game off the road. I think the hon. member presented a very strong case, not only for the protection of that game which we would all like to see being protected, but also for the sake of road safety. National roads are, in particular constructed with a view to road safety, and it is necessary that we have effective fencing-off of the road there, for if one is driving at night, or at any other time, and game wanders onto the road, one automatically swerves away and this could cause accidents. That is why we want to fence this road off so that we will not have that problem with game on those roads. This will consequently be done.</p>

<p>I have already replied to the hon. member for Newton Park. I just want to add the following. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister that we cannot have an Act which would saddle the Minister with the responsibility of repealing or changing the resolutions of the road transport councils, for if one were to do that, one would be depriving the National Road Transport Commission entirely of its autonomy, and then one could just as well dissolve it. [Interjections.] He cannot even suspend it. The act does not make provision for that.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Welkom, Bloemfontein West and Pietermaritzburg City all made a very strong plea in regard to road safety. I agree with all three of them, but you know that there is a commission of inquiry. Its report would possibly have been available for perusal at the end of April, but I have now learnt that they hope to submit it in June or July, because they are making a very thorough investigation. For that reason I do not want to anticipate their report in regard to the suggestions the hon. members put forward here. I think this commission of inquiry and we, too, are well aware that this is a problem which must be investigated very thoroughly and which must be tackled with great thoroughness in order to put an end to this problem. I can only say this. This morning I presented one of our motorcar drivers with a badge for road safety after 32 years of accident-free driving, which is a fine example. I said on that occasion that one drives as one lives. In other words, the driving ability of the individual and the way in which he drives, are linked to his personality. If one is considerate of others and willing to help, and if one&#x2019;s inter-personal relationships are satisfactory, etc., it is reflected in one&#x2019;s driving. Then we will have far fewer accidents in South Africa, and I hope we will all try to emulate this fine example. We in South Africa are not sufficiently road conscious, and consequently we make many of these mistakes.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do drive, and I am proud of my driving. You need not be concerned about that. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City spoke about railway crossings. I shall come in a moment to the aircraft accidents which other members also mentioned. I just want to mention the following very briefly. The present amount for the elimination of railway crossings is R4,5 million, <i>viz.</i> R1,5 million from the Railways, R1,5 million from the Central Government, and R1,5 million from the Roads Fund. I can tell you briefly that since this Act was introduced, we have earmarked 430 railway crossings for elimination. Between 1960 and the end of 1969 127 of this total had already been eliminated by means of <span class="col_5257-5258" refersTo="page_1288"/>90 bridges, 17 subways, four link roads, one road detour, two pedestrian subways, one pedestrian bridge and one work reconstruction scheme at an estimated cost of more than R13 634 000. This was done out of the elimination of railway crossings fund. During 1970 14 crossings were eliminated by means of 13 bridges, and one subway, at an estimated cost of R2 842 000. You will see, Sir, that at present 30 bridges, one subway and a deviation of line is at present under the construction or will shortly be tackled, by which means a further 35 scheduled railway crossings will be eliminated at a cost of approximately R5&#x00BD; million. I am simply mentioning this so that you can see, Sir, that we are really hard at work eliminating railway crossings.</p>

<p>Sir, I shall return in a moment to the problem of aircraft, touched upon here by the hon. member for Mooi River.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein District said a very important thing here, and I hope the Cape Provincial Administration will take note of it. It is a fact that there is a daily stream of pedestrians back and forth across the road between the city and the D. F. Malan building, which is a limited access road. These pedestrians stream across the road through holes which have been cut in the fence. In addition, open spaces in the road reserves are being used as football fields, and my only fear is that when we disallow this and decide to fence in the road, we shall have another new agitation on the part of the hon. member for Houghton who will say that non-Whites are once again being deprived of their rights. Sir, the sooner we put an end to this kind of thing and see to it that the Coloureds are able to enjoy the necessary recreational facilities in their own areas instead of within our road reserves, the better. I hope that cognizance will be taken of what I have said.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member asked me whether we had a master plan in regard to national roads for the next 10 years. Unfortunately I cannot, owing to the limited time at my disposal, furnish him with the full particulars. I can only inform him that during the next 10 years the following amounts will be spent on national roads by the provinces alone: The Cape R210 850 000; Natal R276 600 000; The Orange Free State R170 500 000 and the Transvaal R271 200 00. Sir, you will see that the amounts which will be spent on roads during the next 10 years are extremely large amounts. These roads are expensive. Let me just mention one example: The Somerset West-Botriver-Bredas-dorp-Mossel Bay road alone costs R69 million. I am mentioning this, Sir, to show you that we are working according to a national plan. Time does not allow me to mention all the roads; I should have liked to have done so. If hon. members are interested, I could furnish them with the figures.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member asked whether we could not give consideration, when we build a national road right up to a city, to giving those funds to the local authority to plan a road for us running through that city instead of building a ring-road around it. I want to inform that hon. member that this is impracticable. We analysed what it would cost to do what Bloemfontein wanted to do. If Bloemfontein had built this national road through the city, it would have cost approximately R190 million, while the ring-roads passing on either side of Bloemfontein cost R47 million. But apart from that a national road is a road which links up from point to point throughout the country. You have limited access only, and we are arranging, by way of ring-roads, that all roads running to Bloemfontein from other places link up with the national road by means of fly-overs, subways or traffic intersections. In this way the city is then supplied with roads from all sides. It is essential to do this, particularly if one considers the Witwatersrand complex, with the East Rand on the one side and the West Rand on the other. In addition, the policy now is no longer to give the local authorities the amounts we previously gave them.</p>

<p>Sir, while I am dealing with roads, I just want to reply briefly to the hon. member for Stellenbosch. I have already given an undertaking to grant the hon. member and this association which wants to establish the wine route there an interview. Our Act provides that one cannot have advertisements adjoining roads. But I think that, in the same way as we indicate at our traffic intersections that this road goes to Mayfair or that road to Muizenberg, we will have to give some thought to allowing an indication there that this is the wine route road. We shall look into this matter, because I think this is a very fine undertaking. For example on one wine route I noticed that even a piece of history was presented of how Adam Tas fell off his horse one evening when he was drunk, <span class="col_5259-5260" refersTo="page_1289"/>and had made political propaganda, and had then slept on a farm which is on the wine route. We shall give consideration to this request. It will have a fine attraction for tourists.</p>

<p>One wonders sometimes whether one should take notice of the hon. member for Port Natal. Till Eulenspiegel has a saying for it, &#x201C;The people hate me, but I am always asking for it.&#x201D; Every time he rises to his feet, he creates that impression. That is why he must not take it amiss of me when I say that I wonder whether one should take much notice of him. Let us look at the questions he asked. In the first instance he said, in regard to the investments, that when he analyses the investments, it seems to him, because the managing director of the Trust Bank attacked and reprimanded the Government, that it is not getting the investment capital it should be getting. The hon. member for Port Natal asked us to explain this. Let me inform the hon. member that the hon. the Minister receives a submission of the available investments which have to be made. There is no political interference. For example, in the submission I received last year, the amount available was R28 million. Of that he gave Iscor R10 million; he gave an amount to Volkskas, because they are helping to finance Putco which is a transport service. We also give amounts to building societies. It is not determined politically by the Minister to which building societies these amounts should be given. Whether it is a United Party or a National Party building society, does not matter. We are at present approving a further amount of R4 million for building societies, because building societies are making their contribution to help solve the housing problem in South Africa. The Department makes the arrangements as the requests come in from the building societies. We come then to the banking institutions. These are short- and long-term investments. We therefore see a variation here, because money must be available there in order to make payments. To banking institutions, on a short-term basis, an amount of R9,5 million was given. Neither the Minister nor I determine that the Western Bank should receive so much and the Trust Bank so much, and that another bank should receive another amount. The manager of the fund analyses and sees to it that he makes his investments where he can get the highest interest. Sir, to make that accusation which the hon. member made here, is so much rubbish, if I may put it like that.</p>

<p>The hon. member tried to show that this fund had supposedly made so much profit. He could not analyse it, because he did not know what the outstanding claims were. The outstanding claims on the 1965-&#x2019;66 premiums were 28 in the rural areas and 66 in the cities. For 1966-&#x2019;67 there were 180 in the rural areas and 580 in the cities. For 1967-&#x2019;68 there were 620 in the rural areas and 1 892 in the cities. In 1968-&#x2019;69 there were 3 702 in the rural areas and 11 560 in the cities. In 1969-&#x2019;70 the number of outstanding claims numbered 4 369 in the rural areas &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am enumerating the outstanding claims. These are not the totals in rands, but I shall come to that in a moment. In 1969-&#x2019;70 the number of outstanding claims in the cities was 15 980. This is therefore the number of claims outstanding. In other words, there is a total of 20 349 claims which are outstanding for the premiums which have been paid from 1965-&#x2019;66 up to the present. It is unknown what the amount per claim is. However, we do have a premium committee which analyses the matter. I now want to issue a warning, so that hon. members can know what the actual state of affairs is. I want to mention a few figures. If claims as against premiums in respect of the rural areas are analysed, and the existing premiums for 1965-&#x2019;66 are taken as an example, then the premium on motor cycles was R6 for example and the claims <span class="col_5261-5262" refersTo="page_1290"/>experience R12-20 per motor cycle. In other words, the claims exceeded the premiums. What is also interesting is the case of hearses. Here the premiums are R6 and the claims R6-38. On motor dealers&#x2014;these are the motor cars with the red number plates&#x2014;the premiums are R50 and claims R50-45. But let us look at other cases which are much more important. On public vehicles (taxis) in cities the premium is R57 and the claims R60-83. On goods vehicles the premium is R48 and the claims R53-64.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The premium in respect of the private motorist amounts to R70 and the claims experience is R18-24 in the city. Here, too, the premium is less than the claims experience. We are still able to pay these claims because we earned R11 million in interest by means of our investments. That is the reason why we are able to pay these claims. That is why I am also able to say that the premium committee, which has to submit an annual analysis to the Minister, proposed that the premiums should not be increased at present. They proposed that we should continue as at present. I think that is an achievement.</p>

<p>In this connection I want in conclusion to refer to a Press report on the insolvency of one of the biggest British insurance companies, which entailed that millions of people were without third party insurance. South Africa is, under our scheme, in the fortunate position that we will not again have the problems we were faced with in the past and which the British are now faced with.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the matters raised by the hon. member for Mooi River.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member referred to the question of delay in proceedings relating to fatal aircraft accidents. I can inform the hon. member that all present investigations are up to date. Nothing is lagging behind. What is the procedure? The department&#x2019;s inspector of accidents or in his absence, some other suitable official of the Division of Civil Aviation, is sent with the least possible delay to the scene of the accident and investigations <i>in situ</i> are commenced immediately. These investigations include taking a series of photographs and measurements from which a locality plan can be drawn up. They also include a detailed examination of the wreckage for possible faults and where necessary the removal of certain parts for subsequent detailed investigation. Arrangements are also made for special post mortem examinations and evidence of eye witnesses is obtained. Investigations usually extend to the home station of the aircraft and the responsible maintenance organization. That is the first step. A full investigation is also carried out into the qualifications and experience of the crew, with particular reference to their experience on the aircraft-type involved in the accident. The maintenance history of the aircraft is also carefully scrutinized. Information is also obtained regarding the history of the particular flight, the weather pertaining before and at the time of the accident and, where necessary, the functioning of navigational aids.</p>

<p>This comprehensive investigation, especially where tests and research work has to be conducted, may, depending on the complexity of the investigation, take many months. Hon. members realize that. In the meantime the department gives consideration to the question of the appointment of a board of inquiry. The nature of the accident, the aircraft type and the type of operation dictates the qualifications and the experience of the persons who can be considered for recommendation for appointment to such boards. These things are taken into consideration by the department when making its recommendations. The board is appointed by the Minister in terms of section 12 (1) of the Aviation Act, 1962. When the department&#x2019;s investigation into the accident is completed, the inspector of accidents prepares his report for submission to the board of inquiry. A date and venue for the sitting of the board is then fixed, witnesses are subpoenaed and other arrangements for holding the public inquiries are made. In some cases, after the first sitting, the board may require additional evidence to be submitted for the further tests to be carried out. In these cases, a further sitting or even two sittings, have to be convened before the board is satisfied that every aspect of the investigation has been covered and all possible evidence <span class="col_5263-5264" refersTo="page_1291"/>obtained. The preparation of the report of the board may also take several weeks, depending on the complexity of the accident and the evidence submitted to it, which must be carefully analysed.</p>

<p>*So I can continue to indicate to hon. members that this is a matter which cannot simply be disposed of.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that the legal representatives of the insurers were present. I have no knowledge of this, but I shall have this matter investigated and let the hon. member know what the correct procedure is.</p>

<p>The hon. member went on to say that many of these air accidents are possibly due to inadequate navigational aids. I can give the hon. member the assurance that I have perused all reports of investigations and that I have not yet, in any of these reports, seen a lack of navigational aids being advanced as a reason for an accident. I think that with these words I have replied to the questions put to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, of course no people are allowed on the loading zone, for reasons of safety. Previously all passengers entered via the old building, and because it was not built according to international standards, there was no partition. Thus parents were able to go to meet their children at the gate and accompany them on their way to get their baggage. The new building through which people now have to pass, is built according to the international pattern. Nowhere, at international reception, is there sufficient room allowed for the convergence of a large number of people. It is built in such a way that there is only room enough to allow the passengers who have to be handled to move through. Hon. members in this House can testify, as I can, that when there are small children there are always air hostesses who can come to their assistance and help them until they reach their parents. I have never yet seen little children being left to themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is some gossip going about that number plates were changed on motor-cars in which Ministers are supposed to have driven. I think the matter should be rectified. I have been Minister of Transport for more than 16 years now. During those 16 years I have never given such an instruction to my Department. My predecessor never gave such instructions, and I personally will have no objection to driving in a GG motor-car. This instruction was given by Gen. Smuts and his Government years ago. In other words, it happened in the years when certain of those hon. young members on the other side, who are having such a good laugh about this matter, were still wearing nappies. The instructions were given at that time, and there were probably good reasons for doing so. As far as I can understand, the good reason was that &#x2026;</p>

<p>Security measures were in those days one of the good reasons advanced. Another reason was that a Minister has free use of his motor-car, but that an official driving in a GG motor-car does not have free use of that motor-car. It is the duty of the public when they see a person in a GG motor-car at a place where he ought not to be, to report that person <span class="col_5265-5266" refersTo="page_1292"/>to the Department. The Minister does not keep a logbook in his motor-car, while officials do in fact have to keep a logbook. There we consequently have the difference between the two. I just want to say to the hon. member and the newspaper which made such a fuss about it, that this is not an instruction which I or my predecessor gave, but an instruction given by Gen.

The hon. the Minister will be going on a trip abroad very soon and we wish him a pleasant and a fruitful voyage. He will be visiting the United States, Canada and Europe. I am a bit sorry that he could not touch at Buenos Aires either on his way to or from the United States with our New South African Airways service. It would not have meant more than an additional day or two, or maybe three days. I am also a bit disappointed that he is not going to visit our information offices in Brussels and in Vienna. Today Brussels is, even more than Geneva, an international city especially as it is the capital, so to speak of the Common Market. Vienna is for many countries of the West one of the major listening posts on this side of the Iron Curtain. He will have a task to perform abroad as the Minister of Information. However, he is also the Minister of Immigration and in all these cities there are immigration offices. I would like to know from him whether he will also make a point of visiting, instead of making a double trip, the information offices and at the same time the immigration offices in his capacity as Minister of Immigration. Perhaps he could also find out something about other offices which deal with information about South Africa in the cities which he will be visiting. There are the South African Tourist Corporation offices and the offices of our Foreign Trade Advisers under the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. Above all, I trust that he will have quiet and confidential chats with our ambassadors in all these major cities, whereby he can really find out from them how the information offices can help to a greater extent than they may be doing at the present moment. It is one of the most important tasks of the hon. the Minister to see that there is proper co-ordination between our foreign service and between our information offices. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s whole trip will be costing R20 000. This will mean that an amount of close on R350 per day is granted for him and his party, but if he can do as I have suggested, and if he can improve the information services, and we can see that they are acting as they should, that money will be well-spent.</p>

<p>*However, he has many other difficulties. He is being handicapped in his policy and he is being handicapped in his task, firstly, by the Government&#x2019;s policy, and, secondly, by his own declared policy of the past. One must not forget that the hon. the Minister is a person who will have to defend, for example, a Coloured policy through his Department of Information &#x2026;</p>

<p>I should like to point out that the Department has 70 or 80 information officers and that there are amongst them in Cape Town alone seven for the Coloureds. In this regard I have a reply here from the hon. the Minister. Does the hon. the Minister have officers for the Coloureds?</p>

<p>I just want to point out that in his reply, the hon. the Minister said that the Department also had Coloureds in its service who had to explain the Government&#x2019;s policy to the Coloured people. All I am saying is that the hon. the Minister is going to have trouble with this, as it is a policy, no matter how officially he accepts it, in which he himself does not believe. I want to mention a second point as well. The major task of the hon. the Minister is to be able to supply information concerning South Africa. However, he is a Minister who has committed himself as being a person who believes in indoctrination. The hon. the Minister will recall saying this before he became a Minister. He said at the time that he stood for and believed in indoctrination.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Very well. However, the hon. the Minister did use the word &#x201C;indoctrination&#x201D; with reference to himself, and he can let us have his exact words. The hon. the Minister will have the task of explaining through his information service the other strange aspects of Government policy. I wish he would produce a pamphlet dealing with the sports policy as soon as possible, because I must honestly say that I do not fully understand it. I hope the hon. the Minister will soon explain through his 67 Bantu officers in the Bantu areas what exactly is going to happen now when requests are made for further independence for certain of the future independent states.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s biggest problem is and will always remain giving an explanation of things which are partly inherent in our so-called traditional policy in South Africa, but which are partly unnecessary. Here I am referring to a matter which was mentioned to me by persons who had been invited to visit South Africa, who had travelled through the country and who are favourably disposed to South Africa. These are the complaints we have to hear time after time about that matter which is called petty apartheid in South Africa. One of the biggest tasks of the hon. the Minister is contained in this. He must explain to the rest of the world, if it is possible for him to do so, why things so often take place which are not what the hon. the Prime Minister called them, namely rudeness, but which are part of the policy of this Government and which it is his and his department&#x2019;s task to explain.</p>

<p>In my opinion these are things which are impossible to explain at times, and I am sure the hon. the Chief Whip cannot explain them either, no matter how hard he tries.</p>

<p>&#x2020;There are four divisions in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department. There is the Interior Division, the Foreign Division, the Audio-Visual Services and Publications Division, and finally the Press Liaison Division. I would like, in this ten-minute speech, and possibly in the next, to say something about each of these different divisions of his department. Firstly I would like to say something about his Press Liaison Division. The hon. the Minister has taken steps to improve Press liaison and has appointed persons to see that there is better contact between the Cabinet and policymakers in the Government and the public outside. I agree with that. He has taken a further step, namely in regard to holding Press conferences at which the hon. the Prime Minister is the main figure and at which representatives of newspapers are permitted to question the Prime Minister. I believe that this is basically a good idea. I do believe that the hon. the Minister did, within his powers, organize it as well as he could. But now, having said that, I frankly want to say that I was extremely disappointed with that Press conference and its results. I believe that the major actor at that Press conference, the hon. the Prime Minister, certainly did not do as well as he could do. I looked at the questions he replied to. Of the 39 questions he replied to. I think he gave a vague reply, or a reply equivalent to not knowing, to at least 9 of them. Perhaps one can understand it, but the hon. the Prime Minister was certainly not as informative as one could wish, and I trust that when there is a Press conference again, the hon. the Prime Minister <span class="col_5269-5270" refersTo="page_1294"/>will be better prepared. This, I must say, also goes for one or two of the questions put to the hon. the Prime Minister by the questioners. Some of the questions were good, but some were utterly stupid as far as I am concerned. I do not wish to go into the details, but I think of some of the questions which were put. There was a question about the S.A. Foundation in which the questioner, a journalist or an assistant editor of a Johannesburg paper, certainly did not come off best, and he did not know his facts before he put the question. There was an almost inane question put by the representative of a financial paper from Johannesburg, a question which was utterly meaningless. How on earth the hon. the Prime Minister could have replied to that, I do not know, but at least he did give a coherent reply to an incoherent question. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>In comparison with what we heard here last year, the tenor of the speech of the hon. member for Orange Grove has actually come as a surprise. One part of the surprise is the tenor of his speech. I do think one should not despair. The hon. member is learning, and that is a fact. What has also been surprising, is that the hon. member today accepts the things which he condemned in the sharpest terms last year. Listen to what the hon. member had to say last year about the newest division of this Department, the Press Liaison Division. In this debate last year he said the following as recorded in column 4763 of Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But I am not so sure that there is much in the proposal in connection with the two Prime Minister&#x2019;s Press conferences per year to which only certain people will be invited.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There should not be a press liaison officer and an assistant liaison officer, people for hand-outs and people for briefing all the time. Is their policy so obscure that it must be explained by means of special briefings?</block>

<p>The hon. member continued in this vein, but I want to say at once that it is evident that the hon. member has been learning in the course of the year, and to my surprise. he said this afternoon that now he was in agreement with this system of press liaison.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>But you are carrying it into effect very badly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>At the moment I am first discussing the principle of the matter. The hon. member has learned now. Today he will concede to me that he has abandoned the extravagant language in which he condemned this aspect and other activities of the department last year. At present and he accepts that he was wrong. But the hon. member is out of step once again. This new system and this new dispensation of liaison with the Press has proved itself. A brilliant first major conference was held, apart from the other services this division performs by arranging background conferences and discussions with other Ministers for journalists and others. I maintain that the system has proved itself, but the hon. member could not stop himself from saying that he was deeply disappointed with that conference. Sir, I want to be so presumptuous as to say that there is only one person in South Africa who is of that opinion, and that is the hon. member for Orange Grove. For that reason I do not think this Committee can take any notice of the opinion expressed here by him. Sir, the most wonderful expressions of praise have come from all sides, not just for the idea of holding such conferences, but after the conference had taken place, journalists of all political convictions and the representatives of newspapers from all countries, said that the way in which this conference had been arranged and managed, was outstanding and comparable to the best elsewhere in the world. A newspaper which is not very generous in its praise for this side of the House, the <i>Cape Times,</i> commented favourably and the editor of that newspaper, Mr. Norton, said the following at a dinner held the evening immediately after the Press conference&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Norton said that he had found no one who did not think that the conference was a happy idea &#x2026;</block>

<p>Except the hon. member for Orange Gove&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2026; that it was most successful &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member must listen now&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and valuable and that its success and usefulness will increase in the future.</p>

<p><span class="col_5271-5272" refersTo="page_1295"/>So you see, Sir, that that high praise came from all quarters, but the hon. member said he was extremely disappointed with the way in which this conference came off. The hon. member said the hon. the Prime Minister had not done so well at that conference. This is one of the reasons for his dissatisfaction. Sir, I think one must put it differently. The very reason for the hon. member&#x2019;s dissatisfaction is that the hon. the Prime Minister did do well at that conference, because would he have been dissatisfied if the hon. the Prime Minister had not done well? Surely we had the perfect example in this House last week when the hon. the Prime Minister gave a brilliant performance on matters of policy, so much so that in the past weekend the main mouthpiece of that side of this House disparaged their performance. Surely the hon. member for Orange Grove would not have been grateful had the Prime Minister done well, and that is why he is complaining now. He is cross because things went so well, in the interests of South Africa, in the interests of the Prime Minister and his Government. For that reason he is dissatisfied with this idea.</p>

<p>The hon. member went on to refer to the questions put at this conference and he expressed his disappointment about them. He spoke of &#x201C;plain utterly stupid questions&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>They are quarrelling amongst themselves now. Is the hon. member claiming that his teachers, who boast of being the teachers of the United Party, asked &#x201C;plain stupid questions&#x201D; at that Press conference? No, Mr. Chairman, on the basis of the comments made on this conference from all sides, I do not think this Committee can take serious notice of what the hon. member said about this specific matter, especially if it is compared to the attitude he adopted last year. From my side I want to convey my deepest appreciation to the hon. the Minister, to his Press Liaison Division and to his entire Department for what they did at this conference and on other lesser known occasions. I think they are serving South Africa in a way such as we have not known before, and which deserves the thanks and praise of every loyal South African, irrespective of his political convictions. Sir, I think this Press Liaison Division, as well as the conference which was held, achieved the success it did because it enabled the Press, and especially the foreign Press as well, to come into closer contact with the officials in charge, with the Minister in charge and especially with the hon. the Prime Minister at this Press conference. Sir, the idiom is &#x201C;Unknown, unloved&#x201D;, and if one must depend for one&#x2019;s reporting at all times on what one reads and on what is written by others about people and their policies, things cannot go well with that rendering. A start has now been made to create an opportunity of coming into closer contact with the people concerned and with the policy which forms the subject of the writings. In my opinion this only bodes well for our country in general, as was evident, too, from the presentation of reports, which was direct this time, did not follow devious routes and were published all over the world.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s coming visit overseas. I am pleased he conveyed his good wishes to the Minister with regard to that visit and the task awaiting him, and that he did not follow the same course as last year when he tried to write off the Minister here and moved a reduction of R5 000 in his salary. I think he came a cropper last year and realizes at present what exactly is taking place. Even the <i>Cape Times</i> expressed the idea that the good wishes of everybody, including the Press, in South Africa were going with the Minister as he was going to carry out an important task abroad, namely to visit our foreign information offices, the people manning the outer defences. I cannot but express praise once again for the dedicated and idealistic work those people are doing for us. Last year the hon. member for Orange Grove wrote off and humiliated those people as well by saying that they were earning too much money there and that they were not <span class="col_5273-5274" refersTo="page_1296"/>really necessary there; the diplomats could do their work. Each of us who has come into contact with the staff, especially overseas, knows that the job they have to do there is not child&#x2019;s play, that it is difficult work and that it has to be performed under difficult circumstances. I believe that by visiting them the hon. the Minister will be able to learn exactly what problems they are experiencing, so that South Africa may be made to understand these problems and so that the Department, by assimilating this, may be able to devote itself so much the better to the task over there which is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>While I am discussing the staff of the Department, I also want to express the hope that our foreign information staff might be enabled to return to this country more often to serve here from time to time. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do wish the hon. member for Stellenbosch had paid attention while I was speaking. Must I repeat myself? Firstly, the idea of that Press conference and the way in which it had been arranged by the Department of Information, met with my approval; I am not blaming the hon. the Minister this afternoon for the way in which it was arranged&#x2014;it was arranged well&#x2014;but what flowed from it, was by no means as successful as one could have expected. Secondly, I said that a large number of questions were good but that there were also a large number of questions that were absurd. I have here with me the official verbatim report of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Press conference. I think it was published by the Department of Information itself. It was forwarded to me. What was meant by the following question which was put to the hon. the Prime Minister?</p>

May I just read out a few of the replies, Sir, simply to illustrate what I meant when I said that he had not replied to most questions?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall never do that, Mr. Chairman. I shall abide by your ruling. I was just on the point of replying to the criticism levelled at me by the hon. member for Stellenbosch.</p>

<p>Very well, let us now learn lessons from this first Press conference of the hon. the Prime Minister. Let us realize that these Press conferences of the hon. the Prime Minister should not become a substitute for the normal contact any journalist in South Africa has with the Government and with the Ministers. You know, Sir, a Press conference can take on the form of those arranged by President De Gaulle, which were really meant to keep the Press away from him. We do not want to see something of that nature here. But this is all I want to say about that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I come to the Foreign Division of the Department of Information. There again I pointed out some of the problems which the hon. the Minister and his officials will have. There is the problem of the correct approach to be made by them when they try to impart and propagate information about South Africa overseas. In this connection I trust that the hon. the Minister has read what I regard as a brilliant article, although he may not agree with it. I refer to the article written by my hon. friend, the member for Von Brandis, Mr. De Villiers in the <i>New Nation,</i> February, 1971, under the title: &#x201C; &#x2018;Cow-catcher&#x2019; of Diplomacy.&#x201D; It is an excellent article, although the hon. the Minister may not agree with everything in it. I hope that that article can be distributed abroad amongst our information offices.</p>

<p>We have to be careful with regard to the material we distribute abroad. It is entirely wrong to give it a party-political slant or a colour which is associated only with the Government. The more the propaganda can appear to be entirely neutral and separated from opinion, the better that propaganda will be. I wish to quote what the <span class="col_5275-5276" refersTo="page_1297"/>hon. the Minister said himself, when he addressed a dinner for the Press, some time ago. He quoted when he said:</p>

<block name="quote">I grow in the conviction that readers of American newspapers want reporting of the news and expression of opinion separated, and so separated that they can tell which is which.</block>

<p>So please, let us, in our propaganda, keep news factual and keep opinion, if opinion must be there, entirely separated from the rest.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, information is a much better word. I believe in information, but information is based on facts while propaganda is one-sided information. Good information gives the point of view of both sides. May I, in this respect, suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should also, when speaking about South Africa and the policies of the different parties, tell the rest of the world of the policies of the United Party, the official Opposition. He will be surprised what greater acceptance South Africa will receive once a country knows that there is a responsible Opposition in South Africa with the views, which we have, of a more outward nature than the Government or the hon. the Minister actually have.</p>

<p>I looked at the names and the posts of the senior information officials. I am sure that the majority of his officials abroad are capable people with experience. However, there is one little thing which is worrying me. I would like to have a reply from the hon. the Minister in this regard. I asked him in a question with which newspapers many of the officials in the senior posts had been associated. In the reply I was told that the newspapers concerned were the <i>Transvaler, Patrys, Die Vaderland, Die Burger, Die Vaderland</i> once more. <i>Die Volksblad, Die Brandwag, Die Vaderland</i> again, <i>Die Transvaler, Die Noord-Transvaler</i> and <i>Die Transvaler</i> again. There was also one gentleman from <i>The Star,</i> another from <i>The Natal Mercury</i> and another from <i>Die Burger.</i> Do good journalists come only from one set of newspapers? Do they only come from newspapers which are officially associated with the governing party?</p>

<p>*No, there are much better journalists in South Africa than only those from one group, especially if it is the group of newspapers which is attached to the Government. While they worked for these newspapers, they were actually branded to a large extent as being official propagandists of the publications of the Government and of Government policy. I think the hon. the Minister should cast his net slightly wider when he appoints persons to important posts in his Department in future.</p>

<p>I have already worked on both sides, for <i>Die Suiderstem, Kruithoring</i>&#x2014;just what you want! In any event, if I were to go overseas, I would at least be able to enunciate the policies of both sides. There are internal offices at places such as Giyana, Jozini, Oshakati, Rundu, Bizana, Cofimvaba, Libode, Mquanduli and Nquamakwe. Whether all these offices are necessary, I do not know. According to the report of the Department, those offices are being used to convey the policy of the Government to the Bantu. At the same time, the staff of these offices must convey the feelings of the Bantu to the Government. Incidentally, I am pleased <span class="col_5277-5278" refersTo="page_1298"/>to see that a large number of Bantu and Coloureds are working in these offices. The report says the following of them:</p>

<block name="quote">They are able to assess the Bantu&#x2019;s desires and trends of thought as a matter of course.</block>

<p>It worries me, Sir, to see that these people not only have to explain and propagate the Government&#x2019;s policy, but that they must also tell the Government what the Bantu&#x2019;s desires are. Do we not, as it is, have sufficient information services and organizations of another nature which are trying to determine what people are thinking and what they want?

<p>Mr. Chairman, before replying to the hon. member for Orange Grove, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his Department most heartily on their annual report. Very few members on the opposite side seem to realize that this report covers the period up to 31st March, 1971, in other words, that it is up to date. I think this is an outstanding achievement. We have the report here like a warm loaf of bread fresh from the oven.</p>

<p>It is evident from this report that although this Department&#x2019;s Budget of R6 700 000 is one of the smallest to be voted for any Department, the officials of this Department are in the front lines of fire in this country and particularly abroad. These officials do not do their work in the spirit of clock watchers, but with real love for their fatherland. Their work radiates, as one can also see from all their publications and films, and for that we want to convey our heartiest thanks to the officials of this Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove again mentioned the question of petty apartheid. He actually called it &#x201C;kleinlike&#x201D; apartheid. He also used the term &#x201C;indoctrination&#x201D;. I want to tell him today that this side of the House and the country outside are sick and tired of these two terms which are used in this debate year after year. Where do we find the breeding ground of these two expressions? The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is the father of the expression &#x201C;petty apartheid&#x201D; and the hon. member for Orange Grove is its mother-in-law. Sir, this Department spends large amounts on bringing foreign visitors to this country to show them our country and our people without hiding a thing. These visitors are treated very courteously, and the officials place everything at their disposal. What they wish to see, they do see. Nevertheless, we have found that a visiting newspaper editor from France still asked on Saturday evening, &#x201C;But where are the police? Where is this &#x2018;petty apartheid&#x2019;? We see nothing.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What do they find in this country? They find peace and quiet and stability here. The hon. member for Orange Grove knows what I am talking about. Those newspaper editors find Bantu workers in the pink of health who serve them together with those hon. members when they are received by the officials of this Department. They find all their answers in an objective way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove levelled charges of indoctrination here. I want to challenge that hon. member to show me one example of information which is not positive, objective and factual in the publications of this Department of which many thousands appear each year. Can the hon. member quote one sentence to me from a radio programme, which is not objective, positive and factual? Can the hon. member give me the name of one film of the Department of Information, which was exhibited abroad and which was not objective and based on fact? Where do hon. members of that side get these things from? The hon. member for Kensington, who is sitting over there, is not an Afrikaner. He cannot understand the soul of the Afrikaner as these two hon. members ought to be able to do. We cannot take it amiss of him if he talks about indoctrination, because he does not understand the soul of the Afrikaner. But these, two hon. members &#x2026;</p>

<p>That hon. member knows what I am talking about. I should like to mention here the example of Dr. Morris of the Mercy Medical Centre of Chicago who paid a visit to South Africa as a guest of the Department. What did he say in America after his return? He said:&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The visitor to South Africa can only admire the resolution and determination of this young nation and wish that their problems were less overwhelming.</block>

<p>Instead of those hon. members on the opposite side of the House extending their hands to the hon. the Minister of Information and helping him in his task, they are disparaging his work. We can give examples of this <i>ad nauseam.</i> The hon. member for Houghton and the hon. member for Kensington are the leaders in this whole game.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to return to the films released by the Department of Information. I just want to refer in passing to the film &#x201C;For the Love of an Eagle&#x201D;, mentioned on page 14 of the report of the Department. This film is the work of an amateur photographer and is being exhibited throughout the world with great success. We know that numerous amateur photographers, cine photographers as well as still photographers, do excellent work in this direction. I should very much like to suggest to the hon. the Minister for his consideration the introduction of an annual or biennial competition for these people. Amateur photographers as well as small-time professional cine camera men and still camera men can take part in this. They can then enter their best works for this competition. It does not matter to what section of the population they belong. There are some of these people who do excellent work, as this work, &#x201C;For the Love of an Eagle&#x201D;, has indeed shown. The foreign visitor also visits this country to have a look at, <i>inter alia,</i> our beautiful scenery. A film on our beautiful scenery, or even series of colour slides of our scenery, shown abroad, draw visitors. I should like the hon. the Minister to afford our good cine photographers and still photographers an opportunity of coming forward with ideas for which they can be awarded a prize annually or biennially. An inducement of this nature will mean a great deal, particularly to our amateur cine industry.</p>

<p>I now want to return to the hon. member for Orange Grove and his reference to the article by the hon. member for Von Brandis, i.e. &#x201C;The cowcatcher of diplomacy&#x201D;. The hon. member for Orange Grove is of the opinion that this article ought to be distributed abroad. What do we read in this article &#x201C;Cowcatcher of diplomacy&#x201D; which appeared in the February edition of <i>New Nation</i>? What the article by this hon. colleague of that hon. member says, is indeed what is being done abroad and here in this country by our officials. One cannot say that those two members belong to the same party. The hon. member who has just sat down ought to have made the hon. member for Von Brandis the first speaker in this debate. There are points in this highly praised article of his, however, with which one cannot agree, because they also have that fine sting of subtle propaganda against the Whites of South Africa. He says here, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As seen through foreign eyes, an important proof of a country&#x2019;s strength is its willingness to respect opposition views and the rights of minorities.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask the hon. member for Von Brandis, on the basis of this article of his with which he is going into the outside world, to tell us in this House where there is an &#x201C;unwillingness to respect opposition views and the rights of minorities&#x201D;. It is fine subtle pin-pricks of this kind which make for the fact that people who come from abroad ask us after they have toured in this country for two weeks: &#x201C;But where is this Gestapo? We have not seen a policeman&#x201D;. This matter is a serious one, and quite rightly the overseas staff of the Department of Information, along with our diplomatic staff, are manning the outer defences. This kind of article is not aimed at strengthening the hand of our overseas officials and the Minister. With the kind of example I and hon. members have mentioned, the hon. members are not playing for the fatherland. The Minister need not take any notice whatsoever of their tirades here.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pretoria District became a bit too involved in his arguments <span class="col_5281-5282" refersTo="page_1300"/>and he tended to lose his way at times. I just want to tell him that the hon. member for Von Brandis will be coming into the debate and that he will answer those questions he has put to him. In one thing he mentioned he was very complimentary. This was as far as the timeous publication of the department&#x2019;s annual report was concerned. He said the report was for the year ended the 31st March, 1971. He complimented the department on producing it so speedily. I am afraid I cannot be quite so complimentary, because this report is not for the year ended the 31st March, 1971, but for two years ended the 31st March, 1971. We have waited all this time for the report covering the period 1969 to 1970, and therefore it is long overdue. We should have had it a long time ago and not only at the end of last week.</p>

<p>When the Information Vote was debated in Committee last year, the hon. the Minister was attacked by the Opposition about his declared intention of using the Department of Information and its full resources to educate the White people of South Africa in the ideal of what he called absolute total segregation. He said it would be the main task of the department to explain this ideal of the Nationalist Party and all its consequences. We of the Opposition were naturally deeply perturbed at the prospect of having a Department of State which is being paid for by the taxpayers, being used for these purposes. This was one of the reasons why we moved a reduction in his salary. We still hold the view most emphatically that it is wrong in principle to use public money for party-political ends. In the intervening months it seemed as if some reason has prevailed, because upon the domestic front there seems to be very little activity in this connection. We trust indeed that wiser counsel will continue to prevail and that the hon. the Minister will leave the propagation of Nationalist ideologies to the agencies of his party. While dealing with the activities of the hon. the Minister, I want to commend him for one thing, and here I agree with what was said by the hon. member for Stellenbosch. I want to commend him for having achieved a fairly close and generally pleasant working liaison with the Press of South Africa and with foreign correspondents who operate in our country. His approachability and his co-operation have gone a long way towards improving contact between the Government and the Press.</p>

<p>Also during the debate on the Information Vote last year the hon. the Minister indicated that he proposed to devote a great deal of his attention to the projection of South Africa in the outside world, and as we now know, he has announced that he will be visiting information offices in America, Canada, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Holland, France and Britain, accompanied by the Secretary for Information. An on-the-spot examination of our efforts abroad could be both informative and rewarding and we trust that the hon. the Minister will return with a clear perspective of what needs to be done, in what fields it can be done most fruitfully, and how this should be tackled.</p>

<p>In this context I should like to make what I feel are a few constructive suggestions to him about the examination of the type of effort we feel should be made in projecting the best possible image of South Africa abroad of our country. A great deal of money is being spent in the field of foreign liaison services, audio-visual services and publications. The amount being budgeted for this year totals R4 170 000 in this respect. Taking just two of the publications, we find that the printing and distribution of the <i>S.A. Panorama</i> alone will account for R656 800 this year, and this figure will not take into account the editorial and administrative costs involved. The editorial and printing costs of the <i>S.A. Digest</i> and the <i>S.A. Oorsig</i> are now running at about R200 000 a year. These two publications represent our main efforts in the field of publications aimed at consumption abroad. <i>S.A. Panorama</i> has the specific object of presenting in a well turned out glossy form the physical, industrial, cultural and other aspects of the Republic, while the <i>S.A. Digest</i> presents a week-by-week culling of newspaper and other articles with the object of giving a running account of everyday life in South Africa. <i>S.A. Panorama</i> is generally of a high standard, but on the other hand we have some doubts about whether the <i>S.A. Digest</i> in its present form is very effective.</p>

<p>What does concern us is that neither of the two gives an adequate picture of the realities of South Africa to interested audiences outside the country. It is accepted that a Department of Information can be used to explain and project the policies of the Government it serves to the outside world. That is already being done in various ways by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. We feel, however, that the department <span class="col_5283-5284" refersTo="page_1301"/>could play a very useful role for South Africa if it were to tell the world more about the dialogue that is taking place in the Republic on important matters of policy and government generally. One of our main problems is that of briefing our friends, and perhaps even our critics, abroad in such a way that they will appreciate fully that there is a healthy, active Opposition in our country and that the electorate is not committed purely to one point of view. My colleague, the hon. member for Orange Grove, mentioned that the hon. the Minister might have the task of explaining the Government&#x2019;s sport policy abroad. I am quite sure that he will do his very best to try to present the sports policy of the Government in the best possible way and to try to convince the outside world that this is our very best effort in the field of international sport. In fairness to himself, he should also, as my colleague suggested, see that his department presents fairly the sports policy of this side of the House. I think it is quite essential that this sort of thing should be done as much as possible. We have seen it done by Governments such as the German Government, with its very excellent information service. The German Government takes pains to show the world that there is a dialogue in Germany and that there are differences of opinion. It does it very well indeed. This approach would stamp an information service as a genuine service aimed at informing the world about the country concerned, not as a mere propaganda agency of a government. Sir, I want to go a little further into this, because I believe that this Government could do very much more than it is doing to cause our information service to be better believed in other countries. Let me mention something that caused considerable grief to all of us. I refer to the arrest some time ago of Bishop Zulu, which did a lot of damage to our image abroad. We all know that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, in reply to a question from the hon. member for Umlazi, expressed regret at this arrest, and I think that if this point had been conveyed through our information offices to people in as many countries as possible, it would have done our image a tremendous lot of good.

<p>Sir, if one sat in this House last year and listened to these two hon. members and again listened to them this evening, one wonders what has come over them. Last year both of them used excessively abusive language here; they levelled all sorts of accusations; they waved their arms about wildly and it was difficult to restrain them. But this evening butter will not melt in their mouths. One wonders whether this is due to their not having been able to recover after the knock-out blow they received last week, and one wonders what Messrs. Uys and Serfontein are going to say about them next Sunday. Nevertheless, Sir, I want to congratulate and thank them on behalf of South Africa for having adopted this responsible attitude this evening, particularly in regard to this important Vote we are discussing. We are busy projecting the image of South Africa, and the task of this department is to put the image of South Africa across, and every wrong word spoken here by hon. members on that side complicates the extremely difficult work of the department and its officials abroad. When the hon. member for Orange Grove speaks here of propaganda or of the misrepresentation of facts, even that can have a bad effect on the task of our officials abroad.</p>

<p>The two hon. gentlemen both advanced the argument that the Department of Information should not put across Government&#x2019;s policy alone. This is, of course, not being done. But, Sir, information also has to be given on the subjects in which there is interest abroad. On what do people question hon. members on the opposite side when they travel abroad? On what are the people in the outside world misinformed?</p>

<p>On all aspects of our policy of each national group developing along its own lines. That is what the people are interested in; that is what they are misinformed about, and it is because of that that the facts are distorted. Therein, therefore, lies the enormous task of the department, i.e. to put the facts straight. That is not propaganda. If Government policy is being presented correctly because wrong impressions exist or because there is a natural interest in it, it surely is not propaganda. This is <span class="col_5285-5286" refersTo="page_1302"/>the task of this Government and this department, and it is a task which they are carrying out. The hon. member must not ask the department also to expound the policy of the United Party abroad. Who is interested in that? It would mean a knock-out blow to us if we say there is an Opposition Party here which stands for &#x201C;White rule over the whole of South Africa&#x201D;. Surely this is a policy of the previous century; people are not interested in it. How can the department do such a thing now? The hon. the Minister said here last year too that the department has a task within the country itself as well to inform the people of South Africa about the policy of of each national group developing along its own lives. The hon. member for Kensington apparently misunderstood the Minister in this regard. The Minister did not mean party propaganda. History has placed us in South Africa in a position where we have to co-exist with a whole number of peoples in this southern corner of Africa. Mutual relations between these peoples, as the hon. the Prime Minister also emphasized last week, is of the utmost importance to us. If the hon. the Minister of Information and his department see a task for them in this and see to it that these peoples get to know one another better so that they may respect one another better, I support them wholeheartedly. In this way they will also contribute their share in promoting mutual relations and the disposition among the national groups. This is an enormous task and if they regard this as their task, we must only wish them the best and we must not regard it as party-political propaganda.</p>

<p>The Department is this year celebrating its tenth anniversary as an independent department. I think this House must congratulate the hon. the Minister and his department very sincerely on the enormous progress which has been made over the past ten years. One need only look at the wide range of the activities of the department and at the large number of publications, such as pamphlets and brochures, to realize how big their task is. I think approximately 20 publications are produced by the department. One also notes the absolute neatness, tidiness and high standard maintained in these publications. The department deserves only the highest praise for this work and I should like to convey this to them. There are so many of these good publications that it is difficult to single out any of them, but I particularly want to mention a publication I like very much, i.e. the publication <i>Bantu,</i> which already has a readership of 74 000, both in this country and abroad. This publication really does a great deal to tell the Whites more about the Bantu and their way of life. I also believe that it stimulates more self-respect and national pride among the Bantu. I think it is very tastefully compiled, with interesting news articles, and I should like to congratulate the department on it. I should also like to draw attention to a publication appearing in London since last year, i.e. <i>Report from South Africa.</i> This publication has been issued because there has been enormous interest in South Africa on the part of London newspapers, particularly of late. According to an article which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> on 13th November, 1970, no fewer than 50 editorials on South Africa had appeared in the <i>London Times</i> and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> over the preceding five months of 1970. It goes without saying that these newspaper articles were not always favourable, but they were not always hostile either. They have contributed to the fact that a greater interest in South Africa has emerged and that the curiosity of people about South Africa has been stimulated. The result has been that the information offices have been inundated with requests for more information. The publication <i>New Era of Bantu Progress in South Africa with Profiles of Leaders</i> was then issued. It contains various articles, written more from a personal angle. The first article, &#x201C;The Bantu takes up Reins of Government&#x201D;, contains descriptions of the leaders, the Chief Minister of the Transkei, the Opposition leaders and other personalities. Thus the publication is very interesting and neatly compiled and supplies information on the opportunities existing for the Bantu in South Africa under the new dispensation. It was distributed to Members of Parliament, newspapers, etc. The demand was so great, particularly from students, that a special edition had to be prepared for them. The publication has now also been translated into French. I have the French translation here. In France, too, it is being distributed with great success.</p>

<p>I do not have the time to do so now. [Laughter.] This is just a single example as far as publications <span class="col_5287-5288" refersTo="page_1303"/>are concerned. Hon. members will find this publication very interesting. It is really very neat and informative.</p>

<p>Because people are sometimes too lazy to read, the department has realized that films are today really the medium for disseminating information. The department has also done a great deal in this respect. In spite of the somewhat negative criticism which has come from local film critics, for example from Terry Herbst of the <i>Cape Times</i> and the critic of <i>Die Burger,</i> these films have met with great success when competing with other films at international film festivals. Last year, for example, two of the five films produced and exhibited here, received the highest awards at the Chicago Film Festival. &#x201C;Radio Bantu&#x201D; received first prize, as well as a &#x201C;Gold Camera&#x201D; Award, and a gold medal in Atlanta. The film &#x201C;Katlanong&#x201D; achieved the same distinction in Chicago, and received awards in Columbia and New York as well. The films of this year, which we have been privileged to see here, have also done very well. It has just been learnt that some of them also received the highest awards at the Chicago International Festival. The department must therefore be congratulated on its excellent work in this field as well.</p>
