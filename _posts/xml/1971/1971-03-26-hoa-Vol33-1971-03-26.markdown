<p>Clause 8 (continued):</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>When we were discussing this clause last night the hon. the Deputy Minister was asked what was meant by the words &#x201C;in the performance of his duties&#x201D;. I fear that the hon. the Deputy Minister rather confused matters by talking of privilege and defamatory reports. But I do not think such information has any reference to the question of privilege referred to by the Minister. What we thought the legal position would be was that a member of a local authority on the board would be entitled in the course of his duties to report back to his local authority information he acquired in his capacity as a member of the board. The only privilege there could be is that he would be able to claim, in case of a prosecution. that he was acting in the performance of his duties when he so reported to the local authority. But, Sir, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District asked the hon. the Deputy Minister yesterday if the words &#x201C;in the performance of his duties&#x201D; referred to the member&#x2019;s duties to his local authority or to his duties to the board, and we have not had any information from the Deputy Master on that issue. Subsection (2) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of section 5 (3) and (4), a member or an alternate to a member of a board, or any person in its service, who discloses, except with the consent of that board or in the performance of his duties or as a witness in a court of law, any information acquired by him &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, do those words &#x201C;in the performance of his duties&#x201D; mean his duties to the board or b&#x2019;s duties to the urban local authority? If the hon. Deputy Minister accepts the amendment of the member for Pinelands then such member would automatically have the consent of the board to report and there can be no doubt then as to what these words mean. I ask the Deputy Minister therefore, if he is not in a better position this morning to explain what it means than he was last night, to accept the amendment of the member for Pinelands so that there can be no more confusion on this issue.</p>

<p>I do not want there to be any uncertainty about this matter, and it is really not necessary for any uncertainty to exist about it. In the first place I want to say that the duties referred to in clause 8, are the duties performed by such a board member in his capacity as a member of the administration board. This is what the words refer to in the first place. But I now want to put this question to hon. members: Do they for one single moment think, especially in view of the fact that this clause 8 is an absolutely standard clause, and especially since there is a common interest between the duties performed by such a board member in his capacity as a member of the administration board and the duties performed by him in his capacity as a member of a local authority, that a board would refuse such a member permission to disclose such information? After all, such an administration board consists of clear-thinking people.</p>

<p>Why not accept the amendment then?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>For other reasons. Yesterday I indicated why we could not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands, and I do not want to cover that ground again. I said that accepting the amendment would place me in the position that I would have to act in a discriminatory way towards members sitting jointly on that board, i.e. people from the commercial world. people from the industrial world and people from local authorities. On moral grounds I am absolutely convinced that in the normal course of events such a member of a local authority will not be refused permission by such a board to report back to his board oh matters in retard to which them is a common interest. In the second place, purely on moral grounds. I cannot see how there can be any refusal where there are common interests. I therefore cannot understand how hon. members opposite cannot see that they are now asking us to discriminate between members sitting on the same board. <span class="col_3651-3652" refersTo="page_0484"/>I do not anticipate any problems at all in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>Sir, before sitting down, I just want to make very clear precisely what is involved in clause 8. I repeat that in other Acts there are various examples of exactly the same wording as contained in clause 8. Yesterday I mentioned those Acts here one after the other. In the first place, this clause is aimed at prohibiting, under a penalty, the disclosure by a member of a board or of the staff of a board during a meeting or in the performance of his duties as such a board member or staff member, of information in regard to the private business or personal affairs or matters of persons, businesses or business undertakings; and secondly, to prohibit, under a penalty, the disclosure by such a board member or staff member of information gained in that way relating to the business or activities of such a board. As far as board members are concerned, one thinks in this respect especially of cases involving information received by the board, proposed plans in respect of buildings or land, steps taken to implement any provisions of the legislation before this House at the moment&#x2014;in this regard I refer particularly to clauses 16 and 18&#x2014;or particularly of the assets, liabilities and funds of the administration boards concerned. These matters in fact embrace what I meant yesterday when I spoke about privilege in this regard. The so-called privilege is the privilege against disclosure which in my opinion attaches to the above-mentioned matters by virtue of the relevant penal provisions I have now mentioned here. I therefore did not have in mind privilege in the legal sense such as the privilege to which the hon. member for Zululand referred. I had in mind privilege in the sense I have just explained. I hope hon. members are satisfied with that.</p>

<p>Sir, in the light of what the hon. the Deputy Minister has just said, I really fail to see why he does not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands. Sir, what did the hon. member for Pinelands ask? All he has asked is that the Deputy Minister should insert a phrase into this paragraph which will clarify the very point which the hon. the Deputy Minister has made. The hon. member for Transkei and the hon. member for Pinelands have expressed the doubt which exists in the minds of people as to what exactly is meant by the phrase in this paragraph &#x201C;in the performance of his duties&#x201D;, and to which body this reference to &#x201C;duties&#x201D; refers; whether it refers to the board of which this particular person is a member or whether it refers to the body by which he was appointed, i.e. the local authority, whether it is the duties in both cases or the duties only in the one case. Sir, the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands deals with one specific category of member of the board.</p>

<p>I am referring to the argument which has just been advanced by the hon. member.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The point that I want to make to the hon. the Deputy Minister is this. With reference to what he said about discrimination, there are three different types of members of these boards. They are all appointed by the hon. the Deputy Minister, but under different circumstances. Certain of them are Government employees; the others are those whom he shall choose after consultation with agriculture, with commerce and with industry, but they need not necessarily be representative of those spheres and they are not in fact representative of any organization; they are the choice of the Minister after consultation with those particular bodies. The third category, Sir, is that of a direct representative of a city council, a town council or any other local authority. Because that person is firstly nominated by that board he has a responsibility to that board. The whole purpose of the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands is to clarify the situation with regard to this third group of members. We feel that they should not be bound to secrecy when it comes to conferring with the bodies who nominated them in the first place and whom they especially represent. The person chosen because of his knowledge of local affairs in commerce or in industry does not represent commerce or <span class="col_3653-3654" refersTo="page_0485"/>industry; he does not represent a specific body. I feel that this is a perfectly reasonable amendment which will clarify any doubt that exists. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows as well as I do that everyone of these members of a board will be asked to sign an oath of secrecy, and when he signs that oath of secrecy he is bound; that is where the hon. the Deputy Minister is quite right; a sanction will be imposed if he breaks this oath of secrecy. I grant that this is necessary, but I do believe that these people who represent particular local authorities should be allowed, with the permission of the board&#x2014;this is the whole point&#x2014;to report back to their local authority. The amendment says, &#x201C;which consent shall not be withheld&#x201D;. He must ask permission, but the consent should not be withheld in the case of those people who must report to their boards.</p>

<p>Since yesterday afternoon already I have been trying to indicate in detail why the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands is not acceptable to us. Honestly, yesterday evening I again examined this clause very closely and I again discussed it with the law advisers. You must now accept it from me that it is not acceptable to us, for the reasons I have mentioned. I would merely be wasting the time of this House if I were to repeat all those reasons. I therefore ask hon. members opposite to accept my goodwill, of which I think I have furnished more than enough proof. I want to say that we shall issue the necessary directives as far as it is in our power. As I put it here yesterday, in the normal course of events I cannot foresee that a board will refuse such a board member permission to report back to his local authority. In the light of the assurance I have given, I really cannot understand why the hon. members have problems in this regard.</p>

<p>Clause, as printed, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 10:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I have an amendment standing in my name, which I wish to withdraw. I now wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 42, page 14, after &#x201C;employment&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or appropriate alternative employment without reduction in remuneration offered to him by such local authority&#x201D;; and to omit paragraph (b) of subsection (10).</block>

<p>With regard to this particular amendment, I understand that the hon. the Deputy Minister will be quite prepared to accept the wording which I have asked to be inserted after the word &#x201C;employment&#x201D;. With regard to the omission of paragraph (b) of subsection (10), I would like to say a few words. The purpose of subsection (10) (a) is to provide that, when a person has been offered employment by the board and he elects in writing not to accept such employment, he will be dealt with by the local authority concerned in terms of the provisions governing his conditions of service, such as remuneration, pension rights, etc. This means, in effect, that he will be placed in some alternative employment in the service of the local authority under conditions which he knows and which he accepted when he entered the employment of that local authority. There is nothing new, except that he has refused to work for another employer. He has been employed by the council under certain conditions and he prefers to remain in their employ. Then, however, the clause goes on to make a proviso:</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in such provisions, if the Minister, after consultation with such local authority, is of the opinion that any person&#x2019;s election not to accept such employment is unreasonable, such person shall be deemed to have resigned from the service of such local authority in terms of such provisions.</block>

<p>The effect of this proviso that he should be deemed to have resigned, is that he will lose his pensionable rights, particularly if he is in the very early period of his employment. If he were a man who was possibly in the last five years or so of his employment, the pension provisions might possibly enable him to receive a lesser pension. There are certain rights given to employees in the last period of their employment to resign a little earlier. In the normal course of events, however, the effect of his having been deemed to have resigned, would be similar to that of a man who at any odd time hands in his resignation, so that he would merely receive back the moneys he has paid into his provident fund and he would have no pension rights at all. It is in order to overcome that effect to some extent, that I have moved the words that I have suggested should be inserted. If the Minister is of the opinion that his election not to accept employment is unreasonable or if, when offered appropriate alternative employment without reduction in his remuneration, he refuses and the Minister comes to the conclusion that his refusal to accept such alternative employment is unreasonable, he will be deemed to have resigned. My amendment alleviates that to a great extent, in the sense that, instead of his being penalized for refusing to accept employment with the board, there is the opportunity for him to accept alternative employment in the service of the local authority without reduction of his remuneration.</p>

<p>So far, so good. He is given that opportunity, but there may be occasions when that alternative employment, for reasons peculiar to a particular situation, does not satisfy the employee. The employment may not be congenial to him. It may interrupt the course of a career on which he had embarked in the service of the council. He <span class="col_3657-3658" refersTo="page_0487"/>may be in a particular department where he has shown certain talents, for which he has educated himself over a period of time. He may have taken courses which would have enabled him to improve his lot and to make progress in that particular department. There may be many reasons. Conditions of health may even have played a part. In other words, there may be reasons of which we are not aware at the moment. Despite all that, if the Minister makes a decision deeming a person to have resigned from the council, that decision is final, although it may cause the person concerned to be subject to penalties. That is in terms of clause 10 (10) (b) which I have proposed should be omitted. The fact that the Minister&#x2019;s decision is final means that the person concerned is deprived of any rights he may normally have had. If the council were to come to such a decision, offering one of its employees alternative employment which that employee refused for various reasons, the position would be different. The council could, for instance, call for his resignation, but he could then still complain to his municipal trade union or employee association. That association would take up his case, advise him, and make representations on his behalf. He would have the opportunity of negotiating with the council through his union, or the union would take the necessary action, for which the Industrial Conciliation Act provides. In other words, the decision would not be as final as the Minister&#x2019;s decision, for which provision is made in this clause. The employee would have certain rights that flow from the very fact that he is employed by the local authority. On the other hand, the Minister&#x2019;s decision is not subject to any appeal whatsoever. It is final. We feel that an employee should have the opportunity of appealing, to a court of law if necessary, against such a decision. I think it is a common law right that everyone should be able to approach a completely impartial body such as a court of law, in order to seek the justice to which he feels he is entitled. This is an important aspect, because there are many thousands of people throughout the country who are employed in this service. It is a very vital and important service to the community. These employee unions are very strong throughout the country. They are there especially for the protection of the rights of the employee of a council. I fee] that the Minister should not deprive these individuals of the rights they have. The Minister can make a decision to that effect, but it should not be final. I grant the hon. the Deputy Minister his point of view, which he has put to the House, that some employees may just be difficult. They may be able to use this as an opportunity of shirking employment on the pretext that they are not satisfied even with the alternative employment offered, and they may then find it possible to get away with a pension and certain other emoluments. We know what has happened in the past. In the service of the State itself young men have been bowler-hatted, for which they have received considerable compensation because they had to be compensated for the loss of their pension rights and other privileges they received as a result of their employment.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides for the taking over of staff at present employed by local authorities. We have been given a general assurance that none of these people will be any the worse off when taking up employment with the Bantu Affairs administration boards. However, I want a specific assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to two aspects. The secretary to the Municipal Employees&#x2019; Association asked me to try and obtain these assurances from him. The first aspect deals with the minimum academic qualifications of persons employed in certain posts. The minimum qualification laid down by the department for a person holding the post of licence-holder is matriculation. For many years now certain persons have been employed by local authorities in these posts and the danger exists that the minimum qualifications laid down by the department of Bantu Administration will come into force when this take-over comes into effect. In this regard there are, of course, two courses of action that may be followed. The one is to give these people a certain period of time in which to obtain the minimum qualifications and the second is to say to them: &#x201C;We accept the people holding these posts at present, because they have been doing this work for so many years and we are not going to insist upon their complying with all the requirements of the minimum qualifications&#x201D;. I want to recommend most strongly the second alternative. I want to add, however, that the minimum academic qualifications may of course be made applicable to persons appointed in these posts for the first time.</p>

<p>The second assurance I should like the hon. the Minister to give me, is in regard <span class="col_3659-3660" refersTo="page_0488"/>to bilingualism. From the nature of his duties a Bantu administration official should have a thorough and sound knowledge of one of the Bantu languages, but it is a well-known fact that there are persons in the employ of local authorities who are not sufficiently bilingual as regards the official languages. In this regard the request is for an assurance to be obtained from the hon. the Deputy Minister, particularly in view of the fact that we had the takeover of certain activities by the post office in Durban some time ago and that provision was made in the Act at that time to the effect that certain standards of bilingualism would not be compulsory for the officials concerned. I mention this particularly since a person may say that he is unable to accept a certain post and, in doing that, he will be deemed to have resigned, as was stated by the hon. member for Jeppes. In doing this he forfeits certain privileges. I shall be grateful if the Deputy Minister will give us these assurances.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the first place I want to deal with the questions the hon. member for Durban Central has put to me. I am in the fortunate position to be able to give him assurances in respect of both matters raised by him. The first assurance is in respect of those people who are in the employ of local authorities but who do not have certain academic qualifications which are normally required. Clause 10 (1) (a) lays down the manner in which officials will be transferred to the administration boards. There can be no misunderstanding about that. Clause 10 (5) lays down quite clearly that the local authority should allow all officials to be transferred to an administration board. However, I am able to give the hon. member an assurance because clause 10 (6) lays down quite clearly that a board should offer employment to such official in a post which shall not be less favourable than the post he held while he was employed by a local authority. This also has legal force. The reply therefore in regard to qualifications is that if such a person is at present a licence-holder, a licence for which a matriculation certificate is required which he does not have, but if he has nevertheless been doing the work for all these years, such person can rest assured that he will receive the same treatment he had been receiving from the local authority up to that stage. Consequently, there is no need for any of these officials to feel worried in this regard. Exactly the same applies as far as bilingualism is concerned. Clause 10 (6) lays down that a board must offer an official a post. In regard to a person who is in the employ of a local authority at present, for example, in Natal, and who is not bilingual but has nevertheless served in that capacity for a number of years, it is being stipulated here that the services of such a person have to be taken over by a board. There is no question of bilingualism as far as clause 10 (6) is concerned. Therefore officials need not be worried on this score either. I hope I have set the hon. member&#x2019;s mind at ease now.</p>

<p>The first leg of the amendment of the hon. member for Jeppes is acceptable to me. As a matter of fact, I had an amendment to the same effect on the Order Paper myself. I am not going to move my amendment because I want to allow the hon. member to move his. Why should I be difficult and move my amendment as well? However, I have problems as far as the second leg of the amendment of the hon. member is concerned. It concerns the question as to whether the Minister&#x2019;s decision should be final. Clause 10 (10) formed the subject of protracted discussions between myself, my department, IANA and the U.M.E. If hon. members were to look at the manuscript of the Bill published on 15th December, they would see that clause 10 (10) as it appears in the manuscript is quite different from the one in this Bill. Even after this Bill had been published for general information, the U.M.E. made further representations because hon. members should bear in mind that the provisions as published a second time were also subjected to lengthy discussions. However, the U.M.E. made further representations to me that I should amend the Bill even further, because the Bill, in the form it was published at that time, placed the onus on the local authority and they were afraid they could have a spate of resignations and be held responsible for the refund of pensions, and so forth. I invited them to come and discuss the matter with me again. During the negotiations conducted prior to the publication of the Bill in its present form, we, the IANA and the U.M.E. agreed on the present wording of the provision. The question of whether the Minister should have a say as to whether a person is reasonable or unreasonable, was thoroughly thrashed out in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare. The wording which appears in the Bill at present is <span class="col_3661-3662" refersTo="page_0489"/>the only solution we could find on a joint basis in order to cope with all the foreseeable problems. I agree wholeheartedly with many of the points made by the hon. member for Jeppes. We are trying to be as reasonable as we possibly can towards every official under all circumstances. There is therefore no need for hon. members to see anything sinister in the fact that provision is being made to make it possible for matters such as these to be referred to the Minister. Let me furnish hon. members with the following facts. It is not correct to say that the decision of the Minister in a case such as this will be final. According to the clause as it stands at present, the Minister has to decide on one thing only, i.e. the question of whether an official has acted unreasonably by rejecting a post that is not less favourable, and which is dealt with in that part of the amendment which I am prepared to accent. All the Minister has to do when an official does not want to accept the post with the administration board or the post offered to him by the local authority, is to decide whether he was being unreasonable in any way. Apart from that, the Minister has no say in the matter. There is no need whatsoever for the Minister to lay down that such an official should resign. What the Minister does, is to decide, after consultation with the local authority and the administration board, whether such an official has acted unreasonably. I want to point out that in practice cases of this nature will mainly be limited to our younger officials. When the local authority and the administration board approach the Minister and say that an official has acted unreasonably by rejecting all the posts offered to him the Minister may, in consultation with the latter, decide whether the official was, in fact, being unreasonable. The ordinary procedure will be followed only after the Minister decides that the official has, in fact, been unreasonable&#x2014;and here is where the misunderstanding comes in. In other words, it can be deemed that such an official has resigned and only then will his case be dealt with by the local authority according to his conditions of service. For what reason are we stipulating here that the Minister should act as arbiter? I shall tell hon. members why. It is because local authorities have felt that the danger exists here that the number of the younger officials, officials who have been in the service for only a short time&#x2014;I do not believe this will happen in practice in the case of the older officials who have been in the service for many years&#x2014;want to take advantage of the opportunity created by the circumstances which have arisen and then want to resign without good reason. The result of this will be that the local authority or the administration board, or both of them, will be responsible for higher pension benefits and all that goes with it while no one, except the official himself, will derive any benefit from it. Because what is more reasonable than that the board should offer him a post, and the local authority offers him a post if he is not satisfied with the former, and he does not accept it? Local authorities felt that it would be difficult for them to act as an arbiter in a case such as this. For the very same reason it would be difficult for the administration board too. For that reason they felt that there should be an outside body which would be in a position to ascertain, in conjunction with them, whether or not an official was being reasonable. But even then the decision of the Minister would not be final, because it may be referred to the higher court for revision. Such higher court will then revise the matter, i.e. if there was a complaint, and decide whether the Minister was unreasonable. I have investigated this matter very carefully, and hon. members may therefore accept my explanation. The decision of the Minister is therefore not final. An appeal may then be lodged with the higher court by means of revision and if the Minister, in exercising his functions, decided that the official was unreasonable, such higher court may say that the Minister was not quite unreasonable in his decision that such an official acted unreasonably. For these reasons I feel that hon. members on that side of the House will appreciate this vexing situation and will understand why I cannot accept this amendment. From the nature of the case in in view of the fact that one is dealing with officials who have had many years of service with a local authority and who have almost reached the age of retirement, I can now tell hon. members that we will appreciate and understand that there may be good reason for these officials to feel that they would rather retire from the service. But in the case of younger officials who have been in the service for only a short while the situation may arise where people want to take advantage of their position. If those hon. members could suggest something better than what was suggested by the U.M.E. or IANA, i.e. that the Minister <span class="col_3663-3664" refersTo="page_0490"/>should only act as the arbiter to decide whether or not someone was being unreasonable, I am prepared to consider their suggestions very sympathetically. But jointly we were unable to find a better solution, and I can tell hon. members that the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions thought this to be an excellent solution to serve as a safety valve to make sure that this situation is not exploited.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, following on the courteous attitude of the hon. the Deputy Minister, I want to say that I accept that he is absolutely sincere in his desire to deal with this matter in as sympathetic and reasonable a manner as possible. I also accept that the amendment, of course, does make the position very much better because it must satisfy the employee to a very much greater extent than he would be under the clause as printed. I want to say this, however. There is a principle attached to this matter. There must be very few cases where a man will go to court in a matter like this because it would involve him in great expense. If one accepts what the hon. the Deputy Minister says, namely that the employee has some right of review, it is going to be very difficult for the employee to establish <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the Deputy Minister because that is what he would have to establish. What we are concerned with is the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reasonableness here. He might be misguided; that might well happen. We are dealing with human factors here. It is an ingrained legal principle in our law that a man must have the right to go to an impartial court of law. The hon. the Deputy Minister could be perfectly <i>bona fide</i> and perfectly sincere but misguided in the matter because, after all, it is a matter of human judgment. The occasions on which a man would take the Minister to court must be very rare indeed. Sir, you know the adage that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done; that is a very important principle in our law. The employee already has an inherent right which has been established over the years and which is well ingrained in our whole labour policy in this country. That is that he can go to his union, who negotiated his original terms and conditions under which he entered the employ of a local authority. I do not want to deprive him of that opportunity. But if the Minister is the arbiter, he would have only one alternative and that is to test the reasonableness of the Minister&#x2019;s decision in a court of law. That would occur very rarely. I agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister that it would occur very rarely because under this amendment he would do everything in his power to ensure that the employee was given every opportunity of putting forward his case. But there will be a few exceptions and it is those exceptions that virtually make and sustain the rule of law in a country. Therefore I appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to be somewhat more amenable with regard to this particular clause. This question of a final decision carries an implication which I think should not be brought into an atmosphere in which we are trying to be considerate and to have regard to all the circumstance surrounding this question of employment and re-employment. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree with me that the occasions on which a man would take the Minister to court will be very rare, but to meet those rare cases he should accept the viewpoint put to him. This is not a question of saving anybody&#x2019;s face; it is not a question of being difficult; it is a question of not depriving anyone of even a remote right. The acceptance of the proposed amendment would show a very fine spirit with regard to the whole of the machinery to be employed here; it would confirm the desire for co-operation expressed by the hon. the Deputy Minister, and I would really appeal to him not to be difficult in this matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes moved, as an amendment, that paragraph (b) of subsection (10) be deleted. I appreciate the argument of the hon. member in regard to the whole matter, but I do not think that we come any nearer to what the hon. member for Jeppes actually wants by simply deleting paragraph (b) of subsection (10). As the hon. the Deputy Minister has explained, we are dealing here with two bodies, i.e. local authorities and the administration board. What has to be ascertained now, is whether an official has acted deliberately or not; this is what is mainly at issue here, It is a fact that, in terms of the common law, a person is always in a position to test the decision of the Minister in a court of law. However, I think that we are not in this case, as the clause stands here, going to create the situation that finality has to be obtained on the matter in a court of law in the event of a dispute arising between an official and the administration board or the local authority. This would be the only alternative if this provision is not inserted to the effect <span class="col_3665-3666" refersTo="page_0491"/>that the Minister has a say in the matter. What we achieve by inserting this provision is the following. We provide a safety valve for an impartial person on a high level to give finality on what should or should not, be regarded as deliberate action, instead of such a person having to go to court to reach finality on the matter. By retaining this provision in the clause we are, therefore, making it easier to bring about mutual goodwill. All the Minister is able to ascertain in terms of this clause, is whether a person has acted deliberately; that is all. Apart from that he cannot decide anything else. All the Minister is able to do, is to express an opinion. He can merely express an opinion to the effect that the person concerned did or did not act deliberately. The matter will be gone into thoroughly before the Minister gives his decision and it will save the official or whoever else becomes involved in the matter a great deal of legal expenses if the Minister has stated what his opinion is. If an opinion such as this did not exist the official would have had to take recourse to a court of law before the Minister had even considered the matter.</p>

<from>*MR. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, that is precisely my argument. I say the Minister does not have the final say; an appeal can still be lodged with the court. The Minister decides whether the official has acted deliberately or not and if the Minister says, &#x201C;no&#x201D; or &#x201C;yes&#x201D; any person, in terms of the common law, still has the right to take that decision to a higher court for revision. My argument is that we are going to limit litigation if we give the Minister the powers of discretion to decide whether a person has or has not acted deliberately. We can compare this with the system one finds in Germany as far as the courts are concerned. This really amounts to a discussion before the case comes up for decision in a court of law where the matter is thrashed out and at the point of litigation, only the dispute remains and all other irrelevant matters are left out. I really cannot see what the objection of the hon. member for Jeppes is. On the contrary, I want to submit that it is better if we keep it as it stands here, because this will eliminate the possibility of protracted or unnecessary court cases involving either the administration board or the local authority, and that the Minister is doing something here which will prevent a great deal of money, time and energy from being wasted.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not follow the arguments of the hon. member who has just spoken. In terms of subsection (10) (a) the Minister is obliged to perform a function which requires the exercise of his mind, with the result that he comes to an opinion. Paragraph (b) says that the decision of the Minister is final. As I understand the law&#x2014;and I think it is clear&#x2014; when you place an obligation on a Minister to form an opinion on a certain situation and then you say that that opinion is final, you can attack such a decision in any one of two ways. You can either say that he did not apply his mind to the problem and so consequently could not properly have formed an opinion which he alleges he formed, or you can say that <i>mala fides</i> were present when he applied his mind to that particular problem; that is to say, he was motivated by ulterior or improper motives. As far as I am aware, those are the only two ways in which one could go to a court of law as the clause stands at the present time. It is accepted by anyone who has any experience of practice in that regard that it is extremely difficult to prove either of those two contentions, because you have to go so far, in the first instance, as to say that the Minister&#x2019;s decision was so unreasonable, on the mere fact of its being taken, that he could not properly have applied his mind to the subject. You have to go to that length before you have any chance whatever of success in a court of law, and it is a very slim chance because of the difficulty of proof.</p>

<p>The second point is in regard to <i>mala fides.</i> In the nature of things, where a decision is taken behind closed doors, as would be done in the normal course by a Minister taking a decision of this kind, it is once again virtually impossible to prove <i>mala fides</i> unless the case is so outrageous that it could be assumed on the facts of the case that <i>mala fides</i> were present. I believe that that is a factual statement of the position and for those reasons I do not follow the argument of the hon. member who has just spoken.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have no objection to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s amendment, but the cardinal element of this legislation is the deprivation of local authorities of their jurisdiction over Bantu townships falling within their areas. This clause contains the provisions to bring about the object of the Bill. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (1) deal with the acquisition, disposition and exploitation of land. We cannot have objections to those, if the board is to operate at all. Subsection (1) (e) is the crux of the legislation. It hands over control and all the powers and functions, duties and obligations previously enjoyed by the local authorities to the board, subject, of course, to such conditions as the Minister may lay down. Under paragraph (e) (ii) he can nullify ordinances of provincial councils as the hon. the Minister deems fit. In order to make the boards work, he probably would have to modify certain of the ordinances. There is no doubt about that. However, there is no limit here as to what he can do. We considered how we could amend this clause, but I am afraid that it becomes too complicated. <span class="col_3669-3670" refersTo="page_0493"/>We are also faced with the problem that, as our objections is to the taking away of authority from the local authorities, any amendment we might move to that effect would, of course, be contrary to the principle of the Bill. We are also handicapped in that way, so that we cannot achieve any object by amending this clause. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that they are not taking any new powers for the Minister, but that they are merely taking over all the powers exercised by the local authorities. I submit, however, that, because of the powers being given to the Minister to make regulations and to direct what should be done, the hon. the Minister is getting more powers. I cannot now discuss the powers which he takes in clause 22, but if one reads clause 22 with this clause 11, it cannot be denied that the hon. the Minister is going to have much more power than the local authorities ever had or that he has had in the past with regard to the control of the local authorities. As I have said, there is nothing we can do to amend this clause. It is the crux of the Bill, and we are opposed to it.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I too am completely opposed to this clause. It is really the crux of the Bill. It is the clause which allows the board to take over the rights, powers, functions, duties and obligations of urban local authorities as regards administering the townships for Africans living within those areas. Now, Sir, we hear a lot of talk about tradition in this House. Everybody is always telling us that it is tradition in South Africa to do or not to do this, that or the other. I want to put it to the hon. the Deputy Minister that it has always been tradition in South Africa for the urban local authorities to administer the areas within which Africans live. The Urban Areas Act, which was originally passed in 1922, provided that matters such as housing and the administration of townships in which Africans live inside municipal areas, should be the special responsibility of the municipal authority. That was nearly 50 years. That is tradition. But of course when it suits the hon. the Deputy Minister and his Government, tradition can be brushed aside without a second thought. That is precisely what this Bill is doing. It is taking over a traditional function performed by the urban authorities. Whatever the hon. the Deputy Minister says about wanting to work in co-operation with these local authorities, I am quite sure that within the next three or four years we will find that, willing or unwilling, municipal authorities will have had to hand over the control of the Bantu townships lying within their areas of jurisdiction. I am against this because I do not believe in centralization of control. I think where local governmental functions are concerned, it is far better to leave matters in the hands of local authorities. They understand the needs, desires and aspirations of the people far better than any centralized board can do.</p>

<p>The very fact that the members of the board are not to be considered as representatives of the local authorities, in fact strengthens my reaction to this Bill, namely that the board which is going to administer this is going to be one of these remote authorities not concerned with the needs of the specific communities over whom they are now going to exercise vast powers. I have no doubt that in exercising these powers they will not be as sympathetic as they should be. They will not have the time. They will not be tolerant of the individual needs of the communities which they are going to have to look after. We have already had comparisons between the administration of governmentally controlled townships in the Johannesburg area, which is the only area of which I have any real experience, and those areas which are administered by the local authority. There is no question whatever that the Africans prefer living under the jurisdiction of the local authority. They are by no means satisfied with what they have there, because there are many laws to which they object, but these laws are to some extent at least more leniently administered than are the laws in the same area controlled by the central authority. The very fact that the hon. the Minister and members on that side of the House seem to take offence at the thought that the Bantu Revenue Account is not self-balancing, leads me to believe that the future conditions are going to be even more stringent in the Bantu townships. The Johannesburg Municipality is subsidizing the Bantu Revenue Account to the extent of about R1.2 million per year. I have always thought that figure to be absurdly low, in fact, especially if cognizance is taken of the enormous black population, larger than the White population of Johannesburg, on whom industry and commerce are dependent for the very lifeblood of the economic side of Johannesburg. We all know that wages are pretty low and that services have <span class="col_3671-3672" refersTo="page_0494"/>to be subsidized. As I have said, this seems to me a low figure indeed.</p>

<p>But I wonder when the central Government takes over the administration of the townships, whether any subsidy at all is going to be allowed by the board in respect of housing so as to overcome the Government&#x2019;s stubborn adherence to R30 per month as the economic housing level, and whether other amenities and facilities will be subsidized, which in any case are by no means fully provided for at present. For all these reasons I strongly oppose this clause which I believe to be the very crux of this Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 12:</p>

<p>Mr. T. G. HUGHES. When a board has been established, it will take over all the assets, including land or rights acquired by the local authorities in respect of matters to be taken over by the board. It shall be deemed to have acquired all the assets of the local authorities subject to such conditions, including conditions relating to the payment of compensation (if any) as may be determined by the Minister, and to any conditions which may be mutually agreed upon between the urban local authority, local authority or local government body concerned and that board. Subsection (4) provides for arbitration by the Controller and Auditor-General in case of dispute between the board and the local authorities concerned and the Minister. If one takes the provisions of subsection (4) into regard, it seems that it is intended that compensation will be paid to the local authorities. We know that in many instances&#x2014;Cape Town is a good example&#x2014;local authorities have spent their own revenue on capital expenses in providing accommodation in the Bantu townships.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the only reason for the insertion of the words &#x201C;if any&#x201D; in the English version and &#x201C;as daar is&#x201D; in the Afrikaans version is that all cases are not identical. Situations may arise where a local authority may, for example, argue that compensation is not necessary in certain circumstances. If an administration area is, for example, created in the Free State where those people would very much like to have it, it is quite possible that a local authority may say that, although compensation is involved in the take-over, they feel that in the light of the fact that they are in any case going to co-operate on the larger board, compensation is not necessary in that case. This is the only reason for the insertion in clause 12 of the two words concerned, i.e. &#x201C;if any&#x201D;. There is no other reason. We accept that there will be compensation in the normal course of events. The necessary compensation will then be paid out. In clause 12 it is made very clear that the necessary compensation will be paid where it has to be paid. But because situations are not identical, we nevertheless foresee the slight possibility of a case arising where a local authority itself may argue that compensation is not necessary in the case concerned. We felt that these words should be inserted just to cover such a case.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I must say that the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s amendment does help to a certain extent to remove my fears in this regard. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister could not give us an unequivocal undertaking that moneys from the levies&#x2014;he mentioned it during the Second Reading debate but I should like to hear it again&#x2014;shall not be used for homelands development. This is worrying businessmen, particularly, who were given the assurance years ago by Dr. Verwoerd that the proceeds of this levy would be used specifically for the provision of health services, transport and other facilities for Africans living in the urban areas. Now they have the fear that some of this money will be directed towards homeland development and that the assurance given to them by Dr. Verwoerd will be breached. It is in these circumstances that I should like to have an assurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister in this regard.</p>

<p>Another thing that worries me is what is going to happen to the funds at present standing to the credit of emergency funds of local authorities. In the case of the Johannesburg City Council this, I believe, amounts to about R30 000. These funds were built up by donations from the public in consequence of certain disasters that have occurred&#x2014;railway accidents and so on. Up till now the non-European affairs department of the Johannesburg municipality has had a completely free hand in the utilization of this money, thereby obviating time-consuming inquiries, inquiries which can sometimes go into weeks or months, while the victims and their dependants are going through severe financial difficulties. The non-European affairs department has been able to ladle out these moneys immediately to offset the effect of such disasters. What is going to happen now if the board takes over all these moneys? What is going to happen to any immediate relief that may be required?</p>

<p>These are the things that are worrying people who have had to administer these funds in the past. Knowing how enthusiastic the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Minister have been in the past to get money from local authorities to send to the homelands for development there, I myself share these fears and, therefore, should like to have some reassurance from the hon. the Deputy Minister. I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the amendment of the hon. the Deputy Minister intends to achieve what my amendment intends to achieve, I shall not move mine. Is that the position? Is the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s amendment more limited in scope than the amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton? It has happened in recent times that certain municipalities in the Transvaal made contributions to the department for the establishment of Bantu villages and that type of thing. As I understand the position, however, such moneys could not in terms of the existing law have come from the Bantu Services Levy Fund. Will that still be the case after the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s amendment has been adopted? If he can assure me of that I shall not move my amendment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I should have thought the hon. member for Mooi River would withdraw his amendment after my having explained the matter. This is a very important matter, and it is very clear to me that there is misunderstanding among hon. members opposite as far as the spending of levy funds is concerned. For example, the hon. member for Houghton asked for the assurance &#x201C;that these moneys are not going to be used for homeland development&#x201D;. I want to make myself very clear about this matter. I am fully aware of the assurances given by Dr. Verwoerd in connection with these levy funds assurances we have honoured up to now. The very object of my amendment is to place it beyond all doubt that as far as this Bill is concerned, those assurances will still be honoured. This must be clearly understood. However, it seems to me as if hon. members do not properly understand the circumstances surrounding the spending of levy funds. They must draw a clear distinction between the spending of profits derived from the sale of Bantu beer on the one hand and the spending of levy funds on the other hand. Many hon. members apparently do not understand this. This clause deals with donations. I notice there is definite confusion among hon. members about the question of donations from the revenue derived from the sale of Bantu beer, and donations from the revenue derived from levies. I want to say immediately that the department has received many offers from local authorities from profits made on Bantu beer. Such donations we can use, and we do so too. But we have also had offers of donations from levy funds. We have consistently refused to use such donations. Hon. members must understand the difference between these two funds very well. Donations from profits on Bantu beer are spent on a variety of things in the Bantu homelands. We have received donations from, <i>inter alia,</i> Alexandra, Alberton, Benoni, Boksburg, Edenvale and Empangeni&#x2014; about 22 in total&#x2014;amounting to R2 157 000. These are contributions from the profits on Bantu beer. Moreover, there are still quite a number of local authorities which have promised donations. For example, we accepted a donation of R100 000 from the Johannesburg City Council last week. We received the cheque and I looked at it closely to see whether it was true, and it was. However, this amount comes from the profits on Bantu beer. Then donations totalling a large amount, have also been promised by Germiston, Howick, Vryheid, and various others, from the profits on Bantu beer. On the other hand, as far as levy funds are concerned, Dr. Verwoerd gave the assurance&#x2014;and it is also contained in the Act&#x2014;that those funds would be applied solely in the interests of the employers making the contributions, on the one hand, and their Bantu employees on the other hand. The hon. member for Houghton now asks me to give the assurance that these funds will not be used for development in homelands. We must understand each other very clearly now. As I said, an assurance was given by Dr. Verwoerd and the Act provides accordingly. My amendment now provides that levy funds shall only be used in accordance with the relevant Act. In other words, my amendment goes considerably further in placing a restriction on me than the amendment of which the hon. member for Mooi River has given notice. This amendment of the hon. member also made it clear that hon. members opposite do not understand this matter fully. There are various places in the homelands in the Republic where levy funds are used, not for building houses, for example, but for providing basic services. As I have said, there are places in the homelands where levy funds are used for this purpose. For example, Pretoria has Ga Rankuwa on its doorstep. In addition, Mamelodi and Atteridgeville have been frozen. It is in the interests of employers and in the interests of the Bantu employees in their service that the levy funds <span class="col_3677-3678" refersTo="page_0497"/>derived from the employers in Pretoria should be utilized in the interests of the Bantu in their service. That is why levy funds of Pretoria amounting to R3 444 919 are being used in Ga Rankuwa and Mabopane. I am giving hon. members the full picture, because I do not want any misunderstanding. As far as Durban is concerned, there is an amount of R14 989 491 in respect of Umlazi in the homeland which is adjacent to Durban. There, too, the contributions of the employers are being used in the interests of their own employees in the form of services in Umlazi. I just do not want any misunderstanding. In other words, in places adjacent to the Bantu homelands it has been customary throughout the years, also in the time of Dr. Verwoerd, for levy funds to be used for that purpose. Thus an amount of more than R11 million from levy funds has been spent on this in East London, R934 000 in Pietersburg and R494 000 in Rustenburg. I therefore cannot give the assurance that levy funds will not be used for homeland development, because they have been used for this for years, but what I can, in fact, give is the assurance that they will be used as they have been up to now. That is why I said in the Second Reading debate that the <i>status quo</i> would be maintained in all circumstances, and I now move the amendment in order to give statutory authority to this; in other words, to give statutory force to the assurance which I am prepared to give orally to the hon. member for Mooi River and all the members on the opposite side, and to the hon. member for Houghton as well. I therefore move my amendment to the effect that donations specifically made to the levy funds, shall be used only in terms of the Services Levy Act. Sir, hon. members can accept this assurance of mine. I can say a great deal more about this, but I leave it at that. I take it that hon. members understand the position in regard to this matter better now.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir. the hon. the Deputy Minister says that they have kept to the spirit of the assurance given by Dr. Verwoerd. I read out this assurance to him in the Second Reading debate and he said that he accepted it. I just want to remind him what the assurance was-&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd assured commerce and industry that such moneys would be used only in the areas where they were collected and that payment would be suspended as soon as their purpose had been served in a particular area.</block>

<p>I also said that last time we debated we understood that there was an amount of about R26 million which had been accumulated by the different municipalities over the years. I think Johannesburg had R5 million and Cape Town R3 million, or something like that. Sir, if all this money has been accumulated and has not been used, I suppose it is because of the fact that the services have been supplied, otherwise this money would not have accumulated. Is the Minister in terms of the assurance given by Dr. Verwoerd going to suspend payment in certain areas? Has he given consideration to the question as to where payment is going to be suspended?</p>

<p>From what he said it seems to me that it is quite definite in which way the law is interpreted at the moment and that he is going to abide by that&#x2014;viz. this money can only be used in reserves which adjoin municipalities. He has given the examples of Pretoria, Durban, East London and Mdantsane. That means then that the Johannesburg levy cannot be used anywhere except in Johannesburg because there is no homeland abutting on Johannesburg. The Deputy Minister nods his head.</p>

<heading>CARE OF WHITE AGED</heading>

<speech by="#mclachlan">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. McLACHLAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move the motion standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House notes with appreciation the great progress which has been made over the past years in the care of White aged in South Africa, but is of the opinion that the Government should consider the advisability of having an exhaustive investigation made of the present economic and social needs of these people in order to ascertain the extent to which the existing services and aid schemes meet their needs.</block>

<p>In the first place this motion requests the appreciation of this House for the great progress which has been made over the past years in the care of White aged in our country. Then there is a second part of the motion which requests an investigation of the services and the aid schemes that exist for the care of the aged, with the idea that an investigation should also be made into the needs of the aged in general.</p>

<p>Sir, as a result of the limited time I cannot make a detailed examination of the actual progress in this field in the past number of years. I just want to compare a few figures from the year 1948 with those of the year 1970, but in doing so I have no intention of comparing the United Party of the time with the present-day National Party. For the purpose of this debate we can forget about that. I merely propose to compare two periods, thereby emphasizing the progress that has been made. And when I quote these figures I chiefly want to confine myself to old age pensioners, because we do not have the time to refer to all the various sections and facets. Sir, in 1948 the maximum pension for an aged person was RIO; today it is R35. I do not claim that R10 was too little in 1948. Neither do I say that today&#x2019;s R35 is enough. All I want to emphasize is the fact of a 250 per cent increase over this period. In the same spirit I want to refer to the means test. In the year 1948 a person could receive the maximum pension if he had assets of R800. Over the years this R800 increased by 750 per cent to R6 800. This more favourable application of the means test also brought about a tremendous increase in the number of persons receiving old age pensions today. In 1948 there were 66 000; at present there are about 108 000, of which very nearly 100 000 receive the full or maximum old age pension. In 1948 we spent R6.8 million on old age pensions and allowances; at present it is more than R38 million. In 1948 we had only 23 homes for the aged. Taking into account old age homes that are being built at present, the figure will soon stand at 250. In 1948 we paid R40 000 in subsidies to these old age homes. Now the figure is much more than R2 million, and this does not include the grant made by the Department of Community Development in this connection.</p>

<p>I emphasize again that here I have only mentioned a few of the many figures to stress that progress that has been made from one particular year to another. At the end of his Vote last year the hon. the Minister made a sweeping examination of all the services furnished for our aged. At the end of that speech, from the nature of the case, we could not clap hands, but today, by way of this motion, we should like to give the House the opportunity to express its appreciation for what is being done and for what has been done in recent years. At the same time we offer the United Party the opportunity of joining us in our expression of thanks.</p>

<p>Sir, you may now ask why, if things are so bright, there is a request for an investigation into this whole question. The hon. the Minister has very frequently in the past years made the statement that it is the Government&#x2019;s point of departure that we can never do enough for our aged in this country. It is also in this spirit of not being able to do enough that I advocate an investigation. But I want to say at the very beginning that in using the word &#x201C;investigation&#x201D; I do not in the first place or only have in mind a public commission of enquiry. I use the word more in the sense of study and research, because this is what is particularly necessary in this field.</p>

<p>I now want to try to mention a few chief reasons why I think that study and research are necessary in this field. In the first place I feel that it has political significance in the sense that the position of the aged in the community is very readily abused politically during elections. I do not accuse a particular party of this. We know the history. The conditions of the aged are <span class="col_3681-3682" refersTo="page_0499"/>frequently exploited for political argument. It is my standpoint that any political swindle in this field can only be countered with facts, and facts in their turn we can only obtain by research. With those facts we can then stress why we do certain things, but equally why, on the other hand, certain things cannot or ought not to be done.</p>

<p>In the second place I think that study is necessary because a particular trend is to be detected in the population growth in the higher age groups. In 1911 2.4 per cent of our White population was more than 65 years old. In 1960 the figure stood at 6.8 per cent. In 1970 we expect this figure to be considerably greater. In 1911 0.6 of our population were older than 75 years. I am speaking of the White population. In 1960 2.4 per cent were older than 75 years, and we can certainly expect that the 1970 figures will evidence a considerable increase. What these figures mean to us is that we have a percentage increase of people in that age group that are increasingly dependent upon the community and the State. The older people get&#x2014;and there is no getting away from that&#x2014;the more dependent they become.</p>

<p>But this percentage growth is also more significant, as far as I am concerned, if we note that two-thirds of our old age pensioners are single at present. In other words, we are dealing with a group of people who have for the best part of their lives been together in a family community, but who are now to a certain extent alone. In the last 10 to 15 years of their lives our provision for them must be different to what it was during the earlier 60 or 70 years, and this makes this percentage growth in the top layer of such importance to us.</p>

<p>Also of importance is the fact that 15 000 of our Whites in this highest age group are already cared for in old age homes. I again want to stress that these people, who have been accustomed to different conditions throughout their lives, are now isolated in a particular care centre or other particular circumstances where care is provided.</p>

<p>I also find these figures significant if we note that more than 50 per cent of the women above 60 and the men above 65 years of age are already in receipt of old age pensions. I must emphasize this, because here we already have a large percentage of dependence, but I want to say at once that this dependence must not be interpreted as indigence. A moment ago I pointed out how the means test has been relaxed. Today in this higher category we consequently have people who are in a certain sense dependent, people who to a reasonable extent have an income from which they can live well. They are financially stronger than they were a number of years ago. Our task is therefore no longer solely one of caring for the poor; we know of several present-day aged who tell us they would pay this or that, or make large donations, if only they had some place where they know they would be able to live in the last years of their lives. This phenomenon makes our responsibility that much greater.</p>

<p>Another chief reason why I advocate a study in depth is the shift of emphasis we have observed in the last few years, a shift of emphasis in respect of the methods and the techniques in the care of the aged. I am referring to the National Conference on the care of the Aged that has just concluded in Pretoria. Several facets of the care of the aged were emphasized, and one gains the impression that these various interested groups want to specialize to a certain extent. One emphasizes the health aspect; another intellectual aspect; another the merely physical and another again the merely economic. Because these fields can be delimited so sharply, I claim that the time has come for us to study this matter more deeply. I should just like to refer, <i>inter alia,</i> to what the hon. the Minister said on Monday night when he opened that specific congress which was arranged by the Department. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think there is still a great need for us to immerse ourselves increasingly in a scientific study about the matter of caring for the aged to help us to get rid of many of the stereotyped and uncontrolled ideas about the aged that we still encounter so frequently.</block>

<p>We could conduct a very interesting debate here about what these stereotyped and uncontrolled ideas are, but time will not permit us to do so. In this connection I just want to point out, <i>inter alia,</i> how in the past there has been, and perhaps is even today, a stigma attached to institution care. We think of our old age homes as institutions where the people are isolated. As I shall point out later we should like to get away from that idea. We still perhaps <span class="col_3683-3684" refersTo="page_0500"/>think of care for the aged as being applied to those people who are hidden away in little back rooms, frequently even in rich homes. A shift of emphasis has come about in connection with the care of elderly people, but I do not think that we have sufficient scientific facts to endorse and describe this.</p>

<p>I want to mention a fourth chief reason why I think that study is necessary. The Department&#x2019;s policy of more community or home care has strongly been guided by the hon. the Minister of late. In that connection I should like to quote what the hon. the Minister himself said in his policy statement in connection with the care of the aged. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I fear that we have emphasized too strongly the establishment of homes for the aged and have thereby, too quickly and too easily, withdrawn them from the community and placed them in these homes, while with service and the necessary provision of dwellings we could, in the right ways and in the right places, have kept our old people for a much longer and happier period as an active part of our community life.</block>

<p>The Minister came to the conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Keep the aged in the community as long as possible. Let them continue to live in their natural surroundings and help them with services to combat the problems of age.</block>

<p>This is a standpoint that I fully endorse. I can find no argument against it. But I nevertheless ask that we should make a deeper study of this matter when we come to the application of this idea. As far as I am concerned it boils down to this, that if in the past we have made a mistake by withdrawing the aged too rapidly from the community or by allowing them to be admitted too quickly and in too large numbers to homes for the aged, it now only means that we shall have to reverse this process.</p>

<p>Before doing this I claim that we shall have to think the matter over very seriously. Although the Department and the hon. the Minister perhaps have a very clear picture of it, I myself, as well as other bodies outside, nevertheless feel a measure of concern about how the process will work in practice. I think that I may say here that it is not going to be the Department&#x2019;s policy simply to reverse everything forthwith and say that we have now reached saturation point and are therefore not going to erect any more old age homes. I believe very definitely that this is not the Department&#x2019;s policy. But, while I agree with the idea that much more can be done in the community as far as home care is concerned, I want to ask that in respect of a few matters we should go into this very deeply.</p>

<p>I think we shall have to begin with the aged who are already in homes, and who ought not to be there according to our opinion. We shall have to make a deep, scientific study to assure ourselves that those people are indeed not very happy there. If these studies were to reveal that the people who are there are, in fact, happy and satisfied, indeed happier and more satisfied than they were under previous circumstances, then we shall have to ask ourselves if we are, in fact, on the right track in continuing to emphasize care in the community. I know at once that we are going to have differences in degree. The more dependent, sickly and broken down the aged are, the more will they perhaps prefer the institution care. We shall have to ascertain for ourselves whether we can substitute anything else that would be better than what we are giving at present.</p>

<p>On the other hand we shall have to carry out a study in order to ask ourselves why this community was so quick to let its people go to the institution or old-age home. We must not be misled into thinking that it was as a result of our welfare activities, that it was our care of the aged that served as a stimulus or attraction in quickly taking our people out of the community and placing them in an institution. There had to be other reasons, many of which we could perhaps mention if time allowed. I also think that perhaps my statements would not have been well founded and therefore I should prefer us to make a study of this and ask ourselves whether the experience of the past has not perhaps taught our community that there are good grounds for preferably letting our people go to old-age homes at a particular time and under particular circumstances. I think, for example, that the passage of the Aged Persons Act was to a large extent the result of the poor conditions under which our old people were cared for, not only in groups in old-age homes, but also as individuals. These are conditions we took note <span class="col_3685-3686" refersTo="page_0501"/>of over the years. I think these matters need a thorough study.</p>

<p>In the third place I think that we shall have to investigate the position of the aged who are still cared for at home, those who still live in the community, whether on their own, with children, family or friends. We shall have to make a thorough study and ask them whether they are, in fact, happy there. By that I do not mean that they must simply be asked superficial questions. We shall have to ask them whether we would, in fact, be doing them a favour if we made attempts to house them in old-age homes, and whether they would not prefer to stay where they are. I am sure that several hon. members, like myself, know of old people who tell us: &#x201C;I will make generous donations if I can only be cared for somewhere in my old age&#x201D;. In my own sphere of knowledge I can think of several old people who would tell me, in the words of one specific person: &#x201C;I am very happy. My children are very good to me. My grandchildren love me, but I am terribly lonely, because they have their own lives to live. They are living past me.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In this sense I then want to ask whether the time has not come for us to ascertain whether we have not made a mistake somewhere in the past with the type of old-age home that we built. Will the answer not perhaps be that we should make another kind of home for the care of the aged available that would form a small community on its own and avoid the stigma that now perhaps attaches to the care of the aged, to the so-called &#x201C;institution&#x201D;? Even if we do succeed in keeping people in the community for a longer period, we shall still have to ask ourselves whether we shall not also have to take the existing conditions of care in our old-age homes into consideration.</p>

<p>There is another very important aspect I want to mention. If we decide to place greater emphasis on community care, must we not think in terms of the creation of new services and organizations. We have the family care services in our country that are organized on a very efficient level and that make provision for three different aspects in particular: These are services that call together voluntary workers; that make professional services available and that preserve one very great principle, i.e. that those needing care, and also the aged, must be cared for within their national, language, cultural and religious framework. I am afraid that if we now establish overlapping bodies, and if we inaugurate new ones, we shall adversely affect this one important facet in our family care work. If we undertake a study in this connection we shall have to determine in particular whether the services which I have now termed organized services do, in fact, meet the requirements we set them. Would we, for example, be able to use the subsidies, which we are going to withdraw from the old-age homes, for these family care services?</p>

<p>Sir, my time is nearly up. I would have liked to say a few words about a dangerous trend that I notice in the United Party&#x2019;s policy. They over-emphasize a contributory pension system, they speak of assistance in respect of the loan levy, they recommend that reduced taxes be applicable to the aged who are still employed, etc. I should like to sum it all up in this one idea: No matter how much hard cash we give our old people, we have not yet solved the problem of their ageing. We would all like hard cash, but even if we gave it to them by any schemes whatever and did not supply them with those services that help them in the great and complex process of ageing, we would have done very little for them.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that today I am not advocating a commission of enquiry. What I am advocating is that the Department should use the services that it has inaugurated and its own research division. The Welfare Planning Commission and the National Welfare Board were established to look far into the future, and that machinery must be used to examine all these facets. I have perhaps only mentioned half of the facets I should have mentioned in order to motivate this motion of mine. They must be investigated to ensure that whatever direction we take we shall be doing only the very best for our aged. Many millions of rand are spent on the care of the aged by the State and by voluntary services, and no business undertaking would allow itself to spend millions of rand without good planning.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened with interest to the hon. member for Westdene. He is a person who has practical knowledge of welfare services in South Africa. He is a member of the Welfare Board and obviously we on this side of the House respect the views that he put forward in support of his motion. However, there are certain aspects of his motion which I think he has failed to justify. First <span class="col_3687-3688" refersTo="page_0502"/>of all there is the question of the great progress that has been made in our welfare services for the aged. As the motion now stands, it is completely contradictory to the hon. member&#x2019;s request for a greater investigation, because if we measure the degree of progress, we must surely find that many of the people today, and indeed the vast majority of the aged, are struggling because of the spiralling cost of living. They are struggling with the existing services provided. Every welfare organization is endeavouring to raise more funds to assist these people. It is a situation which is going to be aggravated further by the spiralling cost of living. Therefore, Sir, I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; up to and including &#x201C;but&#x201D; in the third line and to substitute &#x201C;this House expresses its deep concern at the plight of the White aged in South Africa and&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This amendment is moved in order to highlight the position and to give further emphasis to the hon. member&#x2019;s plea for an exhaustive investigation into the social and economic needs of this section of the community. It is not moved in order to oppose the hon. member&#x2019;s motion in its main object, namely to bring about the investigation of which he has spoken. We on this side of the House support the principle of a greater investigation into the economic and social needs of this group of our community. However, in supporting the plea for that investigation, we shall attempt to show how the situation has steadily deteriorated. There is no doubt that progress has been made in certain spheres. We on this side accept the fact that in the period during which the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions has occupied his present portfolio, he has proved himself to be a conscientious Minister. We realize that he endeavours to achieve what he can for the people for whom he is responsible, who are in many instances needy people. However, it is obvious, when one looks at the situation today, that many of these people are experiencing a tremendous struggle to exist. A good deal of the legislation that has been passed and the services that are at present being provided has come about as the result of investigations and surveys that have been undertaken. In the local and regional areas we find, for instance, that groups of public-spirited people get together following an investigation. In the Durban area, for instance, the University of Natal conducted a survey of the living conditions of the aged. Due to the revelations of that survey, the survey was followed by the formation of an association which is shortly to open a very large home for the aged, providing accommodation for over 400 people, to try to meet the need that has become evident as a result of that survey. We know that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department had a working group on legislation for the aged, which resulted in the Aged Pensions Act of 1967. There are various other investigations which have taken place and which have resulted in action being taken. A subdivision for the care of the aged exists in the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. According to the report for the years 1966-&#x2019;70 that was recently tabled, extensive study and investigation have been carried out in regard to their particular task, the care of the aged.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that we believe the exhaustive investigation that is called for is necessary, particularly in view of the fact that these people are finding it exceedingly difficult to exist in South Africa at the present time. I believe that this discussion is all the more opportune at this stage in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister of Finance is to present his Budget in this House on Wednesday next week. I believe that this is an opportune moment to make an urgent appeal to the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions to use all the influence at his command with his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance, to come to the financial rescue of the half million pensioners of all races, although the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions is responsible only for the pensions and welfare services for the White section of the community. I should like him to appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance to take into consideration the position of all social pensioners and, in addition, the civil pensioners who, of course, form part of the aged in South Africa.</p>

<p>There are thousands of civil pensioners who are waiting with bated breath for some assistance. I do not want to anticipate anything in the Budget. I know that the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions can also not do this at this stage. However, my appeal to him is to use all the influence he can with the hon. the Minister of Finance to come to the rescue of these people who are fighting a desperate battle. Many of them are in danger <span class="col_3689-3690" refersTo="page_0503"/>of being completely submerged by the rising sea of inflation that is gathering around them and gaining momentum all the time.</p>

<p>There are other groups amongst the aged in South Africa. The motion that is before us merely mentions the care of the aged and does not specify any particular group. Of course, we know there are many others in that group who are not civil pensioners, but who are living on fixed incomes or inadequate pensions paid by past employers in the private sector.</p>

<p>If we look at the situation of inflation, it becomes obvious that this group is perhaps the most adversely affected of all sections of the community. Just look at the increase in the cost of accommodation that has come about in recent times, the increase in rates where a person is hanging on to an old property, and the increase in the maintenance costs in trying to maintain that property. Look at the increase in the cost of food, such as bread, milk and other commodities which vitally affect them. These are all matters which affect two of the very great necessities of life, namely accommodation and food. I do not think we need any great investigation into this aspect, because merely by our own experience, as representatives of the people in this House, we have almost on a daily basis brought to our notice hardships experienced particularly by this group due to the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>Indeed, if one looks at the situation, one sees that over 80 per cent of those drawing social pensions, for instance, are drawing maximum pensions at the present time. Many of those who have small savings find that they have to make continual inroads into those meagre savings to try to supplement their inadequate pension of R35 per month. This means that many of them look anxiously to the future. Many of them are most anxious at the present situation whereby those savings are rapidly being exhausted. With the increases in rent, many of these people find that almost their entire pension is needed to pay their rent. They then have to appeal to welfare organizations for assistance to enable them to live. If one reads the latest report of the Council for the Welfare of the Aged and the annual reports of welfare organizations, organizations which undertake welfare work amongst the aged, one is amazed to see the growing demand there is for these services, services such as the provision of clothing and food. In many cases the need may be so urgent that there is no time to wait for an investigation to be carried out first. We of course support the principle that there should be an investigation into people&#x2019;s social and economic needs but as I said, in many cases the need is immediate. It is people like these who look anxiously to us in Parliament to relieve their present plight. The hon. the Minister of Social Welfare should in his approach to the Minister of Finance emphasize this need for immediate relief. As I see the situation, five steps ought to be taken to assist these people, steps that could virtually be put into effect immediately.</p>

<p>The first step is to increase these people&#x2019;s social pensions substantially. We have heard from the hon. member for Westdene and from the Minister himself in speeches ir this House and outside that it is the desire and the policy of the governing party I keep these people within their respective communities wherever possible. But it is virtually impossible for many of these people to remain there on their dwindling financial resources. Therefore, an increase in their pensions will assist them to remain within their respective communities for a longer period.</p>

<p>The second step is a relaxation of the means test. We know that income limits have been amended from time to time. We on this side are continually raising the principle of having a means test. There is a fundamental difference between us on this side and the governing party on the question of a contributory pension scheme. We have discussed this many times in the past and, consequently, it is not my intention to deal with it now under this motion. In any event, I doubt whether it would be competent for me to do so. However, we shall continue to propagate such a scheme whenever the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>The next step that the Government can take flows from the diminishing purchasing power of money. The diminishing purchasing power of money has as a result that certain people should receive some assistance through the medium of a social pension from the State on the grounds that the provision they have made for their old age is no longer adequate due to spiralling costs. This too adds to the desirability of a relaxation of the means test in so far as income ceilings and asset ceilings are concerned. It is all very well for hon. members opposite to go back to 1948 for a <span class="col_3691-3692" refersTo="page_0504"/>comparison. But we know what has happened with the value of money in the intervening period. If in these circumstances we were still to apply the means test of 1948 very few people would qualify for a social pension unless of course they are completely indigent. I submit that the object of giving social pensions is not to give it only to the indigent, but also to assist those who made some provision for their old age only to find that that is no longer adequate to meet their needs under present circumstances.</p>

<p>The question of housing is the third aspect to which the Government could give attention. The hon. member for Westdene also spoke about homes for the aged and about housing. This is, of course, a vitally important matter, affecting as it does a large group of people who at present are living in very old buildings. I have seen surveys which were undertaken by welfare officers in connection with housing requirements. Before homes for the aged can I built, one has to submit concrete evidence and facts to convince the department that there is a need for this type of home. Some of these people are living under appalling conditions and when the building in which they live is demolished they are faced with a crisis. The provision of housing for the aged should therefore be included in any housing scheme undertaken either by the Department of Community Development or by local authorities. It should be the aim that at least 10 per cent of the available housing units are made available to pensioners with limited means, not necessarily only social pensioners, but also civil pensioners, Railway pensioners or private pensioners under a certain income limit. That would assist in keeping these people within their respective communities so that they need not be placed in a large institution, a circumstance which in many cases is not in the interest of the welfare of the pensioner concerned for whom it will be far better to remain within the community.</p>

<p>Fourthly, welfare organizations ought to be assisted. These organizations assist many of these people to exist under the present conditions. Here I have in mind the domiciliary services that many of these organizations provide to those people who are unable to gain admission to a home for the aged or whose health is such that they are room-bound, unable to look after themselves. Most of these people desire to retain their independence and hence to remain within the community as long as possible. It is to such people that these welfare organizations are rendering services, such as meals on wheels. Indeed, one organization I am connected with has during the past year served over 14 000 meals to persons who are room-bound. These organizations do not receive subsidies for this type of service and as a result there is an increasing demand on their resources. The question of the subsidization of service centres, which provide meals, services and homes for the aged, is an important one. At the present moment they receive very little by way of financial assistance from the Government in the very important task they are doing in trying to keep these people within the community. Consequently, step No. 4 would be to give greater assistance to these service centres.</p>

<p>Step No 5 also relates to housing. What I have in mind is a special allocation of funds particularly for homes for the frail and infirm. The costs of building such homes are considerable. At the end of last year the department sent out a circular informing those concerned that an increase had come about in the subsidies to be paid to these organizations. Capital expenditure on furniture and fittings has today reached great proportions. Thus, a scheme involving the expenditure of R100 000 on these items, is immediately increased by R10 000 by additional sales tax and additional expenditure on equipment owing to increased prices. A previous Minister of Social Welfare, Mr. Serfontein, was fortunate enough to have allocated on the Estimates a globular amount of R750 000 as assistance to welfare organizations to allow them to proceed with the establishment of homes for the aged, particularly for the frail and infirm aged. In this connection I entirely subscribe to the sentiments expressed by the hon. member for Westdene and also by the hon. the Minister in the past. The homes we have today should be used to an increasing extent by the frail and infirm aged. However, the initial costs of building such a home is today enormous. I understand that an increase in the subsidy per bed, from R90 per bed to R200 per bed, will come into effect from the beginning of April. However, I believe it is necessary that we have a special allocation of funds in order to give immediate relief to these people.</p>

<p>It is a great pity, Sir, that this motion is confined entirely to the White group.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, just before business was suspended I was dealing with the question of the immediate steps that we on this side of the House believe should be taken to alleviate the plight of many of the White aged in South Africa. The second aspect of the motion before the House deals with the necessity or advisability of an exhaustive investigation into the social and economic needs of the aged to see whether the existing schemes are meeting the requirements and the needs of this section. There are of course many aspects of this matter which require greater investigation. There are people who believe that there are certain aspects of this matter which are not necessarily tied to the economic needs of these people. I think it is quite evident that a great deal of further investigation is required into certain aspects of social pensions, and other members of this side of the House intend dealing with certain aspects which I have mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>One of these aspects requiring further investigation is the means test. In terms of the regulations governing the means test there are persons receiving reduced social pensions due to the fact that they are receiving a pension from the private sector or from some other source. These pensions are taken into account in applying the means test. In some instances people have been awarded additional pensions by private pension funds, and in a number of instances this has resulted in a reduction of their social pensions. The whole object of the pensioner&#x2019;s former employer in increasing the pension, whether it be a widow&#x2019;s pension or a former employee&#x2019;s pension, which is to meet the rising costs, is defeated because as a result of the application of the means test the over-all aggregate received by the widow or the pensioner is invariably less. One case which clearly illustrates this is a case which I discussed with a pensioner this week. In this case a widow was receiving R40.62 per month from a superannuation fund and an old-age pension of R9 basic plus a supplementary allowance of R10 due to a delayed application for a pension. In other words, she was receiving a social pension of R19 per month. The superannuation fund then increased her pension to R48.08. Because her pension exceeded the means test ceiling of R48 per month by eight cents the over-all position was that she lost an amount of R11.54 including her social pension. The over-all position then is that she lost her old-age pension of R19 per month and had to reduce her standard of living by R11.54 to R48.08. I think this clearly illustrates the necessity for a thorough investigation into all these aspects. The hon. the Minister has indicated in the past that the means test is continually under review and that surveys and investigations are carried out continuously. However, it is clear that a great deal still remains to be done in this regard. As far as this aspect of the motion is concerned therefore we support the plea that there should be an exhaustive investigation.</p>

<p>There are, however, other aspects of this motion which call for comment. As I indicated before business was suspended, we believe that there are five immediate steps which should be taken to alleviate the plight of these people. At the same time, this investigation should also be extended to include the non-White group, which finds itself in a very difficult position indeed. They are possibly in more dire straits than the White group. I believe it is a great pity that the mover, in framing this motion, did not take cognizance of the plight of this section of the community. I should like to say that we on this side of the House have on numerous occasions put forward private members&#x2019; motions asking for possible improvements in the conditions of these people to be investigated. We have also pleaded for such investigations during numerous other debates. Unfortunately a number of these private motions which came before the House were not accepted by the Government. In view of the fact that this motion has been moved by a Government member, it may mean that the hon. the Minister will be more sympathetic to this particular plea.</p>

<p>What does one find when one considers the whole aspect of long-term planning in this regard and whether sufficient is being done for these people? The hon. the Minister is on record as saying that we can never do enough for these people. We believe that more extensive planning must be undertaken. We believe that it is a tragedy that in South Africa at the present time the pioneers of this country of all races are in many instances living in dire poverty. They appeal to this Government and to this House for an alleviation of the plight they are now facing.</p>

<from><span class="col_3695-3696" refersTo="page_0506"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the time granted to a person during the discussion of these motions is very short. Therefore the hon. member for Umbilo must please excuse me if I do not reply fully, or even try to reply fully, to what he had to say here today. I want to tell the hon. member, however, that it is very popular politics to emphasize the aspect of finance. This is specifically what he did today, but let me say that it was a one-sided emphasis. The amendment which the hon. member moved boils down to the fact that the aged in our country are, according to him, in strained circumstances. There may be such cases, but to pretend that this is the general position is merely to look at one side of the picture. Finance is important, and time and again the Government has indicated its willingness to bring about extensive improvements within the framework of the available means, whether in respect of pensions, subsidies or allowances. We can also expect that, as in the past, considerable improvements will again take place. This could possibly be heralded in the following Budget. Money is important, Sir, but it is not everything. If we read clearly what is requested in this motion we realize that the available money could perhaps be applied to better advantage if we know precisely how and where. And here I want to leave the hon. member at that.</p>

<p>Since 1950, when the first conference about the welfare of the aged was held in Bloemfontein, we have acquired a great deal of knowledge about the aged and their care. Theoretically we can almost say that we have completed our education as far as this matter is concerned. Much of our knowledge we have applied in practice over years. However, the fact remains that certain aspects of the care of the aged need continual investigation and research. The Minister himself referred to that at the opening of the congress which he addressed in Pretoria at the beginning of this week. He said that it is necessary because we should like to do the best we can for these pioneers of South Africa, but we could probably add that research is necessary and even unavoidable because the times and the conditions of living continually change. I said that our theoretical knowledge about the question of the care of the aged covers a very wide field, and if one examines the motion one could easily ask what fields still remain in which research can be done. With this question in view one must also try to delimit a few spheres; one must try to define a few spheres more closely so that one can also make a positive suggestion by those means. There are three matters I should like to bring to the attention of the House, matters in respect of which we could perhaps, by a positive investigation, make a very good contribution to the implementation of. what is being asked for by the member who moved this motion.</p>

<p>The first concerns the direct participation of the general public in welfare work in general and care of the aged in particular. I want to call this the social conscience of the public. Another point is the attitude and disposition of the aged themselves. Then there is a third matter that I shall mention presently. In these two spheres, those of the social conscience of the general public and the attitude of the aged themselves, I have obtained confirmation for my trend of thought in the report that was handed to us only this year. With reference to the welfare services to the aged in the community, these words are used, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To assist the services to become properly established and to develop on sound lines, the general public and persons approaching old age will also have to be educated to have a clear understanding of the characteristics of ageing, the place the elderly can and should occupy in the community and how, on reaching a chronologically old age and the retirement stage, still to lead a meaningful life, retaining an optimum degree of independence.</block>

<p>With respect to that let me also quote this from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech earlier this week. The Minister points out that besides the Netherlands we have one of the highest percentages of aged in old-age homes, but then he adds this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the meantime the services in the community that have as their aim to assist the aged to take up their place independently in the community, have enjoyed relatively little attention. The starting point in the creation and provision of our services must continue to be to help the aged, bearing in mind their primary needs and qualities, to find their way through life independently and to remain integrated members of the community. I want to place particular emphasis on community services. This is one of the <span class="col_3697-3698" refersTo="page_0507"/>most practical and efficient methods of keeping our aged an integral part of the community.</block>

<p>We may now ask what the real contribution of the general public is to welfare services in general. The general public contributes financially. This takes place through church organizations, contributions to collection lists and that coin we throw into the boxes on the street corners. The general public&#x2019;s contribution is worthy of praise when we look at the large amount of money collected for Christmas and Holiday funds. But thereby a large portion of the public&#x2019;s task has been done and many of them have salved their consciences. Then there is another section of the public comprising members of welfare organizations, people who, in addition to their financial contribution, also grant physical assistance. In essence they form the voluntary welfare organization itself, and the voluntary welfare organization occupies a key position in the structure of our national welfare services. The Minister has mentioned on occasion that they are the traditional and faithful allies of the State in the sphere of welfare work. But this faithful ally is frequently bowed by financial burdens. But this is not insurmountable. Only last year, when dealing with his Vote, the hon. the Minister said that if these voluntary welfare organizations were finding it difficult to fulfil their task the State must increase the subsidies that are granted to them, so that they may continue with their work. If they were not able to continue with their work the entire burden of that task would fall back onto the State. Then we are at a point where we would not like to be, because then we are already a Welfare State. Finance is therefore not the only problem. People who are prepared to do voluntary work are just as important, and particularly as far as the care of the aged is concerned. The voluntary welfare organizations yearn for the help of more voluntary hands, for more people who can supply visiting services, club services, mealtime services and transport services. They are looking for people who can join the aged in their activities and sympathize with them. If there are people joining in the activities of the aged and sympathizing with them, the aged will also join in the activities of their community and feel themselves in sympathy with that community. It is, after all, specifically our endeavour to keep the aged as an integrated part of the community. If the public only contributes financially, its actions are actually moving towards ostracizing the aged and having them cared for at some place or other by trained personnel, instead of retaining the aged as an integral part of the community. The more hands we have that can also give physical assistance, the greater will be the interest created in also giving more financial assistance in a larger sphere, according to my way of thinking. Without elaborating further on this matter, I believe that an investigation must be carried out into how we can again make the South African public aware of the need for full physical participation in the care of the aged by community services. How can we again slightly intensify the social conscience of the general public and keep that conscience activated?</p>

<p>Along with that we must also give attention to the concept the aged have about their place and position in society and to adapting them to the changed circumstances of their lives. The tendency towards seclusion, the forfeiting of independence at a time when it is not necessary at all, the feeling of being a commodity that is becoming increasingly useless and a preponderantly negative disposition are mental attitudes that must be counteracted. This can only be done by a process of education, instruction and positive guidance. After that we must carry out investigations. The aged have the exceptional assets of wisdom and experience of life, aspects we should praise. The starting point is perhaps to give them confidence again so that these people will feel a desire for closer links with the community. The determination of the best method to bring about this changed attitude to life is, I believe, a field for research.</p>

<p>I also want to give the hon. the Minister another matter for his consideration. Would the publication of a magazine not be one of the methods of talking to the public and the aged about a changed attitude to life? There are many Government departments that have documents about many subjects. But apart from perhaps the more academic and more technical publications, the Department of Social Welfare does not have a publication through which we can communicate directly with the public in layman&#x2019;s language. It does not only have to deal with the care of the aged; it can also embrace all the other spheres in which this Department carries out its services. Let us use those aged, who have maintained a balanced link in the process of ageing, to provide their fellow aged with suggestions <span class="col_3699-3700" refersTo="page_0508"/>about how one bridges the difficult years when adjustments to life must be made. Let authorities write about the positive transition to the changed conditions of living. There are many ideas and suggestions, but we must bring them to the attention of the public and the aged. This is an important matter, and it effects all of us sitting here in the House. It also effects the population at large. None of us will escape old age, even though we have escaped many of life&#x2019;s difficulties. If we give service to those who need it very much, i.e. the aged in society, we can expect to stimulate others to look after us one day when we in turn are wandering in life&#x2019;s shadow.</p>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Germiston accused us of viewing assistance for our elderly people on a one-sided basis and said that it is popular to advocate financial assistance for old people. But I think that the hon. member for Umbilo made it very clear that financial assistance is the most important, and at present the most essential, kind of assistance that we can give to elderly people in South Africa, and that these other matters, which possibly have to be investigated by a commission, can be dealt with at a later stage.</p>

<p>I give the fullest support to the amendment of the hon. member for Umbilo, but I must take the opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for Westdene most warmly and to thank him. I want to congratulate him because he is beginning to realize himself that all is not well with the economic and social care of our aged. I want to thank him for having the courage of his convictions and not to merely come along and thank the hon. the Minister, and for coming to light with a new approach in the form of this motion.</p>

<p>If there has ever been the necessity for an exhaustive investigation, then it has specifically been for an investigation into the economic and social care of our elderly people. That is why we are thankful that this motion comes from that side of the House. We on the Opposition side do not believe that the existing economic and social care is sufficient. We do not believe that there is sufficient provision for the needs of our elderly people in South Africa. We have been saying this for years, in fact during every discussion of the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions.</p>

<p>We now find it strange that this motion is forthcoming from the hon. member for Westdene, because during the discussion last year of the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions hon. members on that side of the House could not thank and praise the hon. the Minister enough for what is being done for elderly people in South Africa. I cannot but refer back to the words of the hon. member for Westdene in last year&#x2019;s debate. I want to quote what he said at the time. In column 4930 of Hansard he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we look at the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. we find that in 1962 the total expenditure under this Vote was R76 million and this year the figure is almost R150 million. This proves two things to me, firstly, that the Government is definitely not unsympathetic to those people who are dependent on the Government in one form or another for their livelihood, and, secondly, that one is disturbed when one sees how much money is spent on people in our community who are not self-reliant.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene went further and in column 4931 he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is why I want today to put in a strong plea to the hon. the Minister once again that we must guard against the danger of over-specialization in our welfare work, which could lead to our neglecting the basis of our welfare work.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it seems to me as if the hon. member for Westdene is now beginning to listen to us. It did not surprise me when, this afternoon, the hon. member for Germiston advocated a compassionate society in South Africa. Last year, at the beginning of the Session, my hon. Leader advocated a compassionate society in South Africa.</p>

<p>A few nights ago, in his opening address to the National Conference on the Care of the Aged in Pretoria, the hon. the Minister said the following, according to a Press report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most old people were no longer part of the labour force, but there was no reason why they should not be a more integrated part of society. Meanwhile, the services in the community to take <span class="col_3701-3702" refersTo="page_0509"/>their place independently in society, have enjoyed relatively little attention. Dr. Mulder said the idea behind the creation of services should be to help the old people, while considering their basic needs and qualities, to find their way independently through life and to remain integrated members of society.</block>

<p>We on this side of the House accept the fact that where possible our old people should retain their independence in respect of the community. In fact, last year I personally made this statement when I spoke under the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We can only work towards a compassionate society if we take positive steps to make our elderly people happy and active members of our community and to make our elderly people feel that the community and the future generation do not regard them as useless, old and decrepit citizens.</block>

<p>Is the Government now making it possible for our elderly people to maintain their independence in our community? I accept the fact that the hon. the Minister does not want to accept a national contributory pension scheme as a possibility. However, with the hon. member for West-dene&#x2019;s motion it is now possible for the hon. the Minister, if he accepts it, and even if he were to reject the amendment of the hon. member for Umbilo, to make an exhaustive investigation a reality. This investigation could also probe the possibility of the establishment of a contributory pension scheme. Then I believe that it would be an investigation along the right lines. We know that the hon. the Minister made it very clear that he was adopting an attitude of principle against a State lottery, but throughout the years the Government has also, <i>inter alia,</i> adopted an attitude of principle against the establishment of television. Now at least a commission of enquiry had been appointed to investigate matters in connection with television. Possibly the hon. the Minister must waive his personal standpoint against a State lottery to a certain extent and think of the possibility that this exhaustive investigation, as proposed by the hon. member for West-dene, could also probe this matter in the sense that it could be a help to a contributory pension scheme. Today our elderly people, particularly the social pensioners, cannot subsist independently with respect to the community. The national contributory pension scheme that we are advocating is a fundamental and an important part of any possibility along these lines. We have already argued about the advantages and disadvantages, and an exhaustive investigation is perhaps the right answer along these lines.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the loan levy that is also applicable to our elderly people. It happens to be my privilege to represent one of the oldest constituencies in Johannesburg. There are elderly people who have been living there for 40 and 50 years. In other words, I represent many elderly people. I most probably represent many more elderly people <i>pro rata</i> than many other hon. members present in this House. I watch them struggling. They approach me from day to day. I visit them regularly, they write to me and complain about their lot. I now want to say at once that apart from their personal budgets that do not always tally at the end of the month, there is one matter that hurts our elderly people very much, i.e. the loan levy. I raised this matter under the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions last year and I advocated that the Minister should make a plea to the hon. the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this motion deals with an exhaustive investigation into the economic and social needs of the aged. I think that there are many things the Minister could perhaps already deal with at this stage without the institution of an investigation. That is why I want to advocate to him that financial steps could perhaps already be taken without the need to wait for an exhaustive investigation. You will remember that there was a division in this hon. House about this matter. Under his Vote we asked the hon. the Minister of Finance for the abolition of the loan levy, including that for our pensioners.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall then abandon that idea.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the hon. member for Westdene, who accused us here of giving preference to finance instead of other social problems. He accused us of only being concerned about a contributory pension scheme, the abolition of the loan levy and the lowering of the ceiling for payments. He said that cash in the pockets of the aged was not the only thing that helped them.</p>

<p>The economic needs of our aged form a part of their problems. Insufficient pensions, which are certainly affected by the means test, the loan levy, the purchase tax and other taxes are matters that deserve attention. The question of insufficient pensions must be investigated and loan levies must be abolished, in my opinion. If the hon. the Minister cannot negotiate successfully with the Minister of Finance I want to ask him also to take note in this exhaustive investigation of that problem concerning the aged in order to determine whether it is not possible to grant these people exemption from the loan levy. I support the amendment of the hon. member for Umbilo and request the hon. the Minister to accept it. I am sorry that I could not speak about finance; therefore I should just like to ask the Minister to investigate the matters.</p>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is to be regretted that in the impetuosity of youth a man simply wants to make politics of every matter. I thought we were going to discuss this question here in a peaceful atmosphere. He took a turn at television, the loan levy, lotteries and a national contributory pension scheme, merely in order to make politics out of these items. May I just say this to my hon. friend: I do not want to devote much time to him, because he spoke a lot of nonsense.</p>

<p>Firstly he spoke of a national contributory pension scheme. May I just tell him that in England people are already rejecting it, because they say it is only leading to a Welfare State. As far as our aged are concerned, no one on this side of the House has ever said that enough is being done for them. We are agreed on that. It will probably never be possible to do enough for them in any country of the world. But there are surely many other factors that we must take into consideration.</p>

<p>The care of the aged is a question that is daily assuming greater proportions as a result of numerical increases and the changed circumstances in the changing world in which we live. I therefore consider it necessary for the State and our welfare organizations, from sheer necessity, to accept greater responsibility for the care of the aged. At the same time, however, I want to say that one can gratefully testify to the work of some of our welfare organizations that contribute more than their share, and to the work of the State that has done so much for the caring and housing of our aged. Here I particularly have old age homes in mind, the cluster housing that is available to our elderly people and the institutions for the enfeebled aged. Today I should like to express a few thoughts about the institutions that already exist and will be established for our aged.</p>

<p>Since many of our aged find refuge in these institutions at present, I believe that it should be our aim, not to let them feel that they are a burden to the State or to society, but to let them feel that they can still prove to be an asset to society, so that they can retain their independence and selfrespect for as long as possible. They must in no way think that they are living on charity or that they are no longer carrying out any function or serving any purpose. And therefore it must not only be our task to provide for the most urgent needs, i.e. food and housing, but also for their social and other needs. Even if they do form a group in those old age homes or in those cluster housing schemes, even if they are people of the same age group and even if they all have common interests, these are still people who can be lonely. I do not think that old age homes <span class="col_3705-3706" refersTo="page_0511"/>create any problems since welfare organizations do so much to make life as pleasant as possible for the aged. Here I should like to mention an organization such as the Suid-Afrikaanse Vroue-federasie that does a tremendous amount to make the living conditions of the aged as pleasant as possible.</p>

<p>However, I should like to confine myself more specifically to cluster housing for the aged, because I believe this to be the ideal solution to the problem of housing the aged. A cluster housing scheme involves a place where our aged can live independently and where, in every unit, provision is made for a kitchen where the aged can prepare their own meals and even serve tea to their families and friends. I have already spoken about this before, but I want to do so again today. At Boksburg there is a cluster housing scheme consisting of 220 dwelling units in the form of a block of flats. My personal experience is that the people there form a truly happy community. They live quite independently. It is true, however, that the majority of those aged live alone and this perhaps makes life more difficult and lonely for them. In the light of this problem I wonder whether, in the erection of such dwelling units, there cannot perhaps be greater co-operation with other departments. Dwelling units are provided by the Department of Community Development, and I wonder whether the Department of Social Welfare, in co-operation with the Department of Community Development, cannot perhaps in the planning of such a building ask for provision to be made for a communal hall, for a reading room which could perhaps serve as a library and for a consulting room or if need be a clinic for a visiting doctor. I may just mention that a need does exist for such a communal hall. In Boksburg we found that those 250 aged wanted a piano. They held two concerts there and they themselves were responsible for the programme. Even one old man of more than 80 years of age took part and it was a dazzling success Sir, I can tell you that that piano is Probably one of their most precious possessions.</p>

<p>I also want to ask whether it is not possible to arrange, in co-operation with Social Welfare, for a social worker to pay a routine visit there in order to help many of those elderly people solve their problems. Perhaps arrangements could be made, in co-operation with the Department of Health, for a district surgeon to pay a regular visit, or perhaps for visits from a nurse to ease the district surgeon&#x2019;s task. Many of those elderly people find it difficult to go to a hospital or even to a doctor&#x2019;s consulting rooms when they have health problems. If there could be such regular visits it could prove to be quite a help. Mr. Speaker, my time is running short. I just want to say this: It would be a great help if perhaps, in co-operation with the Provincial Administration and even the local authorities, a library service could be established there in order to provide for their love of reading.</p>

<p>I want to express my thanks to the member who moved the motion, to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and to the State for what they have done for the care of our aged. I should again like to make an appeal to the local authorities and the welfare organizations to make old age, that waits for us all, a pleasanter and more tolerable time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to elaborate on what the hon. member for Boksburg said but I do not want to confine myself to the pensions and allowances which pensioners as such receive. I want to confine myself more specifically to housing conditions and the facilities which are being made available for the aged. I want to state that if there is one aspect of this whole matter which requires probing research or thorough investigation, then it is the question of the housing of the aged, the method of housing and the care being given to them. I want to agree with what the hon. the Minister recently said in his opening speech to the conference that we had perhaps reached the stage where we had as many homes <i>per capita</i> for the aged as the average <i>per capita</i> figure in the rest of the world. But the fact remains that in some respects our homes for the aged are completely different to those in the rest of the world where they have made much further progress in this field than we have here.</p>

<p>Sir, an aspect which I have dealt with in this House already, and which I want to emphasize again is the system according to which, when community development has passed the planning and an institute for the aged has been established, only a certain quota is allowed for single dwellings or semi-detached dwellings for category A individuals who can still look after themselves, as compared with category B <span class="col_3707-3708" refersTo="page_0512"/>who can still look after themselves and category C who can no longer look after themselves. I advocated before that couples in category A, i.e. couples who can still look after themselves, who can still do their own cooking and are still able to entertain friends, should be allocated a greater percentage of the flats within the same complex. My standpoint is that if persons go there and one of them subsequently dies, the surviving spouse should be able to remain on in the same complex and in the same circle of friends. It happens that these persons are transferred to category B and when they subsequently become helpless, they are transferred again to category C. It is very important that these aged persons remain within the same circle of friends and within the same complex. Today one finds that more than 20 per cent occupancy in these maisonettes or semi-detached cottages for couples to live in. A maximum of 20 per cent occupancy in the complex is allocated to them. I think it is necessary for plans to be drawn un in such a way that a greater percentage of those people are catered for. It is extremely important that these people live together and remain within the same circle of friends, although they go from the one category to the other.</p>

<p>I also want to agree with the Minister that it is essential to allow those aged persons, who still find it possible to participate in the life of the community, and for whom a niche in society can still be found, to remain in society as such. I am talking in particular now about those in the group 65 and over who are not yet very advanced in years. Such persons must not necessarily be selected to become inhabitants of homes for the aged. However, we must never forget that we have a great percentage of aged persons&#x2014;I am speaking in particular now of those old-timers of 75 and above &#x2014;who have no kith or kin, who are a burden to society, and who do not know what to do with themselves. Many of them are still healthy and therefore find that it is very difficult to get into the institutions. To prove what I have now said, I should like to quote from a memorandum which I recently received from an institution, an institution with which I have had a great deal to do. This institution was completed seven months ago. I want to say at once that I do not want to express any criticism as far as the Department of Community Development is concerned. Nor do I have anything to say in regard to the new concessions which have been made in respect of construction costs. In category A the concession was increased from R2 500 to R3 400. In category B it was increased by almost R2 000. I do not want to criticize that. The point I want to emphasize deals with relationships, the care of these people. Perhaps it would be a good thing if I were now to quote from the memorandum I received. It reads, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows&#x2014;-</p>

<p>Seven months ago only 60 people were admitted, and this was with the close co-operation of, and after screening, by social welfare. Because the home was built for the frail aged, with the active aged to be housed separately in double cottages, the average age worked out to just over 80 years of age, with the breakdown as follows: one of 97, two of over 90, seven residents of 85 to 89, 15 of 80 to 84, 22 of 75 to 79, 12 of 70 to 74 and only one of 65.</p>

<p>The average age of the group is more than 80 years. The memorandum continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All those above 60 were able to come to the dining room and get about generally, but within the last three months there have been five deaths, two admittances to a mental home and 16 classified as infirm. Due to their age, they have deteriorated very rapidly and the remaining 37 could become not frail, but infirm, overnight.</block>

<p>That is the proportion I am referring to</p>

<p>I am now reading from a memorandum from a person who has been dealing with these institutions for years now, and these are the recommendations she wants to make in this regard. She says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From these statistics it will be noticed that the &#x201C;frail aged&#x201D; homes become chronic, sick and infirm homes within a very short period. Thus a home for the first-mentioned, the frail aged, built with money loaned by the Department of Community Development for the building, has inadequate facilities to cope with the change. This change of becoming infirm so quickly necessitates a complete reversal of the original policy as far as the building, the trained staff and other staff, hospital facilities, diet, atmosphere and conditions generally are concerned. <span class="col_3709-3710" refersTo="page_0513"/>The Departments of Community Development and Social Welfare are giving 100 per cent assistance in every respect and can only be praised for their efforts. After waiting up to seven years for a home for the aged, in all centres there is a long waiting-list and residents may now have a bedroom to themselves and excellent meals &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here this person agrees wholeheartedly with what the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The residents now have a bedroom to themselves, with excellent meals, company, laundry and just about everything that can be given and done for them, but it is human nature that nothing takes the place of their own home, no matter how poor and inconvenient. There is something lacking, the homeliness and close contact with their own, with their relatives, friends and surroundings. Now I feel what is wanted is a place of last resort where infirm, incapacitated and bedridden people, in fact all those who have become a burden to themselves and their families and have no place in the hospitals as they are just waiting for the end, could be housed. This must not be confined to the sub-economic group either. The economic should also participate. They have the money and are prepared to pay, but there is nowhere for them to go and an adjustment should be made by the Department &#x2026;</block>

<p>I have used this example to show what happens with some of the most modern institutions we have today, one which was opened seven months ago. I had a great deal to do with its planning and I went to Pretoria more than once in regard to the matter. I regard it as a very modern institution, but within a question of seven months it changed to such an extent in atmosphere and set-up that although it was intended for people who were able to help themselves&#x2014;they were frail but they could still help themselves&#x2014;-it certainly became one which required specialized services, nursing services for which no provision had been made in that home. Then one finds in the next home which I have mentioned previously, where the three categories are consolidated, i.e. the couples who can still help themselves, the individuals who can still help themselves and those who are incapable of helping themselves. It is here that I state that we need incessant research to see whether we cannot get these institutions to offer a refuge for certain categories of persons who can after changing from one category to the other remain within the same complex so that they can remain with their own friends they made earlier, who can remain there now that they are helpless.</p>

<p>Then we are saddled with the other problem I read out to you a moment ago here. This is a modern institution and the clients are selected in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, but within a short time the whole situation has changed so that those persons have now become dependent upon services which are not being supplied in that institution, and which now have to be introduced. It is for that reason that we want to make a plea from this side of the House to the effect that research should be done in this connection, for I do not think we have developed nearly far enough in this field. Apart from the many services we are supplying, apart from some of the wonderful services we are supplying, and apart from whether the pensions or the subsidies are adequate&#x2014;I am not talking about these at all&#x2014;I think we must undertake research. I am talking about the welfare of the aged as such who are far advanced in life and have no other place to go. They cannot go into a hospital, and are dependent upon their own resources or their friends. We must see to it that these institutions are equipped so that they supply the services needed to make it possible for them to care for these people to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>I just want to mention one example here which came to my attention last Tuesday while I was in East London on other matters. This concerns an 88-year-old woman who is completely helpless. Her condition is such that she can scarcely lift her food to her mouth with her one hand; she must be turned in her bed because she cannot do so herself. She is without friends except for one person who is unfortunately leaving for England on the 1st of next month on another emergency case. She has been boarding with another woman and there a Bantu servant has been looking after her for the last three years. This servant slept in the kitchen so that, when she rang the bell, the Bantu servant could hear it. An inspector came and said that the Bantu servant was not allowed to stay inside the house. He said that the Bantu should stay in quarters outside the house. The woman with whom this old lady was boarding, said that she was sorry, but that under those <span class="col_3711-3712" refersTo="page_0514"/>circumstances she could no longer accommodate the old lady. I drove around for hours there trying to find her a place to stay, subject to my obtaining from the hon. the Minister or the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration a permit to allow the Bantu servant to sleep in the house. There is no other way in which she can be cared for. She is helpless and destitute. The maximum she can pay by way of her pension is R40 per month. Nobody will be prepared to take her in for that, but a Bantu servant will be prepared to care for her out of that. This is an example of the kind of legislation we have on our Statute Book which requires that I should come to Cape Town to talk to the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration to make it possible for a Bantu servant to remain close enough to that person, who is completely helpless, so as to be able to go on helping her at the age of 88 years. This is one of the cases which ought to be admitted to a home. There is such a long waiting list, particularly in the vicinity of East London City, that it is almost impossible to have a person admitted. It makes no difference what kind of priorities a person sets; it is of no use unless somebody&#x2019;s arm is twisted to admit such a person. I want to conclude by stating this fact that no matter what we have to say about the financial needs of these people and the concessions which are being made by the Department of the hon. the Minister, they are inadequate. What I should like to know in that connection, and this is to me of primary importance, is how these people are being cared for once they are inside these institutions. Is it the kind of care we want there? Must we not undertake research in order to improve it, to make it more pleasant and more effective as far as housing and so on is concerned? I want to content myself with seconding the amendment of the hon. member for Umbilo.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>.</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to take part in this debate on a subject which has been raised by the hon. member who proposed the motion which has been commented on by the hon. member who proposed the amendment and which has been covered by other members in this debate. I consider this subject to be one of the major social problems, if not the main social problem, which affects the White population of South Africa. I refer to the plight of many old people, and this plight is being magnified these days on account of the rapidly rising cost of living. Obviously, Mr. Speaker, the main needs of older people are, firstly, income so that they can eke out an existence&#x2014;I will not say enjoy a living&#x2014; and have some independence in their old age so that they will not have to rely on their families or on friends or on charity; secondly, housing so that they have a home and a roof over their heads for the remainder of their lives; and, thirdly, care, not only physical care in the time when they become too old and infirm to care for themselves, but also mental, psychological and community care. I think all of these subjects have already been dealt with by other speakers in this debate.</p>

<p>I should like to add my voice to those who have mentioned a problem which, in my experience, is the source of a great deal of exasperation, the cause of a great deal of hardship, the cause of old people losing interest in being of value to the community and making a contribution to society and has many other undesirable side-effects. I refer to the means test. While, obviously, the ensuring of a minimum income for old people is the prime requirement, I have found that what has caused more unhappiness, more frustration and more bewilderment, has been the means test, and, I think with some justification. As at present applied, the means test causes a lot of difficulties in different directions. I should like to deal with some of these difficulties in the time that is available to me.</p>

<p>The first one that I would like to mention, is the fact that as long as the pensioner is dependent to any extent for his income on the old age pension, in other words, as long as he is receiving any part of the old age pension as his income, his income is subject to an absolute and rigid ceiling. This occurs because the means plus pension is a fixed amount, one amount for married people and one amount for single people. The most which a married couple under these circumstances can receive by way of so-called free income until one of them is 70 years of age, free income being that income which is not affected by the means test, is R72 per month. This is dependent upon the amount being derived in income from employment. The free income can be as low as R32 for a married couple or R16 for a single person. As soon as income is received which exceeds the free income, each rand of income in excess of the free income, results in an equivalent rand being <span class="col_3713-3714" refersTo="page_0515"/>taken off the old age pension until the stage is reached where the pensioner no longer qualifies for the old age pension at all. In practice this acts as a very real disincentive against old people trying to augment their income by offering their services in the labour market or trying to augment their income in any other manner. It applies especially to the age group 60 to 69, because after 69 and from 70 onwards earned income is not subject to the means test. It is at the ages of 60 to 69 when retired people are still of most value in what they can contribute productively. In addition to being a disincentive to endeavours to increase income, the means test and the fact that there is this rigid ceiling to it, does cause very real hardship. I would like to mention one case that I recently came across in my own constituency. It concerns a married couple with the husband aged 69 and the wife aged 70. Until November last year the husband was receiving a pension of R43 per month, and the wife R45 per month. Because of the wife&#x2019;s physical condition and the fact that she was virtually bed-ridden, she also received an attendance allowance of R10 per month. This provided this married couple with a total income of R98 per month. Due to the difficulty of making ends meet on this amount, the husband, very inadvisedly as it turned out, thinking that his own pension only would be affected thereby, took a job as a clerk which provided him with an income of R150 per month. The result was that not only did he disqualify himself for the old-age pension, but he also disqualified his wife. His wife also lost the attendance allowance. Because of the fact that he had to go out and work full-time he had to get in outside help to look after his wife. All in all, they were no better off because her husband had taken this full-time job. That is not an isolated case. I have come across other cases where similar circumstances prevail.</p>

<p>I would like to suggest, in the investigation which is proposed in this motion, that consideration should be given to raising the means plus pension ceiling, so that the hardship which is caused by cases such as I have mentioned could be relieved. I would also like to suggest that there is a case for a sliding ceiling. By a sliding ceiling I mean that as the free income is exceeded &#x2014;say by R1&#x2014;then a lesser amount should be deducted from the old-age pension. This would mean that at all stages there would be an incentive for old-age pensioners to increase their incomes by work or by savings. I realize that there are problems in the way of the introduction of such a scheme, but I think that there are great merits to it as well. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that it is a worth-while scheme which can be considered during such an investigation. I support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umbilo.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the hon. member for Westdene for the motion he moved here because it has again focused the attention not only of everyone in this House but also of our public outside on the position of our elderly people and the aged. This has also given us a chance, I think, to take a look at precisely what we are doing for these people. At the same time this has also focused attention on certain improvements which can be effected. I want to repeat what I have said before&#x2014;one can never really do enough for this group of people. We must keep on undertaking further research to see whether we cannot improve on certain existing schemes or effect certain changes to the benefit of our elderly people. For that reason I welcome this whole idea and the discussion which took place here.</p>

<p>First I want to make a general statement, before I reply to individual members. The Opposition of course is now trying to create the impression that they have been pleading for certain matters for such a long time, etc. This is of course a popular theme. In actual fact, all of us make pleas for our elderly people. Every member on both sides of the House makes a plea for them from time to time. I am continually doing so. The Minister of Finance has a very generous heart for them in all respects. There is not a person in this House who is not well-disposed towards these elderly people or who deliberately wants to do them out of something simply because we have some political attitude or other. Everyone would like to help. Unfortunately the limiting factor is finances. In other words, one must cut one&#x2019;s coat to suit one&#x2019;s cloth. Unfortunately again, the source of these finances is the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket. The amount which can be thus obtained is a limited amount. One cannot over-tax the man in the street. There is also a limit to what you can tax him to obtain funds for this very good cause. That is why I maintain that there F no difference of opinion on any side of <span class="col_3715-3716" refersTo="page_0516"/>the House in regard to the need, the desire or the wish to help these people. What is in fact at issue is the limiting factor which is unfortunately all present in our lives, i.e. what funds are available and where these funds can be found. I just want to mention this general idea by way of introduction.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene introduced this matter very neatly and forcefully. I know him to be a person who is sure of his case. Consequently he stated it very forcefully. In the time at my disposal I unfortunately cannot reply to all the different points raised by the hon. member. He will understand that. However, I will in fact furnish replies to certain of the specific matters he raised here. The general idea here is further study and research. This is in fact the theme of the motion and that portion which the Opposition consequently support.</p>

<p>To begin with, I just want to say something about research in general. I shall mention in a moment details of what we have done in regard to research; but research in this field is in fact being done, consistently, from year to year, from day to day, by certain specialized persons, who have specific instructions and whose task it is to keep working on this. I know the hon. member is not asking again for a specific commission of inquiry, because that would again mean a whole bulky report and a whole inquiry. His request is that we ask the existing machinery and the bodies to undertake specific research in regard to these matters. I just want to say this about research. I have here in my hand only a few of the brochures and publications of the Department in regard to research during the past few years since 1964. Not all research results have been published; but I have here, for example, an edition, No. 7 of 1964, of &#x201C;Clubs for the Aged&#x201D;&#x2014;a neat, specific piece of work on this specific theme. The next one which is available, i&#x00AE; &#x201C;Research and Information&#x2014;Legislation in regard to the protection of the aged: a study of relevant literature, 1964&#x201D;. This is also available in Afrikaans. Then we have here &#x201C;The Care of the Aged Policy of the Department&#x201D;, a version of the speech I made in which I announced the policy in 1968, which is also available in this form. In addition there are a few very useful publications, for example, &#x201C;The Training of Homes for the Aged Staff&#x201D;. This supplies comprehensive and specified expert information to everyone who wants to know precisely how the training of staff ought to take place, where the accent should fall, etc. There is also an interesting publication on care of the aged in foreign countries, in which we compare our conditions and everything that is happening here, very usefully with the situation, abroad. We can see where we fall short, and where we have already done better than is being done abroad. This is a very valuable piece of work, in regard to which I have received compliments and praise from all quarters, i.e. &#x201C;Handbook on the care of the Aged in Homes&#x201D;, which the private sector and the voluntary welfare organizations can put to very good use because it is based on expert knowledge. These publications report on actual research in specific fields. I therefore want to say to the hon. member that I want to endorse the idea that there should be continual research on specific themes and problems. I want to concede to him at once that we should undertake that research from day to day. But I immediately want to add that I think that we should not allow the emphasis to be placed so strongly on research that the actual implementation, action and positive steps suffer and lag behind as a result. If I must choose between the two, I think we have done a good stint of research&#x2014;it is time we proceeded to positive action in the implementation of the results of our research and what we have ascertained to be in the interests of our aged persons. As far as the ideas which were broached here are concerned, the precise situation of family care services, the type of home we must build and what should become of the aged in homes for the aged who, according to the new policy should not be there, I just want to tell the hon. member specifically that it is not the idea at present to remove any person who has already been admitted to an existing home from that home unless that person of course requests it himself or is unhappy there. But it is not the idea to remove those people from those places. The idea is simply to make sure in future that people who do not belong in homes for the aged are not placed there. There is therefore no danger in this specific field. The hon. member also requested that we should harness our own section for the purpose of research, and I support this wholeheartedly. I also endorse the hon. member&#x2019;s idea that we should make far more use of the welfare planning commission and the section which was specifically established for the care of the aged, to undertake planning on a general scale and to work out a future <span class="col_3717-3718" refersTo="page_0517"/>for us in this connection. In conclusion I want to thank the hon. member for the way in which he stated his case, and I also want to pay tribute to him for the knowledge he revealed in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo then moved his amendment, and I do not take it amiss of the hon. member for doing so. It is probably asking too much to expect that the Opposition will thank the Minister, nor do I expect them to do so. The hon. member expressed his concern in regard to the condition of the pensioners. I just want to inform the hon. member that we are all concerned about the condition of the pensioners in this sense that we would like to see them better cared for and would like to improve their situation. I personally and all of us on this side are really doing our best to improve their conditions. There is no doubt about that. The hon. member also spoke of assistance to civil pensioners, and I want to tell him at once that I am afraid that I cannot at this juncture give him any information in regard to the matter because I would then have to anticipate the Budget. The hon. member can well understand that I cannot do this. If this debate had been conducted four or five days after the Budget, I could perhaps have said a great deal more in this connection. However, the hon. member may as well listen first to what the hon. the Minister of Finance does in this connection, and I am saying this without compromising him or myself in this connection. The hon. member mentioned five matters here to which he thinks we should give specific attention. I am keeping one eye on the time, but I do nevertheless want to dwell on these matters for a few moments.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Umbilo asked for a substantial increase in social pensions. This is something one and all of us plead for from time to time, but the deciding factor in this regard is the available funds. As far as this matter is concerned, the hon. member will also have to wait for the Budget speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance on Wednesday. The hon. member then mentioned the loss in the purchasing power of money and asked for the relaxation of the means test and the lifting of the ceiling concerning assets and income. The last request was also made by the hon. member for Constantia. The first point I would like to make in this regard is that 90.4 per cent of all our pensioners receive the maximum pension at the moment. This means that the means test really affects only 9.6 per cent of all pensioners, which is a very small percentage. Although there may be hard luck cases in individual instances the facts are that more than 90 per cent of all social pensioners receive the maximum pension and that the means test does not affect them at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will say a few words about them in a minute or two.</p>

<p>The hon. member then spoke about housing and said that 10 per cent of the housing in any housing scheme should be for pensioners. In theory this is a good idea, but I think 10 per cent is a little high because the percentage of pensioners in our community is only about 7 per cent, according to the figures we have at our disposal. In this regard there is an administrative problem as well. If these old-timers are spread all over the country to take up 10 per cent of each housing scheme, problems will be created in regard to services for them and the administration concerning them. The idea is something we can accept in that it can be investigated. Money may perhaps be made available up to a certain percentage for a housing scheme or an old-age home. We can look into this matter. The assistance to welfare services, community services by means of subsidies and the establishment of service centres is a matter which is under consideration at the moment. I personally feel very strongly about community services and service centres. This is at the moment being negotiated with the Department of Finance and the other departments which are affected.</p>

<p>In the last instance the hon. member referred me to the special subsidy for which one of my predecessors, Mr. Serfontein, got R750 000 in a certain year for this purpose. This money has been fully spent in the meantime and we have created a standing Vote for the purpose. Last year, in one year only, R350 000 was spent for this purpose and we are trying to provide at least R200 000 each year as an auxiliary fund to help these people. It is also a question of trying to do as much as we can with the funds available to us.</p>

<p>*Sir, I shall talk to the hon. member again in general presently when I return to my theme. Hon. members will forgive <span class="col_3719-3720" refersTo="page_0518"/>me for not having the time to give attention to each speech. Neat speeches were made on our side, and neat speeches were also made on the other side; that much I want to concede at once. But I want to say this to the hon. member for Turffontein: I do not take it amiss of him; he is still young and inexperienced, but perhaps I can give the hon. member this piece of good advice: Personally I like a good political debate and I like a good political fight, but I do not think that the future and the interests of our elderly people should ever become the theme of a political dispute in the House because these are our people, all of them, and I do not want us ever to try to make political capital out of the position of our elderly people. With experience and with the passage of time the hon. member will acquire a measure of wisdom in this connection and learn that this is not the way to further the interests of the elderly people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg referred to the question of housing. I shall return to that specifically in a moment. The ideal situation is to have the community hall, the consulting rooms, the library and all the services all together in one place; that is the ideal. We should like to centralize them and this we shall in future try to do. The possibility is being investigated at the moment, but the financial aspect is always the difficulty. Sir, I am not going to say much more about the speeches of individual members. I should like to praise the fine speech made here by the hon. member for Germiston, and I just want to say to the hon. member for East London City that he mentioned an individual case here. I am convinced that if he had come to me personally, I would in fact have been able to, if necessary, devise a plan in that individual case with a view to the sudden need of the moment. Unfortunately we have long waiting lists, as the hon. member said, but we now have a permanent arrangement to the effect that in every new home which is being built we try to encourage the people to set aside a certain percentage for the frail aged so that the ideal can be realized that if a person is admitted there and he becomes physically or mentally so frail that he is in need of care, he need not be uprooted and removed, but can merely be moved to another section of the same institution, where he can then continue to receive treatment. This is the ideal situation; this is what we are trying to achieve and are promoting as far as we possibly can. Sir, with that I have dealt with the hon. members&#x2019; speeches.</p>

<p>I want to devote the last half of the time at my disposal to giving a general survey. I think this is necessary. I should like to do so under three heads. Firstly, the attention which the Government has in recent years already given to the care of the aged; secondly, what aspects are at present receiving attention; and thirdly, a survey of future prospects in respect of essential requirements and the directions in which we are thinking. I do not want to go very far back. I want to begin with 1959. At the request of the Department of Social Welfare, the then National Bureau for Educational and Social Research, which at present is the Scientific Research Council, instituted a comprehensive investigation into the social and economic living conditions of the aged. This report appeared in 1962. This covered aspects such as the family life of the aged, housing, the economic and health conditions of the aged, the educational level o&#x00ED; the aged, the social contacts, the recreational activities and similar matters.</p>

<p>In 1964 the then Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions appointed a work group consisting of departmental officials plus members of private welfare organizations to go into the desirability of a special law to protect the aged. Out of this arose the Aged Persons Protection Bill in 1967, which provided, <i>inter alia,</i> as hon. members know, for statutory measures to protect the aged against exploitation and neglect, for the compulsory registration of homes for the aged and consequential regulations in terms of which minimum standards are laid down for homes of the aged and in terms of which we unfortunately closed down certain homes of the aged in the past and as a result of which we have now established new places to which to transfer the aged persons. In the meantime quite a number of short-term investigations have been made by the Department and by the research section in regard to the nature and scope of clubs for the aged, in regard to home auxiliary services, in regard to meals-on-wheels for the aged, in regard to the task of social workers in the employ of the Welfare of the Aged Association. The Department itself instituted an investigation on a country wide and intensive basis into the following:</p>

<p><span class="col_3721-3722" refersTo="page_0519"/>The inhabitants of State-aided homes for the aged, their living conditions before the survey, factors which persuaded them to go to the home for the aged, and their adjustment in the home for the aged. In regard to these facts a dissertation was completed under the title &#x201C;The Role and Significance of Homes of the Aged and the Care of the Aged in South Africa&#x201D;. We are at present considering publishing it. Other departmental investigations were concentrated on existing services available for the aged; I am not going to elaborate on them. The year 1967 was an exceptionally important year seen from this standpoint because a senior professional officer from my Department made an extended overseas study tour on the instructions of my predecessor. This study included all welfare practices and programmes in Western countries. As a result of that a complete report followed which gave rise to my stating in October 1968 the policy in regard to the care of the aged as it is known at present and in regard to which I shall have a few more things to say in a moment.</p>

<p>Also as far as research is concerned, we instituted a detailed investigation in 1969 throughout the entire Witwatersrand area into the need for institutional care for the frail aged&#x2014;who they are, where they are, how many are in hospitals, how many are hidden from sight, and how many find themselves in indigent circumstances. This was a detailed investigation for the Witwatersrand from which an exceptional new service in this connection developed to make provision for these people. I see that time is marching on. I could have gone on to say a good deal about the reports of private individuals, such as the report of Prof. Anderson, the report of Dr. Ripp, the sociologist, and of Dr. Kriek in regard to certain homes for the aged in Pretoria, etc.</p>

<p>I do not want to spend much time on that; I would prefer to say a few more things. There is another case I want to make special mention of. I think it is necessary that I mention it here and place it on record. The South African National Council for the Care of the Aged has done a tremendous amount, within its capacity, not only to make investigations but also to co-ordinate the efforts of private organizations and in this way to cooperate towards getting more co-ordinated action on a countrywide basis. My thanks to them for their co-operation. The annual report which they submit, shows very clearly what a great variety of services is being undertaken.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another very interesting experience which our Department often has in this connection. In practice, if a community applies for the establishment of a home for the aged, then a survey of the needs first has to be made. This survey is usually made by the local persons themselves and then the information comes to us. Subsequently my Department&#x2019;s officials are requested to look into the survey and to evaluate it in order to establish whether the need really exists and what precisely the position is. We have during the past two years worked through 2 500 lists of this nature, and on each list we of course had at least 60 or 70 names; this is the number of personal individual old-age pension cases and care of the aged cases which are gone through individually and in detail by my Department. That is why I want to assert that I think that in general the specific section in my Department working with this matter really has first-hand knowledge at its disposal. I think it has a finger firmly on the pulse in this connection and knows precisely what the need is and where the specific needs are situated. I concede at once that the investigations must continue, but I want to assure hon. members that as far as we are able to do so, we are keeping pace with the complications arising and adjustments required from time to time. When a problem presents itself, it is immediately investigated because we have a permanent section which deals only with these specific matters.</p>

<p>What have we done recently, and what is the present position? I do not want to boast to any extent; I just want to mention a few matters. Between the years 1965 and 1970&#x2014;and because I do not want to make political gain from this, I am deliberately not going to compare it with any previous period&#x2014;R8 million was paid out in subsidies for the establishment of homes for the aged in South Africa. That is F 8 million in five years, more than R1 million a year. We are at present engaged in converting an old hospital into a home for the aged. It will cost us R1 million. It is going to make provision for at least 200 frail aged persons. That is what we are doing at present. This is being done in the complexes on the East Rand, where it is necessary.</p>

<p>I want to mention another practical aspect. I want to emphasize that it is time <span class="col_3723-3724" refersTo="page_0520"/>now that we, even more than we have been doing these last few years, draw positive attention to the practical aspects of this matter. Last Monday night I opened the conference on care of the aged in Pretoria. At that conference which ended yesterday the emphasis fell specifically on positive action and the practical approach as such. I received a report from that conference. It is still in telex form, as it arrived here, for the purposes of this debate. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are approximately 400 delegates. The conference was well-attended throughout. Interest was exceptionally great. Eventually more than 100 proposals were received from the delegates. The following overall proposal we think was one of the most important. This national conference was called by the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions</block>

<p>Now I just want to inform this House who was present at this conference. Firstly, there were representatives from my Department and regional offices throughout the entire country. In the second place there were delegates from all voluntary welfare organizations and churches throughout the country, dealing with care of the aged and homes for the aged, in whatever form. Thirdly there were the hospital authorities of the various provinces. We brought medical services into this. The Department of Health, and everything connected with it, was also present. In the fourth place the universities were present, because we are dealing with research and the training of social workers. They were all brought into this matter here, in addition to quite a number of other interested persons. These delegates were drawn from both language groups and from all avenues and facets of care of the aged. The following resolutions were adopted there (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>(1) This conference noted with great interest the care of the aged policy of the Government as announced by the Minister on 22nd March, 1971, and the conference supports this policy.</p>

<p>(2) The Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is requested to do everything in its power to expedite the implementation of this policy in all its consequences by means of the following (a) systematically making the necessary funds available; (b) establishing the necessary administrative machinery for the effective and rapid handling of the envisaged schemes; (c) obtaining the co-operation of other State Departments and bodies involved in the implementation of the policy, and coordinating their forces in such a way that simplified procedures and measures will be established which will facilitate and expedite the implementation of the objectives.</p>

<p>(4) An appeal is being made to voluntary welfare organizations to make efforts to ensure the implementation of the announced policy and also to obtain the support and co-operation of the public in this connection, <i>inter alia,</i> by obtaining the necessary funds from private and public sources.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with this conference any further. I just want to say that I want to confirm now, as I undertook at that conference, to give my personal attention to these recommendations, and will immediately proceed myself to see in what way these recommendations can be implemented as quickly as is practicable.</p>

<p>Now I want to go further. I said that this conference was deliberately convened for this specific purpose. Now, in conclusion, I want to try to summarize the whole matter. In 1968 at Bethal I made a policy statement. In that statement the three categories were very clearly indicated. Firstly, there are those people who are still living in places they themselves have chosen to live in. We must try to keep them in those places where they are living as long as is practicable. An elderly person does not like being transplanted. He does not like being uprooted. He wants to remain in his own home as long as he possibly can. That is why we want to care for them there with community services so that they can remain there as long as possible. That is why I am making a very strong appeal to the effect that we should expand our community services and that we should give positive attention to the expansion of community services in terms of which certain essentials will be made available as far as the community is concerned. I am thinking of simple things. I am thinking that in many cases those elderly people need transport, which a well-disposed friend can <span class="col_3725-3726" refersTo="page_0521"/>make available for them very easily. This is the least we can contribute, i.e. by taking the old gentleman or lady to church, to hospital, to doctor, to the post office to draw his or her pension. That is little enough which our young people can do for a generation which laid the foundations of this country. These are community services which make it possible for them to stay where they are. Otherwise they try to get into a home for the aged to be near the post office or near the church. I am thinking of other services in regard to which I do not even want to go into detail now, in respect of hot meals once a day, for example, or paying a normal visit to these people. I am thinking of para-medical services such as physiotherapy services, etc., and services to make things easier for the old people. There are numerous things like this we can do, such as paying a friendly visit, and so on. I shall now give specific attention to this and I want to make an appeal to the public outside to remember, while we are strong, young, healthy and fit, that all of us have to grow older and that we may, by now doing our share, perhaps be casting our bread upon the waters which will return after many days.</p>

<p>In respect of housing, we have the second group, the persons who are no longer able to live there, as a result of the death of one partner so that the other cannot remain alone in the house, or as a result of the fact that the place has become too big, and the garden and house are being neglected, or whatever the case may be. There we need special housing, and that is the matter the hon. member for Boksburg raised so neatly, and what the hon. member for East London City referred to. We must establish housing so that these people can enjoy the necessary protection under the supervision and under the protection of the resident house mother and father, but at the same time still remain independent, with a kitchen of their own in which they can make their own tea and receive their own guests and children. These people do not want to be dependent at this stage already; they are still strong enough, but they are simply unable to live where they have been living because that has become dangerous. But in this new situation everything is in order and they will prefer to remain independent there. This is essential. In the third place, there is the question of the frail persons, if persons have through physical or mental deterioration become so infirm that they permanently require semi-medical services. Then only is institutional care necessary, which in my opinion can be added to this housing scheme so that they can, without moving far, simply be transferred to the next section and receive the necessary attention there.</p>

<p>I am making haste, because I see that time is marching on to 4 o&#x2019;clock, to mention the next few points to you as quickly as I can. In conclusion, in the few minutes left to me, I want to say that we realize very clearly that there is this problem of the care of the aged. I would not for one moment hang my head in shame at what we are doing for our elderly persons. We are doing a great deal for them, as much as can possibly be done at this juncture. The methods of what we are doing have been scientifically investigated and are well-founded, to the best of our ability. The financial assistance we are giving them, is at this moment the most the Exchequer can afford. This is the position as it is at present. If we had to give more, we would have to impose heavier taxes on the taxpayer in order to be able to do so, and this is not unlimited; you cannot impose unlimited taxation. For that reason I, as the responsible Minister, feel that we must do what we are able to do to the best of our ability. But I think this debate would be incomplete if I did not in conclusion make an appeal to our people who are still young and healthy to take an interest in our elderly people, to pay them a visit now and again. I am making an appeal in particular to our womenfolk, because a woman usually has a softer heart than a man has in this connection. I want in particular to make an appeal to our womenfolk to pay visits to these fine old people who are in the homes, or who are still living in their own little places, and to take along a bunch of flowers or sometimes a cake or a hot meal. This makes living pleasant for them and makes that person&#x2019;s day or week worthwhile. They are satisfied with so very little. Even the small things in life are appreciated so very greatly by these people who, when in the prime of their lives, laid the foundations and built up this country. You and I who are today sitting here and who regard ourselves as young and vital, in the prime of our lives, must each prepare ourselves for the old age which is coming, prepare ourselves not only financially but also prepare ourselves physically and mentally for what is coming. How many old people are there <span class="col_3727-3728" refersTo="page_0522"/>at present who find it extremely difficult to adapt to the new position because they were so busy and active and thought of more important things so that they do not have a hobby or something to while away their time now in their old age. They do not know what to do with themselves. They feel frustrated and this has a psychological effect and it makes them tremendously concerned about and fearful for the future. They look forward to it with fear and wonder what they are going to do when they are no longer in a position of power or in an executive position. It is necessary that one should in one&#x2019;s youth and in one&#x2019;s middle age begin to acquire certain things gradually to which one can transfer when one&#x2019;s active life as a labour unit is over. When one is old, it is difficult to begin with something like that; the first thing to do is to begin now already and develop it gradually so that eventually you can go over to it when the time to do so arrives. I am calling upon everybody to do this.</p>

<heading>PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES AGAINST POLLUTION</heading>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">, That this House expresses its deep concern at the neglect and decay of so many of our irreplaceable natural resources, and calls on the Government to consider the advisability of taking urgent steps to combat the growth of ecological imbalance and the pollution of the South African environment.</block>

<p>Yesterday I spoke to a crew member of one of the yachts which took part in the Cape to Rio race. I was surprised when he told me that even on the wide open ocean large areas of oil were found. When he told me that near our big harbours there was a shocking state of effluents, of flotsam and of jetsam dirtying the areas near these harbours, it indicated to me how important it is, once more, that we should study and take steps to maintain the ecological balance, which we have always had under nature&#x2019;s good hands in the past. The fact that we are now being threatened by one of the greatest dangers with regard to pollution in the world&#x2019;s history, the danger from radio-activity and from nuclear explosion, might even unite mankind. President Nixon said recently in his State of the Union message&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The great question of the 1970s is: Shall we surrender to our surroundings or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land and to our water?</block>

<p>That is the great challenge of the 1970s. The new word we have for this science of survival is &#x201C;ecology&#x201D;. Our biosphere, our forests, our grasslands, our urban complexes, our oceans and our coastal estuaries are all the main eco-systems of the earth. To keep them in balance is necessary for human survival. But modern man, with his industrial development, as we have seen, has upset that balance and this has caused life itself on our planet to be endangered. Nature enjoins us to maintain a balance between four main factors. The first of these is the minerals of the earth, the inorganic material. The second is the plants that produce food from these inorganic materials. The third are the users of the inorganic materials. We, mankind, are the greatest users and misusers of these benefits which we get. Fourthly, there is the bacteriological action which transmits these minerals and the human waste, the de composed and dead bodies, into soil again. It takes 500 years for a single inch of good top soil to develop. That single inch of good top soil can be destroyed within less than a decade by wrong farming methods.</p>

<p>Let us, firstly, admit that man is the crucial factor in keeping the ecological balance. During the ages, particularly during the twentieth century, man has, through his unrestricted and uncontrolled breeding, increased the population of <i>homo sapiens</i> to such an extent that the earth can no longer support and feed him. 8 000 years ago the population of the world was 5 million. Today it is 3 500 million. By the year 2 000, it will be 7 000 million. The earth will hardly be able to support mankind by then. Today India is faced with an impossible choice. DDT has been discovered to be a poison in foodstuffs. Sweden banned DDT. Sweden asked the Indian Government whether they were going to do anything about it. The Indian Government replied that, if they were to banish DDT, they would have starvation <span class="col_3729-3730" refersTo="page_0523"/>by the million in India. They, already, are a country faced with a terrible choice between poisoning on the one hand and starvation on the other.</p>

<p>Pollution is an ugly word for an ugly subject. There are six main types of pollution, on each of which I should like to say a few words this afternoon, namely pollution of the air; pollution of the land; of the fresh waters in our rivers; of our oceans; noise; and in the last instance, radio-activity. The problem of noise is extremely important. The first one, namely air pollution, I regard as one of the most dangerous, and I am sure hon. members will agree with me. Our bio-sphere is being polluted by effluent from millions of motorcars in the form of carbon monoxide, lead poisoning, nitrous oxides from the chimneys, sulphur dioxide, and so forth. In sufficiently concentrated quantities, these can all kill man and have killed people. These elements go into the air in this world of ours in millions of tons per day. It is predicted that in the state of California, by 1975, we will find mass deaths starting. As a matter of fact, today in Los Angeles physical culture classes are being curtailed and being closed down, because the department of education simply cannot allow the children in the public schools of Los Angeles to breathe so much of that air. It will be harmful to their health. In Tokio the traffic officers are kept on duty for only two hours at a time in that smog-filled city. About 31 per cent of our earth&#x2019;s atmosphere today is covered by low clouds. If we increased that 31 per cent to 36 per cent through pollution, the temperature of the earth can fall by four degrees centigrade. That can be the beginning, as the experts say&#x2014;it is not I that say it&#x2014;of a new ice age.</p>

<p>To come closer home, in Johannesburg the polluted air that we breathe on a windless day is so thick that it is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes. That is what a person inhales through pollution in the air in a city such as Johannesburg. There is a pall of smoke hanging over our cities from the 2 400 locomotives of the Railways and from the factories which are all spewing smoke into the air. In Germiston pilots have declared the air above the Germiston marshalling yards to be a flying hazard because of the smoke. We Capetonians know all about the story of Smoky Sue, the famous tug we have in the harbour. This is a task which, incidentally, needs and, I think, will have the sympathetic attention of the hon. the Minister of Transport. I believe that the Department of Health has a division on industrial hygiene. They have been in touch with the hon. the Minister of Transport in connection with the smoke pollution by railway locomotives. I trust that something will be done in this regard.</p>

<p>Our next problem is the pollution of the land on which we ourselves live. Man is polluting his surroundings by his waste, to a great extent on account of modern technology. Think of the billions of plastic containers made of almost indestructible material that are being thrown away every day. every week, every month. In the United States of America the junk heaps of used cars increase by 7 million rejected old cars per year. 20 million tons of paper, 100 million tyres, 28 000 million bottles and 48 000 million cans are discarded in the United States per year. The United States industrial plants spew out 165 million tons of solid waste per year and 172 million tons of smoke and fume. The figures seemed unbelievable when I saw them, but I read them in reliable journals.</p>

<p>We in South Africa have the same problem. We are in a highly industrialized society. The average South African discards close on 15 pounds of waste per day. Think of our mail boxes every day. After all of us on both sides have conscientiously gone through all our papers, the letters, the periodicals and the blue books, we discard some five to ten pounds of waste paper per person per day. That indicates what is happening in a civilized society. In Johannesburg alone 200 million cans for beer and cool drinks are produced annually. These are discarded. In his lifetime the average South African uses 15 000 gallons of petrol and 26 million gallons of water.</p>

<p>The damage done by the man is not confined to urban areas alone. Many agricultural pesticides, of which DDT is one, are polluting our food, killing birds, small mammals and harmless insects, thereby disturbing the balance in our farm lands. Our natural resources, our water sheds are being grievously damaged by injudicious cultivation of those areas. Our precious wild life areas, such as the Etosha Pan and St. Lucia Bay, are being threatened. Dozens of animal species have died out over the past few hundred years in South Africa. They have mostly died out as a result of the actions of man himself. To mention an instance which is much closer home, it is sad for me to think that those irreplaceable <span class="col_3731-3732" refersTo="page_0524"/>and beautiful botanical treasures of Bokbaai near Darling in the Western Province, which have been cared for by the sacrifice and the love of that wonderful Duckitt family, is being threatened by the expansion which is being planned in the vicinity of Mamre, the Coloured group area. Du Toit&#x2019;s Kloof has been desecrated by banalities, and we wonder whether the remaining beauties of Langebaan, which I think the hon. the Minister has visited, will be maintained very long. Dare we refuse to save the Baviaanskloof area in the Eastern Cape? Would it not be wonderful if we could have the whole magnificent area from Cape Hangklip across the Drakenstein range right up to the Cederberg range declared a natural resources area for South Africa? Would it not be wonderful if the whole of this area were to be brought under the Department of Forestry as a large part of it at the moment is?</p>

<p>It is not true to say that South Africa has too many national parks. In the United States alone there are at least 600 national parks and big areas which have been declared national monuments. I am thinking of Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Petrified Forest, the Grand Canyon, Mount McKinley, the Glacier basin, the Craters of the Moon and, as we have recently seen in a film, the beautiful little area at Zabriskie Point. I believe that injudicious town planning is despoiling many of our coastal areas and also our peri-urban areas today. Something is being done about that and I am not denying it, but I am mentioning this as part of the problem in not only South Africa, but also throughout the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The third great sphere of pollution is our fresh water supply, our dams, our rivers, our lakes and our fresh water estuaries. In Europe the Rhine has become an open sewer. Dangerous chemicals are found in drinking water. The great lakes of America have become dead areas where all life is dying. So are the lakes of Switzerland dying out. Measures have been taken, measures such as the recent Water Amendment Bill in this House. This is an excellent measure, which was supported by both sides of the House. This is to prevent the pollution of our rivers by means of animal waste and by means of agricultural development on the borders of our rivers. It shows that something can be done and that something has been done. Our own Vaal River is becoming more and more polluted every year. Effluent from the gold mine dumps and the slime dams during thunder storms flow into the streams and into the Vaal. I am glad to know that there is a certain unit of the Chamber of Mines which is doing good work in this regard. However, it would take many years before all the flow of the effluent of these slime dams can be finally prevented. Detergents in our washing materials flow into the rivers and this causes dirty masses of foam which kill life in our rivers. Pollution is playing a major part in spreading bilharzia to the rivers of our country which were free of this disease in the past.</p>

<p>The next form of pollution I would like to mention in passing is that of noise. It is not usually recognized as such, but it obviously is. These howling decibels of the modern traffic are actually a health hazard. It has created a greater degree of deafness amongst the urban population than amongst the rural population. This is measurable and it has been established that this is the case. We who are living in the cities are more deaf than those living in the country areas as a result of noise pollution today. Supersonic noises present a danger. I have even read in an article in an authoritative magazine called <i>Environment</i> published in America, that even microwaves can be dangerous. I give it as a present to my hon. friends on the other side that even television too, unless properly safeguarded, can be a health hazard through radiation. So, when television is introduced, please see that safe tubes are supplied.</p>

<p>The next type of pollution is the one that affects our oceans and our beaches. The near-disaster of the Wafra is still fresh in our memory. Was enough done to prevent the incident? I am not blaming anyone now&#x2014;I only hope that we shall take the necessary steps to avoid a disaster occurring when such a danger threatens us again. I trust we have all learnt our lesson. Effluents from sewerage into our oceans has polluted vast areas. I have seen it around Marseilles, Nice and the Bay of Naples, where areas are declared unfit for bathing. 70 per cent of the oxygen of the world is produced, I am told, by plankton in the ocean. If you cover that plankton with a thin film of oil you are going to destroy the whole plankton balance, and even the oxygen balance of the world for mankind itself, apart from the dangers to marine life. Unwise exploitation has almost killed our fishing industry. I do not know much about the problem, but I have been told that the unwise use and permission for <span class="col_3733-3734" refersTo="page_0525"/>using these anchovy nets with the smaller mesh has caused devastation among our marine life. Thousands of small, two-inch galjoen have been pulled up by these nets and have simply been dumped afterwards.</p>

<p>The last form of modern pollution that I would like to mention, is that dreaded one of radio-activity. Tens of thousands of tons of radio-active material have been dumped by the United States in the oceans off the coast of America in containers. But this material can remain radio-active for centuries. There is no guarantee that those containers will not leak. Further tens of thousands of tons have been dumped deep underground in the Western Earthquake Belt of the United States. There is no guarantee that an earthquake cannot upset the whole area and cause the distribution of these radio-active materials. I would like to have the assurance that we are looking in South Africa to the disposal of our nuclear waste from our limited nuclear establishments which we have at the moment to ensure that that waste, which can be active for hundreds of years, will never be dangerous to mankind. I wonder whether sufficient control is being exercised over the use of fluorescent material in our advertising and in clocks and watches.</p>

<p>Now, having stated the problem, the next question is, what do we do now? On behalf of my party I can announce this afternoon &#x2014;and I am happy to do so&#x2014;that, having discussed the matter thoroughly, we have now adopted it as part of our official policy that we would like to have a Ministry of Environment in South Africa. We seriously call upon and encourage the Government to anticipate us by doing so. Should they do so, we shall give them our support. Why have we decided this? &#x00CD; do not wish to indicate that nothing has been done up to now. Indeed, many bodies inside and outside the Government, have been active in this respect. My purpose and our purpose in asking for a Ministry of Environment is to have concerted action and a concerted plan. Outside the Government we have active bodies such as the Society for the Protection of Environment, under its able president, Mr. Bill de Klerk, assisted by Professor Bigalke and Dr. Giliomee. I think of the Vaal River catchment areas and the Veld Trust, associated with Mr. T. C. Robertson. I think of the Vegetation Unit of the Chamber of Mines and of many industries, of which Sasol forms an outstanding example of preventing pollution and reusing by-products. I am thinking of our country&#x2019;s newspapers, which are campaigning for a better environment. I think of a series of articles, the Care campaign in <i>The Star.</i> Our universities are doing good work. I am thinking of Prof. Midgley of the University of the Witwatersrand and Prof. Potgieter of the University of Potchefstroom, who is the Professor of Regional Planning. He is doing excellent work in this regard. Just to show how non-political I am today, I want to mention the work done by the Boy Scouts, the Voortrekkers and the Rapportryers, who recently held an excellent symposium at Stellenbosch about the environment. It was very commendable work. I also do not want to accuse the Government of having been idle in this regard. The C.S.I.R. is doing good work through its National Institute for Water Research under Dr. Stander. There are also other bodies studying pollution. I believe the Windhoek project was worked out by this section of the C.S.I.R. The hon. the Prime Minister has his Planning Advisory Council, which has made investigations into the wider implications of this problem. There is also the Natural Resources Development Council, the Water Commission and the Department of Water Affairs. All these bodies have done good work in regard to our environment. I think the problem is that the work is not being done in a coordinated way. I am only asking for this co-ordination in order to give greater acceleration to what is being done and what should be done. The Department of Cultural Affairs made a very good film, &#x201C;Hou ons Land skoon&#x201D;, which was seen by over I million people. I am even praising the S.A.B.C. this afternoon for having had a series of lectures on this problem. I am pointing out these matters to show how wide-felt the realization of the importance of this problem is. The goodwill exists and the national conscience is stirring. There is no lack of action over a wide field. Even on parliamentary level there has been wide agreement between both sides of the House over matters such as the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act of 1965, the Water Amendment Bill this year and the Water Research Bill, all directly or indirectly dealing with the problem of pollution. I believe that all this can only be co-ordinated under one central ministry with executive and not only advisory powers. The present Ministry of Planning is aware of this problem and is investigating and advising the Government on this. But the hon. the Minister will be the first to admit that his <span class="col_3735-3736" refersTo="page_0526"/>department is more of an advisory body in this regard and does not have the executive powers and the legal authority to do something about it. A separate ministry is the solution and it is up to us in Parliament to enact a law to give it the executive power that it will need. This is no criticism of the hon. the Minister. As a matter of fact, if a Minister of Environment were to be appointed and the Prime Minister were to choose him, we would be very happy with the choice.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment try to assess just how wide this problem is. It affects nearly every Government department. I have mentioned the Department of Planning and of Water Affairs. It also concerns the Department of Community Development in regard to town planning and also the Department of Health with its investigations into the question of industrial pollution and poison. The Department of Mines is concerned with underground air pollution, sink-holes and water in mines, which are indirect forms of pollution. This matter also concerns the Department of Bantu Administration which has a great task in keeping many of our catchment areas free of pollution so that our rivers will not be polluted. The Department of Agriculture has to look after the use of agricultural pesticides, fertilizers and is also concerned with the beaches of our country. All these departments have a role to fulfil today and they are doing so to the best of their ability, but is it done to the extent that the urgency of the problem demands? This is what I would like to know. In this category we can also include the Department of Transport, which apart from locomotives, is concerned with noise at airports and is also in charge of the national road building programme in South Africa. As we all know, a national road can upset the environment to a great extent. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs plays a key role, as we saw in the Wafra affair, and even the hon. the Minister of National Education can do something in this regard through the South African Film Board, as has been done by means of closed circuit television. He can assist the Department of Information in awakening the public conscience still further. The hon. the Minister of the Interior can, via the provincial councils, contribute as well. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Finance realized the importance of the problem and I am sure that he can also assist in this regard. Merely by mentioning these departments one realizes the vastness of this problem and the need for a central authority. Firstly, a proper scientific and technical knowledge is needed. Secondly, the right system of economic analysis in laying down priorities is also needed. Thirdly, the right legal administrative framework should also exist. In this regard the Government can give the lead and we believe that the answer is a Ministry of Environment.</p>

<p>I am coming near the end of what I want to say. I believe that in the meantime further active steps can be taken in regard to this problem. Greater penalties for pollution under existing laws can be imposed by our courts and still stricter control can be exercised in the use of pesticides, fertilizers and antibiotics for animals. Tax concessions can be considered for industries which combat pollution and which re-use waste and recycle water. Crop rotation and the greater use of organic fertilizers can be encouraged. Local authorities can tighten their by-laws and new ways of composting sewage and new ways of re-using glass, paper and tin ought to be found and developed. The field is endless. The goodwill is there. The manpower, the funds and the legal enactments can and must be found or our country will suffer. Therefore I appeal to the Government&#x2014;and we shall support them&#x2014;to take the necessary steps to establish this new authority for our environment under a Minister of Environment before it becomes too late.</p>

<speech by="#pansegrouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the opportunity which this House is being afforded this afternoon for discussing a motion of this nature. We also appreciate the way in which the hon. member for Orange Grove dealt with this motion. There is no one in the Republic of South Africa, and, as a matter of fact, hardly anyone in the whole wide world, who has failed to notice or who is unaware of the problem in respect of this matter under discussion here this afternoon; we have no doubt about that. I think there is not a great deal about which we shall differ with the hon. member for Orange Grove. It was interesting for us to listen to the outline he gave us of this matter, seen against the background of the six levels on which pollution can take place in a world such as that in which we are living. But he will pardon us for making this one remark, i.e. that the wording of his motion creates the impression in our minds that it may be somewhat negative. For that reason we <span class="col_3737-3738" refersTo="page_0527"/>want to move an amendment at this stage, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House places on record its appreciation for the steps being taken by the Government and other bodies to utilize our natural resources judiciously and to combat those factors which affect them detrimentally&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In other words, we realize full well that problems do exist in this connection, but we cannot fail to place on record our appreciation of the steps being taken by the Government and related bodies in combating this problem.</p>

<p>Sir, unlike the hon. member for Orange Grove who conducted a detailed discussion with us on this matter, I should like to leave you this afternoon with a few ideas of a more general nature in respect of this matter. Today we realize, of course, that the strange phenomenon of man revolting against his own technological skill and ingenuity, is revealing itself. However, paradoxical this may sound, it is a fact of which we must take cognizance here this afternoon. The piles of reports, and the writings and publications to which the hon. member for Orange Grove referred are constantly growing higher. They make interesting reading, and we also found it interesting to listen to the hon. member here this afternoon. But these reports show us&#x2014; or this seems to be the case&#x2014;that there is a backlog as regards our knowledge of combating this problem of pollution. Although a great deal of attention has been given to this problem it seems to us at times as though there also is a backlog in applying the knowledge we already have at our disposal. My concern is not so much with the dangers of pollution. To me the greatest threat is to be found in our possibly being too late to combat those dangers. For that reason I want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister of Planning, in contrast to the plea of the hon. member for Orange Grove for the establishment of a separate ministry, to consider in collaboration with the C.S.I.R., the Human Sciences Research Council and the universities, the establishment of an expert task force for conducting an investigation in depth into this whole matter. What is needed is, in my modest opinion, not so much a description of the situation as a programme of action, one which will have to be adapted constantly to circumstances as they may develop.</p>

<p>What I should like to emphasize is that with a view to preventing pollution research in the field of the human sciences is as important as research in the field of biophysics. We cannot do the one without the other. If the necessary liaison existed between the bodies to which I have referred, so as to enable us to cause the research into this matter to go smoothly, and so as to enable us to add to the knowledge we have in this regard, we shall be able, with the Department of Planning as co-ordinating body, to achieve success in this connection. We shall adopt the attitude throughout, of course, that pollution and the protection of our natural resources are indissolubly connected to each other. We see the problem against this background.</p>

<p>The fact that we have to make haste in taking interim measures is as clear as a pikestaff. At the moment we are pleading for a research task force, as I have called it, but it is clear that we are compelled to take interim measures. For that reason we also want to express our gratitude for what has been done by the Government and those bodies to which the hon. member for Orange Grove referred. However, we have no doubt that we shall have to progress much further along this road. If need be, existing legislation will have to be amended at an early date and on more than one occasion so as to adapt it to the problems as they present themselves. It is true that as yet there still is no crisis in respect of this matter here in the Republic. Consequently we still have an opportunity, thank God, of taking timeous steps now to enable us to avert a crisis in the time we still have at our disposal. We must not discuss pollution because it is a popular topic for discussion today. We should rather proceed in a planned fashion to finding solutions. This is something about which I feel very strongly and which I should like to underline when I say we shall have to proceed to drawing up a comprehensive programme of action. We must refrain from playing politics with this matter and we are pleased that the hon. member for Orange Grove also resisted this temptation this afternoon. I say we must not play politics with this matter, but should rather exert ourselves in the interests of an investment for the future of having our people live in a pollution free country. For that, for that investment of having our people live in a <span class="col_3739-3740" refersTo="page_0528"/>pollution free country, we need the assistance of all our people. We must endeavour not only to look after the heritage we are going to leave behind, but even to improve that heritage, if possible.</p>

<p>In the course of the seventies we shall have to make an evaluation of the future. However, difficult it may be, in the course of the seventies we shall have to make an evaluation of the years lying ahead so that on the basis of the knowledge we shall gain along the lines I have indicated, we shall be able to manage and protect our environment in such a way that the heritage we shall ultimately leave behind will be one of quality. This, I think, is a task we shall have to tackle with might and main. Therefore we want to emphasize that all bodies will have to co-operate in achieving this end. In addition to this we realize that institutional arrangements will have to be made, but we shall have to know soon what the nature of these arrangements must be, and this information we can only obtain when we have the necessary knowledge at our disposal. When we do have the necessary knowledge at our disposal we shall in all probability be able to bring this about. Consequently the basis of my plea is to order and improve the quality of our life as a community to such an extent that it will have as a natural by-product the prevention of pollution as well as the preservation of our resources. I am truly convinced of our ability to succeed in achieving this without its being necessary for us to create a separate ministry for this purpose. If we can succeed in involving and obtaining the co-operation in this matter of the bodies to which I have referred, bodies such as the C.S.I.R., the Human Sciences Research Council and our various universities, I do not have any doubt in my own mind that we shall succeed, on the basis of our evaluation of the future and the knowledge we shall then have at our disposal, in producing something fine and good in this direction and leaving our generations to come a heritage of quality.</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Smithfield has made a reasoned and valuable contribution to the discussion on this motion. It is perhaps a pity that he should have moved an amendment in the form in which it has been submitted, in that the amendment fails to recognize the essential and desperate urgency of the situation which faces South Africa, and other countries in the world today, as far as pollution is concerned.</p>

<p>I, today, am particularly concerned with the pollution and the control of our marine environment. In this connection I would like to quote a brief comment which was made by Gaylord Nelson, a United States senator, when introducing a Bill in the Senate. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">I am introducing legislation today which, in its broadest terms, is a human survival act. Its concern is the pollution of our lakes, and now of our seas, a situation which poses dangers to the future of the human race that rank with those posed by the threats of nuclear war.</block>

<p>We in South Africa are in the position where we can still have a lesser Bill, before the actual threat of pollution has become a reality. The cost of eliminating pollution might, otherwise, be so much more serious. Another noted scientist in America, Prof. Epel, has come to two significant conclusions. The first is that the oceans are beginning to die from chemical pollution; the second&#x2014;even more disturbing&#x2014;is that nothing is being done about it. Very few people know about it and no one is watching the world. In our coastal zones, which stretch from the icy Atlantic waters of South-West Africa, to the Indian Ocean around our shores, we have a coastal continental shelf which harbours virtually all the rich sea life around us. Beyond that continental shelf the oceans are virtually deserts. It is in this limited area that we harbour the sea life which provides for the food sources of the generations which will come after us. We are fishing out these areas and we are polluting them. Reference has been made to the chemical pollution, and the pollution by radio-isotopes, which are draining from our land to our rivers and into our oceans. The seas today are a fragile environment which is capable of destruction and once destroyed, cannot easily be rehabilitated. I would like to remind hon. members that our oceans today may be regarded as the toilets of the world. They are easily polluted and there is no plug to drain that toilet. In the case of our rivers, water can be refreshed by rainfall, but when our seas are polluted, civilization itself fails.</p>

<p>The threat of DDT is so serious today that our marine life, with its food chains, is <span class="col_3741-3742" refersTo="page_0529"/>witnessing the poisoning of the micro-marine life through to the fish and on to the birds. It has been found that the seals in the Antarctic, and the Arctic Eskimoes themselves, are suffering from poisoning by DDT. I would like to make one short comment which is indicative of the seriousness of the situation as far as human life is concerned. Researchers in America have pointed out that right now in the human milk of our young mothers there is from three to ten times more pesticide residue than the Government will allow in cows&#x2019; milk meant for human consumption. This is the nature and the seriousness of the problem that confronts us.</p>

<p>Visibly we are all conscious of contamination of the sea through oil. We have had the experience of the Wafra. A few months previously we could have had the experience of the Kazimah, which went ashore on the rocks off Robben Island. Fortunately, it was empty.</p>

<p>We then have the occurrence of pollution by chemicals. The chemicals that drain into the sea remain there and are building up their substance and are becoming more and more powerful, so that they are today a global problem. The radio-active isotopes that we can expect when we have our nuclear thermal power station, again, will drain from the atmosphere into the ocean and create a further threat. It is said that man is the only creature who persistently and consciously dumps his garbage into his drinking water.</p>

<p>There is one particular problem that I should like to raise today. It is in connection with the aftermath of the Wafra disaster. It is the strange case of a Mrs. Hutchinson and her concern with the saving of the coastal birds which became oil-contaminated after that disaster. Mrs. Hutchinson, through her own endeavours, obtained from the owners of the Wafra, some 10 000 dollars in order to assist in the restoration of the health and the saving of these birds. She has been puzzled by an inability to know just what agency to approach in order to translate this magnificent financial gesture of the owners of the Wafra into a physical asset that would help the birds. Because of the fact that there is no particular agency concerned with this matter at the moment, she has had no success to date. Her concern is that there should be an authority capable of understanding the nature of the problem. Medically and scientifically it is not merely a matter of washing the birds in a solvent and returning them to their habitat. It has been said in America that of all the birds that have become contaminated through oil, very few ever live more than a month or two after their return to nature because we do not yet understand fully the scientific recipe and remedy for restoring these birds to their natural state. Her thought was that there could possibly be created a nature reserve in a salt water area where these birds could be watched and fed and cared for until they ultimately do recover. Mrs. Hutchinson feels that this salt water sanctuary would be of inestimable benefit in the future. She thinks, too, that we could possibly turn the Wafra episode to our benefit by regarding that particular disaster area as a scientific area for experiments that could now be closely watched. We know the marine life that was there before the stranding of the Wafra. We know the damage that was created by the contamination purely by oil and the solvents used to get rid of the oil. We should now, using our university expertise, be able to ascertain the extent of the damage, and over a period of two or three years be able to investigate the extent of resuscitation of marine life in that area. Mrs. Hutchinson&#x2019;s problem is: Who can act for her? It will be recalled that some time ago the Cape Provincial Administration relinquished its authority over the estuaries and semi-enclosed bays. As a result, its nature conservation team no longer has authority over the land just below the high-water mark. The Division of Sea Fisheries under the Department of Industries, however, regards the birds that are contaminated as not being its responsibility. There is in existence a small organization of well-meaning and hardworking persons working under the umbrella of the S.P.C.A. who have been tackling the problem of birds contaminated by oil in our immediate waters around the Cape Peninsula, but there is no overall organization that can tackle this problem a problem which is becoming more and more extensive as the spillage from tankers passing our shores from the Natal coast on their way to South-West Africa is becoming constant and continuous. It does not take a major disaster to illustrate that. There is oil spillage along most of our beaches, in most of our bays and in most of our estuaries. We feel, as has been stated, that the problem is an overriding one. It is not one department which is concerned with this, but every department. It is the life of our country that is <span class="col_3743-3744" refersTo="page_0530"/>at stake and it is no good our being able to shoot rockets to the moon if we are standing knee-deep in our own garbage. One only has to walk along our coastline today to see that the beaches of which we used to be proud, and which used to be a tourist asset, are so contaminated today and so disrupted that it is almost no pleasure to continue using those beaches as a major tourist asset. It is therefore my privilege and pleasure to support the motion.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall not follow up the hon. member for Gardens in the appeal he has made here except to say that I have every sympathy with and appreciation of the plea which is being made here. In the same spirit as that in which the hon. member for Smithfield acted, who was the first one to reply to the speech the hon. member for Orange Grove made in introducing this motion, I, too, want to say that I am grateful that a subject such as this has been raised for discussion in this House in this very year. We are aware of the fact that a similar motion was discussed in the Other Place 14 days ago or more. We are also aware of that special spirit which radiated from the speeches of all hon. Senators who participated in that debate. This afternoon I do not want to try to repeat in any way what was said in the Senate on this subject or what was published on this subject in recent times.</p>

<p>To me it is particularly fitting that in this year in the very last private motion of this session, this subject should be raised for discussion. It so happens that the tenth anniversary of the Republic will be celebrated in my constituency this year. The idea occurred to me whether this tenth anniversary might not be seized as an opportunity of instilling in our people in general an awareness not only of the dangers of pollution in respect of air pollution, water pollution, etc., but also of the dangers of what we may term general environmental pollution. I wondered whether our State President and other responsible persons and bodies might not make an appeal to our people on that occasion to continue preserving the beauty of our fine Republic, by refraining from acting as we have been acting in this country up to now. The hon. Senator Loock said it had struck him that when we in South Africa, who are lovers of sport, left Ellis Park, Loftus Versfeld or Newlands, we left behind such masses of litter. That litter has to be cleared away and we ourselves do not do that job but Bantu workers or Coloured workers do so. That actually makes one feel ashamed as a White person of the example one has set to others, to the non-White races as well. I also wonder whether this may not be an opportunity of taking a fresh look at the way in which our youth is being educated to preserve our environment and to refrain from polluting our environment.</p>

<p>This afternoon I should like to express a few ideas and make a few suggestions as to what may be done to educate our people more effectively in this regard and to make our people more aware of this problem so that we as proud South Africans may return from visits to other countries in Europe and think that our country is as clean and beautiful as those countries. In the first instance I wonder whether the time is not ripe for arranging a competition for our youth in this regard as well, just as major competitions are arranged so often for promoting the development of our youth in many other spheres. I have in mind especially the mathematics olympiad which has to prepare our children for this technological age. I wonder whether there is not a need, too, for bringing about a higher degree of competition amongst our schools as well as amongst our children as individuals. I do not think there is anything which grips the imagination of a child more than a competition. If there were to be a special reward, in whatever form, for the neatest boy or girl, not only in primary schools but also in high schools and if there were to be an award from the administrator of each province for the cleanest schoolgrounds in that particular province, I think these awards might be instrumental in gripping the imaginations of our young people, of those who have to follow us.</p>

<p>But I think we can go still further. In this decade which is now starting, we may perhaps create a spirit of competition also amongst the various towns and cities of South Africa. In this regard I should like to make an appeal to those people with philanthropic characteristics who have proved that they are prepared to donate large amounts and to give encouragement to others, in which respect they have rendered major services to our people, to let their philanthropic thoughts include possibly this subject of the prevention of the pollution of our environment as well. Competitions can be arranged for keeping clean not only our White towns but also <span class="col_3745-3746" refersTo="page_0531"/>our Coloured towns and villages. In addition, a competition may possibly be held amongst our Bantu towns and cities of the future. This is a problem which the individual cannot tackle on his own. It is a problem which every member of the community has to come to realize. No matter how well I might look after my own garden and home, it would be to no avail if my neighbours close to me did not display the same degree of cleanliness. For that reason I think we should create a community spirit amongst our people living together in towns and cities so that we may say with pride not only that we have inherited beautiful natural scenery but also that we have succeeded in preserving that natural beauty unspoiled.</p>

<p>However, one will not succeed in achieving the desired end only by means of such fine incentives. For that reason I think we shall also have to accept the modern trend which exists, i.e. that when punishment is meted out, that punishment should be seen as a means of educating people. We shall probably have to take another look at the various existing ordinances as well and at laws which may be passed for preventing the pollution of the environment. We should have to consider whether these laws and ordinances ought not to contain a provision in terms of which they may be used as correctives. We have already experienced that our magistrates sentence people who have been convicted of drunken driving to assist in the treatment of the injured in hospitals over week-ends. I wonder whether it would not be a fruitful idea if we as legislators in this country were to make an appeal to our magistrates and others who have to pass sentences to order people who have been convicted of damaging and polluting the environment to assist at sanitary works or other places and to assist those bodies whose task it is to keep our towns and cities clean.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should see this problem of combating pollution in an even broader light. I think we shall have to give all possible assistance to permanent bodies who have come into existence spontaneously so that those people who sacrifice their time and energy voluntarily may receive support in every respect. It is fitting that the Society for the Protection of the Environment came into existence in the very town in which thousands of our young people, both Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking, are studying, i.e. Stellenbosch. I think it is fitting that authors, lecturers, as well as people who are in the service of the State and even a person who is charged with the study of sea pollution in South Africa, should serve on the committee of that Society. I think it is our task as the Government to give our support in every possible way to this Society, in which these people are working on a voluntary basis and whose work we hope will be very fruitful in the future. In their newsletter, No. I of 1971, which has just been released, it is pointed out&#x2014;and I shall try to quote what they said, although in an abbreviated form&#x2014;that another form of pollution than those we know exists. The letter states. The onslaught of man on his environment does not consist only of the soiling of roads and beaches and the pollution of air, water and land, or the massive exploitation of the natural resources of the earth, but also, in its most subtle form, of rendering banal the landscape through the ugly constructions we erect. This newsletter goes on to point out that even our public corporations, such as Escom, which is doing a fine job of work in supplying the country with power, may possibly be injudicious in building large steel constructions, spoiling our environment to such an extent that that does violence to the aesthetic sense of people. For that reason we should perhaps take a wider view of this problem of pollution, one which goes beyond the pollution of our biotic factors and environment only and includes the problem of the pollution of the aesthetic sense of people. In this regard it will probably be the task of every local authority as well as that of the State, through its departments and its corporations, to ensure that the natural beauty, not only of the Boland, but also of all other beautiful areas of our country will not be spoiled by the injudicious siting of constructions which do not lend themselves to enhancing that beauty.</p>

<p>There is just one further aspect to which I should like to draw the attention. Recently an article was published in the <i>German Tribune Quarterly Review</i> of 18th February, 1971. The article was written by Dr. E. K. Scheuch and the title of the article is &#x201C;environmental protection and protection from the environment&#x201D;. The writer is a lecturer at the university of Cologne as well as the director of the Institute for Comparative Social Studies at that university. He points out that at the time when each country had to make a choice of the living standard it was going to have, its choice often was only to have a larger <span class="col_3747-3748" refersTo="page_0532"/>share of the world&#x2019;s trade. In addition he points out that these countries in the objectives they set themselves were often prepared to pay their own people too little so as to enable them to compete more effectively with the products of other countries. He goes on to say that in the world of today a new method of measuring the standard of living has come about, i.e. that what we call a standard of living does not consist of the things we can consume, not only of the material things we have earned through our labours, but that our standard of living is supplemented to a large extent by the environment and by the condition of the environment in which we are living. He also says that where we often attribute pollution to the fact that there may be too much of a profit motive on the part of our industries, that is not primarily the reason for pollution. Our industries through the wealth which they have created, have possibly placed mankind in a better position to pay for the measures of preventing pollution which would in any event have occurred. I think it is of particular interest to us in South Africa and to the Bantu states which we are assisting in their development to come to realize this truth, i.e. that industrial development does not necessarily mean that pollution of the environment will occur, but that the sooner such industrial development can be brought about so much the sooner those countries will be able to pay for combating a problem which would have arisen in any event because of over-population and the concentration of people in cities. I think we as South Africans will have to keep this aspect duly in mind, i.e. not purely and simply to blame material progress for the pollution which has occurred in our country as well, but rather to be grateful for this degree of industrial development we have already had, as that will enable us to find the massive amounts which will have to be spent in future on keeping our environment clean.</p>

<speech by="#van_z_cilli&#x00E9;">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Vasco on the level-headed and positive way in which he has addressed us on this serious problem. The pollution of the world has become an international problem which has necessitated the co-operation of all states. It is the duty of each government to take the necessary steps in its own country for combating this problem, which is threatening the future of mankind. International conferences are being arranged, and I should like to charge the hon. the Minister of Planning with ensuring that South Africans will be represented at those conferences to exchange ideas during the discussions and to assist in drawing up plans for combating this problem in South Africa. The problem causes the growth of ecological imbalance and the increasing pollution of the continent, i.e. the world or part of the earth; of the air, and of our waters, i.e. the sea and resources of fresh water. Because we regard it as being of such cardinal importance for these problems to be viewed in the proper perspective and to be approached in the correct way, I want to support the motion of my colleague, the hon. member for Orange Grove, and request the Government to effect the establishment of a ministry which will make this problem its exclusive task. With all due respect to the hon. the Minister of Planning and his efficient and hardworking staff, it is my contention that his department with its present set-up and in the midst of all the other tasks of planning resting on their shoulders, cannot possibly undertake the further task of combating pollution as well. We must follow the guidance we have been given in this regard by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries, by establishing a department which will concern itself exclusively with this matter.</p>

<p>Relatively speaking our problem, as compared to those of other highly developed and densely populated countries, is definitely less serious at the moment and this possibly gives us the opportunity of getting to the root of the evil sooner and of solving the problem more readily. At the same time it will cost us much less to solve this problem before it assumes gigantic proportions, and it will possibly do less damage, but in that case it is essential for us to set to work immediately.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, pollution is as old as civilization but it is now causing more anxiety in all industrial nations due to the population explosion and the rapid spread of technology. Advances in agricultural production and public health have lessened the two great constraints on population&#x2014; disease and hunger. Demographers believe that it took about 1 700 years from the beginning of the Christian era for the population of the world to double. One hundred and fifty years later, in other words, by about 1850, it had doubled once again. They now believe that in 35 years&#x2019; time <span class="col_3749-3750" refersTo="page_0533"/>the present population of the world will have been doubled. The problems of pollution are clearly correlated to the problems of increasing populations and accelerating technological changes.</p>

<p>Human activities have contributed significantly to air pollution, mainly by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil products. To mention a few instances, the smoke emitted by industry, railways and private homes; and pollutants emitted by road vehicles. To these we must add man&#x2019;s increasing building and agricultural activities which have raised the dust content of the atmosphere. There are also forest fires, and here again man must bear the responsibility to a large extent today Then there are high-flying jet planes emitting streams of vapour. These activities have released quantities of dust, fine ash and water vapour into the air. We all know that the air is certainly more hazy and dusty around, and in urban and industrial areas and, as my colleague has pointed out, already constitutes a flying hazard to pilots. Smoke emitted from chimneys of houses and not too modern industries hangs at a low level and coal smoke is known to aggravate respiratory diseases. The effects of smog on the human body have not been fully evaluated but may have a bearing on the incidence of. for instance, lung cancer.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere as a waste product of animal and plant respiration through the decomposition of living tissue, but man&#x2019;s contribution by burning fossil fuels has, as I pointed out previously, added significantly to this problem. It is interesting to note that in 1890 the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere was around 290 parts per million; in 1969 it had risen to 320 parts per million. That is to say, since 1890 the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere had increased by about 10 per cent, and half of this rise took place since 1945. If the present rate of increase is maintained the carbon content of the atmosphere could be about 365 p.p.m. by the turn of the century. Scientists have estimated that this may result in the warming of the atmosphere by 0.1 or 0.2 degrees centigrade, which is not rated significant or dangerous.</p>

<p>As far as the long term is concerned, however, the United States Council of Environmental Quality has pointed out that if all the fossil fuels in reserve on earth are burnt, the average temperature may be affected, by an increase of from two to three degrees centigrade. Of course, if this were to happen, considerable areas of the Polar ice-cap would begin to thaw, with a consequent rise in the sea-level, which may be catastrophic for large parts of the civilized world. On the other hand, dust particles and water vapour cause a reduction in the temperature of the world, which contradicts the expectations of the scientists, to which I referred previously. The fact of the matter is, however, that pollution of the air is a health hazard, and every body agrees that something must be done about it. We know that in America the Government has instituted stringent measures to combat the emission of smoke or fumes from exhausts. Everybody will agree that the smoke from diesel vehicles is most offensive. The South African Government has not thought it necessary, up to this stage, to institute these stringent requirements regarding the emission of fumes from exhausts, but I think that the time has come when we should give these matters our very serious thought. Perhaps we, too, should institute measures which will make it obligatory for the motor industry to conform to certain laid-down standards. At the same time the pollution of the air by our industries must be limited and, if possible, eliminated before the problem escapes solution.</p>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the outset I want to say that I appreciate the ideas expressed by the hon. member for Vasco with regard to the special role which the Republic Festival can play in this particular connection. Without going into the full proposals made by him, it may be interesting if I confirm that certain youth organizations, <i>inter alia,</i> the Voortrekkers and the Scouts will be used during the Festival to perform one particular function. That is to see that those grounds will be cleaned and seen to after each item. Apart from the fact that the grounds will be kept neat and attractive, I believe a very important lesson to our youth is contained in that active participation in cleaning those grounds.</p>

<p>I feel inclined to say to the hon. member for Orange Grove, &#x201C;I am pleased to meet you. We have not met before&#x201D;. I have never heard the hon. member discussing any subject so realistically and topically. It is evidently true that one improves with time. I, and in this view I associate myself with all hon. members, am of the opinion that it is very important <span class="col_3751-3752" refersTo="page_0534"/>for a discussion of this issue to take place in a particularly realistic atmosphere. In my opinion it emphasizes a general awareness and a growing consciousness of the dangers which arise from the injudicious use of our resources and its consequent by-product, i.e. the pollution such use causes in various fields. I think the most important thing which has flowed from the discussion up to this stage is that this problem does not reveal itself in limited fields only, but that it is as wide as the prismatic fullness of South African life itself. And for that reason it is obvious to me that in combating this problem it is not sufficient merely to state the problem, that it is not sufficient to deal with or to combat the adverse effects but that it is necessary, I think, to look at these problems analytically in order to establish their cause, in order to establish the cause of the misuse of resources, and in order to establish the cause of the various forms of pollution which do exist and to which hon. members referred. I am pleased, and I mean this seriously, that the hon. member for Orange Grove made a positive contribution to the debate in motivating his motion and that he did not adopt an attitude of criticizing any failure or any alleged failure to cope with problems.</p>

<p>But I should like to associate myself with the idea of the hon. member on this side who moved the amendment, as this amendment, as far as I am concerned, actually penetrates to the essence of the issue, i.e. the judicious use of our resources in their abundance. It also penetrates to the steps which have to be taken in order to combat, or at least to reduce, the adverse effect of pollution. For that reason I believe that we cannot discuss the issue with which both the motion and the amendment deal, in a vacuum. I think it is essential for us to see this issue against the background of the causes which have given rise to it. As we are moving from a technological age into a super-technological age. it is becoming increasingly clear that what is having the most adverse effect on the natural resources of our country and on those of any other country is in point of fact man and the process of providing for his needs. It is true that industrial development and the concentration of large masses in urban areas must obviously be contributory factors to this problem. What we should bear in mind, however, when we want to deal with or combat pollution as such, is that we are actually coping with the adverse effects thereof, whereas I personally believe that our first step must be to prevent pollution, because prevention remains the most effective method under all circumstances as it anticipates the problem by preventing it.</p>

<p>For that reason I feel that there is only one effective method of actually dealing with the question of maintaining the balance between man and his environment. I am aware of the fact that all of us on the various levels of government, at central level, at provincial level and at local level, and, as the hon. member or Vasco rightly remarked, at the personal level as well, are engaged in some way and in some field in dealing with part of the problem. But I do not believe that this problem in its wide scope can be confined to localities. Nor do I believe that it can be confined to provinces. I believe this problem to be of national scope. I think here we are in agreement with hon. members who participated in this debate. I believe that it is essential that administrations, local authorities and private organizations and bodies should have an essential role to play in implementing the results of what I believe ought to be environmental research.</p>

<p>The actual plea I want to deliver this afternoon is that we should get to the root cause of the problem, and I believe that environmental research has become an urgent necessity in our country and that such research can only be undertaken at a national level. We must not forget nor have any illusions about the fact that the problems we have to combat are the result of progress. It is necessary in this country, as indeed in any other country, to have industrial development. In this connection we shall also have to have regard to the fact that the existing pattern of industrial development carries in itself an element which in turn contributes to this particular problem. It is that our industrial development up to this stage has to a great extent gone hand in hand with the urbanization of our population, as has happened in other countries as well. In our own country that has resulted in the crowding together of large masses of people in a limited number of cities. This has happened without regard having been had to the adverse effects of this type of development.</p>

<p>For that reason I believe that in our total planning idea there should be an element of controlled development. But much <span class="col_3753-3754" refersTo="page_0535"/>more than this, I believe that this principle, i.e. the principle of decentralized development, should be maintained to a much larger extent and at an accelerated rate, so that we may reduce the concentration of people and of vehicles, all contributory factors to the creation of these problems. I believe that growing prosperity, if it is uncontrolled, will not always necessarily be a source of spiritual happiness to us, apart from the material benefits it brings along. I think the answer is to be found in striking a balance between the benefits of both. Therefore I believe the idea of decentralized development of industries ought to enjoy specific emphasis.</p>

<p>Our urban development plays an equally important role and for that reason planning in respect of the physical development in our cities also becomes terribly important. For that reason the protection of nature in this country and of the soil of this country becomes of the greatest importance. For that reason it is with gratitude that one takes cognizance of the growing awareness, particularly in our rural communities, in our farming communities, of the value of your soil. For that reason I believe that the decade in which we are living is known, as far as this facet is concerned, as the decade in which the soil conservation idea has been taken to a zenith. Consequently it is true that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is playing an extremely important role in this connection, but the Department would not have been able to do so unless a general awareness existed of the value of saving our soil. I believe that a comprehensive study of environmental factors is not only necessary but may also lead us to a new evaluation of the value and use of soil and of the importance of water and the use of water. This may result in a new approach on our part in respect of urban planning, in respect of industrial development and particularly in respect of laying out and siting industries. In this particular connection I agree with Dr. Kuschke who delivered a serious plea in favour of the idea of creating new cities, in favour of the idea of rebuilding old cities or rebuilding old cities in part. I think the principle of the optimum size of a city is becoming more and more important.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should therefore like to leave in our midst the particular idea that the answer is not to be found in the establishment of a ministry for dealing with this matter. I believe that our research should not, in the first instance, be focussed on combating evils but that our environmental research should, in the very first instance, be focussed on effective planning whereby these problems can be eliminated. For that reason I believe that the hon. the Minister of Planning may fruitfully investigate the idea of a national council which can undertake the research studies in respect of environmental factors and which can advise him and the other bodies and the local authorities with regard to implementing such research.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the outset I should like to congratulate the hon. member for Orange Grove and, indeed, all the speakers who have taken part in this debate this afternoon on the excellent contributions they have made on a most interesting subject. The hon. member for Orange Grove, in particular, should be congratulated for the very wise way in which he presented his case to this House this afternoon.</p>

<p>One wonders why we, the inhabitants of our world, allow nature to be desecrated and spoilt by man himself. Man does this in his attempt to make life more comfortable for himself. And in doing so, he not only despoils the riches of nature, but is turning nature into a slum. He himself will have to live in that slum.</p>

<p>Land is allowed to be overstocked. It is allowed to be overgrazed. It is laid bare and trodden into dust. If it is not blown away by the winds, it is washed into the sea by our rivers when the rains come. Mountain sides are torn away for roads and railways. Vegetation is uprooted, trees are destroyed; shrubs are not replanted. We have seen fertile fields and lands used for housing projects. This is all necessary to our living. But we are not doing anything, as far as I know, to replace that which we are taking away. The good earth supports all growth, whether it be man or plant or tree or animal. These things all develop and multiply and feed on the good earth and make use of the good earth. But the earth itself does not have the privilege of multiplying itself. The demand on it is increasing more and more. The world does not get bigger: if anything, it shrivels, while it has to support a growing population, which is already virtually bursting through its seams. The land is our greatest asset, but unfortunately we keep on abusing it, and the scientists who are <span class="col_3755-3756" refersTo="page_0536"/>helping man to live in an easier and a more comfortable way, are contributing indirectly towards the destruction of the land. It is not only the scarring of man&#x2019;s environment with which we have to concern ourselves; we have to concern ourselves also with the scarring of man himself. If we do not take heed of that now, it may soon be too late to do anything about it. The use of coal, oil, detergents, pesticides, drugs, radiation and thousands of other things that are being brought into our lives, leave their side-effects behind. It is the accumulation of these side-effects, each one different from the other, which will cause that same scientist who discovered what we might have thought was a boon to life, to have to find a way to get rid of the side-effects of the substance he has brought into being. This becomes a vicious circle and if we do not break the circle now, we soon might be too late. We can only do it by a comprehensive survey of what is happening. That survey should be done by a team of people and it should be headed by one man in the Government. That man must be a Minister, as has been suggested by the hon. member for Orange Grove. He should be the Minister of Environment.</p>

<p>To continue with the use of radio-active substances could lead to the destruction of cell structure, to creating mutations, to inhibiting growth, and in the future may even be the cause of a new type of man, a new race of men. That is one thing that may happen. We may find in the effects of radio-active substances the method to stop the population explosion which is taking place at the moment. We have seen the effects of radio-active substances. It could be from a slight burn on the wrist caused by a gold watch which has been made from a radium-containing holder, to the wiping out of a whole community, as we have seen during the last war when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by these elements. It is from the things that happened then that we have to learn how to prepare ourselves for the future. The demand for nuclear energy is going to increase. The electricity which we are using today, whether it comes from coal or water, will in the future be generated by nuclear power. This nuclear power is going to have to provide a hundred times as much electricity in 30 years as is being used at the moment. Then we will be faced with the question of what to do with the effluents. What are we going to do with it? Are we going to allow these effluents to run into the sea or are we going to run them into holes in the ground which nature has provided? Are we going to bury it in containers under 60 metres of soil or are we going to let it just run away into the sea? Are we going to allow the plankton and the fish and everything that lives in the sea to be destroyed? Who is going to guide not only the use and the distribution of the substances that cause the side effects, but also the question of what we are going to do with those side-effects themselves? Nature is helping to the best of her ability. She tries to grow shrubs and grass over the scars that we made, by wind dispersal of seed.</p>

<p>Consider what has happened with DDT. A new substance was brought into being and was going to be the salvation of the agricultural world. Pests were going to be destroyed. Millions of insects died through DDT, but the last laugh was with the insects. We, man, found it was doing just as much harm to the human being as it did to the insects. We had to call the fight off. We had to go and look for other substances. We will soon find that those substances are upsetting the insect life that we depend on. Fortunately, I think, man has never been able to destroy completely any species of insect life. They always continue. That may be a good thing, because it may help us to keep living. But if we want to see what happens as a result of our attempts to produce more and more, we just have to look at some of our chicken farms. For example, where there is a farm of 100 000 battery chickens on the go, they produce as much manure and waste as a village of 15 000 people. It is hard to believe that a farm with 100 000 chickens, which chicken farmers, I think, consider a small farm, is producing as&#x2019; much manure as a village of 15 000 people. What is going to happen? How are we going to distribute this? Who is going to take charge? That is why I say that the time has come for us to take note of what the hon. member for Orange Grove has said here today.</p>

<p>We must at our very first opportunity, institute a ministry that can take care of the matter. It is no good doing this in half measure. We have to have a team of people who are experts and will keep learning what to do. We cannot have a disjointed organization. We must have control through it. As much as we want to eat and live, we have to find ways and <span class="col_3757-3758" refersTo="page_0537"/>means of getting rid of our disposals. The whole trend today is to make objects which do not last. Instead of a good bottle, we have a plastic container. Instead of having a good piece of porcelain, we have a piece of ceramic. The porcelain lasts&#x2014; the ceramic crumbles and breaks and we have to get rid of it. It may be easy to do. Perhaps it was easy to get rid of the bottles in the old days. Today, if one sees an old soda water bottle with a marble in it, it is a piece of furniture. It is an antique, you put it on your mantlepiece. Are we going to be able to do that with a plastic container that holds a liter or half a liter of beer? I do not know what is going to happen in the future, but I know that if we do not do something soon to control all this, we are going to land in a mess which we are making for ourselves.</p>

<speech by="#van_eck">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the old mining areas and in the industrial areas of the East Rand we have, in particular, the problem of chemical pollution. On the East Rand one finds numerous small and larger lakes which have been polluted to such an extent by cyanide and other chemical substances that today they are absolutely sterile and without any forms of life. There are no fish in the water, and there are no birds in the rushes; there is no life there; and there is virtually no use for those dams. One even finds that the water in those dams is so poisonous that they cannot even be used for boating. In particular we also have the problem of hydrochloric acid, which is manufactured by industries and which pollutes the streams and dams in that vicinity. The entire Witwatersrand has problems with hydrochloric pollution. All companies manufacturing galvanized sheet, steel and even wire, use hydrochloric acid. After the use of brine for these purposes, it eventually becomes spent and weakened and has to be dumped. It is estimated that annually more than 10 000 tons of this brine is being used on the Witwatersrand as a whole. This waste brine then has to be replaced by new hydrochloric acid in order to continue the process, and this waste hydrochloric acid is polluting our pans and smaller lakes. It is even being dumped in our sewerage systems and causes serious pollution in our streams. There is an industry which can re-use, regenerate and reclaim this spent hydrochloric brine. Woodall Duck-ham South Africa (Pty.) Ltd. has been conducting negotiations with all users of hydrochloric acid on the Witwatersrand for the reclamation of this chemical substance, on condition that they can persuade these industries to co-operate. They want this industry to be in production as soon as January, 1972. They are able to reclaim for re-use approximately 98 per cent of the hydrochloric acid, which would mean a tremendous saving and would also assist in meeting this problem of pollution. However, the problem is that this process is a quite expensive one and that it will cost approximately R350 000 to establish the industry itself. Consequently it is essential to obtain the co-operation and the collaboration of all the users of hydrochloric acid on the Witwatersrand. It has already been found that a great number of the major enterprises and companies which are under pressure from the Department of Water Affairs, are willing to co-operate, but there are numerous smaller companies and enterprises which do not see their way clear to co-operating or are unwilling to do so. I should like to request that the Department of Water Affairs bring more pressure to bear on these smaller companies and industries in order to persuade them to take part and share in this scheme and by doing so to make it really economic and worthwhile. I also want to request the Department of Water Affairs to bring pressure to bear on some of the major service companies, such as Iscor and Sasol, which are responsible for a great deal of pollution and are apparently escaping to a large extent the pressure brought to bear by the Department of Water Affairs. We on this side of the House feel that the Department of Water Affairs should provide companies with advice and assistance on the way in which they may overcome the problem of sewerage pollution. We are aware that at present the Department of Water Affairs is probably the best informed body in regard to combating chemical pollution in effluent. They have sent officials abroad, and we know that they are doing their best to combat this problem, but we have also been told that these officials have apparently been forbidden to help industries and to give active advice on how they are to meet this problem. I realize that their time is probably being taken up by the vastness of this problem, so much so that they do not have the time to perform that task as well. But a great number of these industries find that they cannot incur those costs; that they do not have the knowledge to overcome this problem. We know that the manufacturing industry cannot consult private <span class="col_3759-3760" refersTo="page_0538"/>consultants anywhere, for at present there are no private consultants for surmounting this problem. The Water Research Commission ought to have a sewage and effluent section for research into the possibilities of treating and improving these polluted waters. There should also be tax relief, as has already been asked for by hon. members on this side, for research and installations for waste water control. The major service companies possibly have such facilities, which they or the board may make available to the private smaller companies.</p>

<p>Sir, one of the most involved and extensive sectors of environmental pollution has to my mind been caused in the biological sphere through man himself. This is taking place all over the country today. We see how, through the act of man, weeds were imported into the country many years ago. Here we are thinking of khaki bush, blackjacks, thorn-apple, the Mexican poppy, not even to mention the proclaimed weeds such as cocklebur, the spiny cocklebur and jointed cactus. The Department of Agriculture is powerless to combat this problem, and we have seen how these weeds have been spreading along the banks of the Vaal and the Orange, and it seems as though this problem is gradually becoming more and more extensive. Here in the Peninsula and in the Western Province there are various shrubs as hakea, rooikrans and black-bark, which are crowding out and ousting our natural indigenous vegetation, and we also see that apparently the authorities cannot control this problem in any way.</p>

<p>In large parts of the Karoo and in the Eastern Province the green-thorned prickly pear caused a tremendous pest in the past. We tried to combat it through biological measures such as importing <i>cactoblastis cactorium</i> and cochineal, and today we find that that biological agent has in turn become a pest here in South Africa. It attacks our thornless green-leafed prickly pear, which is being planted for economic reasons to serve as fodder for the stock industry in times of drought.</p>

<p>In Australia biological problems have also assumed tremendous proportions. Over there the rabbit pest has assumed such tremendous proportions that they have tried to allow the dingo dogs or wolves to increase in order that this pest may be controlled. Instead of the one destroying the other, they have found today that they are saddled with two problems, the rabbits and the dingo dogs. Man has disturbed the delicate balance of nature, and today we see signs of the human rape of our environment above us and around us.</p>

<p>Chemical agents for agricultural purposes can also cause tremendous problems. These agents are in daily use in large quantities, often without the necessary control. They are of great economic value, but are disturbing the delicate balance of nature. There are weed and plant killers, insecticides, rodent and predator killers, which can contaminate the entire environment. There are more than a thousand formulae and compounds. In the United States more than 100 000 million pounds are being used every year. In Peru these repeated sprayings of insecticides on cotton lands have resulted in the original pest being stamped out but also in six other pests being added to aggravate the position. In Malaya the same thing happened in the cocoa trees, where they sprayed the insect pests with insecticides, with the result that numerous other pests made their appearance there since the natural enemies of those insects had to a large extent been reduced in number and stamped out through the use of these insecticides. Here one is thinking in particular of insects such as wasps, which were destroyed by these insecticides. These insecticides, if used unsystematically, land in the rivers and kill our fish, as has already happened here in South Africa at numerous places. In the vicinity of Douglas, thousands of fish died in the Vaal River at one stage owing to the presence of insecticides in the water. Sir, it has already been mentioned here that certain insecticides such as DDT have the nasty habit of accumulating in the fat and in the tissues of man and of mammals. In the</p>

<p>U.S.A. the insect-eating birds started dying in large numbers owing to the high concentrations of DDT in the insects. Birds of prey in several parts of the world have started laying shell-less eggs and are threatened with certain death owing to the use of insecticides. Owing to the fact that DDT and other agents collect in the food chains, we find that a tremendous accumulation is taking place and that the problem will eventually reach tremendous proportions. Here in South Africa the average human being has eight parts of DDT per million in his body tissue. In the U.S.A. this has already risen to 12 parts of DDT per million in the fat and tissue of human beings. Initially they considered DDT to be relatively harmless, but new research has <span class="col_3761-3762" refersTo="page_0539"/>proved that DDT may in fact accumulate in the liver, cause abscesses as well as malfunctioning, which may eventually cause death. Russia has already banned DDT, and so have the Argentine, Hungary and also Sweden. I think that South Africa should seriously and strongly consider banning this dangerous insecticide here as well.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should very much like to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for the discussion that has taken place today. I want to assure them that to my mind they made sound and constructive contributions, and I want to thank them for and congratulate them on these contributions. Each of them&#x2014;some more so than the others&#x2014;put forward valuable suggestions, and I shall definitely avail myself of them in the report I have to draw up for the Cabinet on the whole question of pollution in South Africa. In a moment I shall refer to that again. Furthermore, I am pleased that this discussion did take place, for I think that it will also assist in making our public outside more conscious of their environment and in making all of us more conscious of what our obligations are towards our environment. I think that this was the case, the more so because the discussions this afternoon were so unanimous. I think one can say that, on this very important matter, Parliament spoke to the country today with one voice. The general discussion was, therefore, quite unanimous.</p>

<p>There is one matter on which there seems to be some difference of opinion between us. This is the matter which the United Party put forward without qualification, by saying that they are now announcing officially that they are in favour of a new and a separate Ministry for the Environment. I shall deal with the merits of that suggestion later on. I want to say at once that to a certain extent it strikes me as being strange that the United Party raised this matter this afternoon. Why did they not make it known last year, when they made their booklet on policy available to the country? Why did they not say to South Africa at that stage, &#x201C;In respect of this very important development which is taking place in the world, and which is, almost like wildfire, making the people conscious of their environment, we are advocating a department for the environment&#x201D;? I also find it strange that this announcement was not made by the Leader of the United Party himself. Earlier this year he had the opportunity here in the House of Assembly to inform the country on this matter. I assume that in a fortnight&#x2019;s time he will once again take part in a debate, and he would then have been able to state the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint on this very important matter. It seems strange that this announcement was left to an ordinary member of the United Party.</p>

<from>*The. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p><i>&#x00C0; propos</i> of that remark it seems even stranger to me, for they have now used a &#x201C;future&#x201D; Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to make an announcement on a future department for the environment. The only reason which the United Party advanced for this announcement, was that there had to be a greater measure of co-ordination. I now call the House to witness that in the entire discussion this afternoon there was not one member on the other side who said what kind of co-ordination there had to be. None of them said that there was a common element in oil pollution at sea, pollution of the Vaal River, the spraying of insecticides to control locusts, the gases emitted by motor cars in our cities and the noise they make. None of them said that there was a common element in all these forms of pollution, and that we had to have co-ordination for that reason. They merely said that there had to be co-ordination. However, they did not put the question of whether there might be more effective forms of co-ordination. They simply said that there has to be a new, separate ministry, over and above the Ministry of Planning. My reaction is that I am not in favour of that. Of course, it is not for me to give the decision. It does not rest with me. It rests with my Leader the hon. the Prime Minister, and this matter will in due course receive his attention, but my personal, first reaction is that I am not in favour of it.</p>

<p><span class="col_3763-3764" refersTo="page_0540"/>This matter has many aspects which we shall have to thrash out thoroughly before we can say whether we are going to establish a new ministry. I think the hon. member for False Bay has quite rightly pointed out that one uses water in South Africa, and who other than the Department of Water Affairs is to say how water should be conserved or distributed and how much everybody should get, etc.? And how is one going to entrust other people with the incorrect use of water and this department, in turn, with the correct use of water? After all, this is simply inconceivable, and what is the pollution of water other than the incorrect use of water? A factory is now to go to another department with a water quota to ask how much water it may use. It is to say that the Department of Water Affairs granted it the right to use so many millions of gallons of water per day, but the other department is now to lay down the conditions subject to which it may use that quota of water. Another department is now to say how it is to return its purified or used water to a stream of water which, in turn, is controlled by the Department of Water Affairs for the whole of South Africa. Is the Department of Agriculture to go to this new Ministry and say: We have a locust plague here; may these toxic substances be used? These are the thoughts that enter one&#x2019;s mind.</p>

<p>My Department of Planning deals with the utilization of the soil of South Africa. This is physical planning, but whereas we are the umbrella department and whereas we are concentrating the utilization of the soil of South Africa by all the various bodies and trying to bring about regularity and order in this sphere, we are not a super department which does the work of other departments. We bring everything together. In a certain sense we are the consolidating, co-ordinating body. My personal opinion is that the utilization of the environment, as well as the incorrect utilization of the environment, can fall under one Ministry, but to my mind that ministry is the Ministry of Planning. Whether the Prime Minister is in due course going to call it the Ministry of Environment instead of the Ministry of Planning, is his right. But my first reaction is that one need not establish a separate, new department in South Africa for doing this work, for my basic premise is that one cannot separate the incorrect utilization from the correct utilization. One has to consolidate those matters under the same Minister and the same Department, and they have to watch over and regulate both of them, but another department could act as the umbrella body co-ordinating such matters, especially in regard to the research with which I shall deal in a moment.</p>

<p>In regard to the various aspects of pollution in South Africa, I am very much convinced that these problems are being attended to very satisfactorily at the moment. The hon. member for Orange Grove also said that he was not lodging any complaints against this matter; he said that these problems were being attended to satisfactorily. I was pleased to hear that, and this was confirmed by all the other hon. members; none of them criticized it. The Department of Industries with its whole oil pollution action at sea, is doing good work today. Whether it is now to remove those officials and place them in another department and whether the work will then be better, I do not know. It is obvious that one department should coordinate all oil pollution actions at sea. One cannot have one which does it in the Cape and another which does it in Durban. Furthermore, the Department of Industries has been charged with dealing with the effluent from factories into the sea, and through its Sea Fisheries Division it is doing research in this sphere. The Department of Industries also has the right to control our natural resources along our shores, such as crayfish, pelagic fish, white fish, etc. I think that it is doing this work very well.</p>

<p>The Department of Water Affairs simply cannot do the work connected with pollution, the incorrect utilization of our rivers and streams of water, more effectively than it is at present being done by this department. Admittedly, the research in this regard is being carried out by various bodies. In this matter the research in regard to the pollution of the sea is being carried out by the Sea Fisheries Division in the Department of Industries. Research is also being carried out on a provincial level, and at the University of Cape Town and <span class="col_3765-3766" refersTo="page_0541"/>possibly at the University of Natal as well. As we all know, such research is also being carried out in Port Elizabeth. We could bring about more co-ordination in this research and, perhaps, even consolidate it under one roof. The Department of Water Affairs has research projects which are being undertaken by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the National Institute for Water Research, in addition to which water research is also being carried out at one or two other places. The other day the Minister piloted through in this House an Act in terms of which he established a commission for water research. The funds which he will obtain by these means, will be used by him to initiate specific research projects in South Africa. I also think that the provinces and the local authorities are doing good work.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville referred to the refuse and waste material of the city councils. They have good methods for incinerating and destroying refuse. This could possibly be co-ordinated to an even greater extent, and research in this regard could be intensified. That I may grant. But a department cannot be established to take away from the provinces and the local authorities certain work which they are doing at present. That cannot be done. That is what is implied in the whole discussion we have heard from the other side today. The province, with all its facets, has certain instructions. On a certain occasion I paid a visit to the zoo here in Cape Town. A broken bottle, a mealiecob without any pips, a beer can and papers were lying about there. That is a matter which we should take up with the local city council, but the city council has in fact provided numerous refuse bins. Nor can the local city council afford to appoint a person to sit there day in and day out in order to see to it that people do not throw litter about. I do not want to exaggerate, and I must say that it was not very filthy, but these things and some papers were lying about. We must educate our public to assist the local authorities. To take this task away from the local authorities, will not solve our problem. We must educate the public to assist the local authorities in doing this in South Africa. If necessary, we should institute legal proceedings against members of the public, but we shall obtain their co-operation. We should start by making the children at school conscious of this problem. I am convinced that good work is already being done, but we should look into the matter and try to make the children more conscious of having to keep their surroundings clean. That is where we have to start.</p>

<p>Would countrywide legislation not be more effective?</p>

<p>I do not know whether it would be better for us to introduce country-wide legislation or to call in every province and to ask each of the Administrators whether his province has a law against it. The Administrator will say whether or not his province has such a law. If his province does not have such a law, then we as the umbrella department will tell him to make such a law. He will do it. If he says that his province has such a law, we will say that it is our wish that they should apply the law simultaneously. But they already said that they are willing to apply the law. I repeat that we could apply both methods, but we do not need a new department for doing so. As I have said, this is my first reaction.</p>

<p>Now, what has the Cabinet done? They have appointed a Cabinet committee to inquire into the whole question of pollution and, more or less, to carry out a survey of the whole terrain, of everything that is covered by it. Furthermore, they have to determine what forms of pollution are already being dealt with properly at present and what forms of pollution are as yet not being covered. Then they are to decide where such forms of pollution ought to be dealt with. Any recommendations which we wish to make on more effective co-ordination in respect of the real anti-pollution action and in respect of research, will be investigated by them. We are in the process of drawing up this report, a task that was entrusted to me by the Cabinet committee. When it has been prepared, it will be submitted to the hon. the Prime Minister, <span class="col_3767-3768" refersTo="page_0542"/>after which he will probably decide whether action should be taken. Everything I say here today, should therefore be regarded as my own views, be it in connection with a new department, a department with another name, wider terms of reference or only a co-ordination action for the future. Then, in regard to another matter which we discussed today, I want to say that to my mind we are discussing a very important matter today, namely what we are doing with the earth on which we are living and what we are doing with the natural resources at our disposal. Man and his environment, as was said by the hon. members, has become an important topic for discussion in our present-day lives. It is not only an important topic for discussion, but also a very topical one. But now there is something which is a source of fear to one, something which affects our entire continued existence on earth, i.e. that the greater the increase in the population of the world, the more urgently we become aware of the importance of making the best use of the gifts bestowed on us by the Creator, of retaining, preserving and replacing the gifts bestowed on us in so far as it is at all possible to do so. The more we increase in number, so much the more urgent it becomes for us to utilize and employ correctly the earth on which we live, work and move about. It is becoming clear to us that we must conserve, improve and beautify the soil and the environment, and that we must guard against the incorrect utilization of everything. It is becoming clear that we have to keep pure the air we inhale and the water we drink and spray over the plants which we are going to eat later on. In our time utilization, conservation and pollution have indeed given rise to a new international and national awakening to the problem, for in virtually every country this concept is taking root at present. Not only the earth, but also the great universe must remain a viable place for man to live in. This should also and in particular happen to South Africa, since it is our fatherland and the vehicle of our generations of the future. Out of its rich resources above and under-ground and in the sea, out of its veld and its trees, its rivers and its streams of water and the skies above, we must create a beautiful, happy and healthy place for all of us. The blue of our skies, the clearness of our seas, our vast and lonely flats and our eternal mountains should constantly remain to us and to our descendants the source of a fine, healthy and happy life on earth. Previous generations failed to notice the problem, if I may call it a problem. At that time it was not quite as real a problem as it is today, and especially the problem of pollution did not trouble them. The intensity of that problem was low; the world was open, wide and free; there was a great deal of space, with fresh air and clean water in plentiful supply. Their activities were relatively innocent, and nature had its own ways of restoring and purifying itself. The pace of living in those times was such that nature could still do so. Our generation, on the other hand, may not ignore this new situation, for it stares us in the face everywhere. In part this is the result of the tremendous increase in the world population, for, as has rightly been said here, after Christ it took 1 800 years before the first 1 000 million people inhabited the earth. It only took 80 years for the world population to increase by another 1 000 million people, and the next increase of 1 000 million people took place in only 40 years&#x2019; time. It has rightly been said that the 3 500 million people inhabiting the world at present, will be doubled in number within the next 30 to 35 years. Hand in hand with this urbanization is taking place in the world at roughly twice the rate of the increase in population. In order to provide for the spiritual and especially the material needs of this rapidly growing mass of people, people whose individual and collective needs are constantly changing in quality and increasing in number, man harnessed his scientific knowledge, his technological progress and his technical skill in order to start producing and to meet all needs. There were no limits to his resourcefulness and spirit of enterprise. Where a need did not exist, they created it. They successfully convinced man that he had to satisfy the need that had been created. Industrialization became the watch-word, the means for creating new riches and the basis for unprecedented economic activity. Chimneys started smoking and polluting the air everywhere; <span class="col_3769-3770" refersTo="page_0543"/>the factories extracted clean water from the rivers and replaced less clean water. The cities became bigger and bigger and did not know what to do with their refuse. Where possible, it was discharged in the sea. Of course, all these matters have already been attended to with a great measure of success; I merely mention them to indicate that this is the beginning of an entirely new dispensation on earth, in our country as well. Gigantic building projects were undertaken, roads were constructed, materials were required, and for that reason stone quarries were developed, the landscape was changed and disturbed. What course is the road to follow? Where is the stone quarry with its noise, dust and unsightliness to be situated? These are the questions that were asked. Motor vehicles and diesel engines started roaring down our streets. Tens of thousands of ships started sailing the seas and dumping their refuse in the sea. Everybody who wanted to get rid of anything, left it behind in the sea. Gigantic tankers conveyed the new fuel. Food had to be produced in large quantities.</p>

<p>Birds, and the other natural enemies of insects, were no longer able to combat pests and plagues rapidly enough. In many cases they were also killed in this process. Modern insecticides and sprays were diffused in the air in large quantities. When the bodies of Eskimoes and the fat of penguins in Antarctica were analysed, they were found to contain these toxic substances; they were found in the plankton in the middle of the ocean. The week before last we read about a large quantity of fish that was withdrawn from the market in Great Britain&#x2014;fish that was taken from the sea&#x2014;because it contained toxic substances which are dangerous when consumed by human beings.</p>

<p>We had to start utilizing our natural resources, the things that were in the created, natural environment, which were the legacy of the ages&#x2014;everything had to be employed in order to meet the growing needs of the growing world population. What nature built up over thousands of years, we exploited and exhausted in a matter of decades. We went further by not only using what was in nature, but also creating new compounds which had never been known to nature. We disturbed the balance of nature. On the farms we killed the ant-eaters and we were almost ruined by the ants. We killed the jackals which used to hunt for and eat the small of lynxes, and today the lynxes are ruining our stock farmers. We shot the lammergeyer, which catches the rock rabbits, because we imagined that it also caught lambs&#x2014;today we do not know what to do with all the rock rabbits. They are overflowing from the hills into the flats. By means of this poison we have almost exterminated the wagtails, which used to run around on our lawns, and today one sees far fewer wagtails than one did ten or twenty years ago. Nature has its own intricate processes through which it constantly seeks to restore the disturbed balance, the consequence of the actions of man, but these are slow processes. We consume and destroy at a faster rate than the rate at which nature can replace and restore things. What a mountain fire destroys in 24 hours&#x2019; time, takes nature years to restore. A stone quarry on the slopes of a mountain will take hundreds or thousands of years to become again as it was; for that reason we must locate it correctly and, if possible, plan it in such a way that we may at a later stage use it again for another purpose and convert it or, as a last resort, cover it up by planting trees. The soil in the mine dumps of Johannesburg we shall never again be able to return to the subterranean places from which it was removed; those mine dumps will remain above the surface for ever, but we can cover them up with vegetation or try to make something attractive or useful out of them. Some natural resources can never be replaced again. The iron ore and manganese which we extract, the coal, gold, diamonds and copper and the numerous other minerals have been removed for ever. There are no processes in progress in the earth for replacing them. For that reason they should be exploited and utilized in the most effective manner. We must watch over them as jealously as possible, for they do not only belong to us, but also to South Africa and to the future generations. Of course, there are certain factors which play <span class="col_3771-3772" refersTo="page_0544"/>a role in their exploitation, and technological development constantly enable us to extract more of them from the earth. A higher price owing to an increased demand results in the marginal profit line being brought down to lower ore grades, which are then exploited. Better and cheaper transports also have an effect on what can be exploited. In the same way there are other factors as well.</p>

<p>To a certain extent the soil of South Africa also constitutes one of our irreplaceable natural resources; what has been washed out to sea, will never be recovered. As an hon. member said, it takes 500 years to form one inch of topsoil. What has been built up and covered by cities and roads, remains lost for ever, and what is left should be utilized well and correctly by means of soil conservation and correct farming practices, such as stock withdrawal, etc. By means of physical planning, which is the work of my department, we should see to it that land is classified and distributed correctly and to the greatest advantage for the various activities of man. By means of nature conservation, parks and the protection of our mountains, catchment areas, rivers and streams we must conserve everything we have. The beauty of our country should be a precious possession to us. I could go on in this way, but I notice that time is marching on.</p>

<p>I just want to say it is a good thing that we are becoming conscious of our environment and the need to conserve and protect it against pollution. I want to make an appeal today that in this whole process we should retain our perspective. We must make our people conscious of their environment, but our consciousness and our object must be positive. One could point out negative things and things that are wrong, but what is done cannot be undone. The value of one&#x2019;s contribution lies in the constructive contribution one makes towards making a better and cleaner place of one&#x2019;s environment in all its facets; for the world must go on. Although progress and development have brought about many problems&#x2014;not only for us, but also for other countries&#x2014;we cannot condemn progress and development for that reason. The only thing is to make the best of it. The world must and it will go on. But as long as the divine spark kindles in man, he will strain and strive forward, the one this way and the other that way, but the masses of the earth must be fed, clothed and housed. Their ever-growing needs of working, living and playing must be met, and I suppose it is also correct that as long as we retain our balance, as long as we plan correctly, there is still salvation. It may perhaps be said that mankind will still grow itself to death, but I think that it will after all be better to be worn away than to rust away. For that reason I want to sound the warning that in this whole anti-pollution action we should strike a balance in our actions. Let us make our population conscious of the problem and let us activate them, one and all, both in the private and in the public sector, so that each of them may in his own field, no matter how small it is, render a positive contribution. What should not happen, is that this should provide all and sundry with a platform for levelling, after the event, criticism in an indiscriminate manner. There is no better place to start with than in our schools, and one is grateful for what has already been done. So much has already been done, but today I want to make another appeal to our people and beg all of us to try to make our contribution and to give a practical demonstration of our consciousness of our environment, even if it is only by keeping clean the place where we live or where we spend our holidays or where we spend a week-end. I want to ask our petrol companies, which spend so much money on many advertisements, which we regard as being unnecessary, to furnish their customers at their service stations with plastic containers which may be kept in their cars in order that our people may use those containers for disposing of their peels, papers and other litter.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei put two questions to me and drew an inference to which I am in duty bound to reply. His first question was whether any conditions were attached to the donation of R100 000 by the City Council of Johannesburg. Secondly he wanted to know whether I had given any consideration to where levy payments were going to be suspended. The inference he drew was that Johannesburg could not use levy funds anywhere except in Johannesburg because there was no homeland abutting on Johannesburg.</p>

<p>*As regards the R100 000, there is really no question of any conditions being attached to that. It is rather a question of a gentleman&#x2019;s agreement between that local authority and my department. I do not believe I can do any better than reading out what the position is in this regard. I am doing so because I do not want there to be any misunderstanding; as a matter of fact, there is no reason for any misunderstanding. When all the facts are known we shall be perfectly able to understand each other well. So let me read out the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Town Clerk on the 25th June, 1969, under his reference 122/14, advised the Bantu Affairs Commissioner of Johannesburg that the Council had on the 25th June, 1969, resolved as follows, i.e. that the Council agrees in principle to make available R100 000 to the Department of Bantu Administration and Development for the building of houses in the Bantu homelands for the accommodation of widows, pensioners and others in Soweto who, in the opinion of the Council are in need and who have voluntarily moved to a Bantu homeland, and the Manager of the Non-European Affairs Department be authorized to discuss with senior officials of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development ways and means of doing this, having regard to the necessity of identifying such houses with Johannesburg on the lines outlined in the body of this report.</block>

<block name="quote">On the 17th January, 1971, the writer accompanied by a deputation from the Council&#x2019;s Management Committee, met the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration in Cape Town when the question of the payment of the R100 000 was discussed and agreement reached in regard to the Council&#x2019;s requirements in this matter.</block>

<p>On 12th March, 1971, the Town Clerk wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have pleasure in attaching hereto the Council&#x2019;s cheque for R100 000 to be used for the purposes outlined in the above resolution and confirm that your department will keep the council informed from time to time on what progress has been made in the development of the various Bantu homelands and to what areas people who have voluntarily moved from Soweto have been accommodated.</block>

<p>So these are the facts in connection with this donation of R100 000. I assume that the hon. member now has clarity in regard to this matter and that I may leave it at that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wanted to know whether I had given any consideration to where levy payments were going to be suspended.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The question of abolishing levy moneys in areas in which such moneys have accumulated, is a very difficult problem and creates practical problems which compel us to exercise a great deal of care. Let me just state these problems in brief. One of the practical problems one has to face is that when one abolishes this levy in one area, other areas will want to know why <span class="col_3775-3776" refersTo="page_0546"/>it is not abolished in their areas as well Problems may arise from this. At the moment employers contribute approximately R2 per month, on an average, to the Services Levy Fund. If the payment of this levy were to be abolished in one area because of the fact that there was a surplus and employers consequently no longer need to pay the levy of R2 per month, Bantu from the surrounding areas, areas in which the levy fund is still in operation, would tend&#x2014;experience has taught us this&#x2014;to move to those areas in which it has been abolished because employers who need no longer pay the levy money tend to add that money to the salaries of their Bantu employees. Therefore, before one can give any attention to abolishing the payment of this levy, one has to face up squarely to practical problems such as these. As I have said, abolishing the levy will give rise to dissatisfaction amongst the Bantu employees, something which we, like hon. members opposite, should like to avoid under all circumstances. Because of these practical problems I have been obliged to refuse a request for abolishing the Services Levy Fund in the Pinelands area in Natal. I want to tell the hon. member on the opposite side, however, that we appointed a committee for conducting a thorough investigation into this whole matter. The committee presented its report in connection with this matter and at present we are considering this report with a view to possibly establishing a consolidated fund. Hon. members will realize that this is an extremely delicate matter which has to be handled with utmost circumspection because of the important implications it has in respect of Bantu labour as well as the implications it has for the White employers concerned in the matter.</p>

<p>Finally the hon. member for Transkei said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That means then that the Johannesburg levy cannot be used anywhere except in Johannesburg because there is no homeland abutting on Johannesburg.</block>

<p>I promised to reply to this. Sir, that is quite correct and I have no argument with that, but I should like to point out that section 19 (3) <i>bis</i> (g) of the Urban Areas Act reads as follows&#x2014;and the hon. member for Transkei referred to this in the Second Reading debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu Services Levy Fund shall be chargeable with any amounts which the Minister may, after consultation with the urban local authority, require it to pay to any other body, including any other urban local authority, in respect of adult male Bantu employed in the urban area of that urban local authority but residing &#x2026;</block>

<p>And that is the crucial word&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in any area under the control of such other body in respect of which it provides water, sanitation, lighting or road services and any amounts paid to any body in pursuance of a direction under this paragraph shall be deposited in the relevant account referred to in the Bantu Services Levy Act, 1952.</block>

<p>Sir, on this point, too, we should understand each other very clearly so that there cannot be any misunderstanding in this regard. Our interpretation of the important word &#x201C;residing&#x201D; in section 19 (3) <i>bis</i> (g), which I have just quoted, has been to date, as I explained to hon. members on Friday, that those levy funds should be utilized in the interests of the employer paying the levy and in the interests of the Bantu employee in whose interests the employer is paying the levy. For that reason the hon. member is perfectly correct. But I do say that we should not misunderstand each other. Fairly recently the Johannesburg Councillors came to see me about this question of whether they would not be able to use levy funds, in the same way as they have now used this donation from Bantu beer profits, for example, in a homeland which is not situated too far away and from which they draw of their Bantu workers. I want it to be clearly understood that my reply to them was, as I told hon. members on Friday, that we wanted to keep to the assurances which had been given by Dr. Verwoerd. I state most emphatically that the intention was that those funds should be used in the interests of the employers and in the interests of their employees. As far as I am concerned that is all there is to it, but let us take a look at what the Act allows. If a local authority were to take the initiative and, firstly, were to come forward with a definite project in a Bantu homeland in the interests of those Bantu employees, secondly, if it then were to be proclaimed&#x2014;it has to be clearly understood that there must be a proclamation&#x2014;and, thirdly, if the local levy fund committee and the central levy fund committee were to come <span class="col_3777-3778" refersTo="page_0547"/>forward with a request of that nature&#x2014; and hon. members must remember that the local levy fund committee represents the employers, i.e. trade and industry and all the other bodies&#x2014;I could not say in anticipation what my reply would be, because in that case this section 19 (3) <i>bis</i> of the Urban Areas Act and the interpretation to be given to that section would crop up for the first time. Up to now this has not been the case. I informed the Johannesburg City Council of my attitude &#x2014;and I think they departed perfectly satisfied with that to their request concerning whether I would take the initiative in convincing the local levy fund committee or the central levy fund committee of the necessity therefor and of the fact that in that way levy fund moneys would be used in the interests of the employer and of his employee in a homeland for the construction of services, etc. My attitude is that I shall not take that initiative under any circumstances; however, I cannot withhold a local authority from taking the initiative itself. In that case, however, I would follow the requirements I have just set out to this Committee very conscientiously. I also want to state most emphatically that if those employers, through their local levy fund committees and the central levy fund committee, and the local authority cannot settle those matters amongst themselves to the satisfaction of all, I shall, from the nature of the case, not be prepared even to look at such a proposal. In conclusion I want to content myself by saying that I shall keep to the assurances we have given hon. members. In the light of the assurances I have given, I also hope that it will be very clear to hon. members that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Mooi River, and I hope that he will understand this, is in fact much more restrictive than what I am prepared to do by means of the amendment which I myself moved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for the detailed explanation he has given and the way he answered our questions. The hon. member for Mooi River unfortunately cannot be here today, but I think it can be taken that he would accept the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s explanation and not proceed with his amendment on the assurance given by the Deputy Minister in moving his own amendment that the law will in fact remain as it is. But there is only one thing that worries me. The Deputy Minister has said that he cannot abolish the levy in any area, because if he abolishes it in one area, other areas may ask that it be abolished there as well. Now, I do not think that is a good reason. I am not going to quote again. The Deputy Minister has accepted the assurance given by the late Dr. Verwoerd that he would abolish it and that the payments would be suspended as soon as their purpose had been served in a particular area. But I do not see any sense in making these employers pay this levy and accumulating millions. I have told the Deputy Minister what we understand has been accumulated so far. It is something like R26 million, and in Johannesburg I think it is R5 million. I do not see the sense of going on accumulating these millions unless they can be used, and used in the particular area, as was envisaged in the Act. Therefore I say I do not think the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reasons for not suspending payment are sound. All he has to do is to suspend it because he does not abolish it completely; he merely suspends it, and I do not think he has given a good reason for not suspending it in these areas where they have accumulated millions.</p>

<p>Then my difficulty about the interpretation of the law is this. The Deputy Minister says he can proclaim in terms of section 19 (3) <i>bis</i> (g) an area where the funds can be used by a local authority in a Reserve. But if we look at the wording of the clause, the operative word is &#x201C;resides&#x201D;. The Deputy Minister says the question is what is the interpretation of &#x201C;resides&#x201D;: I have no doubt that &#x201C;resides&#x201D; was intended to mean where the workman resides at the time of his work. But the difficulty I see with the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s interpretation now is that this levy can only be used by some other body which controls an area where&#x2014;I think this is the way the Deputy Minister would like to interpret it now&#x2014; his family resides, or where his wife resides if she resides in a Reserve. Then the question arises, what is a body? Will it fall under some other municipality?</p>

<p>Well, what sort of body can then be envisaged? I do not see how it can be given to the body where the wife resides, unless she is actually residing there at that time. I understood that <span class="col_3779-3780" refersTo="page_0548"/>the purpose of the discussion with the Deputy Minister was to establish some new area where the workmen and their families can reside. I do not see how that can be done under the law as it stands. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that he has appointed a committee to go into the question of how they can utilize these levies.</p>

<p>Yes, but what I wanted to ask was whether the Minister has appointed a committee&#x2014;I thought that that had already been decided&#x2014;to advise him what they can do with the surpluses. He is not stuck with them, but these surpluses cannot be used at the moment. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will come to this House with any recommendations of the committee, either to amend the law, or to explain to us how he intends to overcome this difficulty, so that we again can express our feelings about it. I must say that the employer is the man who is paying the levy. He pays it on the distinct undertaking which was given to him by the late Dr. Verwoerd. I submit that the employer&#x2019;s wishes must not be overlooked in deciding what to do with the money which has already been paid.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I can assure the hon. member that the employer&#x2019;s wishes will be looked after under all circumstances. As I have already pointed out, under no circumstances will I be willing to look at any proposal with regard to the levy fund, unless the local levy fund committee and the central levy fund committee come to me with unanimous recommendations. I gave that assurance to the Johannesburg City Council as well.</p>

<p>*In addition I should like to tell the hon. member what I meant when I spoke earlier. The committee was appointed at the very request of the industrialists, the people engaged in trade, etc., who had asked whether consideration could not be given not only to the services levy funds but also to the consolidation of all these odd fees. At present we are considering the report of that committee. I may just tell the hon. member that when the report has been considered and we have taken decisions, we shall undoubtedly come to this House in that regard, because we regard it as very important. For that reason I am just repeating that I have dealt very fully with the interpretation of the question of &#x201C;residing&#x201D;, etc., but to date no such difficulty or problem has cropped up. Just because I was afraid that some misunderstanding might arise with regard to this question and because I might subsequently be accused of having said this or that, I have dealt very fully with this matter in order to ensure that no misunderstanding would arise in this regard. I just want to repeat that in respect of the Bill at present before this Committee, hon. members may accept my assurance, one which I am having written into the Bill by means of the amendment, that the steps which will be taken of the services levy fund will be exactly and strictly in terms of the existing Services Levy Act.</p>

Can he give us the assurance whether the cutting of red tape, which until now has been a feature of the administration of such funds, will be continued when the board takes control of these funds, which consist of considerable amounts. To my mind, the best part of the funds, apart from the fact that the public has contributed generously, is the fact that they can be applied immediately as required, without searching enquiries while the dependants and other victims of disasters go in very dire need. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister give us some definite assurance in this regard?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have gone into this matter. I intended creating an opportunity of replying to the hon. member for Houghton in this regard. For that reason I am pleased that I can do so now.</p>

<p>The Bill at present before this Committee provides in clause 13 in respect of funds that if the fund&#x2019;s money has not been granted&#x2014;here the important word is &#x201C;granted&#x201D;&#x2014;to the Bantu or to a specific Bantu this administration board will have no authority over that money and it therefore remains the money of the welfare fund or the accident fund, according to circumstances. If the hon. member for Houghton were to peruse clause 13 very carefully, she would see that the provisions of clause 13 are not at all applicable to those funds.</p>

<p>As I have said, I went properly into this matter and also discussed it with the manager of Non-European Affairs of the Johannesburg City Council, Mr. Coller. He informed me that to a certain extent this entire matter was actually being administered by a committee of officials of the Johannesburg municipal department of Non-European Affairs, but that it was being managed completely outside the control and scope of both the City Council and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. For that reason the administration boards will have no authority over this.</p>

<p>To this I just want to add that at the time of the establishment of such a Bantu administration board in Johannesburg the management committee of such a fund or funds, in terms of their own constitution, will be able to decide for themselves in what way they, under the new circumstances, if and when they arose, will cooperate with such an administration board. They may also decide not to co-operate. They are completely at liberty to do as they like, because this legislation actually has no bearing whatsoever on that.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to get clarity from the hon. the Deputy Minister on a certain aspect of this clause.</p>

<p>As I read the clause, the moment a board is formed, local authorities will have to pay over any credit balances reflected in regard to their Bantu accounts. I obviously have no quarrel with this. However, as I see it, this could raise certain financial implications for local authorities. These amounts are very large and are not fluid. They are obviously re-invested in other funds of the local authority. Quite obviously, if there is to be a demand from the boards to pay over these amounts right away, then the local authorities will either have to raise this money by means of an external loan or by special rate. I should like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister whether, in fact, the boards will take over the loans as they stand and wait for the money until the loan matures?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to raise two matters with the hon. the Deputy Minister. In his reply a few moments ago, to a question put by the hon. member for Houghton, I think the hon. the Deputy Minister stated that the funds to which he referred, i.e. funds which have been received by the Non-European Affairs Department of, for instance, the Johannesburg City Council, for welfare needs of some nature arising out of some unfortunate incident where the public very generously contributed money, were not affected by the terms of clause 13. In this regard I should like to refer the hon. the Deputy Minister to clause 13 (1) (a) (v) which reads as follows:</p>

<p>The funds of a board shall consist&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(a) to such extent and subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">(v) of any moneys which may be granted, bequeathed or donated to any urban local authority referred to in sub-paragraph (i) for the benefit of the Bantu in such urban local authority&#x2019;s area of jurisdiction.</block>

<p>There are also quite a number of funds of this nature. I think most of us who have at some time or another served on a local authority have had something to do with these funds. During my career as a member of the Johannesburg City Council, we established what was known as the Albertynsville Disaster Fund. A considerable amount of money was donated within a very short period and an amount of some R20 000 or R30 000 left over after the necessary moneys had been spent, was used to form a welfare fund which gave further assistance to the children and the families of some of these people who were affected. Furthermore it was used as a general welfare <span class="col_3783-3784" refersTo="page_0550"/>fund. Quite a fair amount of money is in the hands of the Johannesburg City Council, as there probably is in the hands of many other town councils. That money is used without any red tape at all, as it has been so well expressed before, and it is administered by a special small committee within the particular local authority&#x2019;s administration. This money is used to the best advantage and with the least delay to those people concerned. This is a very important aspect. If this, for instance, were to be left with the local authority as part of the general welfare work of the authority, it would be satisfactory, because it may be somewhat strange if it is administered by this body which we have described as a purely objective body and which does not have much close touch with the intimate detailed affairs of that particular community. I would like the hon. the Deputy-Minister to explain his own statement in the light of clause 13 (1) (a) (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii), which deal with the donations. There is quite a large amount of moneys which do not flow into the Bantu Revenue Fund in accordance with the laws under which Bantu affairs are administered and in respect of which certain taxation or other forms of levy are payable.</p>

<p>The other aspect I would like to mention is the question of the word &#x201C;reside&#x201D; which the hon. the Deputy Minister has correctly said is the key word in this whole situation. The way we understood it at the time the services levy fund was imposed, was that it would provide services for housing for the workers. I do not know whether the specific question of families arose at that time. What I do know is that at the time when section 10 of the Bantu (Urban areas) Consolidation Act was amended in 1952, the then Minister of Native Affairs, Dr. Verwoerd, did talk about families and he made special provision for families. In fact, he said it was essential to ensure that those who were directly dependent on the worker were properly cared for. They, so it was said, would have the right to live with the worker in the urban areas. I have read this extract very carefully this morning in Hansard and the hon. the Deputy Minister will find it there himself. The then hon. the Minister of Native Affairs, Dr. Verwoerd, went out of his way specifically to refer to that. However, the essence of the services levy fund is to provide services for homes erected for the residence of the worker in respect of whom the employer made those contributions. If we talk about the word &#x201C;reside&#x201D;, the example which the hon. the Deputy Minister had in mind with regard to Pretoria, for instance, is a place, Ga Rankuwa, which is situated on the borders of Pretoria. Another example, I think, is Umlazi, which is situated right next door to the big industrial area of Durban. Another example is that of Mdantsane, which again is right on the doorstep of East London. Therefore, the provision of services for the residences of workers could fall by a reasonable stretch of imagination within the ambit of the purpose of these funds. But if the worker&#x2019;s home is to be in the Transkei, which I use as an example of a Reserve, while he works on the Witwatersrand, he has to be housed. The fact that his family may reside there is possibly not an issue which was contemplated at the time. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister should make it perfectly clear to us what he has in mind, having now underlined this word &#x201C;reside&#x201D; and having stated this as being of cardinal importance and as one of the four pillars on which he will base his whole approach to the subject. I think we should have a very much clearer and more practical explanation as to what the hon. the Deputy Minister has in mind, because I am sure that employers of labour will be very interested to know exactly what was meant.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as a final point, there was no question that, as and when sufficient funds have been collected to provide the necessary services, these funds will then come to an end. It was virtually an implied condition that the necessity for providing further levies would fall away. If a township like Soweto, for example, or any other township outside a local authority, continues to grow or expand and if additional houses are built for which there is a tremendous necessity in the country today, the fund would then of course carry on in order to provide those services, save for one interesting factor, namely that most big cities have large sums accumulated and are only able to spend those moneys if and when the hon. the Deputy Minister approves and permits the provision of further housing. This is the crux of the use of the Services Levy Fund. I believe that there has been a cessation of this practice. It has already been expressed in the Press that in Johannesburg there is a shortage of housing and that this shortage is resulting in certain conditions being created which are not of a very healthy nature. This is something of which the hon. the Deputy Minister <span class="col_3785-3786" refersTo="page_0551"/>must take note. If housing continues to flow in the normal way, providing for the residence of workers, the levy funds will be spent. I think it is in this respect that we must view this whole question of whether levy funds will continue to be provided. The question of whether an employer adds that levy fund to the wages of an employee simply because he does not pay it any more and so creates a certain difference of wage levels between prescribed areas will, be entirely foreign to this whole question. The question of a levy is something which has nothing to do with what an employer will do when the time comes for him to cease making payment of these levies. On these few issues the Committee is entitled to a very much clearer and a much more frank exposition.</p>

My reply to the Johannesburg City Council therefore was that if they want to do it they must take the initiative and must go and iron out their own problems with the local levy fund committee and with the central levy fund committee, because I want the employer as well as the Bantu employee to be 100 per cent satisfied.

<p>Then I must reply to a few questions hon. members put to me. I first want to point out that the hon. member for Jeppes and the hon. member for <span class="col_3787-3788" refersTo="page_0552"/>Houghton spoke of two different kinds of funds. The hon. member for Houghton spoke of an independent, registered fund. I have given her my reply. The hon. member for Jeppes spoke of a completely different kind of fund. I want to tell him that he should take a look at clause 13 (3) of this Bill. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any moneys referred to in section I (a) (v), (vi), (vii) or (viii) shall be applied by the board concerned for the purposes and &#x2026;</block>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Johannesburg North that it is precisely the same case there, and I want to refer him to clause 13 (1) which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The funds of a board shall consist&#x2014; (a) to such extent and subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine &#x2026;</block>

<p>I see the hon. member is indicating that he is satisfied. I am grateful for that. It is very clear that if a local authority were to have a loan of R60 million, or whatever the circumstances might be, and those funds were to be transferred to the administration board, and we were to state that that money had to be paid over immediately, surely it would stand to reason that that would place a very heavy burden on the local authority, a burden which one wants to avoid. Therefore we have had inserted here &#x201C;subject to such conditions as the Minister may determine&#x201D; so that the Minister may say that that money may be paid back over 20 or 25 years, as the case may be. We shall be as fair as possible so as not to embarrass a local authority because of a loan it has raised.</p>

<p>Clause 15:</p>

<p>Now I want to know what is anticipated. What type of Bantu residence will be in the area of a local authority which is taxable? That means that it will be outside a Bantu township. Can the Deputy Minister tell us whether it is Bantu hostels that this clause attempts to exclude? They are defined under &#x201C;residential areas&#x201D; as well.</p>

<p>This is defined in the Urban Areas Act&#x2014;in other words, action will only be taken here in terms of that Act. At the moment I cannot say offhand whether it will be hostels or what other circumstances there may be. But as I said, the position is defined in full in the Urban Areas Act. Clause 15 merely provides that where there is a provision in the Urban Areas Act in connection with the collection of taxes, we must act accordingly. There is nothing more to it.</p>

What I would like to know is this. Will the local authority not be supplying any services which in the ordinary course would have been covered by rates? I am certain that this must be of deep concern to local authorities because they may be supplying services which in the ordinary course are covered by rates and yet here they will not be able to collect such rates. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister give us an indication whether local authorities are satisfied with this provision as it stands?</p>

<p>I can give the hon. member the assurance that the U.M.E. is absolutely satisfied with the clause as it is. It was discussed, although not at length because this was not necessary. Why?&#x2014;because this clause has no other intention than to lay down for the purposes of this legislation the <i>status quo</i> position under the Bantu Urban Areas Act &#x2014;nothing more. In other words, my reply to the hon. member is the same as that I have given to the hon. member for Transkei, i.e. that as far as this legislation is concerned, we shall act only in accordance with the relevant sections of the Bantu Urban Areas Act. Nothing will be done which goes beyond what that Act prescribes in regard to rates, the definitions of a Bantu area, etc.</p>

<p>Clause 16:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>This clause prescribes that local authorities will have to give certain assistance and facilities to a board. During the Second Reading debate I queried the exact meaning of the proviso to this clause, i.e. &#x201C;Provided that any charged made in respect of any such services shall not exceed the charges for similar services provided in respect of any area within the jurisdiction of such local authority&#x201D;. I then instanced a municipality subsidizing certain services. For instance, I do not think in Cape Town they make a separate charge for sewerage. The charge is included in the general rates. Other municipalities make a charge for sewerage If the board requests the municipality of Cape Town, for instance. to supply a sewerage service, the municipality would naturally want to make a charge for it. Well, how would they do that, in view of the fact that this proviso prohibits them for charging more than the charges they levy for the service in their own area?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>As I explained at the Second Reading, the position here is that one cannot expect a Bantu administration board, which does not have to do with Whites, after all, but with Bantu, to pay more when it comes to the provision of sewerage or water works&#x2014; basic services without which one cannot have a Bantu township. Surely it is not the function of the Bantu administration board to provide services such as these; for that it has to depend on the local authority concerned. Surely one cannot expect the Bantu administration board to pay more for such services than the normal charges levied by the local authority. By levying higher charges for those services we would be imposing a tremendous burden on the Bantu community concerned, a burden which it will probably be unable to carry. Hon. members opposite should therefore be very careful with what they say about this.</p>

<p>While the previous clause, not being a complicated provision, was not discussed at any length with IANA and the U.M.E., this matter, on the other hand, was discussed in great detail, during which discussion many possibilities were suggested, especially by the U.M.E. It was agreed that the wording as it reads at present was fair, in other words, that, in the light of the fact that such services are essential, a local authority shall provide a Bantu administration board with such services at charges not exceeding the normal charges applicable in the area of that local authority. Another reason why this was acceptable to the U.M.E. is that no new principle is being introduced here, since it is a principle already included in the Urban Areas Act that a local authority shall not provide a Bantu area with water and sanitary services at. charges exceeding those applicable in that area. Surely this is logical. The hon. member should look at section 20 <i>(2)</i> of the Urban Areas Act. then he will see that this is a principle which has applied for years. Under the circumstances neither the U.M.E. nor the department expects this proviso to give rise to difficulties. I have already mentioned the case where there is a subsidy or a levy in respect of the provision of water, for instance. A local authority will not be <span class="col_3791-3792" refersTo="page_0554"/>able to supply a Bantu area with water works or sewerage works at a charge exceeding the charge applicable in its area. If a Bantu administration board would now have to pay more for such services because the services are subsidized for the Whites, it would create an extremely delicate problem, a problem we want to avoid by providing that an agreement has to be entered into. This is very clearly written into the clause. The clause also stipulates what has to be done when no agreement can be reached. However, we do not expect such cases to occur. In any case, when a charge is laid down for the Bantu administration area, it shall not exceed the current charge in the local area.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has referred us to the Urban Areas Act and pointed out that in that case too the municipality or local authority cannot charge more for services in a Bantu township. I would like to point out that the circumstances are quite different. As I understand the position, under the Bantu Urban Areas Act the local authority controls the Bantu townships, but here the local authority is losing all control of the townships. Once this board has been formed, all the authority is taken away from the local authority. The local authority could recoup itself in other ways; it could charge an extra rental for the houses which are let in the townships. It must be remembered that the local authority was building houses for its own Bantu employees serving the town. A local authority may now be called upon to furnish services for a township which is not necessarily housing its Bantu, and it may be more convenient for one municipality to supply the services than for another. I want to point out therefore that it is not only the local authority&#x2019;s own citizens who are getting the advantages of the subsidy now but it will also be the citizens of other local authorities; they too will be getting the advantage of the subsidy furnished by another local authority. However, the hon. the Deputy Minister has said that it may be necessary to review the subsidy. I take it that if a local authority can satisfy the board and the Minister as to how it subsidizes the service, that will be taken into consideration in assessing the amount which the board should pay the local authority, because it is quite wrong to expect the local authority now to provide services for new townships which, as I have said, may not even affect their area.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is just a small point which I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to clarify for me. I think he knows that in certain cases local authorities do not charge the consumers in a location or Bantu village at all; they do not charge individuals. We know that in a case like that the local authority can, if it wishes to do so, debit this amount to the Bantu Revenue Account. But once the board has been formed there will be no Bantu Revenue Account. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister tell me how this matter will be adjusted became it is specifically stated here that we are not allowed to charge more than we charged before? But in this case nothing was charged. Will the Deputy Minister please tell us how he intends to overcome this problem?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>First I just want to tell the hon. member for Transkei and other members on that side that, as regards this specific matter we are now discussing, Act No. 19 of 1954 provided in respect of the Resettlement Board and the Johannesburg City Council that no higher charge could be made for services provided to Meadowlands and Diepkloof. This has applied for many years now, and I can assure the hon. member that up to now there has never been any problem whatsoever concerning this specific matter of charges between the Resettlement Board and the Johannesburg City Council. I therefore take it that I can give hon. members the assurance that there is no earthly reason to suspect that this will create any problem in future.</p>

In this case it charged nothing at all, but it had this remedy that it could, if it wished to do so, debit that amount against the Bantu Revenue Account. But with the establishment of the board there will be no Bantu Revenue Account. How will the board adjust this particular figure with the local authority? It is a very important point.</p>

<p>I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell us why he finds it necessary to have such stringent penalties for what is, after all, only a civil offence. If he looks at clause 17 (4) (b), he will see it says that anyone found guilty of an offence of obstructing, hindering, resisting, or interfering with an inspector of the board who is carrying out his duties, can be fined an amount not exceeding R200. or sentenced to imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months, or both such fine and imprisonment. It seems a heavy maximum penalty for an offence which I consider to be merely a civil offence.</p>

<p>This question will probably crop up again when we come to clause 22 and I might just as well reply to it now. It must be very clear that this Bill does not intend to interfere with the courts in the least.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The point is just that it is a maximum fine and penalty which is being laid down here, and if the hon. member thinks it is too heavy, there is nothing I can do except to say that the courts will have to decide about that. It is not a minimum fine or a minimum term of imprisonment which is being prescribed here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is a guide-line for the courts. Of course I know it is not a minimum penalty, but my objection is that such a stringent maximum penalty is laid down for what in effect is really a minor offence. It gives a guide-line to the courts to indicate that the offence is extremely serious and that the Government regards it as much more severe than it is. I think this is a very heavy penalty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>It deals with someone who falsely holds himself out to be an inspector. Surely this is not a minor offence; it is a very serious offence. Therefore one makes provision, in terms of this clause, for a serious offence, such as the one I mentioned, when an interpreter falsely holds himself out to be an inspector. Can you imagine what misery such a person might cause in the country or in a certain area? If you take that case, I think the hon. member for Houghton will have to concede to me that a penalty of a fine of R200 or six months&#x2019; imprisonment is really not a very heavy one for that sort of offence, and that is the maximum penalty. We must not misunderstand each other about this. The hon. member cannot tell me that when someone falsely holds himself out to be an inspector, possibly fooling hundreds of people before being brought to book, a fine of R200 or six months&#x2019; imprisonment is too heavy a penalty.</p>

<p>Then I repeat that this is the maximum <span class="col_3795-3796" refersTo="page_0556"/>penalty and that the courts must use their own discretion in respect of minimum penalties. I therefore give the assurance that the intention here is not to deny the court the right to decide, in terms of that specific paragraph (b), not to impose the maximum penalty in a particular case, but a fine of R50, if it considers that it is not such a terrible offence and that it does not justify the maximum penalty. There is nothing to prevent the court from doing this. I just wanted to make the matter clear. Once again it is clear to me that the hon. members did not quite grasp the matter. This is only a maximum penalty, and the maximum penalty is not too heavy for the type of case I have now mentioned.</p>

<p>I just want to get the record straight here. The hon. the Deputy Minister suggested that there is some confusion amongst the members on this side of the House. I submit that there is no confusion at all. As far as clause 17 is concerned, we have no quarrel whatsoever. I think that is quite clear. The point I made in discussing clause 22 (7), to which the hon. the Minister has referred, is that this method should have been adopted in clause 22. Parliament lays down what the penalty is going to be, but under clause 22 (7) the Minister will make a regulation laying down what the penalty will be. So, the hon. the Minister is confused, and I suggest that he gets the record straight.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 18:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>We do not like this clause at all, Sir. Very onerous duties are placed on the local authorities, but if the boards are to operate at all, it seems that they will have to be able to call upon local authorities to fulfil certain duties and, if they do not do so, someone will have to intervene. Clause 18 gives the hon. the Minister the power to intervene. The consequences of non-compliance by a local authority with any request made to it by a board are certainly very drastic. If one looks at subsection (2) (a), (2) (b) and (2) (c) one sees that the board under the direction of the Minister can do the work itself. Then it can claim in a competent court against such local authority&#x2014;I do not have a quarrel with that&#x2014;or it can levy a special rate upon all rateable property within the area under the jurisdiction of such local authority, or it can use both those methods or it can take money payable by way of subsidy, grant or other moneys payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to that local authority. It can also act on a certificate by such board, as to the amount of the costs involved. The bare certificate of the board will be <i>prima facie</i> proof of the amount owing. This clause is far too vague. The hon. the Minister is given too much power. Under what circumstances will he act? He will act and I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">If a local authority neglects to perform any act which by or under the provisions of this Act, it is empowered or required to perform in relation to a board, or performs any such act in such a manner that, in the opinion of such board, the purpose for which such act is so empowered or required is not achieved.</block>

<p>I submit that this is far too vague. The boards will have these local authorities at their mercy. We certainly cannot support a clause of such a nature.</p>

<p>Let me explain this matter to hon. members Opposite once more. They are very fond of making the allegation that &#x201C;the Minister takes so much power&#x201D;. This is really not true. This particular clause, clause 18, formed the subject of protracted and repeated discussions between the United Municipal Executive and my Department. I was present at most of those discussions. This particular clause has been re-drafted and modified repeatedly in order to give the necessary satisfaction. Right at the outset, when these discussions were started, we accepted the principle in discussions with the representative body of the local authorities, i.e. the U.M.E., that there should be machinery in this Bill in terms of which, in the event of a local authority refusing to render the necessary co-operation, it would be made possible for the administration board and the local authority to meet one another in some way or other. That is the principle that has been accepted. It did not take us very long to come to a second principle either, i.e. that we should adhere as far as possible to the principle in regard to a matter of which we have some experience, viz. the Resettlement Board as well as the principles laid down in the Urban Areas Act of 1945. That is the second aspect of the matter on which we reached agreement fairly quickly. But then the same happened as had happened in regard to clause 10 (10). This is a delicate and difficult matter. What we have here now is an administration board which is a statutory body. The administration board has to rely on the co-operation of the various local authorities within that administration area. There would be no problem if these bodies would co-operate with one another. But&#x2014;and this is the important point&#x2014;while we were thrashing out this matter in great detail, the United Municipal Executive wanted to know how we were going to settle the matter if, for example, the administration board were to act quite unreasonably in the demands it was making on a local authority? Now, we should bear in mind that no administration boards have as yet been established and that we should now try and place ourselves in the position an administration board may possibly find itself. On the other hand, what is the administration board going to do if a local authority were to act in a deliberate and unreasonable way? We may then find ourselves in the position of being unable to proceed any further as a result of disputes about technical points. The local authorities which were members of the U.M.E. then said that there was only one way left in which a matter such as this may possibly be solved. That is for the Minister to act as the necessary arbiter, because somebody will have to act as the arbiter, when we are finding ourselves in a deadlock situation between an administration board and a local authority. This machinery was then written into the Bill as it is found in clause 18 (2) (a), (b) and (c), which the hon. member for Transkei referred to. I readily concede that when one looks at sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), as they are in the Bill, the provisions seem to be quite drastic. But hon. members should remember that the U.M.E. and those involved in this matter, agreed that this was the correct course of action, because this is also the principle in respect of the Resettlement Board as well as the one contained in the Urban Areas Act. We would not like to be accused of usurping here more powers than is necessary. As a matter of fact, this is not what is happening here, because we were asked that someone should act as the arbiter in this respect. And it is only fair that the Minister will be the arbiter. From the nature of the case, the Minister will, in the first place, act with great caution and with a soft hand to try to bring about the necessary agreement between the administration board and the local authority, and, in the second place, if no agreement can be reached, he will apply sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) with a soft hand. We do not want to cause these people to be at loggerheads with one another. We should very much like to see the necessary co-operation among these people. The provisions of clause 18 (2) (a), (b) and (c) will be applied in this spirit. I really hope hon. members on the opposite side of the House are satisfied now.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are dealing with a hon. Deputy Minister who, I must say, has been most reasonable in most of his arguments. Experience has taught us, however, that we are not always dealing with somebody who is as reasonable as the hon. the Deputy Minister is today.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister talks about co-operation. Of course, we want cooperation; everybody wants co-operation. He talks about applying these provisions &#x201C;met &#x2019;n sagte hand&#x201D;. But, what the hon. <span class="col_3799-3800" refersTo="page_0558"/>the Deputy Minister implies by talking about &#x201C;&#x2019;n sagte hand&#x201D; is that there is a mailed fist which is hidden in this particular provision. It is not only hidden in this provision, but also in the other provisions of this Bill. What the Opposition is doing today, is pointing out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that we have seen this mailed fist which is hidden in this Bill. If we look at the provisions of clause 16 (2), which we have already dealt with, we find that such local authority shall provide certain services such as to supply water and electricity and receive water or sewage. It also has some responsibilities in regard to roads. They are compelled to do so. What do we find in the event of a dispute? I sincerely hope that there are not going to be disputes, but when we look at the provisions as they exist today we see that there can be cause for dispute. What is going to be the position when a dispute does arise? If we look at the provisions of clause 18, we see that if a local authority neglects to perform any act, or if it has done it in such a manner that &#x201C;in the opinion of the board it is unsatisfactory&#x201D;, it then applies to the hon. the Minister. The Minister arbitrarily then may determine, after consultation with the Administrator, what conditions he feels would be correct. Then, in the event of further dispute, we come to subsection (2) (a) whereby he can go to court. So far so good. We accept that in the event of a dispute between what the Minister may decide and the local authority may decide, such a dispute shall be settled by action in a competent court. Then, however, he has added the words &#x201C;or by levying a special rate upon all rateable property ...&#x201D; to recover the amount. These are the points we are opposing. We are opposing the fact that the Minister can arbitrarily go ahead and do the work at the expense of the local authorities. Then he does not go to court, or he need not necessarily go to court, in order to recover these expenses which he has had. He can then arbitrarily levy a special rate on his own accord. This is the power that he is taking. This is the mailed fist which is hidden herein. We hope that he will use the medium of paragraph (a) to recover the money, but he is now asking this Committee to give him the power to arbitrarily decide on his own to recover the amount, how much shall be recovered arid to recover it by levying a rate. Furthermore, if he finds he cannot levy a rate on the properties within the area of jurisdiction of the local authorities, he can go to some competent authority which pays a subsidy to these local authorities and deduct from that subsidy, grant or other moneys payable the amount he wants for the work which he has done. This is completely and totally arbitrary. The hon. the Deputy Minister has been reasonable, but I think he must also be reasonable when he considers this. In his reasonableness he must also understand why we are opposed to the arbitrary action which the Minister will be empowered to deal with, because it need not necessarily be this Minister; it could be one of his successors. We do not know what the attitude of his successors will be and that is why we are opposed to these provisions.</p>

<p>The question is not whether the hon. members on that side opposed it or not, because they have opposed every good thing which has been requested here! The question is how it was implemented through the years. If the hon. member looks at that Act and at the same time at clause 18 (2) (a), (b) and (c), he will see that section 29 (2) (a) of that Act reads &#x201C;by action in a competent court against the council&#x201D;, whereas clause 18 (2) (a) of this Bill reads, &#x201C;by action in a competent court against such local authority&#x201D;. He will also see that paragraph (b) of the Natives Resettlement Act reads &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Section 29 (2) (a) of the Natives <span class="col_3801-3802" refersTo="page_0559"/>Resettlement Act. The hon. member will find it interesting if he compares the two with each other. If you look at paragraph (b) of the Natives Resettlement Act, you will see that it reads, &#x201C;by levying a special rate upon all rateable property within the area under the jurisdiction of the council&#x201D;, whereas clause 18 (2) (b) of the Bill with which we are dealing now reads, &#x201C;by levying a special rate upon all rateable property within the area under the jurisdiction of such local authority&#x201D;. Section 29 (2) (c) of the Bantu Resettlement Act reads as follows: &#x201C;By deduction from any subsidy, grant or other moneys payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or payable by the Administrator to the Council, &#x2026;,&#x201D; whereas clause 18 (2) (c) of the Bill reads as follows: &#x201C;by obtaining payment from the competent authority by way of deduction from any subsidy, grant or other moneys payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or payable by such Administrator to such local authority&#x201D;. If such a situation as the one the hon. member referred to should arise, and I reiterated that I hoped such a situation would never arise, one will naturally go out of one&#x2019;s way to deal with it by trying to bring the parties together. If you cannot manage to come to an agreement the situation will be dealt with in terms of clause 18 (2) (a). Only if it is impossible to solve the situation will we use these provisions. The argument I therefore advance is that this provision has been in operation, as I have pointed out, for 17 years without any difficulties ever occurring and I therefore want to ask the hon. member to accept it. There is no necessity for not doing so especially in view of the fact that the U.M.E. has accepted it unanimously.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that two wrongs do not make a right. I know that this provision is contained in the Bantu Resettlement Act, but we on this side also opposed it then.</p>

<p>Surely what is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander. Why does the hon. the Deputy Minister not merely provide for responsibility by the municipality or local authority in the same way that he does for the board? In clause 19 it is provided&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any local authority may recover from any board any expenditure incurred by such local authority in connection with any matter within the purview of such board which in the opinion of the Minister would not have been incurred if this Act had not been passed.</block>

<p>If a municipality or local authority has to collect from the board, I take it they will have to proceed along the normal course and sue, because how else can they recover? I suppose that is the only way they will be able to recover. A local authority with all its obligations will not have the privileges and advantages given to a board. Why can the two authorities not be treated in the same manner? That is what we want to know.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister is a reasonable man and he is now in a reasonable frame of mind and I want to put something to him. In respect of clause 18 (2) (a) where the board may recover by action in a competent court the costs incurred by it, I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will concede that that court would be in a position to award the amount claimed to the board. Through the processes of that court the board would be empowered to recover the amounts in terms of paragraph (c) not by obtaining payment from the source, but from a subsidy which would be paid to the board, as is stated in the Bantu Resettlement Act. Why does the hon. the Deputy Minister then want paragraphs (b) and (c) as well? Surely if the court in its wisdom will order that the board may recover the amount which has been expended, the hon. the Deputy <span class="col_3803-3804" refersTo="page_0560"/>Minister does not need any further power. Why does he then want to by-pass the court? It is accepted in this country that a court will settle such a dispute between any two persons or any two bodies. Here, however, because it happens to be the hon. the Minister who is involved, because the board is appointed by him, he now wants to circumvent the normal processes of the law in this country and how it is applied and to take the power arbitrarily to decide on his own. Not only does he want to decide on his own what should be done and how much should be paid, but he also wants the power to carry out such a judgment by the levying of these rates or by collecting from source the amount expended out of any subsidy or grant which is due.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are definitely opposing this clause and shall divide on it. This clause will give the Minister very wide powers to govern by regulation. In replying to the Second Reading debate, the Deputy Minister said that the Minister was really taking no more powers than the local authorities had. Well, I submit that is not so. He takes over all the powers of the local authorities to make regulations. In subsection (1) (b) he takes over all the powers of the local authority. Anything they can do he can do better. In subsection (2) he goes on to take further powers. In replying to the Second Reading debate, the Deputy Minister said that paragraph (f) of subsection (3) really only refer to the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e). I do not agree with him. I am sorry, I cannot accept that interpretation of the law at all. Paragraph (e) will give the Minister power to make regulations with regard to the distribution of Bantu labour. I submit that under this clause he could prohibit Bantu labour from going to a certain area within the jurisdiction of the board or he could give permission to go outside the area. He could also give permission for different categories to go outside the area or for different categories to stay within the area. He will take the power over the board. I know the Deputy Minister will get up and say that he will only do it after discussion with the board. But the fact remains that he can do it even against the wishes of the board.</p>

<p>In terms of paragraph (f) he can do what he likes. It has nothing to do with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e). It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Generally any other matter in regard to which he may consider it necessary to make regulations in order to ensure the effective administration of this Act.</block>

<p>If this only covered paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) it would not have been necessary to have paragraph (0. Why would paragraph (f) be necessary if all he is doing, is covering those matters dealt with by paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)? I submit this is to allow him to make regulations in regard to anything which he considers necessary.</p>

He is going to stick by the opinion given by the law advisers.</p>

<p>But I say that the Minister misunderstood subsection (7). My objection to subsection (7) was that the power of the Minister to provide for penalties should not have been done by regulation but should have been a provision in this Bill passed by this Parliament. Dealing with minimum penalties, I said that the Minister in terms of this regulation could lay down the minimum penalty. Parliament could not intervene.

<p>I agree with everything said by the hon. member for Transkei. I, too, consider that this clause gives the hon. the Deputy Minister very far-reaching powers indeed. I am not a lawyer but one has only to read the clause to see that that is so. It lays down that the hon. the Minister may make regulations in respect of &#x2026; and then it details very wide powers indeed, including those affecting the movement of Bantu labourers between different areas and &#x201C;the distribution of Bantu labourers between different categories of employment in any such area&#x201D;. What is meant by &#x201C;distribution&#x201D;? He will, sort of, be dealing out labourers to the various administration boards&#x2019; areas and different categories of employers. One should read this in conjunction with clause 3 in terms of which the no. I man on the board will be the man who knows something about the needs of employers of farm labour in the administrative area of the board. If I look at this clause in the light of this I become very suspicious indeed. What powers are the hon. the Deputy Minister going to take unto himself when he wants to shunt Bantu labourers off to do farm work when they want to stay within the administration board&#x2019;s area and do other types of work? On the other hand, if he does not intend using such powers, why then did he write it into this legislation?</p>

<p>Sir, I do not like these wide powers to make regulations. Already there is the tendency amongst the Government to consider that it needs complete control over the number of labourers coming in and going out and the number that can be employed by any employer&#x2014;in fact, we have endless laws on the Statute Book in terms of which the Government virtually dictates to employers and entrepreneurs what use they may or may not take of the available labour. This clause, I consider, is even going further and, consequently, I shall certainly oppose it.</p>

<p>In the White Paper on this Bill there appears this sentence in reference to clause 22: &#x201C;Moreover, additional powers are granted to the Minister to make regulations.&#x201D; The hon. member for Transkei and the hon. member for Houghton already dealt with the extent of these powers. The aspect of this clause which worries me is the stipulation that &#x201C;the Minister may furthermore make regulations as to the movement of Bantu labourers between different boards&#x2019; administration areas&#x201D;. The hon. the Deputy Minister has told us over and over again that the prime object of this legislation is to permit the free movement of Bantu labour. This aspect we shall discuss further when we come to a later clause. The stipulation of this clause goes on &#x201C;&#x2026; and the distribution of Bantu labourers between different categories of employment in any such area&#x201D;. This is the point; this is really an aspect I do not like at all, especially in the light of two speeches that were made at the Second Reading. Let me first of all deal with an interjection which was made by the hon. member for Brakpan while I was speaking. I was referring to his speech wherein he said that there were a number of Bantu in urban areas who were unemployed but who refused to accept employment in, as he put it, the Railways, Escom and the building industry. When I referred to this during the Second Reading debate, the hon. member for Brakpan said by way of interjection: &#x201C;If <span class="col_3807-3808" refersTo="page_0562"/>they won&#x2019;t work they must get out.&#x201D; He took great exception when I took up this point and suggested that the hon. the Deputy Minister, in terms of this Bill was going to take the power to compel Bantu to work in certain categories. If they did not work, then the threat of the hon. member for Brakpan would come into operation, if they did not accept employment in those categories, then the hon. member&#x2019;s threat would come into operation and the Bantu would be removed from the urban areas. But, Sir, it goes further than that The hon. the Deputy Minister, in replying to the Second Reading debate, had in his hands the dreadful task of trying to justify the speech of the hon. member for Brakpan, and this is what he said (Col. 2422 of Hansard of 10th March of this year)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I honestly think that this is not even an interpretation, for the movement of labourers between the areas of various boards&#x2014;and now I want to reply at the same time to the hon. member for Mooi River, who also raised this point&#x2014; should be viewed in the light of existing legislation, i.e. that labourers are classified into the categories of commerce, industry, the building trades, the agricultural industry, domestic service, etc., so as to ensure that one does not find the wrong Bantu in the wrong categories of work.</block>

<p>How does the hon. the Deputy Minister decide whether the wrong Bantu is in the wrong category of work? Is he really applying what ex-Deputy Minister Vosloo implied was being applied and which was denied by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. That is that Bantu are now being categorized and classified in certain trades and certain spheres of employment. In terms of this provision he can now make regulations to the effect that if a Bantu is once registered at the central bureau as a farm labourer, he will not be permitted to enter into the building industry, to take employment as a domestic or to take employment in the field of commerce? Is this what the hon. the Deputy Minister is really asking for in terms of this? Is he going to take the right now to classify them once and for all and then apply the threat of the hon. member for Brakpan that if they do not accept employment in that category, they must be returned to the homelands? Is this the intention of the hon. the Deputy Minister in terms of this clause? I sincerely hope that he can give us a reasonable explanation because I am very suspicious of this.</p>

<p>I accept that hon. members opposite are not going to support this clause and that they are going to vote against it. Therefore I am not going to devote too much time to this specific clause because it is quite obvious that we will not see eye to eye on it.</p>

<p>With reference to what the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District has just said, I want to tell him that I am not, nor is the Minister, going to categorize the Bantu into different categories, and the board is not going to do it either. The Bantu do so themselves; they come forward and say: &#x201C;I want to do this type of work or that type of work.&#x201D; Hon. members opposite are reading things into this clause which simply do not exist. With regard to subsection (3) (e) to which the hon. member for Houghton has also referred in regard to the movement of Bantu labourers between different Administration Board areas, why does he not read subsection (6) which makes it perfectly clear that any regulations made under subsection (3) (e) shall have effect only to the extent to which it is not inconsistent with the Bantu Labour Act, 1964. The Minister&#x2019;s hands are therefore bound to a very large extent and in any event the Minister cannot, in terms of subsection (6), go beyond the terms of the relevant Act &#x2014;in this case the Bantu Labour Act. Why then does he come with that story? My law advisers are of the unanimous opinion that the provisions of clause 22 with regard to regulations limit the Minister&#x2019;s power to a very large extent, and I am entirely in agreement with them. When clause 5 was discussed in this House a couple of days ago I pointed out that it was not possible for me under clause 22 to make regulations to direct a board as to how it should go about its business under clause 5.</p>

<p>I could not do it. I had to move an amendment before I had the power under clause 22 to make the necessary regulations to direct a board as to how it should go about its business with regard to <i>in camera</i> meetings. So the point I want to make, completely contrary to what hon. members opposite argue, is that the powers <span class="col_3809-3810" refersTo="page_0563"/>of the Minister are limited in terms of clause 22.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to repeat what I said during the Second Reading speech, and I am certainly not going to cover all that ground again, but the fact of the matter is that with regard to subsection (3) (f) of this supposedly very wide clause, our interpretation is that &#x201C;generally any other matter in regard to which he may consider it necessary to make regulations in order to ensure the effective administration of this Act&#x201D; refers only to matters dealt with in subsection (3) (a) to (e) and that we cannot go beyond those subsections. But we can have general items which are not covered by the wording of subsection (3) (a) to (e), but it must be related to paragraphs (a) to (e).</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister believes that the correct interpretation of this clause 22 (3) (f) is that it limits him to the five matters set out in paragraphs (a) to (e). [Interjections.] Well, it will be interesting to see whether the hon. the Deputy Minister will in fact be able to administer the Bill in that way and stick to that interpretation, because I think one has only to read the wording again to realize that the words go further. Paragraph (a) deals with the regulation and control of land owned by a board, (b) deals with the powers, functions and duties of inspectors, (c) deals with the procedure relating to the calling for and the acceptance of tenders for the execution of work, (d) deals with the adoption or establishment and maintenance by a board or by a board jointly of a medical aid fund and (e) deals with the movement of Bantu labourers.</p>

<p>The reply is obviously no, and that is why I cannot understand why the hon. the Deputy Minister sticks to his interpretation, as advanced to him by his law advisers. I have now read out the five subjects set out in (a) to (e) and his interpretation is that the general powers given in (f) entitle him only to make regulations which are related to those five matters, dealing with land, inspectors, tenders, medical aid funds and the distribution of labour. Now, quite clearly, if they are of a like kind to that, he certainly could not deal with a procedure by the board <i>in camera.</i> Therefore it little surprises one that the terms of subsection (3) (f) are so wide. I want to read this paragraph again so that everyone in this Committee can hear it. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(f) Generally any other matter in regard to which he may consider it necessary to make regulations in order to ensure the effective administration of this Act.</block>

<p>It specifically says &#x201C;any other matter &#x2026; to ensure the effective administration of this Act&#x201D;. The hon. the Deputy Minister himself said that he would want the power to make regulations about hearings <i>in camera.</i> There is nothing at all in paragraphs (a) to (e) which deal with the question of procedures of the board at all. It deals with land, inspectors, tenders, medical aid funds and the distribution of labour. Therefore I think the hon. the Deputy Minister must surely see that the very clear wording of paragraph (f) is extremely general in that it says &#x201C;&#x2026; in regard to which he may consider it necessary to make regulations in order to ensure the effective administration of this Act&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now, it is probably not worth arguing it at any great length because it seems so absolutely clear. It refers to other regulations to ensure the effective administration of this Act. There are countless things in this legislation and its administration which clearly are quite unrelated to the five subjects dealt with in the remaining subsections of this clause.</p>

<p>No, because subsection (4) is dealing with a special situation which our legal system requires and our courts have directed attention to, namely that when you make different regulations in respect of different areas and different people, etc., then you must have a specific provision to that effect. That is the point. Where you differentiate, the courts have repeatedly held regulations to be <i>ultra vires,</i> etc., because there is no power given to treat matters differently. That is why subsection (4) has been included.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree wholeheartedly with everything the hon. member for Pinelands has said. I really cannot understand why the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot see this argument. There is, however, no point in my pressing this any further.</p>

<p>I want to come back to what the hon. the Deputy Minister said in his reply just now. Unless I misunderstood him, he said that he was not going to classify Bantu labour. That is what the hon. the Deputy Minister said to me just now. May I remind him of what he said in reply to the Second Reading debate which I quoted a moment ago. It appears in Hansard, column 2422. The hon. the Deputy Minister then said that the whole matter&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">should be viewed in the light of existing legislation, i.e. that labourers are classified into the categories of commerce, industry, the building trades, the agricultural industry, domestic service, etc., so as to ensure that one does not find the wrong Bantu in the wrong categories of work.</block>

He knows as well as I do that in that bureau they are classified. The whole point here is whether or not that classification is permanent. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows that. This was the cause of the trouble with the farm Bantu in the Weenen area. He knows that. It is no good the hon. the Deputy Minister playing politics and trying to hide. He knows that. We know this as well. The crux of the whole matter is that this is what he is going to do.

<p>If he is in Johannesburg and he has the right to be in Johannesburg under section 10 of the Urban Areas Act who is that hon. member or that hon. Deputy Minister to compel that Bantu to accept certain work? Hon. members must not forget that the areas of the board will include rural areas and Bantu areas as well. Let us just go back to when the hon. the Deputy Minister introduced this measure. In Hansard of 2nd March, column 1963, he said:</p>

<p>&#x2026; this Bill should therefore be seen as a genuine attempt to achieve an efficient administrative system which will in the main have to meet three requirements, namely&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) to provide greater mobility of Bantu labour;</li>

<li>(b) to establish a more effective administrative machinery; &#x2026; and</li>

<li>(c) to join in a statutory body, and on the basis of knowledge of Bantu affairs and a real interest in the Bantu labourer, as a worker and as a person, the best talents for the achievement of the objectives mentioned.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_3813-3814" refersTo="page_0565"/>That last point is the important one. Yet here we have the hon. member for Brakpan saying what he does, after the hon. the Deputy Minister talked about treating them as people and not just as labour units, as ciphers, to be moved around at the whim and fancy of some member on that side of the House, or some members of a board who will be appointed by the Nationalist Party. This is the whole crux of the matter and it is important. This Committee is now being asked to approve that the hon. the Deputy Minister be given this power. This is another reason why we will vote against this clause.</p>

<p>Clause accordingly agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 26:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 26 is the clause which is passed off by the hon. the Deputy Minister in the explanatory memorandum which he so kindly placed before this House when he introduced this legislation, in the following terms:</p>

<block name="quote">The qualifications of Bantu in terms of section 10 (1) of the Bantu Areas Consolidation Act, 1945, in respect of prescribed areas within the board&#x2019;s administration area, are dealt with.</block>

<p>In that simple manner the hon. the Deputy Minister disposes of the whole question of what is contained in clause 26. But what do we find in clause 26 of this Bill? We find that clause 26 deals with the right of Bantu to remain in certain prescribed areas. To the hon. the Deputy Minister this might be a simple matter, something to be lightly passed over. But I want to assure the hon. the Deputy Minister that to the Bantu, this is one of the most important aspects of their whole lives, particularly to the urban Bantu, those who have obtained certain rights to remain in the urban areas notwithstanding the threats of the hon. member for Brakpan, irrespective of whether they work or not. They have obtained these rights in terms of section 10 of the Bantu Urban Areas Act, a section which <span class="col_3815-3816" refersTo="page_0566"/>was added to the Act by the late Dr. Verwoerd in 1952. The late Dr. Verwoerd then made a promise to the urban Bantu people, which was quoted earlier by the hon. member for Jeppes, namely that they would be allowed to remain there if they qualified and that their families would also be allowed to remain as long as they are qualified.</p>

<p>I quoted a little earlier the remarks of the hon. the Deputy Minister when he introduced the Second Reading of this Bill where he said that his prime object was to allow for the greater mobility of Bantu labour. This is a very laudable object and something with which we have no grouse whatsoever, as we have been at pains to point out throughout the whole debate. But when the hon. the Deputy Minister introduced clause 26 he said&#x2014;I quote from Hansard, column 1970:</p>

<block name="quote">This puts the issue beyond doubt. A Bantu does not lose his residential qualifications where he now enjoys them and if he obtains a new qualification in another prescribed area, he enjoys the same protection in regard to the newly earned qualification.</block>

<p>This is once again a very laudable intention and something which this side of the House would support. Unfortunately, we find that there is once again a sting in the tail, and in this case something has been left out of clause 26. Clause 26, briefly, allows that any Bantu who is qualified in terms of section 10 (1) (a), (b) or (c) of the Urban Areas Act may move from the prescribed area in which he is so qualified to any other area within the jurisdiction of a board when it is created, without losing those rights, until such time as he qualifies in another area and is transferred there. In other words, he is not being prejudiced at all. The point that the hon. the Deputy Minister has lost sight of is the fact that there is a fourth category of Bantu who is employed in the urban areas, who is there for a specific purpose and who has obtained special permission to be there to work and to reside there. This is outside what we should possibly call the fifth category of Bantu labour and that is the migrant or the contract labourer who is there for a specific period to do a specific job and then goes back again. I refer to those who have obtained permission in terms of section 10 (1) (d) of the Urban Areas Act, which reads, &#x201C;permission so to remain has been granted by an officer &#x2026; due regard being had to the availability of accommodation in a Bantu residential area&#x201D;. These Bantu have been given approval to stay there.</p>

<p>Today we find that many thousands of such Bantu are in the urban areas in the process of qualifying in terms of section 10 (1) (d) to remain there. Some of them have been living there for years and some of them have been living there for 9 years and 11 months. They have not yet qualified because they have not worked for one employer for a full ten years. Some have been there for 13 or 14 years, but have not yet qualified in terms of the provision which allows them to qualify for permanent residence in the prescribed area once they have resided there for 15 years and have been employed during that period. Those Bantu are not taken care of. In the light of the thinking of the Nationalist Government, what the hon. the Deputy Minister has included in the provision of clause 26 of this Bill, is a concession to the Bantu and is a privilege which he is extending to those who have qualified under section 10 (1) (a), (b) and (c). I wonder why the hon. the Deputy Minister has not allowed that same privilege to those Bantu who are in the process of qualifying and those who have legitimately the right to be in the prescribed area. They have the legitimate right to be there, because they have obtained authority in terms of section 10 (1) (d), of the Bantu Urban Areas Act. With those comments I am going to move the amendment as it stands under my name on the Order Paper, and I would like to hear the reaction of the hon. the Deputy Minister to this amendment, which I now move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 35, to omit &#x201C;or (c)&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;(c) or (d)&#x201D;; and in line 46, after &#x201C;area&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or to have broken any period of continuous employment or continuous residence or to have been employed outside such area&#x201D;.</block>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Arising out of that ruling, Mr. Chairman, I would just like to ask a simple question to the hon. the Deputy Minister. It therefore means that Bantu falling under section 10 (1) (d) of the Bantu Urban Areas Act will not be given the privilege <span class="col_3817-3818" refersTo="page_0567"/>of mobility. If he is in one prescribed area, he will not be able to move to another.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I abide by your ruling, but if you will permit me I would like to reply to the very important question which has been put by the hon. member for Jeppes. Then I will also, in a way, reply to the points which have been made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District.</p>

<p>*Perhaps I should rather do so in Afrikaans. This is a very delicate matter, and I therefore want to take this opportunity to make certain things very clear in regard to this question. In the first place, all section 10 (1) (d) cases are subject to permission. All of these are, as we call them, permission cases, i.e. as regards Bantu for visits lasting longer than 72 hours and for permission for work. This is the first point which should be understood very well. Therefore, this is quite different from section 10 (1) (a), (b) and (c) cases. The second point is that as far as employment is concerned, the permission is granted in such a way that the Bantu concerned may work in various prescribed areas within the area of an administration board. This is a direct answer to the question put by the hon. member for Jeppes. They will therefore enjoy the same privileges as are enjoyed by section 10 (1) (a), (b) and (c) cases, i.e. to work in the greater administrative areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>What about their qualifications?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with that in a moment. I want to go further. Without exception these are employment concessions. Conditions may also be laid down in granting concessions in respect of section 10 (2), and it is a general condition that Bantu in the homelands are admitted under contract to a specific employer for a period not exceeding 12 months. If such a Bantu does not remain so employed, it stands to reason that his permission is no longer valid, for he is a 12-month contract Bantu, the so-called migrant labourer to whom the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District referred. That is my second point. In regard to this matter there is also a third point which I want to make. At the moment a Bantu who finds himself in a prescribed area, may in terms of section 10 (1) (d) only build up a qualification in one prescribed area. The contract worker from the homelands who is on a 12-month contract, cannot do this in any case, for he is only here on a contract for 12 months. Therefore, that is very clear. Now I want to say most emphatically that this position is going to remain unchanged. If I wanted to change it, we would have had to amend section 10 of the Urban Areas Act, as was very clearly and rightly pointed out by you, Mr. Chairman. However, I am not doing that, and therefore the position remains absolutely unchanged. I would be very sorry if there were to be any misunderstanding in this regard, either in this House or outside. The reason why I would be sorry, is that this is a matter which affects the Bantu very closely. There should, therefore, be no misunderstanding in this regard. Whereas I have already said that such Bantu, i.e. section 10 (1) (d) cases, may take up employment in the greater administration area and that in as far as housing is available they may be provided with it so as to make it possible for them to take advantage of this greater labour mobility, and that their position in respect of qualifications remains unchanged, I now want to say most emphatically that nobody is being deprived of any rights. No Bantu is being deprived of any rights in terms of clause 26, as it is before the House at the moment. I hope that I have now made the matter very clear and that there will not be, or need not be, any misunderstanding in this regard, for I do not want there to be any misunderstanding on this.</p>

I feel that, although my amendment has been ruled out of order, it will still be competent for this Committee to discuss the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s intention and what he really means by the provisions of this clause. It is quite clear from the reply of the hon. the Deputy Minister that it <span class="col_3819-3820" refersTo="page_0568"/>is not his intention to allow for greater mobility of movement when it comes to those persons who are in the process of qualifying in terms of section 10 (1) (b) without their losing&#x2014;I am afraid it is rather difficult to describe in one word&#x2014;portion of their qualifying period. I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister knows what I am talking about. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister can give us an inkling of his thinking on this point.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that the hon. the Deputy Minister has come here with a clause which allows the Bantu to have this greater mobility. As far as those Bantu who are qualified in terms of section 10 (1) (a), (b) and (c) are concerned, this has not been a circumvention. But I do believe that it is unfair now for the hon. the Deputy Minister to leave out those who are in the process of qualifying. This is why I believe that it is an attempt to circumvent the provisions of section 10 of the Urban Areas Act. In terms of section 10, Bantu may still qualify. The door has not been closed. The register is not full. Further Bantu can qualify. But the hon. the Deputy Minister is making it no easier for the Bantu to qualify in terms of section 10. I grant him what he said, namely nobody is losing any rights or privileges which he might have had up to now. Nobody is worse off than he was before. But surely, it was in the heart of the hon. the Deputy Minister to make them better off? Surely, Sir, it should have been his object, according to what he said when he introduced the Bill, to make it easier for these people to continue to supply the labour which White South Africa requires and which the Bantu themselves require. But he is not doing it. This is why I am still suspicious that in this respect, anyway, clause 26 is going to circumvent the intention of the late Dr. Verwoerd when he introduced section 10. It was not his intention to close the door. In fact, he deliberately left the door open. The reason why he put subsection (d) into section 10 (1) of the Bantu Urban Areas Act is to allow further Bantu to qualify. But now the hon. the Deputy Minister does not make it any easier for them to qualify. He does not make it any more difficult&#x2014;I concede that point&#x2014;but he does not make it any easier for them to do so. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister could tell us why he has not made it any easier.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that there are a lot of us who are suspicious of his&#x2014;I do not mean this personally&#x2014;and the Government&#x2019;s intentions with regard to section 10 of the Bantu Urban Areas Act, especially if one considers statements such as that which was made by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to Sabra in September, 1963, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Regarding the Bantu who live in the White urban areas, you are reminded that they are not there because they are organically one with the White population, but because they come to seek sustenance there and to supply the Whites with labour. Their presence in the White areas, therefore, can be justified solely in terms of the approved work they perform.</block>

<p>I am sure the hon. the Minister, when he said that, implied that he did not believe that these Bantu should have any rights in the White areas at all. He has said so before. The only right that they should have is the right to sell their labour. Coming to the hon. the Deputy Minister himself, I promised to let him have this quotation. On the 20th June, 1969 (Hansard, column 8750) the hon. the Deputy Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let me state emphatically that we think that section 10 is an obstacle in the implementation of our policy of distinctive development. But, Sir, we have respect <span class="col_3821-3822" refersTo="page_0569"/>for the Bantu and we have respect for everything dear to us in South Africa, and if we wanted to tamper with section 10, then I, to whom the responsibility for the urban Bantu has been delegated, will have the courage of my convictions not to remove, in a sly way, the rights of the Bantu under section 10 &#x2026;</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Up to now we have been discussing the clauses of this Bill on a very high level, and the last thing I want is that in dealing here with the last clause, i.e. clause 26 which deals with a very thorny matter, we should now descend to a level which I have sought to avoid throughout this discussion. But the hon. member has now made statements here which make it difficult for me to react to them in a calm and composed manner. Consequently I am going to say as little as possible about them. However, what I do want to say, is that when the hon. member claims that this legislation, and specifically clause 26, does not make it any easier for the Bantu to have greater mobility of labour, then, with all due respect, I do not have at my command words to say what I think of such a view. All I can say, is that when he speaks that way, he is speaking about things of which he has no understanding or knowledge. The legal draftsmen worded clause 26 the way it was done here with the specific intention of making it possible for section 10 (I) (a), (b) and (c) cases to sell their labour in the greater administration area, and to sell it easily. That is the intention, and here it has been recorded that way in black and white. Any person with intelligence will read it that way. I challenge hon. members opposite, including the hon. member for Houghton, to prove the contrary. But now the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District has made this statement. For whose ears does he say it? If it remained within these four walls, it could still be in order. But for whose benefit is he saying that this legislation does not make it possible for the Bantu to sell their labour more easily, and that we are circumventing section 10 by these means?</p>

<p>I regard this as being the most irresponsible statement I have heard in a very long time, a statement which I find difficult to discuss in a cool and composed manner. I therefore want to register my strongest protest, not only against that hon. member, but also against the Opposition for the statements he made. They are not calculated to promote good relations in this country. As far as section 10 (1) (d) cases are concerned, I read out here a written document in reply to a question put to me by the hon. member for Jeppes. I did so because I did not want there to be any misunderstanding whatsoever in this regard. After all, I very clearly said that a section 10 (1) (d) Bantu who at present finds himself in the prescribed area with permission, would, with permission, be able to sell his labour in the greater administration area, and also that as regards housing such a Bantu would be able to obtain it, if it were available. In the light of this I object to the fact that the hon. member regarded clause 26 in the spirit in which he did. I am honestly not able to make the position any clearer, and I trust that hon. members opposite are satisfied with the unambiguous assurance I gave in regard to clause 26. A great deal of attention was given to clause 26, and here in this legislation it has been recorded in very clear language for everybody to read.</p>

<p>As the law stands at present, if a Bantu living in a certain prescribed area moves to another, that is to say, if this Bill is passed into law, he forfeits his right to live in the original area.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This is not the first time that legislation in regard to the sale of land on instalments has been before this House. On the fate of previous attempts at legislation in this particular connection, I do not now want to elaborate here. Those attempts are, however, an indication that the need for legislation to regulate legal relationships between the parties that have an interest in contracts of purchase and sale of land under which the purchase price is payable in instalments, has already been felt for many years. Previous attempts to place legislation in regard to the subject in question on the Statute Book probably failed because it is very difficult to regulate legal relationships with regard to these particular types of contract by means of legislation. Although most legal rules with regard to commitments which result from contracts arise out of usage, and those legal rules have been put to the test through years of application, the parties to such contracts still find themselves in situations which in time become more and more complicated. The rate at which economic development has taken place, has in many cases led to its being possible to regard existing legal rules as being inadequate. Apart from that the practice has developed that sellers of land on instalments, as in other cases, make use of standard contract forms.</p>

<p>These standard contract forms often contain provisions in terms of which the purchaser relinquishes that protection afforded him by common law. In many cases the purchaser does not read the contents of the contract and, even if he does read them, he does not for the most part understand the implications of certain clauses appearing in the contract. If the purchaser does in fact have objections to any term or condition included in the contract, he will often be swayed by the assurance of the seller that the danger he envisages is not a real one. Because all sellers make use of the above-mentioned standard contract forms when entering into credit transactions, the purchaser must either sign the contract or forfeit the credit facilities. I am mentioning these considerations only because there are persons who allege that there is no need for the proposed legislation. I may add that continual complaints are being submitted to various State Departments in regard to alleged abuses occurring in the sale of land on instlaments. Arising out of these complaints an inter-departmental committee was appointed a few years ago to institute an investigation into this matter. This committee submitted comprehensive recommendations in regard to legislation which, in its opinion, would be necessary to eliminate these alleged abuses. <i>Inter alia</i> the committee recommended that the following general principles should be borne in mind in the formulation of the legislation which it proposed:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) all parties that have an interest in juristic acts in regard to the sale of land on instalments must receive full <span class="col_3827-3828" refersTo="page_0572"/>notification of such acts and, where necessary, agree to them;</li>

<li>(b) the rights and obligations of parties in terms of existing contracts must not be unfavourably affected by the proposed legislation;</li>

<li>(c) the preferential rights of insured creditors must not be prejudiced by the envisaged legislation;</li>

<li>(d) the right of any person to mortgage or to pledge his assets must not be affected, and</li>

<li>(e) the settlement of insolvent estates must not be delayed indefinitely.</li>

</ol>

<p>Because, as I already said, it is difficult to formulate legislation in regard to this particular subject, a Bill which was based on the recommendations of the above mentioned committee was published for general information and comment in the <i>Gazette</i> at the end of 1969. A considerable amount of comment was received and discussions were on various occasions held with various organizations which had an interest in the legislation in order to eliminate the objections they raised in regard to the envisaged legislation. The Sale of Land on Instalments Bill which is now before the House, is the result of this comprehensive system of consultation which was conducted with the various interested parties.</p>

<p>I shall now explain the principles included in the various clauses of the Bill. Six or so concepts are defined as is customary, in clause I for the purposes of the legislation. Here I only want to point out that, as has been done in the long title of the Bill, the definition of the concept &#x201C;contract&#x201D; makes it clear that the legislation only relates to contracts of purchase and sale of land in terms of which the purchase price is payable in instalments over a period of one year or longer. The cases where a person purchases land, pays a deposit and then takes out a mortgage within one year to settle the balance of the purchase price of the land, is therefore excluded. Because the same piece of land in practice sometimes comprises the object of more than one contract, the cession of the rights to claim in terms of a contract is also included in the concept in question. If this were not the case the provisions of the envisaged legislation could be circumvented by means of cessions.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 2 the application of the proposed legislation is for the most part limited to contracts which are concluded by natural persons and which relate to residential plots in the area of a local authority. Certain bodies as well as local authorities are exempted from the legislation because direct and indirect control is being exercised over the conditions under which they sell residential plots. Clauses 10 up to and including 14 of the envisaged legislation will also be applicable to contracts which are still in force when the legislation comes into operation.</p>

<p>In clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill the formal requirements to which a contract in respect of the sale of land on instalments must apply are laid down. It is regarded as being important that such a contract shall be drawn up in the official language which the purchaser has mastered best. In addition, it is being provided that the contract shall contain information regarding 16 different matters which are defined in the Bill. If these particulars are omitted from the contract, it could in the long run be to the detriment of the parties. <i>Inter alia,</i> a contract may not reflect the same address in respect of the purchaser and the seller, unless that address is the address where the purchaser is ordinarily resident. This arrangement will ensure that purchasers do in fact receive the kind of written notification required by the legislation. In addition it is prohibited that the purchaser accepts the risk in respect of the land he has purchased before he has taken possession or occupation of the land.</p>

<p>I also want to refer here to the provisions of clauses 16 and 17 since they relate to the terms of clauses 3 and 4. Clause 16 requires the parties to a contract to give reciprocal written notice of any change of address. Clause 17 provides that, if a contract does not comply with the formal terms of the legislation and the purchaser is substantially prejudiced as a result, he may apply within two years from the date upon which the contract was entered into the magistrates&#x2019; court within whose area of jurisdiction the land is situated to have the contract declared void, or for alternative forms of relief.</p>

<p>It is also regarded as being important that a person should receive a copy of the contract in which he is the purchaser. Clause 5 requires that a copy of the contract shall be supplied by the seller to the purchaser within one month after the conclusion of such contract. If the purchaser <span class="col_3829-3830" refersTo="page_0573"/>does not receive a copy of the contract he may send the seller a reminder and request that he be furnished with a copy within 14 days. If the seller, after such reminder, still fails to do so, the purchaser shall not be liable for the payment of interest under the contract to the date on which he receives the copy.</p>

<p>In contrast to the position in certain other credit transactions the maximum rate of interest on the sale of land on instalments is not at present being controlled. In the first place therefore it is necessary to define the concept &#x201C;interest&#x201D;. Secondly, it is necessary to lay down clear provisions in respect of the amounts, apart from the purchase price and interest, which the seller may claim from the purchaser in regard to the transaction. According to the provisions of clause 6 the maximum rate of interest in terms of the contract shall not be higher than that of building societies. The clause also provides that interest shall not be calculated more often than monthly and not less often than quarterly on the outstanding balance in terms of the contract. This clause is in accordance with the general usage in practice.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that purchasers often forfeit the protection which they enjoy in terms of common law. Clause 7 is aimed at eliminating this problem and certain other prejudicial negotiations.</p>

<p>Clause 8 regulates the position in respect of stop orders and prohibits a person from forfeiting his remuneration or an amount which he receives periodically for his maintenance. Employers who supply their employees with housing, are exempted from the provisions in question.</p>

<p>The provisions of clause 9 provide that the seller shall once during every period of 12 months from the date on which a contract is concluded, furnish the purchaser with a statement of account in order to keep him informed of his financial obligations in terms of the contract. If the seller does not comply with this obligation, the purchaser, after he has sent the seller a reminder and one month has elapsed, shall not be liable for the payment of interest under the contract during the duration of such omission.</p>

<p>The envisaged legislation does not contain provisions in respect of the term of contracts or in respect of the amount of the instalments in proportion to the purchase price and the term. It is therefore possible that such small instalments may be negotiated in terms of a contract that the purchaser is hardly able, with such payments, to pay off the interest which accrues in terms of the contract. Clause 10 consequently provides that the purchaser may at his discretion make larger payments than those negotiated in the contract and may settle any amount which may be owing before the due date according to the contract.</p>

<p>Clause 11 deals with the case where the rights in terms of a contract to claim transfer of land is ceded and where land which is purchased on instalments is again sold on instalments before it has been transferred to the first purchaser. The latter type of transaction is for the purposes of the proposed legislation also deemed to be a cession by the purchaser of his rights in terms of a contract to claim transfer of the land from the seller. One of the problems which is at present being experienced with such succeeding transactions is that one of the middle parties in the chain may become insolvent. Transfers will then have to follow the sequence of the juristic acts and in practice the trustee of the insolvent estate is not prepared to give transfer. The proposed legislation therefore stipulates that provided the alienation by the insolvent is not a voidable juristic act, the cessionary may obtain transfer directly from the registered owner. The clause also makes it clear that the cessionary and any other successor in title of the purchaser may dispose of his right to claim under the contract in the same way as with any other asset in his estate. It may happen that a purchaser who has purchased land on instalments from the registered owner and who has ceded his right to transfer of the land, subsequently fails to comply with his obligations under the contract of purchase and sale. This happens for the most part when the cedent finds himself in financial difficulties. The cessionary will then be unable, without the consent of the cedent, to render performance to the registered owner and to settle such performance against his obligations to the cedent. However, if the cedent with the consent of the registered owner also assigns his obligations in terms of the contract to the cessionary, the latter will in fact have the power to render performance directly to the registered owner. In order to confer this power to the cessionary it is being provided that, if a cedent does not comply with his obligations under a contract with the registered owner of land, the cessionary make make <span class="col_3831-3832" refersTo="page_0574"/>payment directly to the registered owner of the land. Such payments will consequently be deemed to be valid payments to the cedent and the latter shall not be entitled to claim such payments from the cessionary in turn. By making use of this right, the cessionary is left in the position to safeguard his own right to obtain transfer of the land. To ensure that the registered owner of the land shall inform the cessionary of any omission on the part of the cedent it is being provided that the cessionary must inform the registered owner of the cession.</p>

<p>In order to obtain transfer, the transferee must submit to the Registrar of Deeds proof of payment of any transfer duties payable in respect of the transactions by means of which he obtained the right to claim transfer of the land. I want to emphasize that a cession by a person of his right to claim transfer of land is not exempted from transfer duties. However, since the Bill makes provision for the transfer of land directly from the registered owner to a cessionary, proof of the payment of transfer duties in respect of all the transactions in question will have to be submitted in regard to such a transfer. The Bill provides that a cedent shall hand over to send to the cessionary the transfer duty receipts of all relevant preceding transactions. Should the cedent omit or fail to furnish the cessionary with the transfer duty receipts, the latter may send the cedent a reminder and if the cedent does not let the cessionary have the receipt within one month, then the cessionary shall not be liable for payment of interest under the cession from the time the said one month expires until the receipts are delivered. If the cessionary, in order to obtain transfer of land pays the transfer duties, including fines, to which another person is liable, he may by law recover the amount of such transfer duties, including fines from such person.</p>

<p>Ownership of land is not, as in the case of movable goods, transferred by mere delivery. If the registered owner of land sells that land on instalments, he will, apart from the land, also have the contract as an asset in his estate. The registered owner will therefore, subject to the rights of the purchaser, be able to sell that land on instalments again to another person. The rights and obligations of parties to such a transaction are clearly defined in existing law. The envisaged legislation does not therefore deal with this matter. However, clause 13 does in fact cover the case where the registered owner of land or the person who purchased the land from him and then sold it again, uses the contract of purchase and sale of land on instalments to obtain funds. At present a considerable trade in hire-purchase contracts with regard to movable goods is taking place. It is possible that when the proposed legislation is passed, the practice will arise that the seller of land on instalments will assign the contract to another person who is prepared to purchase it. For the most part the seller in such a case will have little further interest in the land or the contract. Clause 12 therefore provides that the person who takes over the rights and obligations of the seller under the contract shall also have power of attorney to transfer the land to the purchaser once the latter has fulfilled his obligations under the contract. The envisaged legislation also provides that the purchaser shall consent to the transaction and the assignee may appoint a conveyancer to execute the transfer. The legislation provides further that the assignee shall immediately notify the purchaser of such assignment so that the purchaser will know to whom he must make his payments. If the purchaser makes payments to the seller in good faith, the assignee shall not be entitled to claim such payments from the purchaser in turn.</p>

<p>In terms of existing law the seller, under a contract of purchase and sale of land on instalments, may immediately resale from a contract when the purchaser omits or fails to fulfil and obligation under a contract. There is no obligation on the seller to send the purchaser a reminder first. Various complaints have been received in which it was alleged that the existing legal position is being exploited. It is possible that a person can lose land which he purchased simply because he was late in paying the last instalment. What is more, he may then perhaps have to forfeit everything he paid under the contract. Clause 13 of the envisaged legislation now provides that the seller must send the purchaser a reminder and, only if the purchaser has after one month after such reminder not fulfilled his obligation, will the seller be able to take action to cancel the contract or to claim damages.</p>

<p>I come now to one of the most complicated problems which crop up in the sale of land on instalments. This is the fact that creditors of the registered owner of land which has been sold on instalments may <span class="col_3833-3834" refersTo="page_0575"/>attach that land and then cause it to be sold in execution, and apply the proceeds of such sale to meet the claims of the creditors against the said owner. For understandable reasons the purchaser, when the land is attached, will be in a very difficult position. In most cases land which has been sold on instalments will have been encumbered with a mortgage bond. However, the mortgage bond will not prevent the uninsured creditors of the owner of land from attaching that land. In such a case the mortgagee may, however, place a reserve price on the land in regard to the sale in execution.</p>

<p>The building societies are of course the principle holders of mortgages on the land which is sold on instalments. It is therefore very important that the position of the building societies should not be endangered by the legislation. Nevertheless it is being regarded as essential that an arrangement should be made in terms of which the interests of the parties to the sale in execution of land shall be weighed up on a fairer basis than is at present the case.</p>

<p>As a result of representations in regard to this matter received from the South African Association of Law Societies, it was decided that a preferential right may be granted to the purchaser of land on instalments in respect of the proceeds of that land if it is sold in execution. Clause 14 (1) of the envisaged legislation provides that the purchaser who purchased land under a contract from the registered owner, shall have such a preferential right. The preference of the purchaser in question shall rank directly after the preferential rights of any holder of a mortgage bond over the land. The purchaser will be able to prove a preferential claim against the proceeds of the land for the amount of the purchase price which he has paid off under the contract, plus interest calculated at 5 per cent per annum in respect of the period from the date of the conclusion of the contract to the date on which the land is sold in execution. The said preferential claim will of course not exclude the purchaser from bringing a claim against the seller in regard to the improvements he has made to the land or the damages he has suffered.</p>

<p>It is provided both in the Insolvency Act as well as in common law that certain transactions entered into by an insolvent before the sequestration or liquidation of his estate may be declared null and void by a court of law. In terms of existing law the trustee of the insolvent estate has the option of maintaining or cancelling the contract, and he need not afford the purchaser an opportunity of taking transfer of the land. This position is now being amended in such a way that the purchaser, despite the insolvency of the registered owner of land which was sold on instalments will be able to obtain transfer of the land provided he is able to comply with certain conditions.</p>

<p>The proposed legislation makes provision for two possible circumstances in respect of land which has been sold on instalments and which is placed at the disposal of the creditors of the registered owner. Firstly, there is the case where the land is not subject to a mortgage bond. This type of case will probably not occur frequently in practice because a person for the most part uses his assets to obtain funds and it may therefore be expected that the person who experiences problems in meeting his financial obligations will encumber his assets as far as he is able to do so.</p>

<p>Before land which has been sold on instalments can be sold in execution, the attaching creditor, or the trustee or the liquidator in the case where the registered owner of the land is insolvent shall instruct the purchaser to take transfer of the land. In the absence of a mortgage bond over the land, the purchaser shall be given six months to pay the outstanding balance under the contract plus interest until the date of transfer. He is also allowed, as the case may be, to make arrangements to the satisfaction of the messenger of the court, the deputy sheriff or the master of the Supreme Court for the payment of that amount.</p>

<p>In the second instance the envisaged legislation makes provision for the case where, in aforementioned circumstances, the land which is sold on instalments, is subject to a mortgage bond. At the high interest rates which are at present payable under mortgage bonds, interest will accrue very rapidly if no instalments are paid under the mortgage bond. Consequently the proposed legislation stipulates that the purchaser shall, within one month of being so instructed, make arrangements to take transfer of the land.</p>

<p>However, the legislation also provides that the purchaser must make arrangements for the payment of the outstanding balance under the mortgage bond plus interest to the date of transfer, or the outstanding <span class="col_3835-3836" refersTo="page_0576"/>balance under the contract plus interest to the date of transfer, whichever is the greatest. In order to safeguard the position of mortgages further, the proposed legislation provides that the purchaser is not entitled to transfer unless the costs of the mortgagee are covered in the case where he has attached land which was sold on instalments. In addition the legislation provides that the purchaser, if he has to pay more than he was liable to pay under the contract by virtue of the abovementioned arrangements, may recover the amount which he paid more from the seller. It is realized that, when the seller is insolvent, such a juristic claim against the seller&#x2019;s insolvent estate offers scant comfort, but these provisions are regarded as being necessary and equitable in the general public interest.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned before that waiver of rights by the purchaser is to his detriment in the long run. Clause 15 therefore contains provisions which prohibits the waiver of rights by a purchaser.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to mention that the envisaged legislation shall also be applicable to the Territory of South-West Africa and that the legislation shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by the State President by proclamation.</p>

<p>I should like to draw hon. members&#x2019; attention to the amendments to this Bill which appear under my name on the Order Paper. I shall explain the reasons for these amendments during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>In addition, hon. members will find that in the Order Paper, page 256, there is a new clause to follow clause 4. At this stage I want to inform, hon. members who have misgivings about this new clause that I will not proceed with the new clause 5, as printed on the Order Paper. Misgivings have been expressed to me in this connection, and I came to the conclusion that I was unable to proceed with this clause.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has dealt at great length with the purpose and the details of this Bill, and I do not propose to repeat what it is going to do for the buyer of land on instalments. This question of the protection of a buyer of land on instalments has been under consideration, as the hon. the Minister has said, for a considerable period of time. The Bill was actually published in 1969. We welcome the principles inherent in this Bill and we will support the Second Reading, because we believe that this Bill provides much-needed protection for the buyers of land and buildings who pay the purchase price over a period of time. We believe that protection for this type of buyer is in fact long overdue. It is strange how many buyers are absolute innocents when it comes to this type of transaction and it is necessary that they should be protected. The hon. the Minister gave a typical example when he mentioned the standard contract. It is true that dozens and dozens of buyers of land will sign a standard form of contract with absolutely no knowledge at all of what is contained in that contract. As we all know, the small print in the contract, put small in a contract by a dishonest party to the contract, is something that we very seldom read, however experienced we may be in our particular profession. The written word seems to cast a spell on us, and we are apt to let things go by default. If we do it, Sir, you can imagine the effect on a poor innocent person who is buying land.</p>

<p>Fortunately today a large volume of the land that is being sold is sold through reputable land developers. Today in this country we have land developers on a large scale whose integrity is beyond doubt, and this factor alone has given a large modicum of protection to the buyer of land, because the land developer and the reputable estate agent today probably handle 90 per cent of all land transactions. Nevertheless it is essential that the buyer should be protected, because there will always be people who, because they lack experience, have to be protected against unscrupulous persons. That is why we welcome the provision contained in this Bill that unless certain provisions actually form part of the contract, the contract may be void. We welcome the provision with regard to information that has to be given to the buyer, with regard to statements that have to be sent to him, with regard to interest rates which have to be agreed upon, and with regard to the protection that will be given to the buyer on the insolvency of the seller. That is something which the hon. the Minister dealt with in great detail and I do not want to repeat what he said. Sir, all of us who have had anything to do with this type of transaction know what hardship is caused time and time again where a person has bought land and the seller has then gone insolvent and the buyer is left with a normal claim in an insolvent estate. He will now be given the <span class="col_3837-3838" refersTo="page_0577"/>benefit of a preferential claim, while the bondholder will be protected.</p>

<p>Another important provision which is to the benefit of a person entering into this type of transaction is the provision renting to a cessionary, which the hon. the Minister has dealt with. If that provision were not in the legislation, then I think the whole structure could be disrupted by the purchaser simply handing over to a second person, and if that transaction is not protected, the Act will be of very little value.</p>

<p>Sir, this Bill has been a fairly contentious one, as the hon. the Minister has said. It has been a very difficult one, and that is why it has taken so many years to reach this House. We know that a great many representations have been made to the hon. the Minister by a great number of organizations. We ourselves have had certain reservations on certain aspects of the Bill, and I want to thank the hon. the Minister and his department for the way in which they have listened to the representations that we have made and the way in which they have reacted to them. It has been a strange situation, Mr. Speaker; it is almost as if we have had an unofficial select committee considering this Bill. I think this is a good thing in the case of legislation of this kind. My legal colleagues, the hon. members for Musgrave and Jeppes, have done yeoman work in this connection, and together with the department we have been able to arrive at a Bill which in the main both sides can accept and which I think will be acceptable on both sides. I think what has happened here has shown Parliament at its best, that is to say, where we have the Government and the Opposition co-operating on a Bill which we want but which presents certain technical difficulties. We managed to iron out most of our problems.</p>

<p>It has not been an easy Bill and that is why the Minister has had to put so many amendments on the Order Paper. He has tried to meet the objections and the representations and to remove the anomalies that appeared in this Bill. Sir, this is basically a legal Bill. A controversy has been raging, for example, as to what is the difference between a cession and an assignment. To me me a layman this controversy has grown out of all proportion, because to the best of my limited legal knowledge one simply says, &#x201C;I cede, transfer, assign and deliver&#x201D; thus covering every contingency in the one phrase, but we do not seem to have been able to do that here and we have had to have discussions and to make adjustments to take care of certain judgments which apparently are known to few people and should be known to more people. But at least we have dealt with these matters.</p>

<p>Sir, there are still, however, a number of matters which perhaps require a little more examination and we may have to move one or two small amendments in the Committee Stage. These matters I am going to leave to my colleagues to deal with in the main, but there are one or two that I would like to mention. The first is in clause 2. Here the hon. the Minister, while making provision for the application of this Bill, is proposing to insert a proviso to the effect that the Act shall &#x201C;not apply in respect of a contract relating to land&#x2014;(i) of which the State, including, for purposes of the application of this Act in the territory of South-West Africa, the Administration of that territory, is the seller or which is held in trust by the State or a Minister for any person; (ii) forming part of a scheduled Bantu area &#x2026; or of a released area &#x2026;; (iii) to which the provisions of the Rural Coloured Areas Act, 1963, apply; (iv) of which the Community Development Board referred to in section 2 of the Community Development Act, 1966, the Housing Commission or a local authority is the seller&#x201D;. Sir, we see no reason why there should be these exceptions. We believe that if this Bill is good for the layman, for the man in the street, its provisions should apply to Government and <i>quasi</i>-Government Departments as well. It may well be said that the State or a province or the Community Development Board or the Rural Coloured Areas Administration would never do anything which may be prejudicial to a buyer. Well, Sir, perhaps if I said that this is a matter of opinion, I could leave it there. We would like to see these exceptions in clause 2 removed so that the Bill <i>per se</i> will apply to every sale of land on an instalment system irrespective of who the seller is. Then we will know that everybody is fully protected.</p>

<p>Sir, we are glad to hear from the hon. the Minister that he has decided not to move the new clause 5. This new clause 5 has, I think, given everybody a great deal to think about because it has merit; there is no doubt about it, but the question was whether the good was greater than the bad or whether the bad was greater than the good. I am glad to see that the hon. the <span class="col_3839-3840" refersTo="page_0578"/>Minister subscribes to the view that the bad was greater than the good and that we will do more good by leaving out this clause. I think it originates from the Niemand Commission&#x2019;s report, when they suggested that there should be this type of clause. I think that where we have to be careful&#x2014; and the hon. the Minister has been careful &#x2014;is to note that the Niemand Commission&#x2019;s report was dealt with and published at a time of exceptional prosperity and economic upsurge in this country, and I believe that a number of the provisions of that report do not apply under normal circumstances. I believe that had we gone ahead with this clause to make provision that a deposit had to be paid at an amount fixed by the hon. the Minister, it would have done more harm as regards providing land for the average person than good. Therefore we welcome the fact that the hon. the Minister has withdrawn it.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 6 we have a small problem, one which has also been discussed to a considerable extent. Tin Minister in clause 6 (2) is trying to tie the interest rates to interest rates charged by building societies. We would like to see an amendment in this clause whereby we say interest rates charged by any building society or a building society. We believe that would give clarity to the clause and make it self-explanatory.</p>

<p>In clause 6 (3) we have a problem as well, which my legal friends will deal with to a greater extent. But it seems to us that provision is made here for the non-payment of certain types of costs which would be payable under common law. We see no reason why these costs should not be paid, even if they are not specifically specified in the contract. For example, in subjection (3) (iv), the costs which are lawfully recoverable from the purchaser in connection with the recovery of any amount which is owed by him under the contract is a norm. It should be recoverable, and this clause appears to us to mean that you cannot recover these costs unless there is specific provision in the contract so to recover it. But my legal friends will take the matter further.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 7 (e), which is to be amended by the hon. the Minister, we would prefer to see his amendment not proceeded with and the clause left as it is, because we believe that that would make the position far clearer.</p>

<p>We have had a great deal of trouble with clause 11. This is the clause dealing with cessionaries and sellers. The phrase &#x201C;registered owner&#x201D; appears here for the first time. A number of changes are proposed in clause 11 which the hon. the Minister is amending in terms of his amendment which is on the Order Paper. We think this takes the problem part of the way, but we still have certain reservations in regard to this clause, and my legal friends will deal with it in greater detail.</p>

<p>Generally, as I have said, we welcome this Bill. It has been a difficult Bill, but I think it is going to give the protection that the public needs, the protection that no honest seller of land will object to and the protection which honest sellers of land will welcome. I think that generally the Bill will do a lot to raise the standard of transactions of the sale of land on the instalment system, and this is something which is very essential indeed. The hon. member for Salt River has come to me on a number of occasions with regard to the sale of land in his area, where properties have been sold and taken back and sold again and taken back again, and where the seller of the property never intends to give transfer to the purchaser. The whole deal is constructed on the basis that the buyer will not be able to pay and the seller will retain his property. Now the provisions of this Bill will stop that type of transaction. We welcome the Bill and will support it.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>I find myself in the position of having to support the hon. member for Parktown in regard to the matters he raised, particularly his recommendation that this Bill ought to be made applicable to all contracts irrespective of whether the purchase sum is paid off by way of instalments. I shall motivate this a little further.</p>

<p>A normal land transaction begins in the office of an estate agent, a man who moves around outside. He has a printed offer and acceptance form. Often he is not a knowledgeable person who know all the finer nuances of the law. He must persuade both purchaser and seller, sometimes late in the night, and subsequently through sheer discouragement some party or other signs the form. That offer and acceptance form produces problems in practice, because in reality it is a contract of purchase and sale. What will therefore happen now, if this Bill should become law, is that an estate agent who in practice brings the purchaser and the seller together, will have to see to it that his purchase <span class="col_3841-3842" refersTo="page_0579"/>and acceptance form fulfils the requirements of this Bill if it falls within the framework of the Bill. But what happens next in practice is that such an estate agent takes his broker&#x2019;s letter, as it is known, to an attorney and the latter draws up the contract of purchase and sale; and do you know, Sir, that in the eyes of the public a contract of purchase and sale is not accepted as such unless it has been drawn up by an attorney. Very rarely do members of the public realize that the offer and acceptance form already constitutes a contract of purchase and sale. Consequently my argument is that we, in order to regulate this whole field with which we are dealing, should make it applicable to other transactions and we should&#x2014;this is a far-reaching idea&#x2014;perhaps consider stipulating that such contracts shall not have legal force unless they are executed before a knowledgeable person, namely a conveyancer or a notary. This is just by way of an exchange of ideas. This does not mean that I do not otherwise support the principle of this Bill. I do so gladly.</p>

<p>As far as the other recommendation of the hon. member for Parkown in regard to clause 6 is concerned, I abo think that we should find a different formula here for the determination of the rate of interest. for we so often find in practice that a building society, for example, does not allow loans on small-holdings, and many of the transactions which will fall under this Bill will relate to small-holdings. That much as far as the reply to the hon. member for Parktown is concerned.</p>

<p>I should just like to sketch the need, as I see it. for this Bill. After so many people burnt their fingers on the share market, they turned to fixed property, to immovable goods. Land is becoming a commodity. When we open the week-end newspapers we see, with reference to land which is advertised in the Cape only, that there is hardly a piece of land which cannot be bought on so-called hire purchase. According to the Niemand Commission there are 40 000 plots in Greater Cape Town alone which are lying vacant and looking for an owner. Just as it is almost impossible for one in the business world to acquire anything without a deposit, the same now applies to land. I still think that unscrupulous developers, those who pretend to be developers, have induced people by means of attractive terms to conclude transactions with them but at a tremendously high rate of interest. Effective rates of interest between 12 to 18 per cent were not unusual. Now it has certainly become the task of the State to protect the most precious of our goods, i.e. land, and to ensure that it is not prejudiced by speculation and by court cases which threaten to take place every day because people have acted unscrupulously.</p>

<p>We want to prevent in this way the fragmentation of land. We want to prevent people from exploiting in an unscrupulous way the ignorance of innocent buyers. Now we are not implying in this way that we want to deny anyone the right to possess a piece of Mother Earth. Let us consider the number of transactions or varieties of transactions which can arise out of this. So for example we can find that A sells to B, B to C, C to D and D to E. The contract of purchase and sale gets lost. E subsequently does not know who the registered owner is. When E wants to take transfer he finds that the original owner has encumbered the land to such an extent that this person owes the building society more than E in actual fact owes him in terms of the contract of purchase and sale. He then stands helpless, as it were.</p>

<p>One finds a situation that with these multiple transactions evasion of transfer duties takes place. Last but not least, in this process it is inevitable that perjury must follow. The last person who takes transfer must state under oath that he is not aware of any other transactions, or something to that effect, and that all transfer duties in respect of cancelled transactions have been paid. That he cannot do. I wonder how many similar statements are lying around in desk drawers throughout our country which the Receiver of Revenue does not know about. Consequently this legislation envisages that moneys which belong to the exchequer will end up there.</p>

<p>What happens further? We find the situation that a purchaser of a property finds that his predecessor has disappeared. He finds that the person who has disappeared made certain improvements to the property. He buys it with the idea that the improvements will be his. He then pays one single instalment, and the original owner comes down on him and in terms of the contract between the original owner and the first purchaser the contract can now be cancelled and everything forfeited. The consequence is that the innocent purchaser must in the end forfeit everything. When this is taken into account, we would like to see legislation being enacted which <span class="col_3843-3844" refersTo="page_0580"/>will in principle afford protection against these possibilities.</p>

<p>The registered owner as seller, from the nature of his situation, enjoys protection, but not the purchaser. The purchaser is also threatened by quite a number of situations with prejudicial consequences which can arise from non-payment of debt by the registered owner or by the predecessor of a purchaser. This can also arise from the fact that the trustee of an insolvent estate may decide not to maintain the contract of purchase and sale of a property on instalments. He then cancels the contract of purchase and sale and all the purchaser has, is a claim for damages. This Bill envisages counter-acting all these prejudicial consequences which such a transaction constitutes for the purchaser. That is why I support this Bill in principle.</p>

<p>As far as particular clauses are concerned, one can ask questions and one can argue this matter. I think however that it is a matter which should be dealt with during the Committee Stage. I may just mention that I think that this Bill should also make provision for sectional titles which, in our opinion, are going to come, as the State President indicated in his opening speech. This, too, is probably a matter which will receive attention in future. It is a privilege for me to support the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is new legislation which is being introduced and is, as the hon. member for Parktown has already mentioned, important legislation for the reason that it provides protection for purchasers of land who are buying on terms. There is no doubt that in the past some sellers have taken advantage of the less-informed purchasers and have exploited them. This type of legislation, therefore, is necessary to deal with such cases. However, I think it should be made clear, in order to put this matter in its proper perspective, that as is often the case with malpractices, it is just the few who have been guilty and, as a result, have given a bad name to people who deal with land generally. The larger property development companies have, I believe, shown that they have had a very responsible approach to this matter and without exception have not indulged in these malpractices. They, of course, do not need to have this type of legislation in order to protect the purchasers; it is just the few. However, as the hon. member for Park-town has pointed out, we on this side of the House are happy to be able to support this legislation, particularly in view of the fact that most of the difficulties we had arising from the Bill, which is before us, have been met by the amendments which the hon. the Minister has placed on the Order Paper in his name. He has indicated today that he proposes to move these amendments at the Committee Stage. We are happy that he is not proceeding with the proposed new clause 5, because there is no doubt that this is a clause which is not only subject to criticism, but could be the cause of a number of problems.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein West has suggested that this legislation should be made applicable to all contracts of purchase and sale of land. We would not be prepared to go that far and it is not necessary for me to go into much detail on this subject, because this proposal is not before the House at this stage. However, we would urge the hon. the Minister to reconsider the exclusion of the Bantu Trust, the Community Development Board and the National Housing Commission from the provisions of this Bill. It may be argued in support of such a proposal that what the Bill is aiming at doing is to guard against prejudice and oppression of purchasers by unscrupulous sellers. It may also be argued that these State bodies can be relied upon not to indulge in these practices. But that is only one side of the Bill, namely to prevent prejudice and oppression.</p>

<p>The other side of the Bill is that there are many clauses contained in this Bill which are giving purchasers certain advantages which they do not now enjoy. These advantages have nothing to do with the matter of prejudice and oppression. I will refer the hon. the Minister, for example, to the proposed clause 9 which provides for a statement of account and to the proposed clause 10 which gives the right to purchasers to accelerate payment. Then of course, there are the important clauses dealing with cession, namely clauses 11 and 12. Purchasers from State bodies may well wish to cede their rights to other purchasers. Those clauses dealing with session, are as important in respect of a purchase from the State as they are in respect of purchases from private individuals. Then there is clause 13 which provides for the limitation of the rights of the seller to take action.</p>

<p><span class="col_3845-3846" refersTo="page_0581"/>Clause 14 is of course, a great advantage. But obviously, it will be argued that the State bodies are unlikely to become insolvent. Therefore, that clause would not be applicable and that can be accepted.</p>

<p>Clause 15 is also important. It deals with the waiver of rights of a purchaser and provides that:</p>

<block name="quote">The waiver by any person who has bought land under a contract, of a right which is conferred upon him by this Act, shall be null and void.</block>

<p>This is another clause which has nothing to do with oppression or malpractice or anything of that sort, but is a distinct advantage and benefit to a purchaser.</p>

<p>For these reasons and others on which we will elaborate when clause 2 is dealt with during the Committee Stage, we hope the hon. the Minister will reconsider the provision which, at the moment, is exempting State bodies from the provisions of this Bill. We believe that these are good provisions. This is a good Bill and a necessary one. Being a good Bill it should apply equally to all contracts of the type which are intended, namely the contracts for the purchase and sale of land under which the purchase price is payable in instalments over a period of one year or longer. We would however, not wish to see the Bill made applicable to all contracts of purchase and sale of land as was suggested by the hon. member for Bloemfontein West. Within those limits we believe the Bill should be made to apply to all contracts, irrespective of who the seller is.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Parktown has mentioned, there are certain clauses which still give us problems and we will deal with them to a greater extent in the Committee Stage. In order to give the hon. the Minister a little time to consider one of these, in addition to those mentioned by the hon. member for Parktown, I would briefly mention the following in regard to clause 11 (7). Subsection (7), as it is worded at present, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the seller fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (6) &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the handing over of a receipt for transfer duty payable&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and he remains in default for more than one month to furnish the cessionary with the receipt referred to in the said subsection after the cessionary has in writing asked him therefor, the cessionary shall not be liable for payment of interest under the cession from the date on which the said one month expires to the date of receipt by the cessionary of the receipt concerned.</block>

<p>One of the problems which arose from this clause is being cleared by the proposed amendment which the hon. the Minister has on the Order Paper, namely to change the word &#x201C;seller&#x201D; in the first line to &#x201C;cedent&#x201D;. We agree that that should be done and it clears up one of the problems which we are faced with. Even though the word &#x201C;seller&#x201D; will be changed to &#x201C;cedent&#x201D;, there still remains one difficulty. That is that if the cedent defaults, the cessionary in terms of this clause will be able to withhold payment of interest from the date of expiry of the one month&#x2019;s notice to the date when the transfer duty receipt is handed over. If it is between the cedent and the cessionary, this may be unobjectionable, but the seller is going to be prejudiced if the clause remains as it stands for a default which has nothing to do with him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>The clause reads, &#x201C;interest under the cession&#x201D; only, and not &#x201C;interest under original sale&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>This is a matter with which we can obviously deal at greater length in the Committee Stage. As I read this clause, it seems to deal with the payment of interest due to the seller in terms of the original contract.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to take it any further than this. I would merely like to draw this to the attention of the hon. the Minister at this stage so that he and his advisers can give some consideration to it in advance of the Committee Stage. Apart from the matters which have been raised by me and by the hon. member for Parktown, we on this side are happy to support this Bill. We support this Bill on the basis that we regard it as needed and because it provides a satisfactory solution to the problems which exist at present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it strikes me, as a relatively new member, how the atmosphere in this House changes <span class="col_3847-3848" refersTo="page_0582"/>in sympathy with the subjects we are dealing with here. This afternoon we almost have here the restfulness of a court room as we deal with this relatively technically legal subject. I welcome the calm atmosphere in which this matter is being discussed, because I think this Bill gives a great deal of food for thought. To tell the truth, I think there are so many sweeping implications in this Bill that one should actually have had a clause at the very beginning stating that in future the type of contract envisaged here ought only to be drawn up by solicitors or legal men. In any case, I think that for quite some time it is going to be necessary in practise to look two or three times at this legislation before going so far as to conclude a contract in terms of this legislation. As I have said, there are quite a few sweeping trends of thought in this Bill, and I just want to refer to one or two of them.</p>

<p>In the first place I should like to refer to the scope of the Bill, particularly as defined in clause 2. This Bill only relates to a purchaser who is a &#x201C;natural person&#x201D;. It would be a good thing if this knowledge were quickly to spread among practitioners and those persons involved in such sales. This legislation is only going to protect purchasers who are natural persons or the estate of a purchaser who has died or who is insolvent. The Bill, therefore, does not protect corporate bodies that purchase land. The object of this is manifest. It is supposed that corporate bodies, such as companies, executing purchases are persons with the necessary depth, experience and background to be able to protect themselves against exploitation when it comes to higher purchase transactions. This legislation proposes to protect certain persons who may perhaps be uninformed about what their rights are and what kind of protection they must stipulate when they are dealing with contracts of purchase. That is why it is also right that this legislation should only be applicable to ordinary, natural persons. Persons who need protection against their own ignorance about their rights fall into this group.</p>

<p>The scope of the Bill is further limited by the fact that its application is restricted to contracts of purchase where the purchase amount is paid off in instalments over a period of one year or longer. This is a second factor limiting the scope of this Bill. In this measure there is no provision in connection with the minimum number of instalments that have to be made during that year. One assumes that there must at least be two, because reference is made to &#x201C;instalments&#x201D;. However, one can also well imagine that some people who want to enjoy the benefits of this measure as far as clause 11 is concerned, could possibly present a transaction in such a way that it does, in fact, fall within the scope of this measure. It could be an ordinary transaction that was not intended to fall within the provisions of this measure. This could happen unless there is an adjustment of the minimum number of instalments.</p>

<p>The scope of this Bill is further limited by the fact that it is applicable to land as defined in the Bill. We find the definition of &#x201C;land&#x201D; on page 255 of the Order Paper. This reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Land&#x201D; means any land used or intended to be used mainly for residential purposes.</block>

<p>Transactions in which the land is not intended to be used for residential purposes are therefore also excluded and not subject to the provisions of this Bill. Here one is thinking more specifically of agricultural land, industrial land and even business stands. This definition relates only to properties intended for residential use. Here one finds the object of the legislation, i.e. to protect a certain group of persons who may perhaps in ignorance purchase too hastily and involve themselves in circumstances that will cause them trouble at a later stage. Here I just want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the intention of the Bill is that this land shall only be vacant land. Our concept of &#x201C;land&#x201D; in Roman Dutch Law or in South African Private Law embraces of course, the land itself with everything that is built upon it, including all structures that are above ground or underground. Does this mean that this Bill is also applicable to the sale on hire purchase of dwellings such as those the hon. member for Parktown quoted when he referred to the hon. member for Salt River? I also want to go further. If this Bill also proposes to cover structures or buildings on the land we shall, in the near future, probably have to introduce another amendment after the Sectional Titles Bill has been considered and possibly passed in this House. In terms of that proposed legislation we shall then have a particular title of a portion of a building. If the purchasers of land and houses must be protected, I would <span class="col_3849-3850" refersTo="page_0583"/>imagine that in future one would also argue that the purchasers of flats will have to be protected as we propose to give protection to purchasers in this case. I should like to suggest for the Minister&#x2019;s consideration that after the passage of that other legislation we shall possibly have to come back and introduce an amendment in this legislation in order to cover those cases as well.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Parktown and Musgrave drew the attention of the House to the exceptions mentioned in the Act, i.e. those lands or transactions to which the Bill is not applicable. It is a good thing that they did so; but I cannot, with all due respect to the hon. gentlemen, quite agree with their arguments in that connection. The hon. member for Musgrave rightly remarked that these transactions that are excluded all have a bearing on cases where the State, or a State institution or agency, is the seller, and that one may therefore assume that in those cases the State will not act unfairly towards the purchasers. The hon. member for Musgrave then continued&#x2014;and I followed his argument closely&#x2014;and said that there are other benefits in the Bill that one would like to transfer to the purchaser of State land. He specifically referred to clauses 9, 10 and 11 and to a later clause. He said that purchasers of property from the State under lease agreement should also be entitled to the benefits provided in this Bill for such purchasers. Sir, clauses 9 and 10 embody very few benefits for a purchaser, and I wish to argue that obtaining the benefits of clauses 9 and 10 is really going to make no diffrence to the purchasers of State land. But as far as clause 11 is concerned, which enables a purchaser to assign his rights by way of a cession, I think that it it is specifically a principle in the purchasing of State land that the State wants to know with whom it concludes a contract. I think the State argues that it does not want to be placed in the position where the purchaser can simply assign his rights in terms of a contract to A, B or C without the State itself having any say. Because what is the purpose of these sales? In terms of the proposed clause 2 (b) we are dealing with land being sold by the South African Bantu Trust in terms of the Bantu Trust Act, land being sold in terms of the Community Development Act and land being sold by the National Housing Commission. In all those cases where land is being sold in terms of those Acts the State has a particular interest in who the purchaser of that land is. For example, it does not readily supply a house to a person that already has one in terms of the National Housing Act. That is why the State has an interest in seeing that only this specific person, who bought from the State, will carry out this transaction and obtain transfer. In terms of the National Housing Act, too, if one obtains transfer of one&#x2019;s property, another restriction is placed upon one to the effect that for a certain number of years one may not resell one&#x2019;s property, so strictly is the principle vested in the relevant legislation. That is why I feel that there is good reason why the benefits of clause 11 should not be transferred to a purchaser of land from the State or certain State institutions, and as far as that is concerned, I courteously differ from my colleague, the hon. member for Musgrave.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, clause 11 is probably one of the most sweeping clauses in this entire Bill. It introduces an entirely new principle into our registration procedure, and it is a good thing for the general public&#x2019;s attention to be focussed on this. You will know, Sir, that up to the present moment every sale transaction that is concluded must be registered in the Deeds Office. If A sells to B, and B to C, and C to D, each of those transactions must systematically be registered in the Deeds Office as consecutive deeds of transfer. In this Bill we are now introducing a new principle; A sells to B; B cedes to C and C cedes to D. Transfer is then made, not from A to B and from B to C and from C to D, but directly from A to the eventual cessionary, D, and this is an entirely new concept in our procedure of the registration of titles in our Deeds Office. I understand the concept was thoroughly analysed in collaboration with the officials of the Deeds Office, that they accepted the principle as such and that they see their way clear to implementing it. But I want to draw attention to the fact that here we are introducing a new principle that is only applicable to the transactions affected by this measure. Sir, at the beginning of my address I enumerated the transactions to which this Bill applies, what the scope of the Bill is and what transactions are excluded according to the Bill. Therefore, a measure of confusion could exist initially among a large number of our practitioners about which of these transactions can, in fact, be conducted merely by way of a cession and which, in fact, must be conducted by way of transfer. I can give <span class="col_3851-3852" refersTo="page_0584"/>this example: A sells to B in terms of this Act; B is therefore a person who is entitled to assign his rights and obligations to C in terms of this Act; but he does not do so in terms of this Act, in other words, he does not sell on instalments, but demands cash. This means that A can transfer directly to C and that B is completely out of the picture. But if I may use the same example, Sir, if C were to sell to D on instalments, it does not mean that in future A can transfer directly to D, because there was at least one intermediary transaction that did not take place in terms of this Act; there must consequently at least be transfer from A to C, and then the cession to E, etc., can be registered. Situations will therefore crop up that will have to be watched very closely by the practitioners that have to deal with these matters, and it would be a good thing if those who circulate information about these matters, for example the monthly journals of the Law Societies and even the Press, were to bring the facts of this situation to the attention of the practitioners if the Bill is passed.</p>

<p>There is another aspect about which I should like to address the House and the hon. the Minister. In clause 11 we speak of a cession of the rights and obligations of the purchaser, but there is no mention of a cession <i>in securitatem debiti;</i> in other words, there is no mention of the right of a purchaser to offer the rights he has in terms of his hire-purchase agreement as security to another person. This is a case where he himself still retains proprietary rights in his contract while ceding it to his bank, in order to obtain an overdraft or something like that, for example. There is no mention of these cases, and I imagine that this is not excluded in terms of this legislation; that it will still be possible for him, according to common law, to cede his rights in terms of such a contract <i>in securitatem debiti</i> to someone he owes money to.</p>

<p>Sir, I have another problem in connection with the contracts of cession that I should like to put to the Minister, and my problem relates to the word &#x201C;cession&#x201D;. In clause I the word &#x201C;cession&#x201D; is defined as a cession in writing, but one can imagine that the cession could also take the form of a hire-purchase sale and that the terms of the cession could also be such that the land is sold in terms of the cession on instalments over a period of longer than a year. I should like it made clear in this legislation that such cessions, which in fact also come under the provisions of this Act, must also comply with the conditions of this Act as far as the protection of purchasers is concerned. What is the purchaser&#x2019;s chief protection? We find reference to the chief protection in clauses 4, 7, 13 and 14, and where one has a cession that is phrased in such a way that the purchase price must be paid by way of instalments, as proposed in this Bill, I should very much like to see that cession, which must be in writing, subject to the same conditions as those which the original contract must comply with.</p>

<p>If we look at clause 4 we see in it all the various requirements a contract must contain. Those requirements are specifically aimed at the protection of the parties, and they furnish a certain security. The most important of those, to my mind at least, is probably clause 4 (1) (d), which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the land is encumbered by a mortgage bond (a contract shall contain) the name and address of the person, or his representative, or, in the case of a participation bond, the name and address of the nominee company, or its representatives &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is, in my opinion, one of the most important means of protection for a purchaser, so that he will know that the seller, from whom he purchases, does have that land under mortgage bond, so that he will know that that mortgage bond must first be paid off before he can obtain transfer of his property, and so that he will know that he runs a certain measure of risk if he purchases land that is under a mortgage bond, because it may happen that the seller does not meet his obligations under his mortgage bond. It is important that the purchaser will obtain notification of that, and I think that this clause 4 (1) (d) is one of the most important protection measures in this legislation.</p>

<p>Coming to clause 7, where certain invalid clauses are discussed, I find (b), which reads as follows, to be the most important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(A provision in a contract whereby&#x2014;) the purchaser forfeits any claim in respect of a useful improvement effected by him on the land if he fails to fulfil an obligation under the contract.</block>

<p>Such a provision is invalid, and I also regard this as a very important protection <span class="col_3853-3854" refersTo="page_0585"/>measure, which I should like to endorse heartily. When we get to clause 13 we see that it relates to the limitation of the right of seller to take action where the purchaser, as we heard from the hon. the Minister, must give notice if he wants to cancel the purchase and give the purchaser an opportunity to meet his obligations. I also regard this as a very important measure. The whole of clause 14 envisages precisely the same protection, and I want to say that I think that it is a very big step forward in the direction of protecting purchasers. One may ask oneself whether the scope of this legislation should not perhaps be extended at a later stage, as the hon. member for Bloemfontein West argued.</p>

<p>Initially the hon. the Minister said that the committee had given consideration to this legislation and made certain recommendations. He said that the recommendations were that all parties should obtain full notification of and agree to the contract; the rights and obligations in terms of existing contracts must not be adversely affected; preference rights of preferential claimants must not be encroached upon; the right to compound or mortgage property must not be assailed; and the winding up of estates must not be delayed. Those were his objects and, in reading through this legislation, I must say that he has succeeded fully in achieving them. I therefore want to support this Bill wholeheartedly.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken has, I think, highlighted more than ever some of the difficulties that we will find in due course in the interpretation of this Bill, which in itself, as has been pointed out, was a very difficult Bill to draft and to place before the House. I would like to make the general observation, however, that I do not think that our general standards of the sale of land in this country have been bad. I think by and large there has been a very good spirit of honesty and integrity displayed on the part of those who have been selling land, particularly in recent years, on such a large scale, and that in fact very few of the public have been seriously hurt or damaged in these transactions by unscrupulous sellers or sellers who have not tried to watch the interest of the buyer as well.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I think we are dealing with a very much more sophisticated type of buyer today who in many senses is much more aware of the difficulties and problems and the obligations which he has to undertake in the acquisition of land, particularly when he buys on terms. Nevertheless I feel that this Bill&#x2014;and I think that has been the feeling of the Minister&#x2019;s department for some time&#x2014;is an essential piece of law that should be on our Statute Book in order to provide protection for the guileless buyer who very often over-reaches himself in regard to the obligations he undertakes. This Bill will give him the opportunity, whether through a form of cession or other means, to retrieve his position timeously in respect of many of the difficulties which may arise. It will give him that protection and help which I feel are necessary.</p>

<p>There are, of course, still many differences of opinion. For example, certain quasi-real rights are created where the buyer is receiving protection in the form of a preference in a sale in execution over and above ordinary concurrent creditors. That is a very important aspect and it has been the feeling of quite a number of people in this field of land dealing that there should be registration of contracts of sale of this nature on the basis of a <i>caveat</i> so that the creditors are fully aware of what is taking place, just as the position is in regard to the registration of bonds. But I think that is a phase which may take many years before it is realized, and this step is already an important step in the right direction and will undoubtedly create sufficient interest to encourage improvements which may come later.</p>

<p>Beyond that I would not like to deal with any of the details which have been so clearly dealt with by a number of speakers, because everyone is very conscious of the importance of this Bill. I would, however, like to make one general remark. It has always been my belief, and I believe the belief of all business people, that any contract should be seen by the attorney of the one party as well as by the attorney of the other party. More particularly in the case of land I think it would be good that the public should always be made aware of the fact that the layman cannot understand the intricacies in regard to a sale of land with all that it implies. There should constantly be some warning to the public that it would be in their interest to consult their legal representative, in selling or purchasing land. I think that is a very important aspect. I think even this Bill highlights the importance of having legal advice when it comes to transactions of this nature which can bind a person and his family over a number <span class="col_3855-3856" refersTo="page_0586"/>of years. I think it is important and it will also be of great value in the pride which one has in one&#x2019;s home and the acquisition of land. With these two thoughts, supplementing what those who have supported the Bill have already said, I would also modestly give my wholehearted blessing to the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The discussion which took place here today, showed me once again how deeply-rooted we are in the soil of South Africa. There is no doubt whatsoever that the South African probably attaches more value to land than most any other person on earth. There is a deep-rooted desire in every South African to own a piece of South Africa. That is why we attach tremendous value to this, and that is why we regard this legislation which has been discussed here today in such a constructive and serious way, as being so important. There is another factor which contributes to this, and that is our registration system in South Africa. Our registration system in South Africa is generally regarded as being the best in the world, and I am very jealous of our registration system. That is why I should like to reply to the hon. member for Bellville that in so far as clause 11 apparently detracts a little from the sound concepts which have always been maintained in our registration system, I do not think that it can do our system any harm. I am aware that we are introducing in clause 11 a procedure which has never before been followed in South Africa. The hon. member is correct in saying that we have always followed a procedure in accordance with which the transfer of land has taken place in our deeds registries in accordance with the transactions in question. If A consequently sells to B, B to C, and C. again to D, all transactions are registered in the deeds registry. It can at all times be ascertained in the deeds registry who, from time to time, the owner of a particular piece of land is. In all the different transactions the transfer duties will be payable and the transfer duty receipts will form part of the documents which are kept in the deeds registry. We will therefore still be able to establish who the various interested parties in this piece of land from time to time were. Since circumstances lend themselves to a cession of a contract and from the nature of the case there are no additional arrangements in regard to the land, or no obligations from the one to the other can take place, I do not think we need have any fear that this will in any way detract from the sound registration system we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bellville referred to the definition of the word &#x201C;land&#x201D; as is being proposed on page 255 of the Order Paper. There land is defined as land which is used or which is intended to be used mainly for residential purposes. I must inevitably deduce from the first part of the proposed amendment that the definition constitutes the intention that this can also be land on which buildings already exist. The hon. member is correct when he says that our concept of land is not merely the ground itself. This also includes those things which are attached to the land in such a way that they cannot be removed from the land without any damage to it. Consequently it is the case that when one builds an ordinary house of bricks, that house comprises part of the land. A building which therefore stands on the land, is therefore included in the concept of &#x201C;land&#x201D; as is being defined here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bellville also referred to the right which the seller may have to assign his rights in terms of a contract to another person to obtain financial facilities and so on. I think that this is sufficiently defined in clause 12 of the Bill. I also referred to it in my introductory speech. There it is emphatically stated that the assignee will have a power of attorney in order to transfer to the purchaser. The assignee will by implication have a power of attorney to sign a deed procuration so that he can give transfer of the land to the purchaser.</p>

<p>I do not at this stage want to deal with the various ideas expressed in regard to the clauses in regard to which misgivings to the one side or the other exist. I would prefer to content myself by expressing my appreciation for the fine, constructive ideas which came from both sides of the House. I am referring to the hon. members for Bloemfontein West, Parktown, Jeppes, Musgrave and Bellville and the constructive ideas expressed by them because it is felt that a need exists for legislation of this nature. Consequently we want to see to it that we place the best possible legislation on the Statute Book. As I see matters, the different policies of political parties are irrelevant here. All of us have a desire to formulate this legislation as clearly as possible. That is why I have an open mind in regard to this matter.</p>

<p><span class="col_3857-3858" refersTo="page_0587"/>Because this is the case I shall prefer not to argue the points which have been raised here now. I shall rather let them stand over until we deal with the Committee Stage. I shall prefer and I shall ty so to arrange it for the benefit of hon. members that we have a few days&#x2019; time before we come to the Committee Stage so that we can, if it is necessary, exchange some ideas in regard to what we feel strongly about in the meantime in a more informal way.</p>

<heading>MINES AND WORKS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>(Second Reading)</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The only important amendments affected by this Bill are those contained in clauses 4 and 5, and therefore I shall refer very briefly to the other clauses, which, as hon. members will see, propose hardly any significant changes.</p>

<p>Clause I is aimed mainly at modernizing terminology, as certain radio-active minerals are referred to as &#x201C;source material&#x201D; in the existing Atomic Energy Act of 1967 and no longer as &#x201C;preserved material&#x201D;, as used to be the case.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 2, I merely want to mention that in terms of section 4 of the Mines and Works Act, 1956, inspectors of mines and of machinery have the jurisdiction to try persons who have contravened the regulations or special rules, unless the death of any person has been caused by such contravention. In terms of subsection (2) (a) of the section, the authority of the inspectors to impose a fine is limited to an amount of &#x00A3;5 (RIO). This fine of R10 was laid down in legislation as far back as 1905 and because circumstances have changed so fundamentally in the meanwhile, inspectors are obliged to take offenders to court, even where the offence is not very serious but nevertheless justifies a fine of more than RIO. Hon. members will agree with me that this takes up unnecessary time and entails legal costs for the trade unions. In terms of clause 2, the amount is now being increased to R30. By the same token the inadequate fines referred to in clauses 3 and 6 are bing increased slightly in order to adapt them more closely to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955.</p>

<p>Clauses 7, 8 and 9, too, are merely aimed at modernizing the fines concerned and therefore it is not necessary for me to elaborate on these minor changes any further.</p>

<p>I now want to pay attention to the amendments to the Act which are proposed by clauses 4 and 5. However, I want to make it clear to hon. members at once that in essence, that is to say, as far as matters of principle are concerned, the amendments concerned do not differ from the statutory provisions enacted in connection with the same matters in 1968 with the support of both sides of this House. As I shall explain, my department came up against certain technical legal problems which have up to now prevented the 1968 legislation from being implemented properly. What we are doing here now, is merely to change the <i>modus operandi</i> so that certain objects of the 1968 legislation may be achieved more easily.</p>

<p>The position is that section 10 of the Mines and Works Act, 1956, which was introduced by section 4 of the Mines and Works Amendment Act, 1968, provides <i>inter alia</i> that the Minister of Mines may determine the number of hours which persons may work or be permitted to work in and at mines or works, and furthermore provides that in making such determination he may&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) determine different hours of work for mines and works or for different mines or works or classes of mines or works or for different areas, working places, classes of employees, etc.;</li>

<li>(2) determine different hours of work that may be worked by employees in different circumstances;</li>

<li>(3) determine the minimum rates of remuneration in relation to ordinary rates of remuneration to be paid to employees in respect of overtime or work on certain days&#x2014;such as Sundays, Good Friday, Christmas Day, etc.; and</li>

<li><span class="col_3859-3860" refersTo="page_0588"/>(4) determine the minimum number of days of paid leave and sick leave to which employees shall be entitled.</li>

</ol>

<p>In order to prevent confusion, I shall say something later on about the question of working hours. I first want to dwell briefly on the last two matters, namely the determination of minimum rates of remuneration in respect of overtime or work on public holidays and, secondly, the determination of the minimum number of days of paid leave and sick leave. The power conferred upon the Minister of Mines to make determinations in regard to the last-mentioned two matters is subject to a proviso to which I should very much like to draw the attention of hon. members.</p>

<p>The proviso is&#x2014;and it must remain like this&#x2014;that the Minister may make no such determination in respect of any mine or works if the Minister of Labour is of the opinion that minimum wages and other conditions of employment in respect of such mine or works are usually regulated by means of an agreement between the employers and one or more trade unions.</p>

<p>As explained in this regard at the time, the relevant statutory amendments in respect of remuneration and leave followed upon representations from the Federation of Mineworkers&#x2019; Unions. Their problem was and is that matters such as basic or minimum wages, overtime remuneration, leave and sick leave may in fact be negotiated as far as the large mines are concerned, because these larger mines are represented in central organizations such as the Chamber of Mines, the Natal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association, De Beers, etc. In respect of many smaller mines in the Republic, however, such organizations with which agreement can be reached do not exist. The position is therefore that, while proper agreements about these matters and general conditions of employment exist for employees at the larger mines, agreements with which we do not want to interfere at all, the worker at the smaller mines enjoys no protection in this respect. The ordinary labour legislation, chiefly the Factories, Machinery and Building Work Act of 1941, is not applicable to mines, with the result that in the case of the smaller mines for which no central organizations exist, the arrangements in regard to remuneration for overtime, leave, etc., differ from one mine to another. Briefly, the position is that employees at the smaller mines do not enjoy the necessary protection in this regard&#x2014;the possibility of exploitation is always there&#x2014;and therefore this was one of the matters which the 1968 amendments proposed to rectify.</p>

<p>In my summary of the 1968 amendments I emphasized that the Minister would be able to determine only the minimum rates of remuneration in respect of overtime or work on public holidays and only the minimum number of days of paid leave and sick leave. The reason for this was that it was in no way the intention to interfere in any respect with the right of the trade unions and the smaller mines to negotiate about these matters and in that way perhaps to obtain more favourable conditions for employees in respect of certain mining occupations at specific mines.</p>

<p>In explanation of the further amendments now being proposed to the Act, I want to point out that after my department had negotiated with the various trade unions for a long time in order to reach unanimity as far as possible in regard to the determination of minimum rates of remuneration and the minimum number of days of paid leave and sick leave, it appeared after consultation with the Department of Labour and subsequently with the law advisers&#x2014;and this is the important point&#x2014;that it would not be legally possible to make provisions of a general nature, as it had been proposed to do. It is a legal question. Legal opinion that was obtained was to the effect, <i>inter alia,</i> that it should be clear from the Minister of Mines&#x2019;s determination itself for which specific mines and works the Minister had laid down the provisions and that it would not be sufficient to indicate in the general terms of the Act to which mines and works the Minister&#x2019;s provisions would be applicable, i.e. the mines and works where agreements already existed. However, approximately 1 200 active mines and 40 works in the Republic are affected, and it will be understood that it would not be practicable to make a separate determination in respect of each individual mine or works.</p>

<p>As hon. members will see in clause 4 of the Bill, read in conjunction with clause 5, which proposes, <i>inter alia,</i> to insert two new paragraphs, namely (u) and (v), in section 12 of the principal Act, the only fundamental change now being effected is that instead of the Minister himself making determinations for individual mines or works in regard to these matters, the State President is now being empowered to make regulations in regard to them, after which <span class="col_3861-3862" refersTo="page_0589"/>the Minister may declare any of those regulations to be applicable to any particular mine or works as may be necessary. This will facilitate the entire procedure. As may be seen in clause 4, this may be done only where the minimum rates of remuneration and other conditions of employment are not laid down in an agreement or are less favourable than the minimum rates of remuneration and conditions of service which will be prescribed by the regulations&#x2014;and then only after the employer, i.e. the mine or works, has been notified and has been offered the opportunity of making representations if he wishes. This, therefore, will merely be a more practical method of achieving the objects to which I referred earlier on.</p>

<p>I just want to make a few brief observations in regard to the question of working hours. No fundamental change is being proposed here either. The position is that the Mines and Works Act itself has always prescribed limiting working hours for mines and works, but that the amending Act of 1968 repealed those provisions because circumstances differed at the different types of mines and the old statutory provisions are too inflexible. I say &#x201C;are&#x201D; because, as I explained previously, it has for certain technical reasons not yet been possible to implement the 1968 amendments, in terms of which the old provisions are repealed. A second reason is that the provisions in regard to working hours are not applicable to the coal mines, because the working hours there may be prescribed by regulation, which is much more practical. Because the 1968 amendments to the Act do away with the old general provisions in regard to working hours and, instead thereof, empower the Minister of Mines to determine different hours of work for different mines or works or for different classes of mines or works, etc., it will be clear to hon. members that I would first have had to make all the necessary determinations in regard to hours of work for the approximately 1 200 mines and 40 works which have already been referred to, so that the new prescribed hours of work could be introduced simultaneously with the implementation of the 1968 legislation, otherwise there would be no statutory provisions in this regard for some time.</p>

<p>In regard to the proposed determination of hours of work it was also the intention to make certain stipulations in order to prevent an employee from working more than one shift in 24 hours, except in cases of accidents or in other essential cases approved by the inspector of mines. In this regard it is also necessary to prescribe a reasonable average time, say 30 minutes, to get an employee from the shaft-head or other mine entrance to his working place and to stipulate that if this time is exceeded, it shall be included as time worked by the employee, provided that in special cases the Government Mining Engineer may extend the average prescribed time of 30 minutes on application by the mine concerned. What we have in mind is to prevent some mines from misusing working-hour determinations and sometimes letting mineworkers wait too long at the shaft-head or taking too long to get them to the working place without their being remunerated in respect of this time.</p>

<p>In this respect, too, I unfortunately have to say that the law advisers expressed the opinion that the wording of the 1968 amendments to the Act is such that it does not allow provisions to be made which include the above-mentioned matters. Under the circumstances it was necessary to change these provisions and this <i>modus operandi</i> as well so that the State President, as in the previous case, would have the power not only to lay down general provisions in respect of working hours, but also to make regulations which include the question of shifts and prescribe the average time for the transportation of employees to their places of work. As hon. members will see, the relevant wording in clause 5 has been extended to some extent in order to include these matters as well.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation in commending this Bill to the House, because the principles have already been accepted and because the law advisers told us that if we did not do it in this way, it would be difficult, or even impossible, to implement it in practice. Since there is no change in principle, I therefore move the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support this Bill. As I see it, this Bill has two parts. The one deals with penalties and the other with the protection of workers. I want to deal briefly with the clauses dealing with penalties. There are one or two matters in connection with the clauses which I would like the hon. the Minister to explain to us. In this Bill, pounds are being converted to rands; this is simple enough. But while amounts have been converted to rands, in <span class="col_3863-3864" refersTo="page_0590"/>other words, where the amount has been doubled to get rands, I see that there is a discrepancy in the periods of punishment. The periods are not consistent throughout the Bill.</p>

<p>I think we find the biggest discrepancy in clause 8. Section 15 of the Principal Act, now being substituted by clause 8 of the Bill, provided for a fine of &#x00A3;250, which has now been changed to R500, and in default of payment, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months. In the case of an offence referred to in paragraph (b) of section 15 the penalty is a fine of &#x00A3;500, which will now be R1 000, or in default of payment, imprisonment for a period not exceeding 24 months, where it was previously 12 months. I cannot see why the period of imprisonment should in the first case remain the same, whereas in the last case it is double that what it was previously. There may be a reason for this, but the hon. the Minister must please let the House know what the reasons for this discrepancy are. The new period of 24 months should really be 12 months, as it was previously. I do not think that the hon. the Minister really meant to double up the time in this case. Perhaps he did; I do not really know. In section 14 of the Principal Act, substituted by clause 7 of the Bill, we find that the amount of &#x00A3;75, has been changed to R150 and that the period of imprisonment, namely 6 months, remains the same. I thought that the hon. the Minister would only change the amounts to rands and let the periods of imprisonment remain the same, except that the periods of imprisonment would be changed where fines are increased. In clause 8, however, the term of imprisonment is being doubled, but not the fine. Perhaps the Minister will correct that, unless he has a special reason for doing so. Those are the main points I wanted to make as far as the penalties are concerned.</p>

<p>I now come to clauses 4 and 5. I should like to know from the Minister whether or not clause 4 is similar to the clause contained in the 1968 amendment Bill. The Minister says that he has compared the two Bills and he finds them similar. Did he consult the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union in regard to these proposed changes? The mineworkers&#x2019; Union apparently does not come into the picture at the moment. He is dealing with people working on the mines who do not belong to unions. I should like the Minister to tell us why these people do not have an opportunity of belonging to unions and why the unions do not accept them, even when they make application.</p>

<p>With respect, Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with miners who are not members of trade unions. These people are specifically mentioned and we should like to know why they are not members of trade unions. I think, Sir, that my argument is relevant to this clause. It is most important that we get a clearer picture as to why this clause is necessary. If these people belonged to a trade union, that trade union would negotiate the hours of work, the overtime, the payment for holidays, and so on. These people do not, however, belong to trade unions, and I am asking the Minister why they do not belong to unions. I think this is very important, because it is surely the policy of both sides of the House that a man working on a mine or in a works should have the protection of a union. Those are the bodies that are going to look after the interests of this type of person. Here, because these people&#x2019;s interests are not taken care of, the Minister takes it upon himself, rightly so, to look after their interests, but I do not know what the motivation was that led to this step. What made the Minister introduce this clause? Who approached the Minister and asked him to introduce this clause? Was it the workers themselves, the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, or one of the allied unions that brought these matters to the notice of the Minister and asked him to deal with the matter, although the miners concerned do not themselves belong to unions? This is most important. How does the Minister fix the remuneration for workers? Does he call a meeting of the workers, and do they then ask for what they think is a fair remuneration, or is this remuneration fixed on a certain scale that has already been in vogue as a result of an agreement between employer and employee? If the Minister thinks that the remuneration of certain workers is not sufficient, or is unfair, he can, in terms of clause 5, interfere and fix their remuneration even when there have already been negotiations between employer and employee. Does the Minister therefore imply that he is willing to be the go-between the employer and the employee and fix what he considers to be a fair remuneration, or is he going to leave this matter to the trade <span class="col_3865-3866" refersTo="page_0591"/>unions? If you read the clause carefully, you find that it is possible for the Minister to interfere here.</p>
