<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to deal for a moment or two with the amendment in clause 2, which has just been reported. In this regard I would like to ask the hon. the Minister specifically whether there are particular reasons for the reduction in the amount of 10 cusecs which was provided for in the Bill as it was read a Second Time and which has now been changed. I think we made it clear that we are not necessarily opposing this measure. This reduction is a very material one, however, because the Bill originally provided for 10 cusecs whereas now a waterworks for which a permit must first be obtained from the hon. the Minister will only be allowed 4 cusecs, that is less than half of what was originally provided for.</p>

<p>In regard to the Bill itself, I would like to ask the hon. Minister whether there is any provision made in this Bill for dealing with flood water. Is flood water provided for in clause 2&#x003F; At the present time it is very difficult indeed when one constructs a waterworks to say whether it is <span class="col_2095-2096" refersTo="page_1061"/>going to rely on normal flow or on flood water. In the case of a dam, provided for in clause 2, it might well be that the impounded water will be flood water. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has taken this fact into consideration and whether provision for this is made in the particular clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the reason for the reduction, namely from 10 cusecs to 4 cusecs, is that we feel that there must be a relationship between the abstraction rate, which is 10 cusecs, and the provisions regarding the damming up of a volume of water which could be 100 morgen feet.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Impounded&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. We feel that if anybody is allowed to abstract water at the rate of 10 cusecs it can mean an irrigation rate of from 400 to 500 morgen which is not in relation to an irrigation rate of impounded water, which we intend to be round about 100 morgen.</p>

<p>The other question of the hon. member was whether we took flood water into account. The time when the impounding of water makes any material difference is not during flood periods, but during lean periods. During the lean period, before the start of the rainy season, it could be very important to prevent anybody from impounding too large a volume of water at one place of abstraction. It was therefore felt that we should limit the volume and keep into account what is happening in South Africa at the moment. We are not so much concerned about the major rivers. We are much more concerned about the smaller rivers. At the moment we have four or five cases where the volume of water abstracted from such small streams could upset the balance along the whole of the river. This can affect the supply of water used for irrigation purposes as well as for other people dependent upon that water. For this reason the provisions of this Bill are very strict. We feel that we should not change them, because we will not otherwise be able to act against people threatening the balance of conservation, especially in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>Motion put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>This clause which deals with the transfer of assets, has a direct effect on persons who are members on a non-contributory basis, of an old fund, now being disestablished in terms of a previous clause and in which provision must be made to protect those persons&#x2019; rights and interests, particularly if they are non-contributory members of an old fund. Here I would like to refer to subsection (2) which deals with an endowment insurance policy which is being held by the Secretary in terms of the old regulations and is in the possession of the Secretary for the purposes of an old provident fund. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the new regulations which are provided for in clause 8 will to any great extent differ from the old regulations appertaining to the old provident fund. Sir, this is an important point in that it is specifically stated in this clause that where such an endowment insurance policy is held by the Secretary, although it is being held in terms of the old regulations of the old provident fund, the Secretary shall continue to hold such endowment insurance policy subject to the regulations. This would appear to apply to the regulations as defined in clause 1, which are the regulations passed in terms of the new Bill once it becomes an Act. It is important to know therefore, in the interests of these persons who are so situated, whether the new regulations to be promulgated in terms of clause 8 of this Bill, will to any great extent be different from those regulations appertaining to the old provident fund which is now being disestablished in terms of a previous clause. The regulations affecting persons in respect of whom such an endowment insurance policy is held are set out in paragraphs (m), (n) and (o) of clause 8. It is important to ascertain whether, where an endowment insurance policy is so held, this particular type of member is affected by dividends that are due through that endowment insurance policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with the question of the transfer of funds more <span class="col_2097-2098" refersTo="page_1062"/>fully in a moment. I just want to say briefly that in outline the regulations will be the same as those we have at present, and the protection at present given to the rights of persons, will be retained. In regard to the question of endowment assurance policies in the possession of the Secretary prior to the coming into operation of this Act, they, too, will be retained for the purposes of the new fund; I can give the hon. member this assurance at once.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In connection with the transferability of assets from the two old funds to the new fund, I want to make it quite clear that these are provident funds and not pension funds as such. A provident fund as such is not subject to periodic valuation. A separate account is kept in the case of each individual member. On transfer the amount standing to such a member&#x2019;s credit is merely transferred to the new fund.</p>

<p>I want to say for the information of hon. members that the balance sheet of the University Institutions Provident Fund shows total assets to the amount of R18,476,000 as at the 31st March, 1970, and in the case of the Technical Colleges Provident Fund the assets amount to R5,375,000, in round figures. The assets of these two funds shall, with effect from a fixed date, be transferred to the new fund. I think that is the answer to the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister during the course of the second reading debate gave further information and elucidated the position of the noncontributory member and the position of a person who is employed by the council of an associated institution in a temporary capacity or on a contract for a fixed period. The paragraph dealing with the position of that person states clearly that he shall continue to be a non-contributory member of the new fund once this new fund is established. Subclause (4) also refers to the position of a person who was a non-contributory member and says that he shall with effect from a fixed date be released from all obligations towards and relinquish all rights and privilege in respect of the old provident fund of which he was a member or out of which, in terms of the old regulations, he was entitled to a benefit on the basis of non-contributing participation. Here I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is satisfied in the case of these persons who were non-contributing members of an old fund, whether it is the Technical Colleges Provident Fund or the University Institutions Provident Fund, that in the event of their being required to become contributing members in terms of subclause (3), their entitlement to additional benefits that they have earned while they have been non-contributing members is fully provided for in terms of the legislation that is before us. In other words, Sir, we would like clarity in regard to the transferability of the benefits of persons who were non-contributing members of an old fund if they should become contributing members in terms of subsection (1) of this clause, because subclause (1) specifically states that persons are contributing members unless they have an additional benefit payable to them in terms of clause 5 (2) that we have already dealt with, whereby these additional benefits due to them would be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. My main point here is the position of a non-contributing member who is then required in terms of the other clauses and in terms of a subsection of this clause to become a contributing member of the fund, to ensure that there is transferability of the benefits earned by him as a non-contributing member of the old fund.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I understand the problem which the hon. member put there, and I shall go into it. It was the exceptional case which he put there; I do not know whether it is possible in practice. The whole object of this clause briefly boils down to this, that members of the old fund who were contributors to an old fund on the day before the coming into operation of the new Act, will be obliged in terms of this clause to become members of the new fund, with this exception: unless they were entitled on that date to the payment of a benefit or an additional benefit; in that case they will not be obliged to become members of the new fund. However, members who were not compulsory contributors to the old provident fund on the fixed date, do not become contributing members of the new fund, even though on the fixed date an amount from an old fund is available which may provide them with annual dividends. <span class="col_2099-2100" refersTo="page_1063"/>A person who is in the service of an associated institution in a temporary capacity or on contract may, provided he has not attained the pensionable age, at the request of the board of such an institution and with the approval of the Secretary for Social Welfare and Pensions in terms of subclause (3) in fact become a member of the new fund. I think this is the reply to the question which the hon. member really had in mind. Subsection (4) divests members of the old provident fund, or non-contributing members who were entitled to benefits in that fund, of all their rights and obligations in respect of that fund when they become members of the new fund. In other words, I think subsection (3) answers the hon. member&#x2019;s question, if I understood him correctly.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 8:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 56, page 14, after &#x201C;members&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or other persons who were members of an old provident fund&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In order to eliminate discussion, I should just like to explain that this amendment is necessary in order to prevent a certain group of persons of whom a few are still alive, but who will disappear in due course as a result of the new Act, from being excluded. This group of persons became members of the old provident fund before 1950 and consequently qualified at the termination of their services for the payment of an additional benefit and although they accepted a full benefit from the fund concerned at the age of 60, continue to serve and thus still await the payment of an additional benefit. As the clause stands at present, my problem is that they do not satisfy the definition of either a member or the other definition of a non-contributing member, and because the additional benefit is payable by discretion only at final retirement from the service, they have neither obtained any established rights in regard to it which may be protected by the Interpretation Act. Thus the amendment is being proposed in order to protect their rights.</p>

<p>Amendment put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, put and agreed to. Clause 13:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday we argued about the 90 days or the 180 days in this specific regard. I want to explain the position at once. As the clause reads at present, the position in practice is that after a person has received official notice from the responsible institution concerned that he must exercise the right as to whether he wants to remain with the old fund or wants to be transferred to the new fund, he has 90 days from then in which to decide. A strong case can be made out by saying that if a person has not decided within 90 days, he will not decide in 180 days either. In practice this means&#x2014;it does not mean that the matter can pass unnoticed without his being aware of it&#x2014;that it is 90 days from the date on which he is specifically notified that he may choose. But in spite of that, I must add that we have discretion as well, and by way of concession the Secretary may allow the persons to exercise their option after the date concerned in case there are real reasons why such a person did not exercise the option, for example a professor who was studying overseas for six months or a year and did not know about this specific provision. The notification could have remained in the post-box and it may be proved that he did not receive it. In that case the Secretary may make further concessions in special circumstances. But I have considered the matter and in the light of the representations of the hon. member, I have decided to move an amendment in order to extend the 90 days to 120 days, which I think will in fact be accommodating towards him and which must be accepted in this good spirit. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The principal change in this clause is a change from the previous position whereby the qualifications and period of office of members of the Immigration Selection Board were laid down in the <i>Gazette.</i> The position sought to be brought in is that they will be appointed by the State President as before, but that he may lay down, presumably in the letter of appointment, the period of office in respect of each individual which he chooses. Now it is common for boards of this kind to have their conditions of service and tenure of office laid down in the regulations so that everyone knows where he stands. I wonder whether the Minister could elaborate a little on why it is necessary to bring in this change.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members will notice that only those conditions relating to pecuniary matters such as remuneration, allowances, etc., are in future to be determined by the Minister of Immigration in consultation with the Minister of Finance, and not the period of service which is contained in the appointment by the State President. These matters come up for review from time to time in conjunction with similar conditions of service applicable to members of statutory boards constituted under other laws, which are almost without exception dealt with in terms similar to the amendment proposed in this Bill. I want to quote a few examples to the hon. member of comparable boards. First of all there is the Industrial Tribunal under Act 28 of 1956. According to section 17 (5) of this Act. the members of this board are dealt with in exactly the same way as we propose to do in this Bill now. Then there is the Wage Board under Act 48 of 1953, the National Housing Commission under Act 4 of 1966, the Group Areas Board under Act 36 of 1966, the Community Development Board under Act 3 of 1966, and the Rent Board under Act 43 of 1950.</p>

<p>The amendment, therefore, will make for uniformity in dealing with the conditions of service of members of statutory boards generally and eliminate any possible discrimination against members of the Immigration Selection Board, who can only start enjoying any revised benefits after the promulgation of amended regulations which may take a considerable time after their counterparts on other statutory boards have already started enjoying theirs. The main problem boils down to this. If for example a change is announced in salaries of Government officials as such and it is approved by the Minister of Finance, then all members of boards automatically go on to the new scale, but in the case of the Immigration Selection Board we have to go through the full procedure of first of all gazetting the new salaries and the new circumstances, which is really not necessary. We find it administratively not necessary. That is the only reason and there is nothing dubious about the whole situation.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The amendment I should like to deal with here is the one in the new subsection (1), which relates to the prescribed form in respect of a permit to enter the Union for purposes of permanent residence. Previously the form which had to be completed was set out in a regulation and all those who wished to make this application and all others such as attorneys whose job it is to advise people in this regard, knew simply by a perusal of the <i>Gazette</i> what had to be collected by way of information and what had to be gone into to complete the application. Now this is to be made available by the Secretary presumably on application. The fact that what is in the form is not known, <i>prima facie</i> appears to be a drawback and, secondly, one would like to know whether there will be a variety of forms for various categories of would be immigrants or applicants, or is there merely to be one form&#x003F; And if that is the case, why cannot it be dealt with in the regulations as before&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>This is once again a matter of administrative efficiency. From the nature of the <span class="col_2103-2104" refersTo="page_1065"/>case, one wants to change the form from time to time in order to obtain additional information. Circumstances in the world are changing all the time. At other times one wants to add an additional question to the existing form because one wants to obtain further information from the person. In terms of the present position, the entire form has to be published in the regulations every time it is changed, and this is a long procedure. I want to assure the hon. member at once that the idea is not to have different forms for different people. The form exists and, from the nature of the case, the existing form will be accepted. But if we should find, as a result of administrative circumstances, that we want further or additional information, we do not want to have to come back and promulgate a special regulation in which it is indicated what the new form will look like. This is merely a matter of our having the power to add an additional question to the form. The form will then be printed.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case, it will not be possible to include this in a certain form overnight. We will have to announce in advance that an additional question will be added, and the additional question will then appear in the new supply which is going to be printed. Only then will we collect the additional information which will enable us to come to a decision in regard to these cases. This is again being done to promote administrative efficiency. There is nothing sinister about this matter. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that the same form will be used for all persons. No exceptions will be made.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause amends section 1 of the principal Act, and deals with certain definitions. This clause also contains the main principle of the Bill, which is to extend the provisions of the National Welfare Act to the Territory of South-West Africa. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not agree that only one amendment to the definition is necessary. It would appear that the only amendment required is to amend the definition of &#x201C;Republic&#x201D;. In this clause, which is now before us, we find the definitions of both &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; and &#x201C;the territory&#x201D;. The definition of &#x201C;Republic&#x201D; reads as follows: &#x201C; &#x2018;Republic&#x2019; includes the territory.&#x201D; Then there is an additional definition which reads as follows: &#x201C; &#x2018;The territory&#x2019; means the territory of South-West Africa.&#x201D; I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not consider the second definition irrelevant. One definition merely defining the Republic and stating that the territory of South-West Africa is included in that definition, would appear to be sufficient for the purposes of extending the provisions of the Act to the territory of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the first part of this clause bring about an amendment which concerns the residential qualifications whereby a person may qualify for an old-age pension. I would like to refer to the principal Act, particularly in relation to the portions of this clause which state that certain subsections are to be deleted in the principal Act. Here we seek further clarity in regard to the reasons for the amendment as it now stands. If we look at the principal Act, we will see that section 7 (1) (b) (iii) states:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2105-2106" refersTo="page_1066"/>If he is a White person, has been repatriated from Angola to the Republic, and is a descendant of a person born in any part of South Africa included in the Republic.</block>

<p>If such a person was returned to South Africa he could qualify for a pension in terms of residential qualifications. However, there are other sections in the principal Act which are to be deleted which refer to the question of a person who is a White person who has entered the Republic from any territory in Africa determined by the Minister. This would appear to have a considerable effect on the means test as it now exists. In terms of this amendment which is before us namely the new subparagraph (iii) which reads:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; has entered the Republic from Angola or any other territory or country specified by the Minister and complies with such conditions as the Minister may in consultation with the Minister of Finance determine &#x2026;</block>

<p>It appears to be a departure from the existing position whereby this was restricted to White persons entering the Republic from any other territory in Africa as has been determined by the Minister. In the past we have found that the hon. the Minister has granted these people permission in terms of the residential qualifications, those who have come from Kenya, the Congo and Tanzania. However, the principal Act merely states that this concession to the people is merely of a temporary nature, because subsection (6) of the principal Act which reads:</p>

<block name="quote">The provisions of subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) and subsection (3) shall cease to be of force and effect as from a date fixed by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> in respect of each of those subsections.</block>

<p>Is now being deleted. In terms of the clause which is before us, paragraph (b) of the clause, subsections (2) and (3) are deleted and according to paragraph (b), subsection (6) is deleted. It would appear that this now becomes a permanent part of our legislation that persons who have entered the Republic from any other country or any other territory and not specifically confined to the African continent could be exempted from the residential qualifications as they exist. Subsection (6) of the principal Act, whereby the Minister may with effect from a date fixed by the State President by proclamation end the concession which was previously granted in terms of the other two subsections, is now deleted. The other portion of this clause which deals with the question of the continuation of the payment of the pension after a period of six months, is also being amended in that the proviso which reads that a person who has resided in the Republic or South-West, &#x201C;for not less than 15 out of the 20 years immediately preceding the date of his last departure from the Republic &#x2026;&#x201D; is also being deleted.</p>

<p>We welcome that provision, because we realize that there have been cases of persons who, due to circumstances beyond their control, have found that these circumstances have necessitated them to leave the Republic and that they are unable to continue to receive a pension after a period of six months should they not have been in the Republic for 15 out of the past 20 years. Therefore, that deletion is welcomed by this side of the House, but what we seek at this stage is clarity in regard to this clause. We seek clarity in regard to this clause, particularly as it affects the deletion of the subsections of the principal Act, which I have already referred to and which have previously been enforced. These subsections have limited the countries from which these people have come to the countries or territories on the African continent. It now appears that in terms of this legislation this is now being widened to include any other country or any other territory. We will be grateful if the hon. the Minister can give us an indication whether this in fact will be the practical implication of this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member is quite correct. This extends my responsibility, as well as the possibility, to other countries outside Africa. I need not deal with it fully. I can merely tell him that it takes into account our immigrants who come to South Africa from other parts of the world. Sometimes one finds that circumstances are such that these people are really in need and require financial help, and that there is no other method of helping them. Then they cannot meet this requirement as it stands at present. It affords the Minister some flexibility so as to <span class="col_2107-2108" refersTo="page_1067"/>enable him to assist such people in co-operation with the Minister of Finance. This is the idea behind it and the concession we are trying to make in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>It applies in other cases as well. I shall take South-West Africa as an example to which we are making this specifically applicable. It often happens, for example, that the German-speaking people in South-West Africa send their parents back to Germany for a long period, and that these people return to South Africa after approximately one year. In that case there is an interruption in the period, and in terms of the present legislation, we shall not be able to give them any pension. The present Ordinance in South-West Africa does not contain this strict provision. In order that these people will not be penalized under the new dispensation, we are making this concession so as to meet their case.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second-Reading debate on this Bill we discussed mainly this clause which brings about an alteration to the definition clause in the principal Act. We were particularly concerned about the position as far as the definition of a war veteran is concerned, whereby the various racial groups were deleted. However, the new amendment to the definition of a war veteran made a stipulation that those persons who were not entitled to be termed a &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; in terms of the legislation in force immediately prior to the enactment of this Bill, will continue not to be so classified as war veterans. In effect, as a result a situation arose whereby the Bantu race would be the only race that would be excluded in terms of this definition, as was the case in the previous Act. The hon. the Minister in his reply to the Second-Reading debate indicated that he would be prepared to give consideration to the plea that we made on this side of the House for a reconsideration of the definition of a war veteran with the aim of assisting those persons of the Bantu race who are specifically excluded in terms of the definition which is now before us. Before taking this matter any further, we would be grateful if the hon. the Minister could give an indication at this stage whether he has had an opportunity to give further consideration to the matter, as he said he would, with his colleague in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to say at once that I have discussed the matter with the two colleagues concerned. There are quite a number of problems which we shall have to iron out more thoroughly than is the case at present.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. member for North Rand also has something to add in this regard. For that reason I just want to tell the hon. member that at the Third Reading&#x2014;i.e. on Monday&#x2014;I shall definitely have more particulars at my disposal, but I just want to add at once that the principle involved here, cannot be corrected in this Bill. It will have to be corrected under the Department of Bantu Administration, under which all Bantu pensions fall. This question will therefore have to be raised on that Vote during the general Budget debate with a view to legislation being passed in that regard. During the Third-Reading debate I shall be glad to furnish more particulars in regard to the matter. I shall also reply to the hon. member for North Rand when he has finished speaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. the Minister is quite clear about what our attitude is in this regard. Therefore I do not wish to thrash out this matter any further. However, I just want to take this opportunity to bring two points to his attention in order to help him and to help us.</p>

<p>In his reply yesterday the hon. the Minister mentioned the large numbers of Bantu who served in the war and who would therefore qualify under this new definition of a &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; if it were adopted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Who might qualify.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. What the hon. the Minister said, is quite true. As <span class="col_2109-2110" refersTo="page_1068"/>far as I know approximately 78,000 Bantu served in the Second World War. Now, if we assume that there may be another 70,000 of them who will qualify as war veterans, it still does not follow that there are 70,000 of them who will receive war veterans&#x2019; pensions. Just as it is in the case of the Whites, there are many who qualify under the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;, but all White war veterans do not draw pensions. Such a war veteran has to comply with certain requirements in order that he may qualify for that pension. Only a very small number of those persons who qualify as war veterans, can, in fact, also qualify for war veterans&#x2019; pensions. That is the first point I want to put to the hon. the Minister. Therefore, it does not follow that all 70,000 Bantu are entitled to war veterans&#x2019; pensions. Just as in the case of the Whites, they must also comply with the qualifications that have been laid down.</p>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the means test and other tests which are being applied to the Whites. A very small number of them qualify for this pension.</p>

<p>But there is also a second point which I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Yesterday he said that only those persons who were in the fighting line, would qualify for this war veterans&#x2019; pension. I hope I have not misunderstood him. In this case I just want to point out that as far as Whites, Coloureds, Chinese and Indians are concerned, everybody who performed any service anywhere qualifies for the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;. But, once again, it does not follow that they are entitled to a war veteran&#x2019;s pension. The point I want to make in this regard, is that although many of these Bantu served in con-combatant units, they nevertheless have to qualify as war veterans, just as it is in the case of the Whites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on reading sub-paragraph (d) of clause 1, before one comes to the words proposed to be added at the end, one sees that it follows a pattern which has been adopted in other legislation of this House when such legislation has been extended to South-West Africa, namely to give it the fa&#x00E7;ade of not being related to population groupings. In the case of this Bill for instance, the definition of a &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; is proposed to be amended by the deletion of the words &#x201C;White person, Coloured person, Chinese or Indian&#x201D; and if this legislation is adopted, &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; will mean any person who served in the Armed Forces under certain circumstances. However, that fa&#x00E7;ade is destroyed by the proposed addition of certain words at the end of this clause, which do not refer to colour, but to persons who qualified before the passing of a certain Act. We have appealed from this side of the House over and over again to the hon. the Minister and his predecessors to see that justice is done as regards the people in South-West Africa whom the hon. the Minister, in terms of this clause, now intends to preclude from receiving war veterans pensions. If the last words &#x201C;but does not include &#x2026;&#x201D; etc., are deleted from this clause, there will be justice done to all persons of all races of South-West Africa who served in the Armed Forces in the different circumstances which are related in this clause.</p>

<p>There can only be two reasons for adding the words which the hon. the Minister proposes to add in this clause. This clause provides that Bantu persons in South-West Africa will be excluded from the provisions in this Bill. The first reason is the number of persons who might qualify. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that that is not a consideration. It was never a consideration in dealing with war veterans&#x2019; pensions for the First World War, Second World War and Oudstryder pensions. Numbers were not the consideration, but the question of service to the country. The second reason which might motivate the Government in feeling that Bantu should not receive war veterans&#x2019; pensions is the nature of their service during the war, namely as non-combatant troops. To suggest that the Bantu being non-combatant troops as were the Coloureds were not subjected to all the dangers of war would be a misconception of what took place. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that the Bantu who were concerned with the supply lines and on supply routes were probably subjected to more aggravated forms of aerial bombardment and machine gunning than were some of the armed troops. When one also thinks of the extent to which they entered war zones with supplies one realizes that they were subjected not only to aerial bombardment and machine gunning, but also to the normal gun fire and mortar bombing which <span class="col_2111-2112" refersTo="page_1069"/>take place in those areas. In these circumstances I do not believe that there should be an exclusion in regard to Bantu in South-West Africa. I also hope that in due course the hon. the Minister will extend these war veterans&#x2019; pensions to Bantu in South Africa who served their country.</p>

<p>We have just completed in this chamber a Joint Sitting to give to the Bantu people of South Africa, or to provide the machinery, to give them all the trappings of nationhood, like a flag, a national anthem and self-government. We want to give them all those things which are regarded as being so important. The one thing we are not giving to Bantu ex-servicemen is bringing them into the orbit of the War Veterans&#x2019; Pension Act and giving them the recognition which we are prepared to give to any other person of every other colour who have served our country in the past during war time. It seems a little inconsistent, to say the least, that this attitude should continue. I would have welcomed it if the hon. the Minister had seen fit not to include this &#x201C;but&#x201D; at the end of this clause. Then at least a start would have been made in regard to those persons who qualify in South-West Africa and I hope that the hon. the Minister will later come with legislation to deal with these people who live in South Africa. I do not know where the &#x201C;haakplek&#x201D;, if I may use this expression, is in this regard. I am sure the hon. the Minister concedes that it is the just claim of these people to get their just deserts as far as pensions are concerned. I am sure the hon. the Minister who deals with social welfare realizes that it is only just that they should be included. Somewhere in the workings of the Government or his colleagues there is a &#x201C;haakplek&#x201D;. Whether it is in connection with finance or with the Department of Bantu Administration I do not know. But I do hope that the hon. Minister, who has indicated his willingness to view this matter with sympathy, will not only view it with sympathy but will use his influence within the Cabinet and the Government to see that this position is rectified. I want to assure the hon. the Minister that over the years since the conclusion of hostilities this responsibility has been carried to a great extent by funds which have been made available by the general public. I want to say here that we appreciate the ready access which the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration has given to representatives of the South African Legion and others who try on behalf of the National War Fund to help these Bantu ex-servicemen. That has been done in certain parts of the Republic; it has been done in Lesotho at the request of the Government of Lesotho, and I do believe that we in South Africa now have the opportunity of extending this first of all to the Bantu in South-West Africa and then seeing that that continues and that it is extended, as the hon. the Minister said he will consider doing. I know he has not committed himself beyond undertaking to give it consideration, but I know that if he sets his mind to achieve something he can do it, and I hope that we will have legislation during this Session to see that this long-standing discrimination against the Bantu ex-servicemen is removed from the legislation of this country. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will give that matter his full support.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has indicated that he is considering this matter further, and this gives us an opportunity to make certain other suggestions to him to assist him in coming to a decision. Sir, the one reason why we are compelled to raise this matter under this legislation is that this hon. Minister is responsible for the administration of the War Veterans&#x2019; Pension Act and, of course, for the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; which is now being amended in terms of this clause. We fully realize and appreciate that in terms of other clauses and other provisions of the principal Act, the hon. the Minister delegates this portion dealing with the Bantu to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, but ultimately it is this Minister who will have to bring forward amending legislation so as to facilitate the payment of a war veterans&#x2019; pension to the Bantu as well.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister mentioned quite a number of figures this afternoon as well as yesterday during the Second Reading debate, but I want to say that some of his figures are not really relevant. Here I have in mind the figures which the Minister mentioned concerning those Bantu who are receiving a military pension for a disablement received while on service. With respect, Sir, we are not dealing here at all with that type of pension; that is not a social pension. We are dealing here with a pension in terms of the War Veterans&#x2019; Pension Act which is a social pension, so I submit that it is not relevant at all to quote figures relating to Bantu persons receiving <span class="col_2113-2114" refersTo="page_1070"/>disablement pensions for war service. The point has also been made from this side of the House that although these Bantu did not bear arms, they certainly saw action and were open to grave danger, and indeed the roll of honour displayed in the Gallery Hall of this House records the names of those Bantu who paid the supreme penalty. The figures given by the Minister in respect of those persons receiving military disablement pensions indicate that these persons suffered war injuries and were wounded in action. I would like to illustrate, Sir, what the exclusion of this particular group means to those who are already receiving old-age pensions or <i>ex gratia</i> allowances in terms of existing legislation. Because the Bantu is excluded from the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;, a Bantu war veteran today is receiving the same amount that a Bantu old-age pensioner receives, with a maximum of R5 per month. A White war veteran pensioner receives R43 per month. There is a tremendous difference therefore between the amounts paid to these two groups of war veterans, a difference based merely on the fact that the one is a white war veteran and the other a Bantu war veteran. The Bantu war veteran is not included in the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;; he receives an old-age pension, if he is over the age of 65, or he can receive an <i>ex gratia</i> allowance which also only amounts to R5 per month. In the case of those persons who are already receiving an old-age pension therefore the cost to the State will not be so great, because I presume that the Government will adopt the same attitude that they have adopted in the past, where a ratio of four to one has applied. This will mean that if the Whites receive an extra R8 per month, and the Coloured and Indian R4 per month, the Bantu war veteran will possibly receive an extra R2 per month. It would therefore merely mean the payment of an additional R2 per month to those Bantu who are war veterans but who are receiving old-age pensions or <i>ex gratia</i> allowances. There are only 212 persons receiving those <i>ex gratia</i> allowances. I submit therefore that it is not such a large amount of expenditure that would be involved should this definition not be proceeded with and should the definition be allowed to stand for all racial groups, including the Bantu. It will bring into account these people, many of whom have had years of service during the war, and if we look at the application of the means test we realize that there is a strict means test applicable for all racial groups and particularly amongst the Bantu. So only those who are really in need would qualify for a Bantu war veterans&#x2019; pension if one takes into account the means test that exists. We know that in terms of the regulations, which are not before us now but which are germane to this discussion, if a person has served for one month in so far as war service is concerned he can qualify for a war veterans&#x2019; pension. Only recently I dealt with a case where a White war veteran had served only for five weeks and was discharged and he applied for a war veterans&#x2019; pension and received R43 a month, although he had only served for a period of five weeks. So one can see that there is a wide difference in regard to the position of these people and we believe that it is important, to be consistent with the other legislation as the hon. member for Green Point has suggested, that we should apply it to all racial groups and see that justice is done to this one group, which at the moment is excluded in terms of this clause.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will appreciate that at this stage I cannot consent to this amendment. The reason is very obvious, namely that, unlike hon. members may be thinking at the moment, if I were to withdraw this amendment as it stands here at present, it would not mean that only the Bantu of South-West Africa would qualify, but also that all Bantu in the Republic of South Africa would qualify, and then I would, in regard to this matter, already have conceded the principle on which the Government has up to this stage adopted a different attitude. But this does not only apply to this Government; that is my problem. I am now going to quote from the Hansard of 1941, and the speaker on this specific matter was Minister Jan Hofmeyr, the then Minister of Finance. That was during the war years, while the war was still in progress. At that time he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; makes no provision for Natives. Of course, the hon. member, when he talks of Natives serving in the present war, must not forget that we are dealing here with people who served in previous world wars. I <span class="col_2115-2116" refersTo="page_1071"/>refer him to the report of the Committee on this point. The Committee said as follows: &#x201C;The recommendation of the Committee does not extend to the Native population. No representations have been made to the Committee on behalf of Natives who gave service in the field, and consequently no facts are available upon which the Committee could base any recommendations. It is, however, suggested that the Minister of Social Welfare as the Minister responsible for the administration of this scheme should be empowered to give consideration to any case of a Native who gave service in the field and who has been reduced to a position in which, were he of another race, he would be entitled to receive such a grant.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was the standpoint in 1941 as stated by Minister Hofmeyr. Now, I do not wish to refer myself to that situation, for I know circumstances may have changed completely. But I just want to tell hon. members not to create the impression that this Government is now adopting such a callous attitude. Their own Government during the war adopted the same attitude, for very practical reasons. Now I want to make the matter very clear at once.</p>

<p>In the first place, one has administrative problems. I have already given the undertaking that I shall investigate the matter further and illustrate the matter further at the Third Reading, but there are administrative problems. Firstly, according to the numbers I have here a total of 160,017 Bantu served in the two World Wars. Whether this is a duplication, I do not know. Whether some of them who served in the First World War also served in the Second World War&#x2014;which would, therefore, bring down the total&#x2014;I do not know at all at the moment, but the total is 160,000. How many of them have died and how many are still alive, I do not know either. At this stage these facts are still unknown. Consequently hon. members cannot take it amiss of me if I say that at this stage I cannot commit myself to adopting a brand-new attitude before I know what the consequences of that attitude will be. But I want to add that even if all these Bantu to whom we are referring now, were already receiving old-age pensions, a mere change from the old-age pension to the war veterans&#x2019; pension would, if we were to adhere to the 4:2:1 basis cost the State an additional amount of R3,850,000. I do not wish to go into all the aspects now, for I do not think this is the time to do so, but I should just like to make it clear to hon. members that this is not a decision which this Government is now too callous to take, but that it is an old decision of their Government which has specifically been brought to our notice and which has not been amended up to date.</p>

<p>I want to quote one more passage before proceeding to the next point. I am now going to quote from the so-called Van Eck Report of 1944. The full name of the report reads as follows: &#x201C;Report of the Social Security Committee on Report No. 2 of the Social and Economic Planning Council, entitled &#x2018;Social Security, Social Services and the National Income&#x2019;.&#x201D; In that report we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In connection with old-age pensions reference must be made to the war veterans&#x2019; pensions provided for in the War Pensions Act. They are applicable to Europeans, Coloureds or Indians who served in the Anglo-Boer War, the Great War and the present war (1944). At first the rates were the same as for old-age pensions and the position was really that old-age pensions accrued at the age 60 or earlier in approved cases because war veterans are pre-aged. However, by Act No. 33 of 1943, the war veterans pensions were raised by one-third over old-age pension levels. In addition, the same cost-of-living allowances applied which accrued to old-age pensioners.</block>

<p>The report then furnishes a table, and after that the following is specifically said in respect of the Bantu&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be mentioned that arrangements comparable to the war veterans&#x2019; pensions have been made for needy ex-members of the Native Labour Contingent of the Great War and the Native Military Corps of the present war, although here there are no old-age pensions to replace. The assistance to the Native veterans is not granted by statute, but from the Vote of the Department of Native Affairs. To receive the allowance the Natives must be 60 years of age, or be unable on account of infirmity to undertake regular work.</block>

<p><span class="col_2117-2118" refersTo="page_1072"/>These are the provisions that were made at that time. What is the position today in respect of this specific situation&#x003F; At present the Department of Social Welfare is paying 1,414 Bantu ex-soldiers or their dependants an amount of R175,000 per year, at a maximum of R168 per year, and an average of R123 per year per case as a war pension in respect of wounds, injuries and inability to work owing to injuries sustained in the Second World War.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>That is not a social pension.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not saying that it is a social pension. I just want to point this out to the hon. member. I mentioned the argument merely to prove that we have not totally forgotten or ignored the Bantu. Bantu who sustained injuries as a result of which they are handicapped to such an extent that they cannot perform normal work, are in fact being accommodated in this way. In addition, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development is at present paying approximately R12,000 per year to 212 ex-soldiers. These are <i>ex gratia</i> payments and not war veterans&#x2019; pensions. This is being done in terms of those arrangements which were adopted in 1941 and 1944, and which are still in force today. These are the arrangements to which I referred in the Van Eck report. In other words, on the basis of a means test the Department of Bantu Administration is paying <i>ex gratia</i> payments to all Bantu ex-soldiers who can prove that owing to circumstances their position is such that they are really struggling to make a living. They have therefore not been forgotten. However, to hon. members the point at issue is apparently the principle that all Bantu war veterans of the two world wars who qualify in terms of a certain means test, should receive pensions. That principle is so wide in scope that I cannot give a decision on it now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman I want to thank the hon. the Minister for what he has said. However according to the figures he has just mentioned regarding the number of Bantu who served in the wars and who are receiving pensions to suggest that only 212 of all those thousands are deserving of assistance shows that the surface has only been scratched when it comes to the investigation of this matter. The percentage should be far higher and obviously is far higher. I do not want to pursue the matter with the hon. the Minister now. I just want to say that if he were consistent and followed every decision of the United Party in the past we would have little to disagree about. In giving us the background the hon. the Minister mentioned the situation as it was in 1941. Much has happened since 1941. The problems and the difficulties which have to be faced by these people are very different from what they were in those days. The country is very different and the philosophy of this Government is very different to what it was then regarding the development of these people. I can only leave the matter at that and hope that the hon. the Minister will use his influence in the right quarters to see that justice is done. We do not want to suggest in an irresponsible way that the sluice gates should be opened before we know what the actual demands will be but I think the time has arrived when we can assess carefully what this will entail for the country. This is a matter which the country can afford to investigate when it comes to granting relief to those Bantu who served in the armed forces.</p>

At that stage the United Party did not approve it either, in spite of those circumstances.</p>

<p>In the second place, I want to say that, although the hon. member said that circumstances had changed, our Party&#x2019;s attitude in that respect is very clear in regard to our situation as a whole. That is why I say that they are knocking on the wrong door.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban Central, who was the last speaker yesterday evening, is unfortunately unable to be present here this afternoon as a result of the fact that he had to leave for Kimberley owing to unavoidable circumstances. However, I may mention that he apologized to me for not being here. I found that particularly courteous. I may say, however, that when I referred to his speech which he made in this House yesterday afternoon, I am very sorry to say that I found it less courteous than his conduct when he told me that he was leaving.</p>

<p>What did we find&#x003F; We found that that hon. member, as well as other hon. members on the opposite side of the House who participated in this debate, tried to cast this jewel of a Bill, If I may call it that, under suspicion among local authorities in South Africa. This motive was present in the speech made by the hon. member for Durban Central from beginning to end. What did they say&#x003F; I have the speech made by the hon. member for Durban Central here with me, and I am now going to quote from it.</p>

<p>The hon. member, as well as other hon. members on that side of the House, implied that this Government is derogating from the autonomy and the powers of local authorities in South Africa. The hon. member for Durban Central went even further and he implied that the Government distrusted local authorities in South Africa. Just for the record, I want to quote briefly from the speech made by the hon. member for Durban Central. In the first instance he said this, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Through the years we have learned that the policy of the Government is incapable of being implemented without at least having two effects. The first one is the drastic curtailment of the rights and powers of individuals, groups of individuals, organizations or, as it is in this particular case, local authorities.</block>

<p>That is not all the hon. member for Durban Central said. The hon. the Deputy Minister made an interjection arising out of what I am now going to read out to hon. members. The hon. the Deputy Minister said it was shocking, and I cannot but express my <span class="col_2121-2122" refersTo="page_1074"/>disappointment to the hon. member for Durban Central in his absence, for during the short while he has been in this House, I have regarded him as a reasonably responsible member, even if he is a United Party member. I want to read out to hon. members what he said. He said that the first shocking aspect of this legislation was that the powers and functions of local authorities in respect of the Bantu are being taken over completely by the Government. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I maintain it is shocking because it proves what mistrust there is of local authorities. The implication of the legislation is that all local authorities must now be told that they are in fact incompetent to be entrusted with the control and the development of the Bantu who fall under their jurisdiction.</block>

<p>That is what he said, that they are in fact incompetent. Let me make this very clear. This side of the House has every confidence in local authorities and the commendable work which has been done by them over the years in South Africa. After all, hon. members on that side know as well as I do that it is laid down in legislation that local authorities are solely the agents, as the hon. member for Stilfontein said, when it comes to the implementation of the policy of the Government in regard to Bantu administration. I should like to indicate this very clearly. I want to refer hon. members on that side to the Constitution Act of the Republic of South Africa, section 111, which makes this aspect very clear. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The control and administration of Bantu affairs and of matters specially or differentially affecting Asiatics throughout the Republic shall vest in the State President, who shall exercise all those special powers in regard to Bantu administration which immediately prior to the commencement of this Act were vested in the Governor-General-in-Council of the Union of South Africa, and any land which immediately prior to such commencement vested in the said Governor-General-in-Council for the purpose of reserves for Bantu locations shall vest in the State President &#x2026;</block>

<p>But I should like to go further and quote to hon. members from a speech made by our former Prime Minister, the late Dr. Verwoerd, on the occasion of the Congress of the Institute of Administrators of non-White Affairs in Bloemfontein in 1956. I want to quote what the late Dr. Verwoerd said in respect of this matter, so that there can be no misunderstanding as to what the policy of this side of the House is (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">People who phrase the questions in this manner are in fact labouring under a certain apprehension.</block>

<p>I think that at that stage he was referring specifically to the United Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They do not understand what the actual situation is. The true position is that there is only one source of policy in regard to Native affairs in the country, and that is the State itself. All the cities deal only with administrative functions. The task of the city authorities is to carry out the policy of the country, not to establish basic policy for themselves or for the country.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with respect, I should like to quote at some considerable length, because I want to make the standpoint of this side of the House very clear. I am quoting further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is a very clear foundation which has been laid down in our legislation right from the start, viz. that it would only cause confusion and disorder in the country if Native affairs became subject to a diversity of policies. It simply cannot happen that in one city the Native is controlled on a certain basis and that in another city he is dealt with on another basis; or that piecemeal policy is implemented, because a variety of modes of conduct exists. Nor can it be the position that uniformity of policy should be sought through voluntary co-operation in such an Institute as this&#x2014;because it will not be found. I am saying this deliberately and with so much emphasis because I should prefer that we avoid all misunderstanding <span class="col_2123-2124" refersTo="page_1075"/>in this connection. It is essential to avoid misunderstanding here because recently one has often heard the accusation that the Central Government is interfering in municipal matters when it takes censorious, admonitory or exhortative steps against urban authorities that are not prepared to carry out national policy. I find it essential to make it very clear again to you, who are the interpreters of national policy in your municipal councils: the State is the responsible body for the policy as far as Natives are concerned, and the Central Government is not interfering, but is doing its duty when it issues instructions in this connection and when it exercises its supervisory function in this connection when the local authorities do not fulfil their duties in respect of Native affairs. Their independence in respect of other matters, I am not discussing.</block>

<p>I think it is now very clear to hon. members what the standpoint of the Government is. I really think it is far-fetched of an hon. member such as the hon. member for Durban Central to have made this statement in his speech yesterday evening, i.e. that the Government, mistrusts local authorities in South Africa. I shall during the course of my speech return to those commendable things which have been done by local authorities in South Africa. But allow me at this stage just to say that it is with the greatest appreciation that this side of the House and the Government takes cognizance of the good work which has over the years been done by local authorities in South Africa.</p>

<p>This National Party Government not only has a duty and a calling to fulfil towards the Bantu in South Africa, but it most certainly also has a duty and a calling to fulfil towards the Whites in South Africa. I want to give the assurance that this responsible Government will tackle this responsibility with the greatest conscientiousness and dedication, as it has done in years gone by and as it will also do in the years which lie ahead, in spite of the standpoint of such a rotten Opposition. The National Party Government has been governing South Africa for many years, for more than two decades now.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is saying: &#x201C;Too long&#x201D;. I want to give him the assurance that the National Party is going to govern South Africa for many years to come still. I am afraid that that hon. member will no longer be in this House then. At various elections in the past this National Party Government has received a mandate from the people of South Africa to continue to develop the Bantu policy and the chosen course it has been following for many years. Members on that side of the House can moan and wail, they can do exactly what they like, but this National Party Government will, as long as it receives the mandate from the people of South Africa, continue to implement its Bantu policy in South Africa. I also want to tell hon. members on that side of the House that this side of the House is governing South Africa. They will simply have to accept the fact that this side of the House is governing South Africa and that this side of the House will continue to govern South Africa for many years to come.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if we consider this Bill and its contents, we see that it holds a promise. I see in it the promise to make better provision. And to make better provision is to my mind an admission that the provision which was made in the past, was not perfect. People and a government aware of such a fact, and admitting it, must also be prepared to make continual adjustments. This view of legislation becomes all the more a fact which must be faced up to when we are dealing with this specific situation in which the legislature of South Africa finds itself, and in the times in which we are living, because in South Africa there is an assembly of peoples and an arrangement of inter-ethnic relationships between the various population groups which is the only one of its kind in the world. It is the duty and the responsibility of a responsible government, <span class="col_2125-2126" refersTo="page_1076"/>such as this National Party Government, to be continually making adjustments, as it has in fact done with this Bill which is now under discussion.</p>

<p>As a result of representations by industrialists and employers for larger controlled areas in which labour can move freely, for example from one urban area to another, consideration has been given to means by which to implement this. In order not to separate the control of labour and housing in a larger controlled area, there was, in my humble opinion, one or two possibilities which could be adopted. In the first instance the Government could have decided to establish local authorities side by side in an area, or alternatively, to establish one central body which would undertake the control of all aspects of Bantu administration. The disadvantages of the co-operation between local authorities would have been in more than one respect. Co-operation would not necessarily have been assured. That is obvious. It would be possible to give preference to local interests, and disputes and competition could arise between local authorities, which could make co-operation difficult. Another great disadvantage, in my humble opinion, for the Government would be that it would still have had to liaise with various bodies, as opposed to the one control body. A single controlling body eliminates all these disadvantages and assures, in particular, uniformity in respect of the application of policy, which is of great benefit, specially to the Bantu in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister did not go to work in a haphazard way in drafting this Bill. I can only join with others this afternoon in congratulating him personally on the great circumspectness with which he tackled this great and enormous task. In particular I should like to thank him for his untiring zeal in consulting interested bodies in drafting of this Bill. We are aware that work on this Bill has been in progress for the past two years. We are aware that many other bodies have been consulted. But what I am particularly grateful for is the fact that the United Municipal Executive, as well as the Institute of non-White Administrators, were from time to time consulted in this specific case. If one adopts a completely objective attitude to this Bill, if one stands on the &#x201C;side lines&#x201D;, if I may put it like that, to whom must I pay heed&#x003F; Must I pay heed to an Opposition such as this which is in fact out of contact with reality as far as dealing with Bantu Affairs in South Africa is concerned&#x003F; Or must I, if I want to be objective, pay heed to the Directors of Bantu Affairs Departments in South Africa&#x003F; In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Deputy Minister stated a very important fact. He said that the Institute of non-White Administrators in South Africa unanimously supported this Bill, and that is very significant to me because we are dealing here with men from various local authorities who are wrestling every day with the problems of Bantu administration in South Africa. I maintain we are dealing here with men who know from day to day what the practical problems are in regard to this entire matter. I want to repeat that if I wanted to be objective in regard to this, who must I believe and to whom must I pay heed&#x003F; Would I be correct if I said that I must pay heed only to those people who are directly involved in dealing with Bantu administration in South Africa&#x003F; For that reason I am grateful to the hon. the Deputy Minister for the way in which he has from time to time consulted these people. I am also particularly grateful to know that drafting this Bill also went hand-in-hand with the exchange of ideas between the Institute and the hon. the Deputy Minister. I want to emphasize again that I take far more notice of them than I will of the hon. members on the opposite side. These people deal with the practical side of these matters and they know what is going on. For the first time in history employers&#x2019; organizations have representation on a body which is responsible for the administration and provision of labour. These employers&#x2019; organizations will now be afforded an opportunity, because they will also have representation in the Bantu control boards, to state their problems. Local authorities will also have representation, and in this way the new board will retain its liaison with local authorities. The board will also be <span class="col_2127-2128" refersTo="page_1077"/>able to draw on the years of experience gained by local authorities. I also see great benefits in this Bill for our rural areas. It is a well-known fact that smaller towns, with their lack of finance, do not always have the desirable machinery. The Bantu Administration Board will now meet that deficiency because it will have at its disposal officials of various local authorities who are associated with Bantu administration.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I would like to mention in passing and in regard to which I feel there will be unanimity between this and that side of the House. This is a matter which sometimes gives me cause for concern. I feel that we in this wonderful country of ours, with all its possibilities, have succeeded, particularly during the past few years, in establishing many tourist attractions in our country. When I drive along our national roads, particularly in rural areas, then it worries me when I see those unsightly Bantu dwellings near our national roads. Since organized agriculture will now enjoy representation on such a Bantu administration board, I want to hope and trust that this matter will also be subject to careful scrutiny and that it will in due course be remedied.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on an occasion such as this, as I said at the outset, one cannot but pay tribute to and speak with the greatest appreciation of all the local authorities in South Africa, with one exception&#x2014;I am referring here to Johannesburg&#x2014;for the faithful manner in which they have carried out the policy of the National Party Government in years gone by and are still doing today. I can inform hon. members that I am also speaking from personal practical experience here, because it was my pleasant task to be a member of the town council of Welkom for almost fourteen years. I was mayor of Welkom for four years. I see the hon. members for Johannesburg North and Jeppes are not present here. The only difference between them and me is that I was a far better mayor than they were. I say I am speaking from experience because I know that the town councils in South Africa, including that of Welkom, were inspired with only one ideal and that was to place no obstacles in the way of the implementation of the Bantu policy of the Government, because the town councils in South Africa realize that when we are dealing with Bantu policy in South Africa, the Minister and his deputies are from day to day wrestling with a great problem. It is not the easiest problem on earth to solve when we come to colour relationships. That is why it is only with the greatest praise and appreciation that I can take cognizance of the wonderful way in which local authorities in South Africa have, in years gone by, ensured consistently that they strengthen the hands of the Government, that they have continually supported the Government, by carrying out Government policy. Sir, because this is so, I feel that I am completely at liberty today to address a plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister. But before I do so I just want to say this to hon. members on the opposite side: I can address this plea because I believe, as I read the signs of the times, that I am correct in my premise when I say that this Bill will be passed within a few days in any case. Sir, I want to address a plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister to give preference to the Orange Free State, and particularly to the goldfields complex when it comes to the establishment of the first Bantu administration board. The town council of Welkom, together with all the various departments of the latter, deems itself competent and equipped to share in the conversion and desires to make a contribution to the successful functioning of such a board. As motivation for this I just want to submit a few thoughts to the hon. the Deputy Minister: The already existing, efficient organization of the Bantu Affairs Department of Welkom, which could form the nucleas of a Bantu administration board for this region; the already existing regional Bantu beer brewery&#x2014;this is a regional Bantu beer brewery which is already distributing Bantu beer widely throughout the entire Free State gold fields &#x2014;; the situation of the gold fields&#x2019; Bantu affairs offices which now form a unit together with that of the Board&#x2019;s Bantu Affairs Department; the large concentration <span class="col_2129-2130" refersTo="page_1078"/>of Bantu in the Orange Free State gold fields complex; the zeal of the town council and officials of Welkom in particular, and those of surrounding local authorities in general, to make their contribution in respect of the establishment and the consequent successful functioning of the envisaged boards; the fact that the Bantu Revenue Account of Welkom at present has accumulated surpluses of more than R2 million at its disposal, which funds will accrue to such a board. I believe that this is an important fact of which the hon. the Deputy Minister could take cognizance. Sir, since all factors which seem to be necessary for the establishment and successful functioning of such a board appear already to exist in and around Welkom, the heart of the Free State gold fields complex, I feel myself at liberty to request the hon. the Deputy Minister to give serious consideration to establishing the first Bantu administration board on the Free State gold fields with Welkom as centre.</p>

<p>But in obedience to your ruling, Sir, I will say no more; I think I have said enough.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Welkom has no regard for the opinion of this side of the House and much prefers to accept the opinion and attitude of the Institute of Administrators of non-European Affairs. He says that members on this side of the House have no experience of these affairs. I want to say at once that the Institute of <span class="col_2131-2132" refersTo="page_1079"/>Administrators of non-European Affairs must have some good people upon it, but they view this legislation from a very definite and narrow point of view. It is our function as members of Parliament of this country and as an Opposition to view the measure as a whole. This is what we do, and in condemning this Bill we refer to matters quite outside the ken of the administrators of non-European affairs. When the hon. member says that this side of the House has no experience in these affairs, let me just remind him, firstly, that there are many members on this side of the House who have served on local authority bodies and have had intimate dealings with the very matters now under discussion; secondly, it is a council controlled by this side of the House which for over 20 years has successfully controlled and administered the largest collection of Native people in this country. We are often told that peace and order exist in this country. We all have our different views as to what that is due to. I take it that the hon. member for Welkom will be prepared to concede a share of the credit for this to the administrators of non-European affairs in Johannesburg and to the council which lays down the policy to be administered by those administrators. The hon. member for Transkei in an exemplary speech dealt with both the general and detailed objections which this side of the House has against this measure.</p>

<p>He dealt with it in great detail and so far there has been no adequate answer. But no doubt the Deputy Minister will answer. I want this afternoon rather to deal with the more general aspects against which this Bill must be seen, and to give some idea to the hon. member for Welkom of matters other than detailed administration which are at stake in this measure. Let me first say, as others have said on this side, that we welcome the greater mobility of labour within the urban areas which this Bill affords the Bantu people. But we stress, and we say again, that this greater mobility could have been introduced without dispensing with and taking over from the local authorities concerned. Since Union in 1910, that is 60 years and more ago, matters affecting the urban Natives have been entrusted to local councils of our cities, our towns and our villages, entrusted to the councils of those places in which these Natives live. It is true that they were entrusted to them as agents for the Government, but this entrusting, to my mind, is more than a mere question of agency; it is very much a question of the local people knowing best how to handle the day-to-day affairs of their Black workers as they do indeed of the White workers and citizens of their towns.</p>

<p>Elected by the people of these cities, towns and villages. They are the town councillors who control the non-European Affairs Departments at present administering the affairs of Natives. I agree that they are elected by Whites, but the members of these boards will be nominated by a Government not by any means representative of the people of many of these towns, cities and villages. [Interjection.] This fact that now, in the year 1971, the Government are effecting a <span class="col_2133-2134" refersTo="page_1080"/>take-over from local authorities is to my mind by no means a mere matter of administration; it is a historic step which confirms that we are at a watershed in regard to Native Affairs. Just as on the one hand we had that watershed of a move to sovereign independence of what were hitherto the Reserves, so in regard to the urban Natives there has been a watershed. That watershed is represented by the decision to move our entire Native population in the urban areas on to a migratory basis, if possible. This Bill, which is innocent looking in many respects, sets the seal upon this decision of the Government to convert everything to a migratory basis. We have known for many years that the Government has had before the people, the bodies affected, draft Bills much akin to the one we now have before us. We know that in those draft Bills were clauses which severely affected the section 10 rights of the Native people in our cities. It is true that in the present measure that matter has been excised, but on the other hand the Government is securing its purpose to place Bantu labour on a migratory basis by means, as has been pointed out, of the persuasion of so many of the families of these people to move out of the cities. At the present time I do not doubt that the Government is able, by means of this so-called persuasion, to secure the movement of Bantu out of the cities in sufficient numbers to make it unnecessary to take any further steps, but one certainly is by no means confident that we shall not hear more of this matter in due course.</p>

<p>I believe that this measure in a sense, therefore, sets the seal upon this revolutionary change in regard to the urban Native. I may say that, not only under Governments of this party, but also under Governments of the party opposite there was never any question that our entire urban Native labour force should be placed on a migratory basis. Under all previous Nationalist Governments of Gen. Hertzog and Dr. Malan this was never an aim of their policies. It is just as new an innovation as is the whole question of sovereign independence. I say therefore that this Bill serves the whole aim of Government policy to move all the urban Native people on to a migratory basis. I believe that it serves to show the contrast between the two visions of the party opposite and of this party in regard to the urban Native.</p>

<p>Let us look briefly at some of the features of the Nationalist vision for the urban Native. Firstly more and more hostels are appearing in our towns and cities. In 1964 a law was passed in which reference was made to hostels and we are today seeing more and more of these hostels appearing in places like Diepkloof. It is now being said that in Cape Town employers are being urged and encouraged to erect hostels and this is to be the new basis upon which the labour will be housed here. This side concedes completely that there is a place for migratory labour in our system. It has been traditionally so in regard to the mines, and certain other categories of work, but it is an entirely different proposition to move the entire Bantu labour force onto a migratory basis. In the mines it has traditionally been the young men who have come to sow their wild oats and to have the experience of working there for three or four years. In most cases they have been unmarried men. It is quite a different question, however, in the case of the men who are to be operatives in factories. That is to be their place of employment year in and year out, from the start of their working life to their retirement, and now they too will be placed upon a migratory basis. The work in the mines, hard though it often is, can fairly be described as being unskilled in most cases. Operatives in factories, however, compete in world competition. They need to be highly productive and they need to grow annually more productive.</p>

<p>Very often they are on a migratory basis for a few years, because they do not always come back again. This is true of people from Malawi, Portuguese East Africa and certain other places.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite should bear this in mind when they look at our economic <span class="col_2135-2136" refersTo="page_1081"/>position. Our balance of payments position is one of the matters causing most concern to the hon. Minister of Finance and to the country. Our balance of payments position is clearly moving into more difficult times with the value of gold produced remaining constant. With our population and our standards rising, our gold production forms an ever smaller percentage of our exports. So it is that our balance of payments and our export/import position is in a most unsatisfactory position. These are facts that cannot just be wishes away. These are the hard facts of life, just as when one&#x2019;s bank manager calls one in and says that something must be done about one&#x2019;s overdraft. By contrast with this, the U.P. policy, as I have said, continues with what has been the traditional policy of South Africa in this regard. We agree concerning categories of migratory labour. Not every Native wants to bring his wife to town, nor will he be encouraged to do so. Equally we recognize an urbanized and detribalized class of Native, who must have a settled life near his work and as such benefits the entire country.</p>

<p>Side by side with the rising hostels, these gloomy, concrete structures which are most unattractive, merely places to lay one&#x2019;s head at night, is a growing shortage of homes in our big cities. Johannesburg alone has a shortage of 15,000 units for families. This is a shocking condemnation of the Government in this time.</p>

<p>No, that is not so. I would like to deal with that. The Deputy Minister says that it is a shocking contradiction that, on the one hand, we criticize them for moving to a complete basis of migratory labour and at the same time for there being no houses for the families.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I will deal with it. I will now account for it. The position is that the Government&#x2019;s stated policy is to go over to complete migratory labour. They have not got there yet, it is true. But they are pushing people out now, as fast as they can separate them. Surely the Deputy Minister does not run away from their policy stated by no one less than the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who stated that their policy was to get all the Native labour in the urban areas onto a migratory basis. That is his policy and I condemn it. Most of the people on that side of the House in their heart of hearts condemn it. Of course I criticize him for it, because it is a thoroughly bad aim to have. But now I also criticize him for having in our cities thousands and thousands of Bantu families that have no homes to go to. They are either living in crowded conditions with other Bantu families that have homes or they are creeping into the backyards of White and other people and causing all sorts of objections to arise all around the country. So, the hon. Deputy Minister should take better stock of where his policy has got to. His policy has got to the position that, in Johannesburg alone, there are 15,000 Bantu families requiring homes. This inefficient Government has not provided the homes for these people. That is the position. I am afraid that the hon. Deputy Minister must realize that they naturally should be criticized on both those grounds.</p>

<p>Side by side with these rising hostels is this terrible shortage of houses and all the evil consequences which flow from it. I do not doubt that this is part of the Government&#x2019;s attempt to discourage the Bantu people from being there, persuasion of the Government that they should go out to these places in the areas which are to become the homelands. Because this matter is quite often wrongly used in this House, I would like to make one reference in passing to the position as it was after the war. There was, of course, quite a great shortage of houses, and hence many &#x201C;pondokkies&#x201D; after the war. We must remember that a war was being fought and people were drawn in and therefore it was not possible &#x2026; [Interjection.] Let us be fair on this; I will take any criticism gamely. Let us take this in perspective. The war brought in people in great numbers to Johannesburg and there alone we found a considerable number of &#x201C;pondokkies&#x201D;.</p>

<from><span class="col_2137-2138" refersTo="page_1082"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I want to remind hon. members opposite that it was not a United Party municipal council that governed the Johannesburg municipal area in the war years &#x2026; [Interjections.] Do hon. members not know that it was a Labour Party local authority&#x003F; [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I am quite glad that I have caused some amusement to hon. members on that side of the House. The United Party took over the Johannesburg Municipal Council in 1946; up to that time the council consisted of a majority of Labour Party members.</p>

<p>As hon. members know the only party in this Parliament which was allied with the Labour Party is the party on the opposite side of the House. To show hon. members that this is not a kind of problem that can be solved overnight, it was only in about 1954 that any impression was made upon the shortage of housing in Johannesburg. Now I want to move from past to present. I say that the way the Government has allowed the housing position, particularly of the non-White people of this country, to slip back in these 20 years, is shocking. The number of &#x201C;pondokkies&#x201D; that you see and the infinitely more that you do not see in South Africa today is appalling. It is an appalling indictment of this Government especially when they are so keen to criticize the alleged failure of the United Party during the period after the war. I think they should first remember what they have failed to do in these piping days of peace.</p>

<p>The second feature in South Africa with this new policy in regard to urban Natives is these rising number of resettlement townships which are all situated on land which is included in a Native reserve. In the main, I say, these places are places of gloom. They are places where women and children and the aged are found. With few exceptions no work is available there; with few exceptions there is no plot to till. In these native &#x201C;statte&#x201D; of old there were the &#x201C;rietdak&#x201D; houses and the occupants of these huts could till the land which was situated nearby. There they could have their own plots. These unfortunate resettlement townships&#x2014;perhaps the reason is space or whatever it may be&#x2014;are places of gloom. So often the facilities are not there. Our policy, by contrast, is not to separate the old people when their working days are over, from their families who can sustain them. How often have we not heard from the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, and quite rightly so, that a civilized society keeps these old people within its embrace. Then there is the interworking with the young and the old and what a noble thing it is, we are told, for young people to look after their old people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that hon. members opposite, when they reflect on this aspect of their policy, can view it with pride. Let us be fair to hon. members opposite. They do not wish to deny family life. It is not their wish, but equally paramount with them is, what they believe to be the need to save White civilization. They believe that this is the way to achieve that object.</p>

<p>No, we do, but we believe it can and will be done in a different way. We believe in it just as strongly. We want to save the Deputy Minister just as much as he wants to save himself.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite have come up with various ideas in order to try to neutralize this separation of families. We have discussed before the border areas policy. How much is that policy not in discredit today among academic and businessmen on their side. Now we have the quaint idea of jetting these Bantu workers daily from places like Groblersdal and Mafeking into Johannesburg. This is a worthy motive. But in today&#x2019;s very paper we find a complete refutal of that whole motive. Did hon. members not see in today&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> the fact that the cost of a daily return ticket from Malmesbury to Cape Town for a White worker has gone up to R30 per month&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan wants to bring these workers from Mafeking and Groblersdal to the Rand. Can you imagine what the cost of this will be&#x003F; There is not time to dwell upon it. I think when one has pointed to the cost in this regard, one immediately shows how ridiculous it is. If the hon. member for Brakpan will say: &#x201C;Not daily but weekly,&#x201D; then I say to him: &#x201C;What about the question of two homes&#x003F;&#x201D; That Native worker must have a home in the reserve and a home in the town. Hon. members opposite know better than any the high cost of keeping two homes. Time does not allow me to dwell upon the disadvantages for South Africa of this greater <span class="col_2139-2140" refersTo="page_1083"/>and growing emphasis on migratory labour. One knows of the high rate of crime; one knows of the poverty, the malnutrition; one knows of the illegitimacy among the Coloured people and among the Bantu people and how this affects our crime rate. What do we not lose in efficiency and, therefore, in wealth for everybody through this system&#x003F; I say the approach of hon. members opposite is that they do not like doing this, but they are doing it in order to save the White people. In other words, they say &#x201C;the end justifies the means&#x201D;. That is the most dangerous approach which one can make to affairs in any civilized country at this time. We also believe most sincerely and completely that it is absolutely essential for the White people to survive in South Africa to lead other people to a finer life.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to remind hon. members opposite&#x2014;I have said this before, but I want to say it again&#x2014;that they have always had a view that we as a White people have a destiny in South Africa, a destiny, in the words of Prof. Viljoen &#x201C;to Christianize and civilize the non-White peoples&#x201D;. I say nothing can be a greater antithesis of Christianity and civilization than to move on increasingly until finally we reach with our Bantu working urban people a position of complete migratory labour.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker when the hon. member for Transkei made the first part of his speech the other day, he spoke about poor administration and said &#x201C;It is because of the interference by the State in the administration of local authorities&#x201D;. I then thought that he was not being very serious and he was in fact just trying to get the last few minutes of the evening. But believe it or not, he came forward the next day with the second part of his speech, and moved an amendment. In that amendment he said that the United Party was not going to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill, because it removed the application of the laws regarding urban Bantu from the local authority where they rightly belong. He also said that it vested the Minister with dictatorial and far-reaching powers.</p>

<p>In the first instance, as regards the powers of which these are being divested, I just want to point out that the hon. member for Welkom a moment ago quoted section 11 of the Constitution Act in this connection. He indicated very clearly that control and administration of Bantu Affairs is vested in the State President, who exercises all the special powers in regard to Bantu administration. Now I am asking the hon. Minister whether they want to change that part of the Constitution Act&#x003F; As far as we are concerned, this is what this matter is all about. The Government is in this measure requesting the right to exercise the right it has in terms of section 11 of the Constitution Act. That right the Government has in the course of years handed over in part to local authorities. If we consider the Bantu (Urban Areas) Act of 1923, and the Consolidated Act, Act No. 25 of 1945, with its numerous long clauses, we find that everything which is stated in section 11 is embodied in that legislation. Not a jot or tittel of the original intension has been reproved. I want to associate myself with the quotation from Dr. Verwoerd which was read a moment ago by the hon. member for Welkom. One should really quote the entire speech to the United Party, because there is such a tremendous amount they can learn from it. Dr. Verwoerd was talking to the administrators of non-White affairs. The history of these matters has been written by Gen. <span class="col_2141-2142" refersTo="page_1084"/>Botha and Gen. Smuts. It is not we who formulated it. It is history which indicates that the Government has the plenary power to formulate policy, and that local authorities are only afforded the opportunity to apply it and carry it out. In this regard Dr. Verwoerd was discussing the matter of licencing. The other day I found it terrible to hear how the hon. member for Transkei referred to these licenced officers. He referred to them in a derogatory manner. He did it spitefully and he said it spitefully. He even insinuated ugly things. I would like to read out the first section of his Hansard to the House. He said: &#x201C;The managers of Bantu municipal affairs have to be licenced by this Government&#x201D;. I shall return to this again in a moment, because I want to show how the hon. member for Transkei is dancing to the tune of other people who told him to say these things. He went on: &#x201C;Their livelihood, therefore, depends on the appreciation of the necessity of carrying out the instructions and wishes of this Government&#x201D;. Nowhere in this debate was a grosser insult expressed towards people who have carried out their duties over a long period of time than the hon. member for Transkei did.</p>

<p>That is not our argument. This has been stated repeatedly already. I shall now indicate what the functions of these people are. He said of these people&#x2014;I may not use the word &#x201C;bribe&#x201D;, because it is not stated here&#x2014;&#x201C;Their livelihood depends on the appreciation of the necessity of carrying out Government instructions&#x201D;. What does all that mean&#x003F; It means that they are not people with an opinion of their own, and that they do not think for themselves. I now want to quote what Dr. Verwoerd said on 17th September, 1956, if I am correct. He said: &#x201C;The licensee is a person who has duties to fulfil in regard to which the State has the right of supervision. It is of so much importance that the State is entitled to cancel the licence if a municipal administrator does not properly fulfil the functions entrusted to him.&#x201D; That is altogether in line with the Constitution Act. What right does the hon. member for Transkei have to say that these people are merely dancing to the tune of the Government&#x003F; Dr. Verwoerd went on to say: &#x201C;The licence granted to these people gives them the patronage of the Minister and of the Department if they should encounter certain conflicts in the lawful fulfilment of their duties.&#x201D; Here the policy of the Government is very clearly defined. We accept that these people have certain rights, duties and instructions which they must carry out in terms of the Constitution Act. I now want to ask the hon. member for Transkei whether they want this provision to be withdrawn, whether they want to delete it and whether they want to remove it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands a moment ago sang the praises of the Municipality of Johannesburg. It suits the United Party to do so, because it is their people who are in charge there. However, I want to tell hon. members on the opposite side that this is precisely what our difficulty is. They say they do not want this Act implemented because these licences will dance to the tune of the Government. In addition they say by implication that this City Council of theirs, which is United Party controlled, does not want to implement the Government&#x2019;s policy. That is precisely what the Act says we must do. The Act says that the municipalities must implement the Government&#x2019;s policy. I can quote to hon. members where Dr. Verwoerd elaborated at length on this. He pointed out that there could not be two policy making bodies as far as this matter was concerned. Because this is the case, this Government went and sought the co-operation of all the people dealing with this matter. Sir, I want to refer to a speech made by the hon. the Minister for Bantu Administration and Development on 29th November, 1967, before the Transvaal Chamber of Industries. He spoke there about the problems in regard to Bantu administration. First he referred in particular to the labour problem in regard to Bantu, and he then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We to whom Bantu administration has been entrusted, try to remain as closely as possible in touch with reality and to adjust laws and regulations within our policy to new circumstances and problems continually.</block>

<p>This the Minister said in 1967 already, and subsequently invited the Camber of Industries to hold a discussion with him in regard to this matter, and they did so, as the hon. the Deputy Minister also told us.</p>

<p>Sir, I have a problem with the United Party. They are putting up this fight here <span class="col_2143-2144" refersTo="page_1085"/>in Parliament to bring about the defeat of this legislation, but I want to allege that they are in fact dancing to the tune of other people. I have here in my hand a number of statements which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 20th December, 1970. This report appeared a few days after the Secretary for Bantu Administration had divulged that such legislation was being envisaged. Then we got this kind of thing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Political storm breaking over Bantu Affairs Administration Bill. M. C. Botha, Czar of African workers. Draconian powers and secrecy attacked.</block>

<p>I quote what the <i>Sunday Times</i> wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister himself will retain draconian powers over the lives of Africans outside the reserves.</block>

<p>Here they talk about &#x201C;draconian powers&#x201D;, and in the amendment the Opposition talks about dictatorial powers. But, Sir, I want to come to something else; I want to tell the United Party that they are nurturing two adders in their bosom. If they do not get rid of those adders, they are going to have a problem. Sir, I am now going to quote to you what Mr. Beyers Naud&#x00E9; said. The <i>Sunday Times</i> asked for his comment on this envisaged legislation, and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu Affairs Administration Bill published this week has given rise to &#x2026;</block>

<p>He had not yet read the Bill; he had not yet studied it, but he was prepared to make a long comment on it, and he hides behind the words &#x201C;has given rise to&#x201D;. Subsequently he said &#x201C;the Bill appears to be&#x201D;&#x2014; again just another vague misgiving. All kinds of things were mentioned without the Bill having been studied. Mr. Beyers Naud&#x00E9;, the Leader of the Christian Institute, went further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question therefore arises whether this Bill will be used to conscript migrant workers as farm labourers.</block>

<p>&#x201C;To conscript&#x201D;! Sir, these words were not used without a purpose. He said that he had not studied the Bill, but he used words such as &#x201C;it gives rise to&#x201D;, &#x201C;it appears&#x201D; and that it appears that conscription may be applied, and to crown it all, conscription as farm labourers. We still remember the events of a few years ago when those people, in conjunction with these same people, kicked up a fuss about what was supposedly happening in the so-called prison gaols, etc.</p>

<p>This is the suspicion and this is my objection, that these people allow themselves to be misled by these things. They must not tell me now that Beyers Naud&#x00E9; is not their man, because in the same report, linked to this one, they mention three Johannesburg leaders, Messrs. Powell, Harry Schwartz and J. F. Oberholzer. Listen to what they are in agreement with&#x2014;</p>

<p>They agree with this. The point I want to make is not what these people said, but that the United Party allowed themselves to be taken in too by these people. They dare not today say anything different to what these people are saying, because the incitement and agitations of the <i>Sunday Times</i> and of a Beyers Naud&#x00E9; of the Christian Institute is endorsed by those people, and that is my point. I may not say here that they are agitating, nor do I say so, but I maintain that they use the same terminology to say the same things these people are saying, and these people say these things before having read the Bill.</p>

<p>I want to come to a second group of people, and they are the Institute of Race Relations. Our problem with these people is that the Christian Institute sails under the flag of so-called Christianity and dons the mantle of Christianity. From beneath that mantle they play a political tune, and the United Party dances to that tune. I have the same difficulties with the Institute of Race Relations, these people who hide behind their mantle of science and the study of racial problems. These people issue one statement after the other. I have here in my hand No. 168 of 1970. This shows how many they issue. When I read this statement, I began to underline what did not seem correct to me, and you can see how it has been underscored. Almost every line written here is not true, or a question mark can be appended in the margin, or is incorrectly presented. I maintain that these people don the mantle of <span class="col_2145-2146" refersTo="page_1086"/>science and from beneath that mantle they are playing a tune to which those people are dancing. That is why we had the phenomenon here yesterday that what the hon. member for Johannesburg North was speaking, I quickly laid hands on this document and what I found interesting was that he used almost every argument stated here in the same sequence, correct or incorrect. He used them as they are stated there, but this document predates by a considerable margin the first standpoint of the United Party in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>I want to tell the United Party that Bantu administration is a very wide field. It is not merely concerned with a little influx control or a little housing or a little transportation of the Bantu. When I consider all the factors we have to deal with, I should like to quote a man like Dr. Eiselen, who himself said that he was merely making a summary. He spoke about the clearance of chaotic Bantu housing in the industrial areas, the introduction of the site-and-service scheme, the replacement of the irksome pass system with a comfortable and efficient reference book identification, the creation of labour bureaux and everything which has a bearing on that, the establishment of tribal, regional and territorial authorities. Then he mentioned another long list which I do not have the time now to read out. The fact of the matter is that we are dealing here with a very comprehensive problem when we talk about Bantu administration, and what we are requesting here today is not a debate on each of those separate aspects we are administering. We are requesting the right to place what was allocated to the Government by the Constitution Act where it belongs, namely in the hands of the Government, and the Government is requesting broader powers to that end. This yellow document to which I referred, is full of anomalies. The hon. members for Johannesburg North and the Transkei echoed the sentiments expressed therein. They stated precisely what it contained therein. It is stated there: &#x201C;There is no provision for public accountability&#x201D;. They say that it will not be necessary for the Board to report to the public. Sir, statements of these kind are merely being made in order to sow suspicion. While we are engaged in waging a titanic struggle abroad against those who want to bring about our downfall, we find that others are trying to create the impression that the Minister is a &#x201C;Czar with draconian powers&#x201D;. They are trying to imply that he has dictatorial powers. In sections 26 and 27 of Act No. 25 of 1945 it is very clearly stated what the responsibilities of the municipalities are at present. We know what the duties of this board is going to be, as far as accountability is concerned. Those two sections state very clearly that certain statistical particulars have to be furnished, and that a report has to be made to the Minister and the Department. However, those hon. members feel themselves at liberty to say that the public will not know what is going on. Sir, as long as they are doing that, they are merely running a race against the Progressive Party outside. They are trying to see whether they cannot execute a better dance to the tune the liberalists are playing to them from the corner of the Institute of Race Relations and the Christian Institute. I want to predict that this dance is going to come off second best in this dance.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I find it perfectly understandable that the hon. member for Westdene should be so enthusiastic about these Bantu affairs advisory boards. I should imagine that he is even more enthusiastic than ever about the provision in this Bill that persons are nominated to these boards by the Minister, because I can foresee his position after the next general election, when he is very likely to be looking for a new job. To have the title MBAAB after one&#x2019;s name may not sound as good as the title M.P., but at least he will not be in danger of losing an election. I shall go a little further and say that if this Bill becomes law, I am even prepared to put the case of that hon. member, as well as those of the hon. members for Boksburg, Springs, Germiston District and Randburg, to the United Party Minister, to see if he cannot perhaps accommodate them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene mentioned that licensed officials of non-European Affairs Departments were entitled to their own opinions and certainly have their own opinions on the advisability of this Bill. I want to say to him that by the time this Bill in its draft form reached them, they must have realized that the writing was on the wall. They must have realized that their departments were going to be swallowed by this hon. Minister&#x2019;s department and that they themselves would be brought into this Minister&#x2019;s department if he wanted to compel them to do so. I do not think it is fair to suggest that people <span class="col_2147-2148" refersTo="page_1087"/>in that sort of predicament could possibly have brought completely independent minds to bear on the merits of this Bill.</p>

<p>If this Bill in its broad outline and in its detail reveals anything at all, it betrays this Government&#x2019;s total bankruptcy as far as any realistic or constructive policy for urban Bantu is concerned. We cannot look at this Bill in a vacuum. We cannot ignore what for many years now has been the case in the Republic, namely that the Bantu who settled in urban areas, the areas regarded by this Government as the White areas, run to many millions in number and that these people are no more citizens of far-off Bantu homelands than we of European origin in this country are still tied to the various European countries from which our forefathers came many generations ago.</p>

<p>This measure sets out to establish an entirely new basis for the future administration of Bantu affairs in our country in all the areas outside the so-called homelands. The basic philosophy behind the measure shows how radically we on this side of the House differ in our approach from the members on the Government&#x2019;s side. Putting these matters at their broadest, we believe in recognizing the reality of the situation. We believe that it is not a new situation, but a situation which has been present with us for many years. A lot has been said about Soweto and its 800,000 permanent inhabitants. There are millions of people in other parts of the country too who long ago became a permanent part of our urban or non-homeland population.</p>

<p>Just as one cannot turn the clock back and move back in time, so it is impossible merely by passing a law to ensure that second, third and perhaps fourth generation Bantu urban dwellers will revert to their tribal status and go back to an earlier stage of their development. That is quite impossible. How the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration can possibly take this approach, is beyond our comprehension.</p>

<p>We of the United Party, the Official Opposition, believe that the millions of Bantu who are now settled in the urban areas should have been recognized long ago as belonging to permanent communities and that the task of a good government in this country will be to ensure that such communities become as stable as possible, not as unstable as possible. The view of this Government, in fact the very aim of this Government, seems to be to make our urban Bantu communities as unstable as possible. That is where we differ so radically from the gentlemen on the other side. We want the urban Bantu, who are a fact of existence in this country, to grow roots, to be able to build their houses, to live decent lives with, as far as possible, their families around them and to participate responsibility in the administration of their local affairs. This Nationalist Government is setting out to do the exact opposite. This Bill before us represents a major step in what the Government is aiming to achieve. What are the ends which the Government wants to achieve&#x003F; The Government wants to convert our urban Bantu population and, for that matter, all other Bantu outside the homelands into a rootless, voiceless and rightless mass.</p>

<p>No, I am sorry if the truth hurts that hon. member, but these are the facts of the situation. The Government wants to control them as rigidly as possible. It wants to control where they should live, where they should work and what kind of work they should do. It want to try to break down whatever orientation they might have developed in the direction of the so-called White areas, which in fact are their own settled areas as well, and it tries to induce them to accept that they really belong in the faraway homelands. The hon. member for Brakpan told us quite a lot about this when he spoke earlier in this debate. What he said was nonsense, of course, and it caused a fair amount of merriment. I believe we should examine what he said very closely because it betrays a lot of the thinking which is going on on that side of the House. I wonder, in fact, whether it was not betraying quite a lot of the thinking of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and of his Deputy Minister who is handling this legislation. The hon. member for Brakpan has to a large extent performed a service for which everybody in this House should be grateful. He left <span class="col_2149-2150" refersTo="page_1088"/>us in no doubt at all as to the woolly-mindedness of this Government in tackling what is really one of the major problems of our time. I might add that he also highlighted how far this Government, in trying to implement its ideological and impossible plans, has driven itself away from reality. The hon. member for Brakpan told us&#x2014;and we have heard this sort of nonsense before&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister and his Deputy are silent. We all enjoyed the joke at the time, but I wonder if we should not pause a moment to examine some of the implications of this type of remark. Well, the hon. member for Brakpan&#x2019;s faith in the ability of this Government to create a transport system big enough to do this, is touching. There have been suggestions that this mass transportation should be done by way of Jumbo jets. I do not know whether they have consulted the hon. the Minister of Transport to ascertain whether he can build new railway lines for them. Maybe they are thinking of a vast mass bus transport system or perhaps the hon. the Minister of Transport himself might suggest a pipeline. I wonder what the hon. the Minister of Transport will have to say if this question were to be put pertinently to him. I can go further. If I can get the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s and his Deputy&#x2019;s attention. I would like to know whether even they have discussed the question of mass transportation of Bantu between our urban areas and the homelands. I see that they are at the moment engaged in a conversation and therefore I will repeat the question: Could they perhaps indicate to us whether even they have seriously debated with the Minister of Transport the question of the feasibility of mass transportation of the Bantu workers on a daily basis to and from the homelands&#x003F;</p>

<p>As this House has already been told in this debate, the. South African Railways are already experiencing the utmost difficulties in transporting Bantu workers from Soweto to Johannesburg. I do think that, in the interests of logic and perhaps a reasonable level of debate, this hon. Deputy Minister might ensure that next time he brings speakers into a debate we are not presented with suggestions such as we have had today. What we can take as common cause, of course, is the fact that the hon. member for Brakpan did not have the faintest idea of what he was talking about. Now and for the future we cannot even imagine any means of transporting millions of Bantu workers on a migratory basis between the homelands and our urban industrial complexes, whether it is on a daily, weekly or even a monthly basis.</p>

<p>This Nationalist Government departs from reality and seeks comfort in the most extravagant fantasies. This Bill is in fact based on a myth, the myth that our urban Bantu communities do not belong where they are and where they have been for generations, but that they belong in far-off homelands. But the legislation before this House is far from a myth.</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>This legislation, we all know, is eminently capable of implementation in the most stringent way. Here I think that if the hon. the Deputy Minister should be taken to task for anything at all, it is for the fact that in his introductory speech to this debate he glossed over all the really important and dangerous aspects of this Bill and tried to present it as though it were some gentle measure, just allowing the Government to have more efficient control of the situation or more efficient administration. What the hon. the Deputy Minister is seeking to do with this legislation is to try to translate <span class="col_2151-2152" refersTo="page_1089"/>his overall policy, his ideological blueprint, into some tangible form, by assuming to himself the power to regulate the lives of all non-homeland Bantu literally from the cradle to the grave. In setting out to do this, he is not only creating for himself a dictatorship over an empire that controls the vast majority of the populalocal authorities and even to people who are now the employees of such authorities. Subsection (1) of clause 16 enables Bantu administration boards&#x2014;the sort of boards that are going to be created to take over the control of all Bantu in non-homeland areas&#x2014;to demand of local authorities that they provide certain services. If the local authorities refuse, or if there is a dispute in the matter, then the final power to compel a local authority to provide the services required rests with the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, in terms of subsection (4). The hon. member for Langlaagte spoke very glowingly of this type of provision. In fact, he went so far as to claim that there was considerable support for this general approach. The hon. member is, of course, a former member of the Johannesburg City Council. He said that there had been a feeling among councillors in Johannesburg for some considerable time that there should be a metropolitan approach to the provision of services. That is true, but can it be said by any stretch of the imagination, that clause 16 of this Bill provides for an actual metropolitan approach by elected local authorities&#x003F; Of course it cannot. What it does is to provide that the Minister, if he wants to. may dictate to the local authorities whose services he wants to use. He can dictate in that he can say what he wants of a local authority and then stipulate the terms on which he is to receive it.</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. Is the hon. the Deputy Minister not listening to me&#x003F; The hon. member for Langlaagte was a member of the Johannesburg City Council for many years. I believe it is not inconceivable that in his fairly long tenure of office as a city councillor of Johannesburg, he did at times, or he might have, put the interests of Johannesburg ahead of those of his political party. I wonder, when he was still in the Johannesburg City Council, whether he, in the interests of the council as a body representing the ratepayers, would possibly have agreed to this type of imposition on the rights of the Council, which could, in the absolute and final discretion of the Minister, result in heavy capital expenditure which might or might not be properly compensated for.</p>

<p>Then we have the provisions of clause 10 of this Bill. The hon. member for Westdene seemed to take it amiss that a Sunday newspaper, the <i>Sunday Times,</i> should have referred to the provisions of this Bill as making the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration a Czar over the Bantu outside the homelands. I wonder if the hon. member even took the trouble to read subclause (10), because this subclause makes this hon. Minister the Czar over White employees of our local authorities. Subclause (10) enables the hon. the Minister to dictate the future of White employees of local authorities. I want to read this subclause because I think it is very important to get it all on record here and now. Sub-clause (10) (a) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person to whom employment has been offered in terms of subsection (6) and who elects in writing not to accept such employment, shall be dealt with by the local authority concerned in terms of the provisions governing his conditions of service, remuneration and pension rights &#x2026;</block>

<p>Thus far it is perfectly all right, but the paragraph reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in such provisions, if the Minister, after consultation with such local authority, is of the opinion that any person&#x2019;s election not to accept such employment is unreasonable, such person shall be deemed to have resigned from the service of such local authority in terms of such provisions &#x2026;</block>

<p>If that were to be reduced to plain English, all it means is that if a council employee does not want to join this hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department when he is offered a job, and if this hon. Minister thinks he is being unreasonable in turning down the offer, this hon. Minister then has the right to sack that employee not only from his Department, but from the council by which he is employed.</p>

<p>In fact, I would go so far as to say that the provisions of clause (10) are in the classical tradition of the oldtime press gangs. Why should the hon. the Minister seek to take this type of power&#x003F; I want to add that clause 10 (10) (b) makes the Minister&#x2019;s position quite plain. It reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Any decision of the Minister under paragraph (a) shall be final.</block>

<p>There is no right of appeal to anybody. Why should he have the right, a right which might be exercised in a fit of pique, to sack a council employee from service in the council just because that employee does not want to transfer to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to come back to other aspects of this Bill generally, aspects which we submit will have the effect of breaking down more than half a century of goodwill that has been established between local authorities and the Bantu whose affairs they have administered. Here it must be remembered that the local authorities have carried out their work in the interest of the people, in the interest of their own ratepayers, of their own White voters as well as in the interest of the Bantu and not as part of a grand ideological design that has no regard for individual right, but seeks to impose a system for the system&#x2019;s sake. The hon. the Deputy Minister, in introducing this Bill, suggested to us that his Department, in fact, has the capacity to be more humane than local authorities. I am quite sure that this in theory might well be true. In practice, I suggest, it is far from true. How does his attitude, for instance, square with the official attitude adopted by a former colleague of his, also a Deputy Minister, who spoke of non-productive Bantu in urban areas as being superfluous appendages&#x003F; This hon. Deputy Minister, it is true, in recent times appears to have been at pains to dissociate himself from this remark. But can this be taken as an official change of heart on the part of the Department&#x003F; Then we have another former colleague of this hon. Deputy Minister who was also a Deputy Minister associated with him and who is now Minister of Community Development. He stated it as policy that living conditions of Bantu in White areas were not to be made too comfortable in case it should induce them to stay in the White areas. Is that still policy, and if so, does this square with the so-called humane approach suggested by this hon. Deputy Minister&#x003F; This is a very real question, Mr. Speaker, because I suggest that if the Deputy Minister had any such thoughts, those thoughts have remained inside his head. One only has to look at the respective types of hostel accommodation provided by the Johannesburg City Council and the Resettlement Board to see that the Johannesburg City Council hostel accommodation, even though it is still comparatively basic, is infinitely superior to that provided by the Resettlement Board under the authority of the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, here are several other aspects which I want to touch on. I want to say that we on this side of the House obviously welcome one thing, which is the possibility under this new system of there being a greater mobility of labour. This cuts both ways. It operates in favour of employers in that it will iron out a lot of their problems and I think it is fair to say that it will also operate in favour of the Bantu; in other words, their position is for the moment going to be improved. Our objection, of course, as has already been said, is that this legislation merely uses this one good provision as a smokescreen for introducing any number of other things and I am afraid that in coming with this legislation this Government has managed to leave many people under a misapprehension. If, for instance, you take the attitude of organized industry to this Bill, you will see that the Federated Chamber of Industries has welcomed the <span class="col_2155-2156" refersTo="page_1091"/>greater mobility of labour, as we do, but what the Chamber of Industries does not seem to have applied its mind to, is the fact that the labour pools in the new enlarged administration areas themselves are not going to be extended. There is no suggestion that influx control, for instance, is going to be relaxed. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>The argument which the hon. member for Kensington has just delivered, plus all the other speeches of hon. members opposite, have made a few things clear to me. The first is that they have only come to light with a few arguments that did not appear in this yellow circular of the Institute of Race Relations or in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> From their ranks in this debate only one single argument has emerged which they themselves have formulated. This was the standpoint the hon. member for Johannesburg North tried to adopt yesterday when he said that a referendum should now be held about this aspect in a place like Soweto, for example. Mr. Speaker, I have never in my life seen anything more amateurish than this very thing, because just before the hon. member expressed his idea, what did the hon. member for Transkei say&#x003F; I think he had a suspicion that the hon. the Minister had consulted with the Bantu as far as this matter was concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei said that it does not mean a thing if the Bantu were to welcome this legislation; then one cannot believe the Bantu, and he gave reasons why he had said it. If the Bantu were to say they welcomed this legislation we must not believe it, but just after that this hon. member gets up and proposes that a referendum should be held in a place like Soweto. I now ask the hon. member for Johannesburg North in his absence: What does he think such a referendum will mean to the hon. member for Transkei&#x003F; What is more, Sir, when the hon. member for Transkei made his statement he received tremendously riotous support from the Opposition. I now get the idea that the hon. member who came to light with the referendum notion is not even going to have a seconder on that side of the House for his motion. It seems to me as if he stands alone.</p>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, another aspect of that motion that appears to me to be amateurish is that the hon. member says that a referendum must be held in a place like Soweto. If the hon. member is going to hold a referendum in his own constituency, asking the electorate whether they are Nationalists or United Party supporters, and the result tallies with what we know it will be, what would this mean&#x003F; In that single constituency we would gain the impression that South Africa predominantly supports the United Party, while we are sitting in this House of Assembly with more than a two-thirds majority of supporters who are Nationalists. In other words such a proposal means absolutely nothing it itself.</p>

<p>But, Sir, the second thing that has become clear to me from what hon. members opposite said is that the Opposition is not only 25 years behind the times; they have now already fallen a quarter of a century behind their own views as far as this matter is concerned, because at a certain stage in the history of the United Party there were people who in a fleeting moment of levelheadedness began to realize that this matter we are discussing today should fall under the Central Government. That became clear to me from a speech that a United Party supporter made here in the House of Assembly in 1945 when the Bantu (Urban Areas) Act was consolidated. On that occasion the then member for Johannesburg West, who has passed away, said to the Minister who submitted the legislation that merely consolidating the legislation was not enough, but that the Minister should do more than that because the situation had become such that more legislation was required. He motivated this. I want to quote to you, Sir, what Mr. Tighy said in the House of Assembly at the time.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>It was on 6th March, 1945 (Hansard, col. 2893). Mr. Tighy said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But this question has become so great, so extensive and so complicated that there is no municipality within the borders of the Union of South Africa, which can tackle it effectively. I am absolutely convinced that if a proper investigation were to be instituted, one of the recommendations would certainly be that the Native question in the cities falls outside <span class="col_2157-2158" refersTo="page_1092"/>the scope, the capability and the possibilities of the municipalities. As a matter of fact, I want to go further and say that it is extremely unfair to leave that matter in the hands of the smaller local authorities. It is a matter of national interest, and I hope it will not be long before the administration of the platteland Native and of the various classes, as in the case of the reserves today, will also fall under the direct administration of the Central Native Administration.</block>

<p>Sir, it was a United Party member who said that 26 years ago, and I now tell the United Party members who are sitting here today that they are a quarter of a century behind their own views.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go further and say that I do not agree with a certain statement that Mr. Tighy made here at the time when he said that the town councils were not competent to handle this matter. I think the town councils handled this matter competently, but the present system does not allow for the highest efficiency to be maintained as far as this matter is concerned. I think the reasons were stated very clearly by hon. members on this side. There are so many bodies responsible for this matter. In my own district, to take this as an example, there are various local authorities. Each one at a small town, in a prescribed area, is responsible for the Bantu administration in that small town. Then one still has the Bantu Affairs Commissioner who is responsible for the district, and then one still has the Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner who is responsible for the area, etc. Sir, a fine indication of this was given by hon. members, but specifically because of the system this is not possible.</p>

<p>Hon. members of the Opposition said that all the Minister had to do was simply to amend section 40 of the Bantu (Urban Areas) Act in order to bring about greater mobility. The Opposition said they were in favour of greater mobility. But I want to tell you, Sir, that this is not possible. The Minister cannot simply amend section 40 and then achieve greater mobility. The Opposition does not realize this. The simple reason is that there are certain aspects incorporated in the entire present-day setup that make it impossible simply to amend section 40, i.e. that each local authority is responsible to its taxpayers. That is why a local authority today is not going to erect housing in its area so that 50 per cent of the people can work in another local authority and it must carry the cost of it. Now I want to tell you that it is going to happen, because your big local authority is the place where the big employers are concentrated, the big building contractors and the big manufacturers, etc.</p>

<p>They are specifically the ones who move from there to the area of the smaller local authority in order to do work there. That is why the bigger local authority will now have to house the people from the small local authority, and they will not be game for that sort of thing. That is why the people, including the employers, who are now concerned with the matter, who know this matter in depth, and not superficially like the United Party that has only read a circular, all agree that this matter does not belong with the local authorities, and as far as employment and other aspects are concerned, with the Bantu Commissioner, but that there should be a central body to make the greater mobility possible.</p>

<p>Now the Opposition says that they object to this administration board that the Minister wants to inaugurate. But this board, which is going to be appointed by the Minister, is going to be appointed on the basis of two considerations, as expressly provided in the Bill. The first is the people&#x2019;s knowledge of Bantu affairs and the second is their interest in a specific commodity, agriculture or industry or whatever. And now I want to allege that this is not a new principle. We have several such statutory bodies in South Africa that assist with the implementation of policy. I can list you the Group Areas Board, the Land Bank Board and the school boards. They are all statutory bodies, but this specifically gives the public, the electorate that has a specific interest in the matter, the opportunity of assisting the Government in the implementation of that policy.</p>

<p>I now want to go further, Sir, and I want to tell you that a local authority is not elected on the grounds of these considerations, for this specialized and specific matter. It can happen that on a local authority one has no person with an interest in Bantu labour, except perhaps the Bantu doing housework. But one can find a situation in which no person on that local authority has any interest whatsoever in or knowledge of industry, commerce and every other aspect. Therefore I find it only logical that this principle, which has successfully been introduced in other spheres, <span class="col_2159-2160" refersTo="page_1093"/>should specifically be introduced here by the Deputy Minister, and that he can make use of such a statutory body to assist the authorities in the implementation of what is their duty, because it is specifically those people with a personal interest who are in a position to make a positive contribution when this policy is implemented. This would not have been the case if the Minister did not inaugurate such a statutory body.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to mention to you another very important consideration which is of particular importance to me as a representative of a platteland constituency, particularly from the point of view of the Bantu. I want to say that the smaller local authority in the platteland cannot afford to keep an engineer. In other words, when your Bantu area is laid out that local authority does not have the services of an engineer. But when this larger control board, which is going to serve a large area, exists, it will be economically justifiable for this board to employ an engineer and to furnish all the residential areas in that area with the services of an expert.</p>

<p>There is yet another consideration, i.e. that concerning the traffic of Bantu. In a constituency such as that of Lichtenburg, where we border on the homeland, only a few miles from the Bantu townships, it is not possible at present for a small local authority to establish its Bantu labourers in the homelands and transport them from there by bus, because they are too few in number. The numbers in respect of that small local authority are so few that those Bantu cannot even obtain a high school. Since a board is now going to administer that area and work with large numbers within that area, it can become possible and economically feasible for that board to establish the transport and to house those people in a larger township so that they can also be provided with the other amenities, such as school facilities, which they cannot obtain now.</p>

<p>Apart from this there is yet another big advantage for the Bantu in this, i.e. the question of the right of residence or the qualification he acquires in terms of section 10, which will not fall away now when he goes from one area to another to work there. The motivation, which the hon. the Minister furnished to the effect that this matter is also of importance to the Bantu, is therefore of the utmost consequence. I want to go as far as to say that when the hon. member for Kensington, who has just spoken, said that there should be greater stability in respect of the Bantu working in the urban areas, he displayed the greatest ignorance I have ever come across. The hon. member does not know the Bantu family as it really is. He thinks a Bantu family is like a White family, consisting of a husband, a wife and a few children that form an individual unit. The Bantu family is not like that at all. It forms a portion of a large whole in its social context. It is not only a question of a husband, a wife and a few children. It is an entire family and an entire tribal institution that exercises authority over the children and that helps to carry authority.</p>

<p>Scientists who have carried out careful research in South Africa indicate indisputably that the urbanization of the Bantu has an extremely detrimental effect on the Bantu family because the social context was wrenched out of alignment and because the Bantu could not yet adapt himself to that. Hon. members opposite joke about the fact that labourers are already being transported in certain areas from the homelands, a situation that is going to increase to an ever greater extent in the future. They do not realize that this measure is in the interests of the Bantu family. If they were to consult scientific research they would see that the ratio of illegitimate children in the urban areas and in the homelands, as well as the incidence of crime, indicates that where the Bantu family is in its tribal context and where there is greater authority, this has a beneficial effect by comparison with the urban development of the Bantu, which the Bantu has not yet been able to make a part of himself and to which he has not yet been able to adapt. I just want to quote an example of what scientists have to say. Mr. J. F. Eloff of the University of Pretoria states (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus the social groups, which in the tribe play an important role in the creation and maintenance of an ordered community life, have either fallen away altogether in the cities, or have lost their functions to such a degree that their influence outside the homelands is not of any particular importance. The structure of consanguinity lines and groups has virtually declined altogether in the urban surroundings, and the important control measures, characteristic of groups <span class="col_2161-2162" refersTo="page_1094"/>of this kind, on which an ordered tribal society is built, have also declined.</block>

<p>He states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Native has therefore not succeeded in adapting himself to the individualism, characteristic of the White civilization, to such an extent that the functioning of the family has not suffered in consequence. There is a strong inclination in the members of the family towards individualistic action, and now no balance has been reached in such a way that their individualistic action can be co-ordinated to benefit the family as a whole. The inward balance and principles that temper the individualism of the Westerner to such an extent that the disintegrating effect is not too pronounced, has not been assimilated by the Native. The result is an unhealthy individualism that has a disintegrating effect on the family and its functions.</block>

<p>Hon. members opposite referred to the question of the cost involved in transporting labourers from the homelands to employment opportunities. I want to tell them that the distances they mentioned are altogether off the mark. I am certain that more than 50 per cent of the labourers who are found in the Transvaal at present live nearer than 50 miles from a homeland. Hon. members may consult the geographic situation of the large centres where employment opportunities are, and they will see that they are nearer than 50 miles from the homelands. The hon. members have been sewn up in a cobweb. They are 50 years behind the times, because they do not know that today it is possible to transport those people by bus at cheaper than half a cent per passenger mile when one has large numbers of them. They do not know of those things that are happening. They are not aware of the fact that it is happening elsewhere in the world, and that people are conveyed for distances of between 100 and 120 miles to their jobs. Then they come along here and make jokes!</p>

<p>It is the practice in Japan. It is the practice in that country, Japan, which the hon. members are so fond of holding up to us as an example. There workers are transported over those great distances. This indicates to me that this Opposition is living in another world and that they do not know what is going on. They come along to this House and speak of planning, efficiency and other concepts, but with them it only remains a matter of concepts, and just as in the case of individualism among the Bantu they have not yet made this a part of themselves. That is why they are in the process of disintegrating.</p>

<p>I want to mention another important matter to hon. members, i.e. that in this Bill which the Minister has now placed before us, four new points are incorporated. The first is the administration area, the second the administration board, the third the greater mobility of the Bantu and the fourth is the greater efficiency that is envisaged. Now the Opposition has said that they accept the greater mobility, but they are opposed to the board and to the area. I think we have indicated to them that it is impossible to obtain greater mobility without this measure relating to a greater area and an administration board. Now only one thing remains, and that is that this Opposition, as I have summed them up, are also afraid of efficiency. One must examine their history and then one can see what happened in their time. Then one can understand why they would start trembling when a Minister comes along with an efficient measure. In their time such a thing was out of the question. I now want to tell hon. members that when I read Mr. Tighy&#x2019;s speech many things became clear to me. [Interjections.] The first of these is that those young United Party members sitting there at the back, such as the young hon. member for Turffontein, who just made the interjections &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hartzenberg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HARTZENBERG</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am much older than you are. I now want to tell that hon. member that when Mr. Tighy made his speech the hon. member had not been born yet. At that stage I at least knew already that it was a disgrace to be a United Party member. Those hon. United Party young members have not had the privilege of seeing a United Party Government in action, and they would not be able to believe that things could be as they indeed were. All they have to go on is <span class="col_2163-2164" refersTo="page_1095"/>their belief in what the other old hon. members on their side tell them. That is the only way of explaining why they can be United Party members. I want to tell hon. members that if they were to know what South Africa looked like when the United Party was in power, they could not possibly be members of that party any longer. The problem of the young people, who are already going to constitute more than 50 per cent of the electorate in the next election, is that they must think abstractly in order to know what the result will be if a United Party were to come into power. It is unthinkable that this could happen, and I was surprised when I read these things. For me it also clarified the problem with which the young voters are struggling today. In respect of the matter now being dealt with in this legislation I want to quote what Mr. Tighy said about how it looked when the United Party was governing. On 6th March, 1945, column 2894 of Hansard, Mr. Tighy said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, the less privileged plattelander. The poor natives too, who could not make a living on the platteland, did the same. They migrated to the cities. They did so for two reasons; in the first place for better wages, better productivity and better remuneration for their activities, and especially owing to droughts and failure of crops on the platteland. They came to the cities. Nothing was done to receive them. They had to pave their own way; they had to find their own way. There was no housing. There was no definition of areas of employment. They were not told where they were to live.</block>

<p>I just want to add that this is a United Party member speaking here and not a Nationalist, speaking at a time when the United Party Government was in power. He is speaking to his Minister. He continues:</p>

<block name="quote">They had to find their own way, and they received no definite vocational training. What happened in the big centres, especially on the Witwatersrand&#x003F; Both those sections went to the poorer areas of the big urban centres, and there they competed with one another both in the sphere of labour and in the sphere of housing, and as a result of that, problems have arisen which we are trying to solve by legislation of this nature, but which can no longer be solved by legislation of this kind. There they competed with one another. That is why we find those mixed places today where Europeans and non-Europeans sometimes live next to one another; where they sometimes live next to one another in the suburbs. However deplorable it may be, we even have cases in this country where they live in the same building.</block>

<p>Can hon. members believe it&#x003F; Can hon. members believe that a United Party member must stand up in this House of Assembly while his Government is in power in order to tell his Minister that conditions in this country are so desperate that Whites and non-Whites are living together in the same building&#x003F; That is why I say that those young hon. members sitting there at the back could not be members of the United Party if only they knew how things would be under a United Party Government.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I, who represent a platteland constituency, regard this measure as a very welcome one. I do not believe that the hon. the Minister could have waited any longer in respect of this measure. These hon. members referred to it and said that not only must the Natives not be believed if they say that the legislation is good, but also the employer, who does it under false pretences. I now want to tell hon. members that I, who am engaged in agriculture, can today give the assurance that the agricultural unions have also accepted this legislation. As far as the agricultural unions are concerned I reject the accusation of the hon. member for Transkei to the effect that it was accepted for motives other than the mere fact that it is good for agriculture and for the agricultural labourers.</p>

<p>For the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s consideration I should like to tell him that I see that here in clause 5 (1) it is provided that after the first meeting of the board is held a meeting shall be held each month. I can now imagine that there could possibly be a month in which there are insufficient activities from which to draw up an agenda for a meeting. That is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether in the Committee Stage he will not consider introducing an amendment which would make it non-compulsory for a meeting to be held each month. This can be done by the insertion of the words &#x201C;unless the Minister <span class="col_2165-2166" refersTo="page_1096"/>otherwise directs&#x201D; after the word &#x201C;monthly&#x201D;. This means that a meeting will not be held if the Minister so directs. Then the board does not need to hold a meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not find it strange that young South Africa is beginning to find this Government out. They were bluffed during this period and that is why I do not find it strange that the majorities in constituencies such as that of the hon. member for Lichtenburg have declined sharply. I ascribe this to the young people who voted for our party there.</p>

<p>This Bill now before the House must be seen in the overall pattern. This is a pattern which is divorced from the traditional approach and is closer to the fragmentation philosophy of this Government. When one regards this legislation more closely two radically different objects are apparent. Firstly there is the relaxation and greater mobility of labour in larger areas, and secondly the take-over of the traditional control and administration of the urban Bantu, at present being dealt with by our local authorities, by the Department of Bantu Administration.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Brakpan&#x2014;I am sorry that he is not here&#x2014;came and cast still further light on this matter for us. He approached this legislation on a twofold basis. He says firstly that it makes possible the greater mobility of labour and secondly that it creates an opportunity for the Government to send the Bantu back to the homelands. To that argument I made an interjection. By implication he kept harping all the time on the fact that the industrialists of South Africa accepted this legislation. I said to him: &#x201C;Tell us if the industrialists accept your second statement&#x201D;. His reply was: &#x201C;It does not matter to me what the industrialists accept&#x2014;I am the policymaker of this country and that is the policy of this Government.&#x201D; I nevertheless think that commerce and industry should take note of this, because apparently they themselves and all these bodies who want the greater mobility of labour in South Africa, did not see this object in the way that hon. member put it. The question now arises as to whether in the future this Government will reject any consultation with people that are going to be affected by this kind of legislation.</p>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>The industrialists. It appears so obvious that the hon. the Minister and his Deputy Minister, with their greed for power, must have been very concerned about and careful with the drawing up of this legislation. I want to put it like this: In order to achieve the second drastic object, i.e. the take-over of the control and administration of the urban Bantu by this Department and, as the hon. member for Brakpan said, the sending back of the Bantu to the homelands, a proper pretext had to be found to keep their actual objects from the public. This smokescreen is specifically raised by means of the first object, i.e. the relaxation and greater mobility of labour in a larger area or territory. A statement of the South African Institute of Race Relations, dated 29th December, 1970, summed it up nicely in the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The price to be exacted from the African people in what is called the White territory &#x2026; in return for the right to have greater labour mobility is likely to be a very heavy one.</block>

<p>Now I must tell the hon. the Minister, or even his controversial Deputy who is piloting this legislation through, that their trick was reasonably successful. Seen from the point of view of the industrialist, the employer, the various bodies of trade and industry and the Bantu himself, the first object<span class="col_2167-2168" refersTo="page_1097"/>, this relaxation and greater mobility of labour, had a hypnotic effect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fourie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. FOURIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Johannesburg North spoke of the fact that no consultation took place between this Department and the urban Bantu. Now, in an article in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> written by Langa Skosana, it was very interesting to read the following under the heading &#x201C;Africans welcome proposed take-over&#x2014;but &#x2026;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s proposed take-over of responsibility for African affairs from local authorities was welcomed yesterday by many Africans on the Reef and in Pretoria, but with reservations. What was enthusiastically welcomed was the intended relaxation of influx control allowing Africans to move from one urban area to another to seek work. However, Africans feared that when the Government took over the control of the functions of local authorities it would apply separate development more rigidly.</block>

<p>This is clear proof that this hunger of the Bantu, the desire on the part of these people for greater labour freedom, is of paramount importance. But incidentally, what is also illuminating is the fear on the part of the urban Bantu that separate development will be strictly applied. We frequently hear from the Government how the Bantu of South Africa supposedly support this policy&#x2014; perhaps the Matanzimas, but definitely not the urban Bantu.</p>

<p>This is clear proof of how drastically necessary this measure has long been. So absolutely necessary was this concession, and this more sympathetic approach to the greater mobility of the Bantu in the labour field, that it blinded the Bantu to all the other complications connected with this legislation. This is obvious proof of how out of touch this Government is with the problems of South Africa, or else the hon. the Minister and his Deputy have pulled a fast one on those concerned! With this relaxation of the labour force, in which not only the Bantu are involved and will benefit, but the entire labour pattern, particularly on the Witwatersrand, we have no bone to pick with the Government. On the contrary, we must congratulate them on this small candle that burst into flame in their pitch darkness of verkramptheid and stagnation, on this concession in their granitelike pattern of thought.</p>

<p>But this specific legislation is not necessary for that. Why is the Minister abusing this long-delayed, important and necessary measure to extend his dictatorial powers in respect of all the other measures&#x003F; Appeals have already been made for years to have the Witwatersrand declared one labour area, in order thereby to accommodate both management and labour in a period of economic and industrial growth and expansion, particularly where many bodies are establishing branches in the areas of nearby local authorities, or even where bodies are moving <i>in toto</i> from one local authority, say Johannesburg, to another local authority, for example Isando. Instead of teaching new, raw, unskilled labour from scratch, industrialists can now take their existing skilled labour with them without any trouble. The answer to making this concession, or to easing this problem of making labour more mobile, does not lie in the fact that it should be used as a cloak for other dictatorial powers&#x2014;this is obvious in the mere amendment of section 40 of the existing Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act (Act No. 25 of 1945). The hon. members for Langlaagte and Lichtenburg said that the amendment of this section is not the answer, that its compass is not wide enough. The hon. member for Langlaagte speaks of &#x201C;we in Johannesburg&#x201D;. Throughout the years there have been pleas for the administration of the Bantu in those areas on a regional basis. But this was not advocated under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I believe that these people thought more in terms of co-ordinating committees of local authorities.</p>

<p>I also foresee problems as far as other matters are concerned. The Minister will have absolute right to discretion in the appointment of the so-called Bantu Affairs administration Boards, which will be exclusively appointed by him. These boards obtain jurisdiction over areas that are also exclusively determined by the Minister. It is obvious that the Minister will have to appoint Nationalist yes-men who, at the snap of his finger, will merely have to implement Government policy. He also has <span class="col_2169-2170" refersTo="page_1098"/>the right, to use the English expression, to &#x201C;hire and fire&#x201D; without any explanation. What does this mean&#x003F; &#x201C;The hard and fast rule must be obeyed&#x201D;; otherwise you are out.</p>

<p>I should just like to refer to the appointment of Senators in the Other Place, with specific reference to the Coloured population in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then I shall not use it. But what about the so-called consultation that must take place between these boards and the local authorities&#x003F; Suppose that no agreement is reached as such. What position would then develop&#x003F; We shall find ourselves in a position where the elected municipal councils can come up squarely against the appointed Bantu Administration Board of the hon. the Minister. Who is going to be the suffering party if the so-called consultations come to nought&#x003F; Not the appointed board, not the elected council and not the Minister, but the urban Bantu is going to be the suffering party, because it is his fate that is being put at stake. It can be asked why one is providing this friction and these clashes between the Minister&#x2019;s appointed board and the electorate&#x2019;s chosen council&#x003F; There is only one reason for this, and in this connection I specifically want to refer to Johannesburg. The reason is the difference in approach to the urban Bantu. At present we have there the more sympathetic, more humane attitude of the local authorities, but with this legislation we get once more, in this field, that inaccessible &#x201C;hard and fast rule&#x201D; strictly applied as dictated by this hon. Minister and his Deputy.</p>

<p>I want to quote further from the <i>Sunday Times</i> article of Langa Skosana. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. W. F. Nkomo of Pretoria received the news with mixed feelings &#x2026; He said that for a number of years Africans had been in close contact with local authorities and that a firm relationship had developed. City council members were more easily approachable than Government officials, who put Government policy before people&#x2019;s feelings &#x2026; The take-over by the Government from local authorities would break the relationship and confidence people had in the City Council.</block>

<p>We all remember the Msini case. I do not want to elaborate on this, but it specifically proves this point I now want to make, i.e. that Government policy is being placed before people&#x2019;s feelings.

<p>I almost want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he does not go red behind the ears at having made such a statement. I say this because this legislation is specifically going to clash with the family life of the Bantu in the urban areas of South Africa.

<p>In the <i>Sunday Times</i> Langa Skosana writes further that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Lennox Mlonzi of the Soweto Urban Bantu Council said he feared that if the Government took over it would propagate its policy of separate development which many people did not care for. I fear that they will misuse their powers.</block>

<p>Did the hon. the Minister consult with the Bantu concerned and find out how they feel about this matter&#x003F; This does not appear to be the case when one hears of a certain Mr. T. G. Makhaya, to whom the same article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> also refers. There it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. T. J. Makhaya, also of the Soweto Urban Bantu Council, said Africans should have been consulted before the Government thought of the proposed measure.</block>

<p>We are entering a situation in which the humanity with which local authorities are implementing this administration will be replaced by the application of the fixed rules and regulations of the impractical, impracticable and unacceptable policy of this Government. It is an unequivocal fact, certainly in the case of the Johannesburg City Council, that the administration of Bantu affairs is implemented with the greatest measure of sympathy and humanity as against the harsh, strict and keep-to-the-rules-and-regulations action of the implementation of Government policy by Government administrators.</p>

<p>I want to say this, apart from the fact that local authorities in many respects only act as agents of the Department of Bantu Administration. Any person and I also include the hon. member for Langlaagte, who is familiar with the conditions and with the administration of Soweto by the Johannesburg City Council, as against the administration of Meadowlands and Diepkloof by the Bantu Resettlement Board appointed by this Government, cannot but be impressed by the difference in the provision of facilities and the attitude of the officials concerned. The network of recreation and welfare facilities provided in Soweto is absolutely outstanding and cannot be compared with the poor conditions in Meadowlands and Diepkloof. The hon. member for Langlaagte says that he has travelled through Meadowlands and Diepkloof. However, he does not tell us whether he has also travelled through Soweto. He dare not say it, because then he is going to find himself between the devil and the deep blue sea. He cannot then be honest about that. It is a fact that Meadowlands does not have a single social worker at its disposal.</p>

<p>When one comes to housing, one can speak here until the sun comes up.

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister is so fond of speaking about an &#x201C;explosive&#x201D; situation that would supposedly develop under United Party policy. I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that if there is ever an explosive situation it is specifically developing under this Government, particularly in respect of the poor housing conditions in many cases in Bantu urban areas. I want to issue a warning today to the hon. the Minister, his Deputy and the Government, that in the urban areas&#x2014;and I say this with all due respect and with the utmost confidence and the best of dispositions&#x2014;a recklessness and a dangerous state of mind is developing which we have never had before in this country among the Bantu. Those hon. Ministers who sit so comfortably cosseted in their warm houses costing R60,000 and R70,000 must very seriously take note of this fact.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development comes along with this legislation to take the administration out of these more humane and sympathetic hands. At present there are about 12,000 families in Soweto alone who are without housing. They live with friends and family in unparallelled pokiness. Each year matters get worse.</p>

<p>It is expected that at the end of each additional year a further 2000 families will be without houses. These are squatter conditions developing under this Government&#x2019;s policy. Why do these problems arise&#x003F; What is more, these problems will be much worse if the Government takes over this administration. The shortages are the result of this government&#x2019;s approach, i.e. that these thousands of homeless people must not obtain houses because one day&#x2014;that is the promise the Government makes to them&#x2014;they will go back to their homelands. We know how the Johannesburg City Council is struggling with pleas to the hon. the Minister for development. What then would happen if the local authorities are switched out&#x003F; This Government is creating the most explosive situation of all times. These facilities and conditions in Soweto of a standard on a par with the best Johannesburg can manage, can only be maintained with a subsidy from the Johannesburg City Council to the Bantu Revenue Fund. This year this amount was in the region of R1.25 million.</p>

<p>The question now arises as to whether the Government with its Bantu boards will allow similar subsidies, because conditions and facilities can only maintain this level with subsidies from bodies other than the Bantu Revenue Fund.</p>

<p>Castles in the air have to be built in the Bantu homelands for people in the White areas who have never seen the inside of a Bantu homeland, who never want to see it or never will see it. Money that ought to provide facilities and improvements for these people who are ending their days in the White area, must be applied in an area they will never get to.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that hon. member has a lot of time to read my speech in Hansard. Then he can give me an answer on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there has ever been political trickery then it is specifically with these provisions. We are dealing here with a group of people living in the White area and working in the White area, people who will end their days in the White area and who maintain a very low standard of living and, instead of working towards raising their standard of living and improving living conditions I foresee only the deterioration of these aspects with this kind of legislation. Their own contribution towards improving themselves is not being used in the places where they are, but rather in this Government&#x2019;s dream world where they ought to be.</p>

<p>When we give warning that the Government is creating an explosive situation, we are scolded for being instigators and for being irresponsible. But does this Government not realize what it is playing with&#x003F; Does it not realize that it is dealing with people&#x003F; This legislation is deviating from the establishment of undisrupted family life. It leads away from the right to own land and one&#x2019;s own house where the urbanized Bantu is situated and lives, and away from the self-administration in urban areas by the Bantu. This Government is unleashing uncontrollable monsters which will not be its problem, but will become the problem of future generations. Those good relationships that were built up in a place like Soweto between the White local authorities and the inhabitants, are being razed to the ground by this legislation.</p>

<p>When one advocates these matters, i. e. good relationships, which ought merely to be a natural matter of course, then we are told that we want to integrate. When we speak of the fundamental importance of building up a stable middle class Bantu in the cities and when we plead for better conditions, for family life and land ownership for the Bantu who qualify and live in their own area, then we hear a stream of arguments to the effect that we want to open the sluices. After all, it is the United Party that established influx control, is responsible for section 10 of the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act and daily advocates the improvement of the Bantu&#x2019;s standard of living.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to the hon. member for Lichtenburg who referred to the Bantu family that cannot be compared to Western families. Development is taking place daily. As these people are admitted to Christianity they are adapting themselves increasingly to Western customs. For example, take the question of more than one wife. Those who have been admitted to Christianity have only one wife, because any Christian accepts that practice. There is also the accepted fact that the mineworker traditionally comes to work in South Africa without his family, and that the majority of those Bantu are foreigners.</p>

<p>But I now want to put a question to hon. members on that side of the House who are shouting at us all day long that we want to throw open the sluices. They must tell me what this Government proposes to do with the thousands of Bantu families in permanent residence in Bantu residential areas within the White areas of South Africa&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we tried to listen to the dramatic reading which the hon. member for Turffontein gave here. It was full of all kinds of cleverness and was pre-eminently a virulent discourse. That lecture of his contained so many impudent, presumptuous assertions. And let me simply add that it embodied ignorance. That a member of that calibre should come along here and boast, and time and again try to create the impression that he is the self-appointed leader of the youth of South Africa, is ridiculous as far as this side of the House is concerned. In a dramatic and clever way he speaks of a &#x201C;snap of the fingers&#x201D; and of &#x201C;pulling a fast one&#x201D;. He reminds me of someone on whom a fast one has been pulled.

<heading>MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT OF HOUSE ON MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE: VIZ. OIL POLLUTION FROM TANKERS</heading>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The adjournment of the House in order to discuss a matter of public importance, viz.: The failure on the part of the Government to take timeous and appropriate steps to meet such a serious contingency as the stranding of the oil tanker Wafra with its threat, present and potential, to the material resources and the environment of the Republic.</block>

<p>This concerns the position of the tanker Wafra, which went aground off Cape Agulhas in the early morning of 27th February. On the 2nd March I placed an urgent question on the Question Paper and this question was answered fully and promptly by the Minister concerned some three days later. Since then a further period of seven days has elapsed without the Minister having made any further statement to this House, which is the body most concerned with this particular matter. Concern has been caused by the fact that the hon. the Minister in his broadcast statement on the matter doubted that we were sufficiently prepared to cope with the situation. Since then there has been a vast amount in the newspapers and there had been a lot of speculation, but Parliament as such has heard no more. It is quite clear that the danger of a national disaster still exists. In fact, one wonders whether it is not greater now than seven days ago despite the good news in the newspaper this afternoon to the effect that the tug has succeeded in pulling the ship through 55 degrees, although it has not yet succeeded in getting it loose.</p>

<p>Three major questions arise in connection with this matter. The first of these is whether we were adequately prepared to deal with a disaster of this kind; secondly, whether we have done all we could since the disaster took place; and, thirdly, what are we going to do to avoid this sort of situation in future. In regard to the first question, we have the Minister&#x2019;s statement that he doubted that we were sufficiently prepared to cope with the situation although we have no details about the grounds for his feeling that we were not prepared. This has happened some four years since the Torrey Canyon disaster off the coast of Great Britain and four years since the close of the Suez Canal. The closing of the Suez Canal has brought about a vast increase in tanker traffic around our coasts and no doubt the Torrey Canyon disaster should have alerted the authorities here to the enormity of the danger of oil pollution off our coasts. Well, four years is a long time to prepare for disasters which must be regarded almost as inevitable especially if you have regard to the fact that during those four years there have been repeated crises which have drawn the attention of the public and of the authorities here to the inevitability of disaster and the gravity of the problem with which we would have to deal. I believe I am correct in stating that the tanker traffic around our coasts today is the heaviest in the world. As a matter of fact, about 20 tankers a day pass round the Cape at the present time.</p>

<p>What has the history been&#x003F; Three years ago a French tanker of 81,000 tons, the Sivella, ran aground off Green Point and caused quite a bit of anxiety. Three months later the Esso Essen sprang a leak and spewed oil off Green Point. In June, 1968, the World Glory broke in half after an explosion some 40 miles off the coast near Durban and caused a massive oil slick which threatened the coast in that area. A few months ago we had the tanker Kazimah aground off Robben Island. Each time the question of our preparedness cropped up and it was questioned whether we are prepared to deal with oil pollution which could result from an accident of this kind. Each time the reply we received was that experience had added to the efficiency of those dealing with this matter and that it was hoped that we would be able to deal with any challenge. The matter has also been raised in this House from time to time by way of questions put by the hon. member for South Coast and by the hon. member for Green Point. As early as June, 1968, we were told that legislation was going to be introduced, it was hoped during that session. When we inquired about the stockpiling of detergents and dispersants, we were told that legislation would be introduced to deal with those <span class="col_2179-2180" refersTo="page_1103"/>problems and when we asked about the legal implications involved we were told that legislation would be forthcoming. That was in June, 1968. The matter was raised again in 1969, however without our getting any further. Here we are today, three years later and some four sessions later, with the Minister still saying that he is hoping to introduce legislation. No legislation has come forward as yet.</p>

<p>I know that committees have been formed to deal with this matter. I know that action committees and operational control centres have been set up at various centres and I know that some study has been undertaken, but how much we do not know. We know there has been talk of regional oil pollution control officers and oil pollution control officers. These have been spoken of but have not yet been appointed because of the danger of the expense. Other people have been asked to undertake their duties. I also know that the action committee in operation here consists of the chief engineer of the Cape Provincial Administration, of Professor Mallory, of the Department of Oceanography of the University of Cape Town. Mr. Stander, who is the chief research officer of the Division of Sea Fisheries. Mr. Venter, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Industries, Rear-Admiral Terry Lloyd of the S.A. Navy and the Port Captain, Cape Town.</p>

<p>I believe they have done good work and have done their very best. I know that the objects and duties which they have outlined for themselves are concerned with pollution of the sea only and pollution of the sea as well as of adjacent coastal areas. I know that the Government has undertaken the responsibility for expenditure incurred in combating pollution at sea, but that in so far as beaches are concerned a certain responsibility still rests upon the local authorities. I know it is hoped that officials of the Department of Industries will be on the scene as soon as possible to continue the conduct of operations, if necessary in co-operation with other bodies which have been mentioned. I know that the oil companies themselves are going to enter into what is known as the Tovalop Agreement, whereby they undertake responsibility for backing each other in the event of damages due to oil pollution. I know, Sir, that arrangements have been made for the storing of chemical dispersants and spraying equipment, but I do not know to what extent they were stockpiled or what spraying equipment was available. I know that the vital question of communications, which must be both rapid and effective in disasters of this kind, has been discussed at length, and I know that it was decided to use the existing facilities of what are known as coast radio stations.</p>

<p>I think the question that we have to ask ourselves this afternoon, Sir, is whether we have really established an adequate fire brigade to deal with this situation. I know it will cost money. I suppose every city in the world knows what it costs to maintain a fire brigade, but we also know how very important it is, and my own impression, even without the frank admission of the Minister, is that we have not yet established an adequate fire brigade to deal with the risks and the inevitable disasters which are sure to follow upon this heavy tanker traffic round our coasts at the present time. Clearly, Sir, the question of communications, oddly enough, has been a problem in dealing with the Wafra itself. The Minister mentioned it in his replies to me in the House. It seems to be a situation where communications caused a great deal of difficulty and a slowing up of the operation. We also have a statement from the owners that off the coasts of the United States of America or Great Britain a disaster of this kind would not have happened, because there would have been help available to the tanker quickly enough to have prevented it from going ashore. We hear also from a naval spokesman on this action committee that what South Africa needs is a coastguard service similar to the kind that they have in Great Britain and the United States of America. It was certainly a shock to hear how short of tug power we are in South Africa and what the delays were before tugs could become available.</p>

<p>I feel therefore, Sir, that in the absence of a convincing explanation from the Minister we cannot say that we have established an adequate fire brigade and that we cannot say that we are adequately prepared to deal with situations of this kind. In fact, it does seem to me that we are courting disaster in not taking further steps and taking them rapidly.</p>

<p>Sir, have we done all we could since this disaster took place some ten days ago&#x003F; What we could do, of course, was determined by how prepared we were, and having regard to preparations or lack of them the position still seems to be a confused one and I certainly am left with certain <span class="col_2181-2182" refersTo="page_1104"/>queries in my mind. First of all, there is the question of communications. Clearly communications have been inadequate. It would seem that at times they broke down altogether. I believe there were very few walkie-talkies available which I should have thought would have been one of the first things available. I believe radio telephones have actually been borrowed from private firms, and it seems to me that we could certainly have been better prepared in that sphere than we were.</p>

<p>Then comes the question of the stockpiling of detergents and dispersants. It seems as though this stockpiling has been inadequate. It seems that we may need as much as 5 million gallons if the oil all leaks out, and I believe the Government is now buying detergents from no fewer than seven different companies and that the amount involved is already a very big one. I believe at one stage even transport of the detergents was held up because of the necessity of getting exemptions under the Road Transportation Act. I believe that the conveyance of dispersants to the boats doing the spraying has been slowed up because of the depots chosen to assemble the dispersants being at a considerable distance from the point where they would be used. I believe also that we are storing in depots and having detergents picked up in Cape Town which could be picked up at points closer to the scene of action and could be got there very much more quickly by road transport than by sea. I believe also that in the beginning detergents were taken out to the ships doing the spraying by helicopter, but that is no longer happening. I am also uncertain whether the best detergents and dispersants are being used.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Sir, I am worried whether the best possible dispersants are being made use of. I am informed&#x2014;I am sure the Minister can tell us&#x2014;that there are non-toxic dispersants available, certainly in the U.S.A. Since one knows that in matters of this kind you very often find more damage done by the detergents and the dispersants than by the oil itself, it is very important to know what the situation is in regard to a detergent of that kind, which I understand emulsifies as well as disperses. I know there are technical troubles, because some of these detergents cannot be used in water of less than 40 feet depth, but I wonder whether we have given enough attention to the possibility of destruction by burning. I believe that the Swedes carried out tests last year with a new material, I believe it is called Cabocyl ST. 20, and I understand the results were very good indeed. I believe, also, that there were reports in the Oil and Gas Journal last year about the treating of oil spills at sea and mention was made of this Swedish product and of another one, both for the controlled burning of oil at sea, and that both have been tested very successfully. I believe the Shell Company of Holland also has a method of dealing with oil slicks at sea which has resulted in their being able to sink the oil quite rapidly without damaging the marine life underneath. I ask these questions because I know that when the question of a certain fire powder which is made in Germany was raised, the Government reacted quickly and has been going into the question.</p>

<p>The third point that worries me is whether there were sufficient steps taken to ensure that small boats were available and collected quickly enough to do the spraying, and whether there was spraying equipment available. I believe I am correct in saying that the Caltex Company to whom the oil was to be delivered actually chartered four small boats immediately and equipped them with spraying equipment, and I believe the Fisheries Department produced three boats for that purpose, but was that enough&#x003F; Was enough done, and was it done quickly enough&#x003F; Is it not possible that had it been done more rapidly and more quickly far less of this oil would have reached the shore than is the situation at present&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then there is a fourth point. Did we react quickly enough to Wafra&#x2019;s May-Day signal&#x003F; One knows there was a Russian ship which took her in tow, but it did not have enough power. One knows that the Pongola also took her in tow but also lacked power and was in fact, I believe, pulled backwards; and one wonders whether, if we could have reacted, or if we had had some system of reaction whereby we could have had a helicopter go out perhaps to pct a marine engineer on board, or perhaps called the Navy in, a frigate might have done the job which it was not possible for those ships to do. The position in Britain is that the Royal Navy has a duty frigate on standby which can put to sea within 30 minutes. In any disaster of <span class="col_2183-2184" refersTo="page_1105"/>this kind that frigate, within 30 minutes to an hour, is moving to the affected area at a speed of 30 to 35 knots. With that power they are even prepared to try and tow with the anchor chain, if necessary. Even if damage is done to the frigate, that would be covered by the insurance.</p>

<p>There is another point I want to mention. One wonders whether the Department of Industries is the right department to be handling this matter. One wonders whether the whole issue should not really be under the control of the Navy. The Navy knows about the sea. They have experience with ships. They know what can and what cannot be done. They certainly have adequate communication systems and could react quickly when required. I believe that they could co-ordinate an effort of this kind, possibly far more effectively than any civilian department. I wonder whether we should not consider the possibility of the Navy handling the whole business in matters of this kind.</p>

<p>I think we also want to know whether there were any legal complications in this matter. Were they a factor here, before the owner abandoned any idea of salvage&#x003F; One knows the difficulties the Government is in. One cannot just take over a man&#x2019;s ship, telling him that all that matters is the danger of oil pollution and that salvage does not matter, unless one has previous legislation with which to do it. I should like to be reassured by the hon. the Minister that there were no unnecessary delays here because of legal complications involved.</p>

<p>There is another matter which has interested me enormously, namely the question of flexible tanks. It is clear that there has been a development in the United States of America of flexible tanks which may be taken, in a collapsed condition to the site of any tanker accident, so that the oil may be pumped into the tanks and towed away. I believe that this is a development from the last World War, when certain naval boffins got the idea of sausage-shaped flexible tanks which could be collapsed and taken alongside a tanker which was in trouble. The oil could then be pumped in and they could be taken away with very little trouble at all. One wonders whether we have examined these possibilities, whether amongst our equipment there are tanks of this kind and if not, why not&#x003F;</p>

<p>I know that the whole operation is, at the moment, at a very critical stage indeed. The weather has been wonderful, the sea has been calm, but we cannot count on that continuing indefinitely. There is a full moon coming. There is a spring tide coming and if the weather turns against us things may be very difficult indeed. I believe that the spare tanker which is coming cannot possibly reach that spot until Wednesday or Thursday at the earliest. What alternative preparations are we making, if we are not successful in having that tanker pulled off&#x003F; What preparations are we making, if the weather proves to be too bad to pump the oil across&#x003F; Even if pulled off, that tanker may turn turtle because of the unevenness resulting from the loss of oil from its various tanks. We also know that the pumping operation is not only extremely hazardous, but will probably be very slow indeed. Since neither electrical power nor steam power can be used, it seems that the whole pumping operation will have to be done with compressed air. We should like to know what the hon. the Minister has in view as to possible developments and the steps he is taking in order to deal with these tankers.</p>

<p>Before I speak of the future, I would like to pay a very sincere tribute to those of our officials involved in this calamity, not only for the courage they have shown but for the manner they have stuck to the job under very difficult circumstances.</p>

<p>Now, what about the future&#x003F; I think there are two aspects: the one is what we are going to do about wrecks and disasters in future and the other is what, if anything, can we do to control tankers travelling around our coast&#x003F; Clearly, for the control of tankers travelling around our coasts, legislation and international agreements seem to be the only weapons possible. But for wrecks and disasters we need an adequate fire brigade. No matter what we spend on it, I believe it will save us money in the end. That means we need adequate money, adequate knowledge, adequate equipment and proper co-ordination. I ask again whether the control and co-ordination of matters of this kind should not be under the Navy rather than under a civilian Department&#x003F; I believe that the Navy could act with speed. They have helicopters at their disposal and proper means of communication. Provided there is adequate legislation empowering them to act, they could take steps very much more rapidly than any civilian department.</p>

<p>The question of adequate knowledge is something that we shall just have to give attention to. The whole world is studying <span class="col_2185-2186" refersTo="page_1106"/>this problem at the moment and there are developments from day to day. While I know that on this occasion we have had experts flown out from all over the world, the question is whether we are keeping up to date and whether we are seeing to it that we have the necessary equipment available. That necessary equipment seems to me to be dispersant stockpiles, the availability of small boats for spraying, proper spraying equipment, flexible tanks, tug power, even if it does mean tying up some capital, dispersed round our coasts, and a proper coast guard service to work hand in hand with the Navy to keep this danger away from our shores.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House of Assembly for the Swellendam constituency I am perhaps more closely involved in this disaster on the coas of Bredasdorp at Agulhas than any of the other members.</p>

<p>Swellendam has the distinction that the most southerly point of Africa, Agulhas, falls within this constituency. Bredasdorp, as the district in which it falls, is the most southerly district. And the small town of Agulhas is in reality situated right on the southern tip. The fact that geographically we possess this southern point is a matter of pride to us. We are not only aware of the fact that this lovely tip of Africa falls within our constituency, but we also feel that we as a community, and all bodies involved, want to strive to utilize this natural resource to the full. The tourism potential of this lovely point is already very well known. Although the publicity that Agulhas now enjoys is of a slightly negative kind, it nevertheless brings this lovely point to the fore and Agulhas enjoys more attention. The local authorities, the municipalities, the divisional council and the various associations involved, <i>inter alia,</i> the publicity association and the development association, are already utilizing this potential on the southern tip to the full and throwing it open to the public. This rapid development in recent years is actually characteristic of that region. The small town of Agulhas already has a village management board. Struis Bay, which lies just next to Agulhas, is also developing rapidly. Skulpiesbaai lies between these two, and building operations are taking place there at an increasing rate. And Suidersee is still in the planning stage. Electricity, water, and so on are reaching those places, and the authorities are very sympathetic to this development. This multi-million rand development on the southern tip of Africa did not take place as a result of front-page advertisements, nor did it take place because there were hon. members who sang the praises of their own localities in this House, but the southern point has the potential in itself to draw people to it. It is a lovely area with beautiful sand and fine beaches. There are lovely holiday resorts and it is a fisherman&#x2019;s paradise.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the motion now, Mr. Speaker. All the benefits of this coastal area have now been spoiled by the Wafra disaster. The sea and the beaches have been polluted, and our people are grieved at this. These riches have now suddenly been polluted and threatened by an oil tanker such as the Wafra. The tanker was constructed in Japan, registered in Liberia, it has a cosmopolitan crew, is American owned and was gossiped about by the United Party members. As we have learned from the newspapers, this tanker has a tonnage of between 40,000 and 70,000. Like so many ships before it, this tanker ran aground on our coast. History reveals to us, and I am referring particularly to an interesting book written by Mr. Potgieter called &#x201C;Skipbreuke langs die Suid-Afrikaanse kus&#x201D; (Shipwrecks along the South African Coast), that 80 per cent of the shipwrecks on this coast are caused by the fact that the ships were overloaded. And there is something else that also caused more confusion in the case of the Wafra, i.e. the strange fact that this ship was taken in tow in relatively deep water, but because the cable broke at Quoin Point the tanker moved against the strong Agulhas current, in other words upstream, until it is now lying east of Agulhas, about 20 miles further along. This strange fact is causing a lot of speculation among our people. This sea disaster has caused a tremendous amount of pollution of our coast, and there is no doubt about that. I hope that the hon. members on the United Party side, who are going to speak today, have taken the trouble to visit this coast. I hope that each of them has been there so that they could see what is really going on there. A disaster such as this simply happens because it is an accident that is beyond human control. Our people accept the fact that such a disaster, which is not the first, because <span class="col_2187-2188" refersTo="page_1107"/>so many have already taken place in the past, occurred because of circumstances beyond human control.</p>

<p>If there are perhaps any problems about that, and if the feeling is that the State has not done its duty in this case, I should like to refer hon. members to this fine little newspaper report that appeared this morning. The article deals with an interview conducted with Mr. J. Mayer of San Francisco. He was brought here by the Caltex company. He was not brought here by the National Government, but by a company that would like to make independent use of his services. What does this man say&#x003F; He says: &#x201C;One of the best things I encountered here involves people who know precisely what they want to do. Your own people have all the knowledge of oil pollution that they need. I am only here to make my experience of oil pollution in California available to them if they should need it.&#x201D; But he also said: &#x201C;In America the Government has now made money available for research as to how to overcome the problems involved in such a step.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I feel that I can rightfully express my appreciation for what has been done in connection with this Wafra disaster at Aghulhas. Oil did reach the land, but up to now this has not been crude oil, merely engine oil or bunker oil. The extent of the pollution there is not very great. In fact, it is very limited. It stretches from Struis Bay past Agulhas to Die Dam, scarcely a distance of ten miles. On the contrary, I would say it is less. The sensational aspect of this pollution that has been magnified by the newspapers also led us to fear for the animal and other life at our river mouths and even further upstream. We were grateful to see for ourselves yesterday that this damage is very limited. In fact, the damage to animal and plant life in the sea is not evident on the coast. I only saw a few bluebottles that had been washed up, probably having been affected by the oil pollution.</p>

<p>However, we could not otherwise see anything out of the ordinary on the beach. This is notwithstanding the fact that from the smaller pools oil can be scooped up with a bucket. It is interesting to see that nature can look after itself. The marine life that can move had moved back and away from the oil that lies mainly near the beach or on it. It is remarkable to see how the marine and fish life simply continue normally just behind the waves and the oil polluted strip near the beach. It was also good to see to what extent the oil, which had washed up on a beautiful beach such as Struis Bay, had been removed. This was done in a simple but practical way, i.e. by digging a trench, simply pushing the oily sand into it and then closing it up again. We hope that this measure will prove effective. It is a relatively deep ditch. We hope that this measure was timely and effective, and that it will not have to be repeated at a later stage. We also hope that the ship will be dislodged from the bank on which it is now stuck. With all this sensation-mongering people began to throw straw into the sea. I must admit that the straw does absorb the oil reasonably well, and that a certain measure of success is achieved with this method. Oil solvents have, in my opinion, been used very judiciously. They are sprayed around the ship six miles from the coast, and this substance is not used near the coast at all.</p>

<p>Something else that I should like to bring to your attention is that the sea itself makes a tremendous contribution towards combating such a disaster. It is interesting to see that the oil that was washed up quite high on to the beach last week by the spring tide, and then not touched by the water again, has to a large extent already been broken up by oxidation, etc. Lower down, where at present the sea still reaches at low tide, the oil lies in thick layers. However, above this point it is already disappearing. I have the support of people who have a knowledge of the sea there, and who have an interest in the sea, for example the secretary and the chairman of the divisional council, who testified that the situation today and yesterday was very much better than it was last Monday. This is simply as a result of normal developments taking place&#x2014;the sea is cleansing itself. We trust that this help we are getting from nature will also make a particular contribution towards solving this problem.</p>

<p>I nevertheless feel that by bringing this discussion to the fore today, the Opposition probably had something in mind. I cannot always be so sure that they really want to do a service. I do want to concede on their behalf that it does, in fact, appear to me, judging from the calm way in which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition put this matter, that he wanted to do the country a service in a responsible manner. But I have a suspicion that the measure <span class="col_2189-2190" refersTo="page_1108"/>of success already achieved in being able to shift the Wafra by 55 degrees, has something to do with it. I do nevertheless feel that since this sensational event is being spoken about by everybody one encounters, the Opposition has seen in this an opportunity to make a little politics. I do not begrudge them the fact. It is certainly their right. But I do feel that they should nevertheless keep slightly to their sense of proportion.</p>

<p>Let us speak of another small disaster, if you will permit me. There was an earthquake here a few months ago and that was a tremendously sensational event. Everyone was willing to make a contribution. Just near us here there is a much greater disaster&#x2014;the South Western districts are perishing in the drought, and the disaster damage is much greater, but the United Party has never yet come to the fore and said &#x201C;give a little help&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think perhaps, in the light of what has already happened and what may be facing the area down at Cape Agulhas, I would not be out of order and will probably be speaking for every hon. member in this House when I say that our sympathy goes out to the folk who are threatened by this catastrophe which has taken place as a result of the grounding of the Wafra. They are the people, after all, who are going to be the main sufferers if, in fact, the worst should happen.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down. He seemed to me not only not to answer what my hon. Leader had said in any way whatever, but he seemed to be belittling or trying to diminish the importance of the situation out there at the present time. My hon. Leader said that the Government had been warned. I want to make this abundantly clear. I go the whole way with my Leader when he refers to the work that has been done by the officials, year in and year out. What is lacking, has been drive and determination to get on with the job at the very top. That is the Government. The Minister must take the responsibility. But in the last resort, the Government itself must take the responsibility. It was not only the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs; it was not even this Minister; it was his predecessor during whose time the matter was before the Government repeatedly. I have a letter here from a borough council in my constituency in which they refer to correspondence that they have had with the Minister of Tourism, because they believed that he would bring pressure to bear on the Government, so that adequate measures for the protection of our coast line would be taken timeously. That was a broken reed on which to lean at a time like this. What is the position in so far as warnings are concerned&#x003F; The entire position today loses its emphasis, it loses its point if out of the blue unexpectedly, without any warning a catastrophe of this nature suddenly hits South Africa. But that is not the position. We had the case of the Torrey Canyon, with which we were not directly concerned but from which we could learn a lesson. We have also had our own cases. We had the case of the World Glory up on the north coast of Zululand&#x2014;46,000 tons of oil. Fortunately the winds, the tides, etc., saved our coast from disaster. Nothing was done on our side until the slick started to come down to the coast when once again the officials got stuck into it; they did a magnificent job and the winds, the tides and the currents did the rest. Let me ask once more: From the top, where was the guidance&#x003F; Where was the authority&#x003F; But it was not only the World Glory. I myself reported a fully loaded tanker which passed between what we call the Aimee Lykes rocks at Green Point in Natal, a loaded tanker on the inside passage. If she had touched the rocks which put the Aimee Lykes there, within two or three miles from the coast, we would have had the whole bottom ripped out from this big tanker. However, she took the chance, and what was done about it&#x003F; Nothing! I went to the trouble of going back to the nearest post office and phoning the appropriate authorities in the harbour in Durban so that something could be done about it. The tanker had the whole way to travel from Green Point, from the Aliwal shoal, right into Durban, but they could not identify her. Then we had the case of the Burland, in respect of which I raised questions in this House. The Burland ran amuck in Durban harbour, loaded with oil. Yet the department did not even hold an inquiry to find out what had happened. Her steering went completely out of commission and two tugs had to keep her moving around in a big circle in the middle of Durban harbour because there was nothing that could be done to stop her. Her steering was completely out of control, locked right over. Those tugs saved us, but there was not <span class="col_2191-2192" refersTo="page_1109"/>even an inquiry; not even an inquiry. A big ship loaded with oil in the middle of Durban harbour! Then just recently, 10 days ago, we had the <i>Daily News</i> with the picture of a ship. An aircraft was sent out and they took her name, the Tugelaland. There it is in the paper, in the <i>Daily News,</i> showing an oil slick streaming away for miles behind her. It was reported, but was anything done&#x003F; Nothing was done. On Thursday I flew to Durban with the plane which left here at 12.20. On the way we passed over another tanker with a slick at least a mile long just before we got to the Bluff outside Durban. It was reported, and was anything done&#x003F; No, Sir! But the worst of the lot was the case of a boat the John Lyras. She was reported to be pumping oil from her bilges by a passing ship. This ship had nothing to do with South Africa; yet the foreign captain took the initiative and was even prepared to wireless to South Africa to give the name of the ship, her international identification number and reporting the fact that she was pumping oil at such and such a point of the compass and that she was throwing it into our waters. He then went on his way. And what happened&#x003F; The John Lyras went into Durban harbour and stayed there for four days. Yet nothing was done. This is the type of thing that has given warnings to the Government; this is the kind of thing that has been happening. If the Minister does not know about it he ought to know about it; it is all in the papers. For three years I have been asking questions here about the steps which were being taken. You see, Sir, when we have an accident like this, when we have a catastrophe of this magnitude, what is needed is an absolutely efficient organization and speed. The entire essence of the operation is speed. That is why I go along entirely with my hon. Leader when he says &#x201C;Hand this over to the Navy&#x201D;. It is not because the Division of Sea Fisheries cannot act; it is not because the Department of Commerce and Industries cannot act, but the fact is they are not equipped to deal with it. And where is the law that was coming as I was promised in reply to my questions of 1968&#x003F; The law was coming that session. The following year I asked questions again and was told that it would be coming that session. In 1969 it was coming and in 1970 it was still coming and today we have not got it yet.</p>

<p>Let me deal with the question of speed. In the case of this boat, the moment her engine-room was flooded she was out of control&#x2014;she could not steer; she could not go forward nor back; she was at the mercy of the wind, of the sea and the currents. A Russian boat tried to take her in tow but if failed. Then came the Pongola and she also failed. When that ship sent out a distress signal that her engines were breaking down, she obviously could not do anything about it; she was out of control owing to the inflow of water; the engines were sunk, literally and figuratively. The very moment this ship sent out a distress signal we should have had a helicopter sent out there with a marine engineer and a scientist capable of assessing the damage of the oil spill that might take place. If the helicopter could not land on the tanker it could have landed the men there, equipped with walkie-talkies. They could then report the position exactly as they found it there. Here was a boat in the process of drifting ashore. As my hon. Leader said, after the Russian ship cast her off and she was taken in tow by the Pongola, she actually pulled the Pongola backwards as she went on the rocks. Where was the authority that could do anything about it&#x003F; Various laws had to be complied with, various undertakings had to be considered, various discussions had to take place between different authorities. There was no central authority to take control and to see that things got done, the right things under the circumstances. There was no best advice except what we were getting from various officials who were doing their best from the shore; there was no proper communication and communication was vital&#x2014;it was as vital to have good communication as it was to have speed. Yet this was lacking. It would not cost millions of rand to set up a system to ensure good communications to act with speed. Then there could have been a sea/air rescue boat to stand by. It might have been necessary to take the crew off the tanker. When once the Pongola gave it up a sea rescue boat was necessary because the Pongola herself could have gone on the rocks had she not been careful and it might have been necessary to save the lives of the men on her. What was necessary was a driving force, one central intelligence, one man who could take control of the situation. This is where the law comes in and this is where the Government is dilatory&#x2014;wasting time year after year; failing to clothe itself with the powers to deal with the matter. Here again we have not learned the lesson of the Torrey Canyon. Do you know, Sir, that within a full week <span class="col_2193-2194" refersTo="page_1110"/>after the wreck of the Torrey Canyon the Government of Britain, the underwriters and the owners of the ship argued about the ship, for a full week, before anybody was legally entitled to get down and do something. Meanwhile the Dutch tug was trying to pull her off. But for a whole week there were arguments as to what legal rights were whose. Sir, we have got to have a law on our Statute Book making it clear as to who has got what rights in this event and these rights are going to be the rights of the Government of South Africa in the public interest. We cannot afford to have all the red tape and the messing around with discussions and consultations and all the rest of it when there is an issue at stake like the wreck of this boat. Sir, this may only be the beginning, for all that we know to the contrary. Here are any number of papers showing that the 100,000 ton tanker is just around the corner while the Japanese are now preparing plans for 500,000 ton tankers. Mr. Speaker, think of the incident referred to by my hon. Leader, of these tankers bringing the dispersant to the wreck and being held up because of the necessity to get exemption under the Road Transportation Act. When a fire engine comes into town because there is a building on fire, they do not worry about robots or whether they have a transportation certificate. It is incredible, Sir. We think it is nonsense; it is childish even to talk about things like that but why is it not equally nonsensical, where you are trying to get much needed chemical dispersant to a wreck like this, to have this kind of holdup, to stop your people from exercising the greatest amount of efficiency of which they are capable&#x003F; Sir, we do not know where this thing will end. It is all very well for the hon. member for Swellendam to make light of it, but we do not know where it will end. We have not even closed the first chapter; we do not know what is going to happen. May God forbid, Sir, that this ship comes adrift and turns turtle when once they have got her off the point where she is at the present time, or something equally catastrophic. This is in the hands of Providence; it depends on the weather. That is the position that we are facing at the present time. But even as far as it has gone, Sir, what actual knowledge is in the mind of the hon. the Minister&#x003F; Does he know what dispersants are necessary for the proper handling of the oil that is spilling from that tanker&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#hon_members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>What do you suggest&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Has he had such analyses made, such experiments carried out, that he can say with certainty: &#x201C;This is the dispersant to use under those circumstances or under those circumstances&#x201D;&#x003F; The hon. member who sat down just now distinguished between engine oil and crude oil. Fair enough, but that is not a thing that you want to argue about when you have an issue like this on hand. You have to be prepared for it. The Minister who should be controlling matters, or who should have appointed somebody who has the drive and the initiative and the imagination to deal with this matter, should have a man who is going to know the answers to these things and is able to get in touch with the finest technical, scientific and professional advice at a moment&#x2019;s notice&#x2014;exactly like marshalling a military operation. The very best advice should be available at once. [Interjections.] Sir, hon. members over there know nothing about mounting a military operation. Their bows and arrows have got mildewed since they last used them.</p>

<p>Sir, you can have this kind of thing in a semi-enclosed bay or you can have it in the open sea. You can have it in shallow water or you can have it in deep water, and the treatment in every case will have to depend upon the circumstances. But the main, essential driving force behind this must be a carefully thought-out plan, tested as far as it is humanly possible in all its details, so that if this should eventuate, then plan A is put in operation immediately. If that should eventuate, then plan B is put in operation immediately. It is true that the dispersants which are being used may do far more harm than the oil itself; that, unfortunately, is perfectly true and we have no knowledge of this; we do not know exactly what is happening there, because we do not know what dispersants are being used. As my hon. Leader has pointed out there are some dispersants in respect of which the manufacturers themselves say that they must not be used in less than 40 feet of water. But, Sir, that dispersant can be put down where there is 60 or 70 feet of water. Then the wind and the tide can bring it in and it can still come on to your rocks in the shallows and on to the beach. May I say at once that they can forget about the idea that you can clean up the beach afterwards with bulldozers <span class="col_2195-2196" refersTo="page_1111"/>and what-not. Along the Natal coast today, where we have innumerable small slicks coming on to our shores, the net result is becoming a major disaster, and to try to get that slick off the top avails nothing. As the tides run and the sand sifts, you clear the top completely and two or three high-tides later, more oil comes from lower down. That oil can go five or six feet down into the sand. We have determined that with actual experiments where we have investigated and gone down into the sand that depth. We do not know what the after-effects of a catastrophe like this are likely to be. If some of those dispersants get on to the rocks, the rocks will hold no sea life, no marine life, whatsoever for possibly two or even three years hereafter. Biologically sea life will not be able to find sustenance on those rocks. It can affect fish; it can affect your crustacea; we do not know how far it can go. It can affect food chains. It can affect small plankton and small life of that kind which in turn will poison those that feed upon them and those that feed upon those and those who feed upon those. Sir, the end of a chain like that is not known to man. We are not able to fathom it. We do not know how far the damage can go.</p>

<p>But here we sit at the present time, in my opinion, because the Government has had warning after warning and has taken no cognizance of it. It has left its officials from time to time to do their best with completely inadequate facilities. In nothing has it been more clearly shown than it was at the meeting we had in Durban some two years ago, where time after time the officials had to say that the Minister must decide this or that. The Minister has decided nothing and we have been struck by a catastrophe. The Government has been caught, as I said, like a lot of schoolgirls running about in an aimless manner, and no doubt the officials will be the people who in the end will have to carry the responsibility, and that would be bitterly unfair. The Government itself as a whole is responsible for the fact that there is no adequate provision made for proper machinery to deal with a catastrophe of this nature.</p>

<p>On the evening of Saturday the 27th all the crew members of the Wafra had already left the boat. In this process, one person was killed and another is missing, presumably also dead. The rest of the crew were picked up only on Sunday morning. On the Saturday afternoon, my Department, the Department of Industries, was approached by an engineering firm to make the necessary arrangements for a Super Frelon to be made available for transporting a compressor to the scene for pumping air into the ship in an attempt to refloat it. As soon as that Sunday, i.e. the day after the ship had struck the reef, senior officials of my department left for the scene in the morning and returned to Cape Town only late that night. The day after that, on the Monday morning, I made it my business to accompany officials and the hon. member for Swellendam to go and have a look at what had happened. I should like to give this House an impression of what I saw there.</p>

<p><span class="col_2197-2198" refersTo="page_1112"/>The oil which had leaked out during the Sunday night, was evidently drifting in the direction of the coast, and I noticed oil on the coast between Struis Bay and Agulhas and also some oil to the east of Struis Bay. The small harbour at Struis Bay, amongst others, was filled with oil. Furthermore there was an oil slick stretching in a westerly direction from the ship. It is not a good thing and of course one is concerned about it. It happened on the Monday. From that day on, the officials of my department have been on the scene virtually every day. This has been done in addition to regular flights which have been undertaken by the Maritime Command of the Air Force since 1st March in order to establish the whereabouts of the oil. On each of these occasions, professional officers of my department have gone along in order to take a look at the circumstances there. From Sunday, 28th February, the day after the stranding, sprays and equipment have been put in readiness. I should like to draw the attention of the hon. member for South Coast specifically to the fact that Agulhas is hundreds of miles away from Cape Town and as many hundreds of miles away from Port Elizabeth. Surely I cannot keep ships with sprays ready at Agulhas for such circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member speaks as though this happens so easily. Since the occurrence of this accident, I have received ideas and advice from far and wide. If I were to make a synopsis of those ideas given to me, it would make interesting reading. I think the plans of the hon. member for South Coast are just as interesting. Men and women, old and young, have come forward with ideas, but this is not such an easy matter. Five big ships, each of which can carry 5,000 and 25,000 tons of spray, are doing the spraying. Another ship, which can carry 500 tons, will start spraying as soon as possible. As regards the spray, I should like to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast that we have sufficient supplies to enable us to spray continuously for three weeks. We have never had any problem in regard to sprays. We have never had any problems in regard to sprays which have been analysed and examined in the laboratory of the Division of Sea Fisheries and which have been found to be the most effective in our circumstances. A senior official of my department has been stationed at Agulhas in order to act as a liaison officer and advisor. 1,800,000 litres of spray have already been prepared. I want to explain to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that it is not necessary for us to keep all that spray in stock. All we have to do is to keep a sufficient supply of spray in stock, so that the factories with which we have a fixed arrangement in regard to the manufacturing of sprays, may be given an opportunity of manufacturing the sprays. Since we have started using the supplies at our disposal, the factories have set about the manufacture of the spray. We have no problem at all in regard to the spray. Hon. members have kicked up a fuss about sprays, but this is the popular argument used.</p>

<p>I was still coming to that. This spray is poisonous. The sprays which have been used up to now in the world, are in fact very poisonous. The statement is already being made that if the spray were to be used indiscriminately or to a large extent in shallow water, it might cause more damage than the oil pollution itself. There is talk of a new spray now, of which we have in fact obtained a small supply, and which is alleged to be not poisonous, or at least, not as poisonous as the spray we have been using to date.</p>

<p>I want to add to this that we have not imported any spray whatsoever. We have manufactured all the spray here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Where&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not quite sure where it is manufactured, but it is manufactured in South Africa by factories with which we have a definite arrangement. We keep supplies of the spray at Walvis Bay, Cape Town and Durban. On the occasion of the previous incident, namely that of the World Glory near Durban, we had supplies left over consisting of 350,000 litres, of which the value was R190,000. It is possible that there was some imported spray in that quantity. For the rest, the spray we use is manufactured in South Africa and we have no problems in that regard. We have 12 sets of spraying equipment which we have been held in readiness since 1968. The cost of this was R12,000. Two sets <span class="col_2199-2200" refersTo="page_1113"/>of spraying equipment of the type used on the ships for spraying, are now being manufactured according to the most modern designs.</p>

<p>But let me say something about the organization beforehand. There is an action committee and a service control centre at each of the following places: Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Walvis Bay. These action committees and service control centres are being administered by my Department of Industries. The task of the action committee is to investigate cases and to decide what action should be taken. The service control centres, on the other hand consist of representatives of Government Departments and local authorities who then have to implement the plan of action as decided on by the committee.</p>

<p>In this case, the action committee was not summond to meet at first, as the appropriate action was actually logical. Obviously&#x2014;and I think we all agree with this &#x2014;the first endeavour was to pull the ship from the rocks. But subsequently a meeting was held at Agulhas by the action committee, the ship-owners, the cargo-owners, engineers and other officials of our various departments. At this meeting various steps were decided on. I should like to request now that when another hon. member rises to discuss this matter, he should tell me precisely what we did not do which consequently caused a delay. Hon. members on that side of this House must not talk in broad outline and try to make political capital out of an unfortunate incident like this. They must please be specific. I am being serious now. Hon. members must please be specific and tell us what we have done wrong and what we have neglected to do.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, at this meeting, various steps were decided on. The first of these was that attempts were to be made to pull the tanker from the reef to a point approximately 200 miles south of Agulhas or latitude 38&#x00B0; south. It was suggested that a frigate should be used. But, so I have been informed, a frigate was not available at that stage. Besides, a frigate cannot be used for this purpose. The hon. the Minister of Defence will be able to tell hon. members that it cannot be done. How on earth can we use one of his frigates for undertaking towing work of this nature&#x003F; It is not permitted. The second step decided on was that attempts should be made to transfer the cargo after the tanker had been pulled off the reef. If we did not succeed in pulling this tanker off the reef, attempts were to be made in any event to pump the oil over into another ship. In the meanwhile, the spraying of the area had to be continued so that we might combat the pollution of the sea as far as possible.</p>

<p>Other possible steps were also considered, for example, burning the oil in the ship. But it was said that that could not be effective. We imported five tons of a new product which will be used to ignite the oil on the water where thick layers of oil are found. As yet we are not sure whether it will work, but it has been considered and we shall try it. In addition, there was talk of bombarding the ship. But at that stage it was decided not to do so at all.</p>

<p>Since 4th March salavage attempts have been made. The owners of the ship, and these are the legal implications to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred, accepted the ship as being lost. On 4th March, the master of the ship which had to pull this tanker off the reef, decided not to continue that attempt. At that stage there were negotiations to continue the work on the basis of &#x201C;payment for the work&#x201D;. Previously the negotiations were on a basis of &#x201C;no salvaging, no payment&#x201D;, or as it is called, &#x201C;no cure, no pay&#x201D;. On the morning of Friday, 5th March, the head office in the United States of America notified us that such an agreement could not be entered into with the salvage boat. My Department of Industries immediately had further negotiations and we entered into a contract with the salvage boat so that the work of trying to refloat this tanker could continue. The same evening, i.e. the afternoon of 5th March, when the contract was entered into, the salvage boat tried to pull the tanker off. Of course, as hon. members know, the tug has not yet succeeded in doing that. As I have said, the first accusation, and it seems to me the principal accusation levelled by the Opposition, was that there was not enough spray.</p>

However, I want to associate myself with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition by saying that this method is an extremely dangerous and delicate operation. Everybody thinks this is the most obvious step which can be taken, i.e. to pump out the oil. Everyone says this; man, woman, child, small, old and young tell one this. However, it is an extremely difficult operation and we must prepare ourselves for possible adversities in the process. It is extremely dangerous. Furthermore, one does not always have a suitable tanker in the neighbourhood into which the oil can be pumped and there are various other problems as well.</p>

<p>In my short radio talk I said I doubted whether we were sufficiently equipped to be able to combat this type of problem. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was surprised about that. Now I want to ask him as Leader of the Opposition or anyone who gets up on that side, to tell me whether there is any country in the world sufficiently equipped to eliminate all damage in a case like this. What country in the world is so equipped&#x003F; Do they expect us to do superhuman things when other countries, such as the United States of America, cannot&#x003F; If the hon. member wants to take the trouble, he should read what appears here on page 52 of the <i>United States News and World Report.</i> The article is published under the title &#x201C;Growing Problem of Oil spills&#x2014;reasons and remedies&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It is the edition of the 8th February, 1971. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What to do about big oil spills that pollute the nations&#x2019; beaches and harbours is becoming a high priority worry for top officials in Washington as well as in the oil industry. Two disasters in January this year &#x2026;</block>

<p>Reference is being made here to America and not to us; the wonderful America which, according to Sir De Villiers Graaff, allegedly has a solution to the problem. I proceed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Two disasters in January brought new outcries of alarm about the growing threat of large-scale oil contamination.</block>

<p>This is a problem which the world has not yet been able to combat. It is a modern problem. We can very easily purchase ships and equipment and various necessary or unnecessary remedies to the value of millions of rands, but the next case will in all probability not be similar to the present one. In that case we would have spent millions of rands on a white elephant with which we will be saddled.</p>

<p>I should just like to add that there are many things which can still be considered. This experience has taught us something, in the same way that previous experiences have. It has taught us something in the same way as similar experiences in the rest of the world have taught us. The Cabinet has already paid attention to the possibility that the Navy should perhaps accept the responsibility, especially in regard to the salvage work. These are matters which can be considered. I should like to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that in the laboratories of my Division of Sea Fisheries, we are keeping abreast of the new developments in the world in the field of oil pollution at sea, from day to day and from week to week. If hon. members on the opposite side want to express criticism, they must be more specific; otherwise we shall not take notice of them. Their criticism should not be couched in the terms of the motion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who refers to the &#x201C;failure on the part of the Government to take timeous and appropriate steps&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the first place I think it is appropriate to say that the hon. the Minister is today on record as having said that at no stage subsequent to the stranding of the Wafra has there been any shortage of dispersal chemicals. Secondly, that he said that the dispersal chemicals that were available in such great quantities were of a poisonous kind. He has not told us to what extent the chemicals that have been available since the stranding of the Wafra have in <span class="col_2203-2204" refersTo="page_1115"/>fact been used. Thirdly, he went so far as to say that it was the Government&#x2019;s intention to pull the Wafra off the rocks and to tow it 200 miles out to sea where it will be disposed of one way or another. The fourth point I want to record is that he said that my leader had said that we had suggested that a frigate should be used to pull the Wafra off the rocks. We never made any such suggestion. We said that there had been a long delay from the time of the sending out of the S.O.S. to the time she had landed on the rocks and that in that time a frigate could quite easily have come from Simonstown to prevent the Wafra going onto the rocks. Then my leader and the hon. member for South Coast at no time mentioned the possibility of bombing. We on this side of the House feel in the light of the experience of other tanker wrecks and more particularly with the Torrey Canyon that bombing does more harm than good. We have never at any stage advocated this method.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Swellendam have said that we are trying to exact the maximum political pleasure out of this situation. I want to refer them to <i>Die Burger</i> of last Saturday and the correspondent Andre Rossouw who must also have been exacting the maximum political pleasure out of this situation. I say this because he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wanneer die hele drama van die Wafra verby is, gaan iemand seker &#x2019;n paar lastige vrae stel aan di&#x00E9; instansies wat verantwoordelik is vir die skepe om ons kuste. Die vrae moet tog nie eers deur &#x2019;n kommissie van ondersoek gevra word nie. Daardie dinge kos maande voordat al die getuienis aangehoor en &#x2019;n verslag uitgebring is. Dit moet onmiddellik gedoen word.</block>

<p>The fears of this side of the House are also shared by <i>Die Burger</i> and also by every other newspaper which has an interest in the coastal areas and knows what it is talking about in these matters. They are just as concerned about the lack of action during the past four years by this Government as we on this side of the House are.</p>

<p>So far are we on this side of the House from trying to make politics out of this situation and so anxious are we that the Wafra should be pulled off the rocks and that a most appalling catastrophe should be averted that it is perhaps appropriate that we should be the first to give the news to this House that in a note which has just been passed to me it is stated that the Wafra has in fact been pulled off the rocks. There is no one in this House who derives greater pleasure out of this event, if it is correct, than members on this side of the House. There is no reason for the Government to suggest that we take any pleasure out of an appalling catastrophe which could still occur and which almost certainly would have occurred had the Wafra not been pulled off the rocks. I have no doubt that the hon. member for Caledon in response to a telegram from the Publicity Association of Hermanus has had an enormous lot to do with the success of this undertaking!</p>

<p>I believe that at this stage it is appropriate for us to refer to a report that was tabled in this House in the middle of 1968. This was an <i>ad hoc</i> report by a committee presided over by Prof. Mallory and it made certain recommendations. As the hon. the Minister says that we on this side of the House have levelled very few charges against him I am going to ask him on an appropriate occasion to deal in detail with the recommendations made by that <i>ad hoc</i> committee, which was tabled in this House. The first recommendation was the establishment of a permanent action committee to prepare the country for emergencies and to act in the event of any major oil spill. Now that action committee, in fact, has been set up. I should like to ask in what way has the Minister prepared the country for the eventuality such as recently occurred in the stranding of the Wafra. Secondly, the committee recommended that the action committee should have made available to it funds immediately a disaster takes place, with which they could cope with the situation as they found it. The third recommendation which this committee made was that there should be established a permanent scientific and technical advisory committee, because there was a need for expert knowledge in the field of marine and fisheries biology, and a number of other very, very important aspects of recovering ships from the sea. Now I want to ask him whether that scientific and technical committee has ever been set up; if so, how often has it functioned, and will its findings be tabled in the House&#x003F; It is said in this report of Prof. Mallory that it was essential to divert scientific efforts from current research projects, so that a study could be <span class="col_2205-2206" refersTo="page_1116"/>made of the short- and the long-term effect of any disaster such as the Wafra. Now I should like to ask him, where have scientists been diverted from existing scientific projects to investigate this essential matter&#x003F; The report went further and suggested that State laboratories should be made available and that the universities should be consulted with a view to their undertaking special emergency studies to do with the consequences of oil pollution. The committee suggested further that there should be a set of reference stations set up all along our coasts with which to feed the Department of Fisheries and the Department of Industries with the necessary ecological information. Mr. Speaker, as you will know at the time of the Torrey Canyon disaster one of the reasons why that disaster was not of even greater magnitude than in fact it was, was because there had been special ecological surveys of the coast for some years past in the area near where the Torrey Canyon went aground.</p>

<p>Two special recommendations were made by this committee as well. First of all, they recommended that the Republican Government should immediately initiate research on a national basis in the field of combating oil pollution. I want to ask the Minister, where has this research taken place on a national basis and what are the results of this research&#x003F; They suggested that all modern methods should be checked and verified, methods that are being dealt with and are coming to light every other day overseas. A special research unit should also be set up with a personnel of three&#x2014; an organic chemist, a marine biologist and various technical assistants. I would like to ask him whether that special research unit has in fact been set up. This committee presided over by Prof. Mallory, made a specific recommendation applicable to the Government. They called on the Government to sign an international convention for the prevention of pollution at sea. This committee met and its report was tabled in this House in the middle of 1968. I would like to ask if South Africa signed the convention following the Brussels conference in 1969, or whether we again sent an observer and nothing further has been done at the international level.</p>

<p>The aims of any action to be taken as recommended by this committee, are clearly set out in the committee&#x2019;s report. First of all. they say that the armed forces must immediately be alerted and called in to implement the necessary control measures. I would like to ask the Minister, were our armed forces in fact immediately alerted and have they been called in even at this stage&#x003F; The other main objects were to salvage the ship if it is reasonably possible, to fire any escaping oil as close to the ship as possible and to use detergents where necessary. Then the report goes further and says that at local level there must be a combined organization as regards the mechanical removal of the oil that had been deposited on the seashore. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister what organization has been set up at that level to deal on a regional or a municipal basis with oil pollution on our beaches.</p>

<p>Lastly, for the information of the hon. the Minister, in case he has not read this report&#x2014;there are some occasions when I feel that the Minister does not do his homework as well as he should&#x2014;there is an appendix &#x201C;A&#x201D; to this report, which gives the person put in charge of the particular operation to which I have referred, a guide as to the information that should be obtained. I would like to ask the Minister whether all the information recommended in the middle of 1968 to be obtained by the Under-Secretary for Industries, has in fact been obtained and whether it is available in his department.</p>

<p>Now let us deal with what has actually happened on the 27th February.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister whether the armed forces were in fact alerted to control the situation, more particularly the Navy. Was the Simonstown Naval Base immediately advised of the S.O.S. sent out by the Wafra&#x003F; Simonstown is very much closer to Agulhas than Cape Town. Was consideration given to the possibility of Simonstown being made the centre of operations&#x003F; I would have thought that the telecommunication system of the Navy was far superior to any telecommunication system that could be established at short notice in as far off a place as Cape Agulhas with a telephone exchange only at Struisbaai. I would have thought that the facilities available at Youngsfield and at Simonstown could best be used in the situation in which the Government found itself on the morning of the 27th. The Minister has poured scorn on the suggestion that a frigate could have been used. Yet I believe that one of our frigates, capable of up to 30 knots, could have left Simonstown in the early hours of that morning and been at the Wafra well before she went aground. <span class="col_2207-2208" refersTo="page_1117"/>Instead of that the Navy, I believe, of its own initiative, and not in response to a request from the Government, sent the tug De Noorde on a lifesaving mission to the Wafra. This tug is not big enough to be able to have kept the Wafra off the rocks and furthermore she did not engage in any towing operations. She came back to Simonstown with the body of one of the crew who had drowned. Regarding the question of facilities I would like to know whether Naval ships and facilities were used. If not, why were they not used&#x003F; Would they not have been able to cope with a combined operation far better than is the position at the moment under the direction of the department operating from Cape Town&#x003F; Let us look at the vessels that were involved, and first of all the tugs. Priority number one is to get a stranded vessel off the rocks as soon as possible. After the S.O.S. was received, how long was it before the H. E. Bates was sent from Cape Town to Agulhas&#x003F; Was a telephone call made to Pretoria first for permission for it to be sent on such a mission&#x003F; As you know, Mr. Speaker, our docks and harbours fall under the control of the Administration in Pretoria. Was a deposit of R80 per hour required by the Railways to be paid by the agents of the Wafra before the H. E. Bates was sent on her way&#x003F; How many hours elapsed before the H. E. Bates went to the Wafra&#x003F; How long did it take her to get there&#x003F; I would be surprized if she took less than 13 hours to get to the Wafra. In any event, was there any delay&#x003F; I should like to quote what Mr. Averill had to say; he is an engineering authority for the company concerned. I should like to quote what he said since another American has recently, I believe yesterday, visited South Africa, was then flown over the coast in the company of the Minister and has produced such a glowing report of the state of preparedness. I should like to quote Mr. Averill. He was here a little bit longer than this gentleman who came yesterday; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The stranded tanker Wafra could have been salved if expert advice and ships had been readily available.</block>

<p>What about other privately-owned tugs&#x003F; We had the situation on the morning of Saturday that the Baltic, the Atlantic and the Oceanic, privately-owned tugs, were in fact on duty, in two cases in the Durban area and were unable to get to the Wafra in time. There is no deep-sea tug available in Cape Town harbour of any larger size than the H. E. Bates, and the H. E. Bates, I submit, is not capable of undertaking the towing of a tanker of the size of the Wafra once she has grounded. We have had four years of warning, Sir, that this sort of catastrophe was going to happen, and if it is correct&#x2014;I hope it is correct&#x2014;that the Wafra is off the rocks and South Africa is saved this catastrophe, then it is through Providence and through no action on the part of this Government, since it has been perfectly obvious that it would only be a matter of time before a tanker&#x2014;and in this case it is a fairly small tanker&#x2014;went aground on our shores.</p>

<p>Sir, what other vessels were used by the Minister in this state of emergency, with the possibility of a national disaster taking place&#x003F; Do you know what vessels were available&#x003F; First of all, there was the Africana II, a research vessel of the Department of Fisheries. Then there was the Sadinops, also a research vessel of the Department of Fisheries, and from South-West Africa, where it was engaged on an urgent research project to do with the disappearance of the pilchards resources off the South-West African coast, came the Benguella, rushing to Agulhas. For what purposes, Sir&#x003F; To spray dispersants on the sea. And then we had the Malgas and the Gamtoos, both vessels in the service of the Guano Islands. They also had to hurry to Agulhas to spray dispersant on the water. Then we had the Gemsbok, which is owned by Murray and Stewart and which was also sent to Agulhas to spray dispersant on the sea. Vessels of the Department of Fisheries were taken off their urgent research and sent to Agulhas. What about smaller naval vessels&#x003F; Could they not have been inspanned; could they not have been used to perform this service&#x003F; What about the detergents&#x003F; The Minister has dealt with this, but I want to say this: On the day after the stranding of the Wafra, the engineer of the Provincial Administration said he hoped that there were enough dispersal chemicals available to cope with a thing like this, and an oil company official on the same day said that something like 2.6 million gallons of dispersal chemicals was necessary to cope with the disaster. The Minister says that all of this was available.</p>

<p>Sir, what about other methods&#x003F; Have other methods that have been used with success overseas been studied; have officials been sent overseas since the Torrey Canyon to study these methods with a view to <span class="col_2209-2210" refersTo="page_1118"/>adapting them to the conditions off our coast&#x003F;</p>

<p>What about the local authorities&#x003F; Were the local authorities involved in a combined operation&#x003F; Was the municipality of Hermanus consulted and told what to do&#x003F; On Friday when I spoke to the mayor of Hermanus, the answer was: &#x201C;We have had no communication whatsoever.&#x201D; Was the mayor of Gansbaai consulted and told what to do&#x003F; On Friday he also had received no information nor the mayor of Simonstown nor the mayor of Cape Town nor the mayor of Fish Hoek. On Friday when the wreck seemed to be in great danger of breaking up and a national catastrophe was facing us, the local authorities most concerned had received no information or direction whatsoever either from the provincial authorities or from the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have not time to go into the question of our unpreparedness at international level, to which I have referred very briefly. But I have asked questions which should have been answered on Friday, questions which could easily have been answered on Friday. I have not yet received the answers. We on this side of the House feel that we are still facing the possibility of a national disaster which we hope will be averted. The man directing this operation up at the top is the Minister responsible for the Japanese jockey episode; the Minister in charge of this operation is the man responsible for the hire-purchase fiasco.

<p>I want to hold it against the Opposition for trying to make political capital of a disaster such as this. In our happiness at the fact that the Wafra has been towed off the rocks, I want to congratulate the Opposition on one thing, and that is that today they achieved a world record in the sense that they were the first people in the world who saw their way clear and succeeded in making a political issue of pollution. If the hon. members of the Opposition were really in earnest, as they professed to be, about the merits of the case, why have we not in recent years had a private motion on <b>a</b> suitable occasion in order to lodge a plea in this connection&#x003F; This afternoon the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke very calmly and piously here, but have you seen what his motion looks like&#x003F; He refers to the failure on the part of the Government to take timeous and appropriate steps.</p>

<p>I now want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this. The latest available report is that the Wafra was towed off the rocks at 3.17 p.m., and is at present moving four miles south of that position.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this. If, as he and the hon. member for Simonstown implied, there was a lack of timely action, is this shifting of the Wafra then not due to the costs incurred and the efforts of officials under the control of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x003F; Judging by the way this debate was tackled I want to say that the hon. the Minister and his department, with the department of the hon. the Minister of Transport, deserves all the praise and full marks for the fact that the Wafra was towed off the rocks.</p>

<p>If one had been listening to the kinds of arguments in this debate&#x2014;I must say the hon. member for Simonstown does like to pose as a great authority on the sea and on navigation, but the hon. member must do a little homework. There is no tug with the name he mentioned. I do not know what initials he used, but the tug&#x2019;s name is the F. T. Bates. The hon. member did not know the ship&#x2019;s name. He also asked when this tug did in fact leave Cape Town harbour. If the hon. member and other hon. members on that side, instead of listening to gossip and street-mongering when a disaster like this occurs, had rather spoken to the responsible officials sitting here today, their knowledge would have been very much better. Then they would have known that the F. T. Bates left Cape Town harbour with the minimum of delay. There are, after all, certain basic preparations that had to be carried out, and the hon. member for Simonstown&#x2019;s insinuation that a phone call had to be made to Pretoria first in order to obtain permission, is also wrong. The hon. the Minister is here in Cape Town and so is the General Manager of the Railways. Permission to leave <span class="col_2211-2212" refersTo="page_1119"/>was granted to the tug immediately after the requirement of paying a deposit was met, but the hon. member is now bent on implying by way of insinuation that there was an endless delay here. I say that if the hon. members would only rather have talked to people who have knowledge of this matter, they would have known that the handling of the Wafra incident speaks volumes for South Africa&#x2019;s skill and co-ordination. The hon. member himself referred to what happened in the case of the Torrey Canyon in England. The hon. member would like us to learn from them. How much floundering did not take place there in order to reach a solution!</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member that it is best to prevent a disaster, but one would not be a realist if one did not realize that a disaster is an unexpected event, and that is why it is a disaster. If a disaster occurs, one must try one&#x2019;s best to restrict its damaging effects to a minimum. I say it speaks volumes for the handling of the matter by the Government and the various departments, and for the fine co-operation there was between them and with the private sector which is also involved. There are dangers involved in the matter. Further, human lives can be implicated. But through careful handling and good co-ordination the ship has now eventually been dislodged from the rocks without further loss to human life or to property.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition delivered his speech by way of a set of questions, or rather by way of suggestions. An hon. member sitting near me counted that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition used the words &#x201C;I believe&#x201D; about 30 or 40 times. The late Dr. Malan said on occasion, referring to certain journalists who were fond of using the words &#x201C;I believe&#x201D;, that those things they believed were the products of their own imaginations. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, as I said, approached the matter from the point of view of his &#x201C;I believes&#x201D;, and then made an allusive statement to boot. This comes from the kinds of popular stories that do the rounds when disasters occur. Have hon. members already seen what happens when there is an accident on one of our highways&#x003F; As quick as a wink there is a whole crowd of people. Each individual is more curious than the next, and cleverer about what exactly happened and what precisely should be done. But on the other hand a minimum number of them are available to grant actual assistance. This is precisely the same thing one is now getting in the case of the Wafra disaster.</p>

<p>I hear that people at Agulhas are going around with a variety of stories about how things ought to be done, and these include better plans than those proposed by the Opposition. There is quite a bit of conjecture about what really happened, what is wrong and what was not done. There are simply no limits to it. One would be unrealistic if one did not gauge this manifestation, during a disaster, of human nature as such. That is why I say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s approach to this matter, with his allusive &#x201C;I believes&#x201D; comes from those kinds of stories that are doing the rounds among people with little knowledge.</p>

<p>The shipwreck of a large oil tanker creates problems. This ship is not a very large one. Today there are many oil tankers in the world that are vastly bigger. One&#x2019;s ability to control such a situation is as wide as the ocean itself. We have legislation in our country to combat the pollution of the air, of rivers and streams. The field of application of that control is so much smaller and can therefore be managed quite easily. But in the case of the ocean one is dealing with an area that is used by all seafaring countries of the world. One is then dealing with an area that is not only used by ships aimed at our own harbours in order to take on or off-load cargo here. Also, particularly since the closing of Suez, one is dealing with massive traffic, particularly that of tankers on the way to Europe around the tip of Africa. Here is a coastline of 2,000 miles and more that can be polluted in the case of some disaster or other.</p>

<p>With all the planning one can do&#x2014;and I take it that one learns something from every incident&#x2014;one still does not know precisely how and where the next disaster of this nature will occur. All one&#x2019;s planning and the knowledge one has gleaned can be manifestly insufficient when a disaster takes place under totally different circumstances. This has been proved in this particular case. It was not possible to make a sudden decision about what action had to be taken after the disaster occurred. Decisions had to be changed repeatedly as <span class="col_2213-2214" refersTo="page_1120"/>circumstances, the tides, the weather and other factors changed. One has therefore learned from the circumstances of this disaster that the field one must cover is a large one. In addition, the extent of the methods one can apply in such a case is also endless.</p>

<p>This matter also has another aspect, i.e. that it is an international problem, and that we must seek a solution together with other seafaring countries of the world. The hon. member for Simonstown also has an easy solution for this, i.e. that we should extend our territorial waters several miles out to sea.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I did not mention that today.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>I know what is going on in the hon. member&#x2019;s head; that is why I say that that is his kind of solution. The hon. member believes that matters that are international in scope can be dealt with so easily by just extending our territorial waters endlessly into the sea. Has the hon. member ever thought that the extension of our territorial waters depends on recognition from other countries whose ships sail along our coasts&#x003F; It also depends on our ability to enforce our authority in those territorial waters. The hon. member said here a moment ago that a frigate should have gone to the Wafra&#x2019;s aid. If we wanted to enforce authority in territorial waters ranging as far as the hon. member proposed they should, we would need ten times as many naval ships as we now have. I mention this matter to point out the difference between a responsible approach to a problem situation such as this, and an opportunistic, irresponsible approach. We are dealing here with a problem that affects the entire world. I believe that the only way open to us is to continue to seek co-operation with other countries in order to take united action against the problems created by the pollution of the sea.</p>

<p>Since tankers are becoming increasingly bigger, and there is the danger that a single shipwreck can cause that much more damage, I think the time has come for us to resort to extreme measures to obtain the co-operation of the greatest possible number of countries in the world. I want to point out again that the development of engine trouble, as in the case of the Wafra, is a phenomenon that can occur at any time to any ship or moving vehicle. A year ago, together with a few other hon. members in the House, I had the opportunity of standing on the deck of a brand new tanker of a quarter of a million tons which had had serious engine trouble on the day it had to leave the docks for a trial run. This delayed the tanker in the docks for another week, otherwise the same thing that has now occurred could have happened there. The increase of tank ships has already resulted in several collisions in European waters. They did not strike a reef or develop engine trouble; they collided with one another, consequently causing pollution and related problems. That is why I say that this matter can only be tackled in a responsible way if we link up on an international basis with everyone who has an interest in this matter.</p>

<p>I surely cannot neglect, on this occasion, to refer to the fact that the ship that is now implicated is flying the Liberian flag. To be sure, it is probably not a Liberian ship, because a large number of tankers plying the ocean carry the Liberian flag. I do not think that Liberia can afford them all. Liberia is not a country that is well-disposed to South Africa. It is a country that has on occasion instituted legal proceedings against South Africa at the World Court. Liberia is one of the countries opposed in particular to the supply of naval armaments and equipment to South Africa. The irony of the matter is that the South African Navy has the task of protecting the sea route around the Cape. In my opinion the protection of the sea route around the Cape does not only mean action in the case of open hostility, but also action such as that in the present case, the saving of human lives, regardless of origins or the countries from which the people come. Apart from human lives, efforts must also be made to protect property, and apart from property, help must be given to prevent the pollution of the coasts of South Africa from taking place. Here is preeminently an occasion on which the South African Navy and the Maritime Division of the Air Force played a role. Hon. members advocated here that they should play an even greater role. I want to express the hope that incidents such as this will cause responsible bodies in countries such as Liberia to think again about their attitude to South Africa, particular as seen in the light of our specific strategic role here.</p>

<p>I believe that although we were incidentally engaged in this debate when news arrived that the Wafra had been towed off <span class="col_2215-2216" refersTo="page_1121"/>the rocks, thanks to planned and purposeful action on the part of the Government, this debate has nevertheless served its purpose. But it did not succeed in the negative objects that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had in mind. I also believe that it will make our population aware of the great responsibility that rests at this time on the Government of the country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now heard three speakers from the Government side in this debate. I want to say immediately that nothing has yet been said by anyone of them that can dispel the apprehensions of this side of the House, the public at large and everybody who takes an interest in the welfare of the natural resources of our country, that the Government has not done anything but fail in this matter of the Wafra. It has in fact confirmed our beliefs. All the signs point to the fact that the Government, through inefficiency and lack of foresight at the top, was simply not equipped to handle the situation. Here I can say&#x2014;and I say it in the most heartfelt way&#x2014;that we can thank God that this ship has now been taken off the rocks.</p>

<p>We first listened to the hon. member for Swellendam, who started off by taking us on a sort of travelogue of his constituency. I thought it quite inappropriate. He then tried to comfort us all by telling us that the beaches yesterday were in a rather better condition than they had been last Monday. He told us that nature was helping to clean the sea or, as he put it, that the sea was beginning to clean itself.</p>

<p>Then we had the hon. the Minister who tried to assure us that everything possible had been done beforehand to ensure that the Government would be properly equipped to handle this sort of emergency. This hon. Minister was rather querulous when he asked us some questions. He asked, for instance, whether we felt that South Africa should be necessarily ahead of America in our techniques for combating oil pollution. He also pointed out that Agulhas was several hundred miles from Cape Town and several hundred miles from Port Elizabeth. He quoted from the <i>United States News and World Report</i> on the question of pollution. What the hon. the Minister did not tell us is that one of the American experts who was out here, a tanker expert, said that the Wafra need never have become stranded at all. That part he conveniently omitted to mention to this House. I think here we come to the real basis of the problem.</p>

<p>Then we had the hon. member for Stellenbosch, who tried to tell us that the problems were too complicated and too manifold for adequate arrangements to be made beforehand to combat manifestations of this sort. He told us about the varying tides. He told us about the variations in the weather. In fact, he told us a rather sorry tale of why this Government has dragged its heels so far. Let me put something to that hon. member and to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. We have been talking about the whole question of trying to avoid this type of stranding of a vessel and we have been talking too about trying to inhibit the consequences of any such stranding as much as possible. The field in which we should be looking to the future, and I wonder if the hon. member for Stellenbosch has heard about it, is civil defence.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, he sounds a bit surprised, but our civil defence is something, and everybody in the House knows it, to which this Government has given considerable attention. In doing so, it has had the overall support of the Opposition. Civil defence embraces many things. For instance, it covers the ability of our country to meet natural disasters, earthquakes, floods, or anything like that. It covers the entire country and any civil defence organization to be efficient, must be in a state of general preparedness all the time. Now, the hon. member for Stellenbosch has told us that this problem was too big to tackle. If this problem was too big to tackle, then we should never have attempted civil defence. This is just an illustration of the nonsense we have heard from the Government speakers in this debate.</p>

<p>There are a few further points at which this House might fruitfully look. What I want to say here is by way of summary, because most of the points have been touched by speakers before me. In the first place I think it should be remembered that this is not a problem which we are tackling all of a sudden, without any warning. As my hon. Leader has said when he introduced this motion, this is something of which this Government has been forewarned for four years, ever since the closure <span class="col_2217-2218" refersTo="page_1122"/>of the Suez Canal which caused the Cape route to become progressively the busiest tanker route in the world. There is another thing which is common cause and that is that this South-Eastern Cape seaboard is one of the roughest seaboards in the world. We know well enough that any ship that gets into distress on this seaboard has very little chance of survival unless assistance can be given speedily. We have also been given adequate notice and adequate warning of what can happen when an oil tanker goes aground. The Torrey Canyon is one example which has been heavily used in this House. The hon. member for Stellenbosch asked what could be learned from the stranding of the Torrey Canyon and he pointed to the fact that the various authorities concerned stumbled around for the best part of a week before anything was done. I trust that is not what he and his Government are trying to emulate in cases of the stranding of tankers on our shores.</p>

<p>What evidence do we have that this Government has heeded warnings which have come from us as the Official Opposition, the public, from people who have been concerned with disasters abroad, and from the near-disasters we ourselves have had, of which my colleague the hon. member for South Coast has mentioned a few&#x003F; What evidence have we that this Government has heeded these warnings and that it has tried to meet those pleas&#x003F; Here I should like to say that we in the Opposition are quite convinced that the Government officials who have been concerned with this situation at first-hand have done the very best they could to warn the Government about the dangers. We feel that theirs must have been a very frustrating job indeed. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs asked what should have been done that was not done. I trust that he is not telling us that another potential disaster of this nature can happen, perhaps with a tanker three or four times the size of the Wafra, and that the Government would be as ill-equipped to tackle the occurrence as it was in this case.</p>

<p>What seems quite clear is that we in this country need some efficient type of service modelled on the lines of the American coast guard and that is able to take speedy and efficient action in the case of any ship in distress. It must have high-powered and fast boats which will be capable of doing what the Russian tanker and the South African coaster tried to do in the case of the Wafra but did not succeed. I would suggest here that, in spite of what the hon. member for Stellenbosch said about the costs, the potential costs to this country of any serious disaster from the stranding of an oil tanker would be far Less than the cost of steps taken to prevent it. If we were to weigh up the one against the other we would come to one conclusion and one conclusion only, namely that prevention is not only better but probably cheaper than any cures afterwards. I support my hon. Leader in suggesting that this service should perhaps be undertaken by the South African Navy. I cannot think of any agency better equipped to handle this type of situation that we have in mind speedily and well. I think our Navy would be absolutely first-class for this job if it were given the sort of support it would need to carry it out.</p>

<p>There are other points as well which we could consider here this afternoon. In spite of the fact that the hon. member for Stellenbosch has told us that it is virtually impossible to do advance planning for contingencies of this nature I believe that it is quite possible not only to have advance plans to ensure that we are equipped, in the first place, to handle this type of emergency from the point of view of operations at sea, but also on the lines of civil defence preparedness to have some organization geared up to handle anything which might flow from it. Having heard of some of the shortfalls in organization that we have heard of this afternoon, the shortfall in communication, the shortage of walkie-talkie sets, the fact that radio telephone equipment had to be borrowed and the fact that there was an apparent shortage of small craft to divert to the scene of the stranding, I feel that not only must we have some central authority to handle incidents such as this and that this authority must be adequately equipped but I would go so far as to say that long ago we should have had full-scale rehearsals to meet this type of contingency. There is no reason whatever, if we can have rehearsals for matters involving civil defence, why we should not have full-scale dress rehearsals for something as important as this. I suggest too that had we had such rehearsals we would have seen just how many gaps there are in our organizations for combating this type of menace. We would have seen just how far short we fell in the matter of communications. I think we would have seen just what would have been needed in <span class="col_2219-2220" refersTo="page_1123"/>the way of small boats and as regards the general question of mobility to get detergents to the scene of disaster. I think, too, that some other matters would have come to light. One of them, for instance, is the apparent lack of communication between the authorities who were handling the Wafra affair and local authorities on the coast line whose towns are likely to be most affected by the oil slick.</p>

<p>Even on the question of road transportation we would not have been faced with problems such as that which apparently arose over the Road Transportation Board and its licence, had we dealt with the matter beforehand. All in all, I want to say that we on this side of the House are far from satisfied that the Government in the first place did nearly enough in the way of trying to prevent this sort of occurence. I want to say, too, that we are still highly dissatisfied about the machinery that should have been set up to deal efficiently with the menaces that flowed from the stranding.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when a country is hit by a disaster such as the one we have just experienced and a large oil tanker runs aground on the coast, it is an event that meets with very wide response, because there is a great deal of drama involved, and in this case more than one person also lost his life. We saw this in the many people who flocked to look at what had happened&#x2014;perhaps out of curiosity, perhaps out of interest. Many of us in this House and outside are really concerned about the beauty of our beaches and the marine and wild life that is adversely affected by such a disaster. I now just want to tell those people who have this matter at heart that this Government is deeply in sympathy with them. This Government has done more than any previous government to protect wild life, and it took many unpopular steps. On this occasion, if it was necessary, they would have done so again.</p>

<p>The fact is that the Wafra ran aground at Agulhas. I now ask: Could we have prevented that ship from running aground&#x003F;</p>

<p>I hear the hon. member for Simonstown, who normally makes a good contribution to proceedings in this House, remarking that we could have. I do not now want to congratulate him on his knowledge of it, because he would not like that, but I want to tell him that we could do as little to prevent it as the erstwhile Government could do to prevent the outbreak of the 1918 influenza epidemic in this country. [Laughter ] Yes, hon. members are laughing at that. I want to concede that it is perhaps a far-fetched comparison. But here people also knew of a pending disaster, and they were not able to prevent it. Every day there are 20 ships of that kind around our coast. To aim at having a watchdog for each of them in order to prevent anything going wrong is something beyond our capabilities. The United Party is now &#x201C;wise after the event&#x201D;. Now they are able to list all the things that could have happened. If we were to do everything that was proposed here this afternoon, we would have to have an omnipotence that is actually beyond our reach. The case of the Torrey Canyon is frequently mentioned, and I want to elaborate on that a little. That ship, as we all know, ran aground on the English coast and polluted the beaches with oil. By comparison with the length of our coast that of the English coast is very short indeed. In addition they have a maritime history probably covering more than a thousand years. And yet they, with all their ships, equipment and experience could not prevent the Torrey Canyon from running aground, and after it had done so they could not, with all their knowledge and experience, prevent their beaches from being polluted, to a much greater extent than in this case of ours. However, what strikes me most forcibly is that one did not hear of Englishmen speaking ill of their Government because the ship ran aground; one does not hear the English people saying that the Government could have prevented it. However, here in South Africa we must make politics of the matter became we have an Opposition that is not big enough to rise above politics and see this thing as a national disaster that must be prevented. I wonder whether, in this respect, we could not learn a little from the English. In any case, I should like to recommend it to the Opposition.</p>

<p>The Minister has elaborated sufficiently on the steps taken after the ship ran aground, and I want to congratulate them on what they did to prevent this threatening disaster. The damage that we did, in fact, suffer, we could not prevent. To everyone who had a hand in the affair and contributed to freeing the ship we want to say <span class="col_2221-2222" refersTo="page_1124"/>that we are relieved about it. I do not know whether the Opposition is also glad. To look at their faces it would appear to me as if they are a little sorry that a march has been stolen on them this time. They would surely had had a fine time of it if all the oil had gushed out and our coastline was so affected that one could not even walk on the beaches. If I think of the level of debating on their side I must believe this to be the case.</p>

<p>I represent a constituency bordering on that of Swellendam. In my constituency there are probably more than 100 miles of the loveliest beaches and good fishing areas. A disaster would therefore most seriously affect us. Having had this disaster, we must regard it as a study case. We can now determine how we can remove oil that has washed up on to the beaches by covering it with straw and then setting the straw alight. We can see whether we achieve anything by digging ditches in the sand and trying to lead the oil off into those ditches. We can now determine the most suitable substances to spray on to the oil on the water, and in the course of time research can be undertaken to determine the substances that are the safest in order to prevent the people handling them from burning themselves. When we have made a study of this, and made a thorough study of the measures that were so efficient here and that the Opposition is actually sorry about, we shall be able to apply them very profitably to cases that are unavoidably going to take place in the future.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>The problem of oil pollution is, of course, a tremendous one. It is a terrible thing, as a man like Thor Heyerdahl, the North Sea explorer, saw that 40 per cent of the ocean has already been polluted by oil, and if we want a solution to this problem I think it will have to be tackled on an international scale. The countries involved in that&#x2014;I want to sum it up briefly&#x2014;are in the first place those who purchase the oil. It is in their interests that the oil should be delivered to them safely. In this case it is specifically tragic that the oil tanker was coming here to South Africa and that we would have used that oil in the normal course of events. Many of us would have been using that oil in our motor cars in a month or so Secondly there are the countries that sell the oil. They have just as much of an interest, because they receive the money, in ensuring that the oil is delivered safely to its destination. Thirdly there are the owners of the oil tankers If a proper investigation were to be instituted, I wonder whether we would find this ship that ran aground at Agulhas to have been seaworthy. We attach very great importance to the fact that our motor cars on our roads should be roadworthy. A while ago we had the case on the East Coast of a ship simply breaking in half, and I think the time has come for ships to have licences certifying that they are seaworthy before they take on oil or are allowed to sail round the coast.</p>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>If we examine the general statement the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made in his criticism, it actually and basically amounts to three specific points. He actually did so in the form of rhetorical questions. He asked whether there were sufficient measures in readiness to combat such a problem; secondly he asked what was done in the specific cases to neutralize the effects, and thirdly what we were going to do in the future. It is very clear, in spite of the fact that several members opposite took part in this debate, that no real or fundamental criticism was actually forthcoming. I want to say at once that the hon. member for Simonstown was probably so busy tackling local authorities on Friday in order to determine whether they had been given any specific instructions, that he could not give much attention to his work here. Sir, one must immediately ask oneself whether criticism from hon. members opposite was not specifically replied to by the fact that the collective endeavours at handling this problem situation had succeeded; is the most effective reply to that criticism not specifically the fact that the endeavours at towing the Wafra from the rocks succeeded, and must we then not preferably adopt a positive standpoint by saying that we must congratulate this Department and everyone concerned with the matter on the co-ordination of their particular efforts at averting a tragedy. But, Sir, let us go further. If the hon. member for Simonstown would take the trouble to find, on his own initiative, the replies to the questions he put to the hon. the Minister, he would immediately discover that the recommendations of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of Prof. Mallory, to which he referred, is not stored away <span class="col_2223-2224" refersTo="page_1125"/>somewhere on a shelf, but that consideration has been given to the recommendations and that positive steps were taken not only to implement the recommendations that could be implemented, but also to really handle the wide scope of the problem. Sir, what hon. members apparently forget is that we are a relatively small country as far as the population is concerned, but we have one of the longest coastlines, i.e. 2,000 miles, where these problems can crop up. If there is criticism about preventive steps that were not taken I would have expected hon. members opposite to make positive suggestions about how this could be done, because it is obvious, as far as this problem is concerned, that there are preventive measures that can be taken, but that subsequently, after the disaster has occurred, there are steps that must be taken to combat the situation. But what has happened in respect of the report to which the hon. member for Simonstown referred&#x003F; Let me begin by saying this right away, that Mr. Stander of the Department of Sea Fisheries made a special contribution in drawing up and writing that report, something that I think should be recognized in this House. The first recommendation was to the effect that a general action committee should be inaugurated. But after discussions with Prof. Mallory, and apart from those specific recommendations, another step was taken that is more efficient, i.e. five such committees were established at five decentralized points, i.e. Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Walvis Bay. It is very clear that considering the extensiveness of the geographic area that must be served, the five action committees could work much more efficiently than one committee. The second recommendation concerned a scientific and technical research committee. It was not left at that, because once again the Department held discussions with the C.S.I.R. and also with the University of Cape Town in respect of the research that is going to take place, and the net result was that in respect of the University of Cape Town alone, an estimated R1.5 million had to be spent just to establish the institution, and that was done. The hon. member will surely understand that even if those specific recommendations were accepted, and if the arrangements could have been made with the University of Cape Town alone, it would in any case not have been possible to complete the erection of those buildings at this stage. I mention this just to point out that in this specific case the recommendations were not summarily dismissed or simply shelved. But I just want to make this specific point that although one could establish an organization, one would still be under the illusion if one thought that it is possible to patrol this 2,000 mile coast line in order to take preventive measures, and that is important. It is true that in respect of this specific case the costs of the handling, combating or prevention of further detrimental effects already costs R750,000, the spray R600,000 the tug R72,000 the incendiary material R40,000, the aircraft about R20,000 and the administrative costs of the ships about R10,000.</p>

<p>I want to allege, in conclusion, that in respect of what can be done with the available information, and bearing in mind that the circumstances involved in such occurrences differ from time to time, it is not possible to find a single or a simple solution. I want to point out that even big countries with tremendous capabilities, such as America, are only beginning with research at this stage. There are very clear indications that in spite of research it is never possible to prevent such occurrences by action that is identical in all circumstances. It goes without saying that what is true for the Agulhas coastline and the conditions there, is not necessarily true in respect of another place. That is why research can actually be better aimed at handling the results of such occurrences, rather than at preventing the occurrences themselves. I want to say at once that I think the hon. the Minister, his Department and the officials who were working on the project, deserve the praise of this House and of the community in general for the particularly circumspect way they handled this situation. There is much more at stake than a mere instant solution, and the fact of getting a ship off the rocks or out of the sand. That is why I want to emphasize that in this specific case we must actually extend a word of praise for the actions of this Department and its officials. I want to go further.</p>

Those hon. members are disposed towards exploiting problem situations in the country <span class="col_2225-2226" refersTo="page_1126"/>for a little unsavoury political publicity. And this does not only apply in respect of the Wafra. It is also true of anything that adversely affects our population. Those hon. members are even prepared to exploit the drought in order to get at the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. I think it is reprehensible that not a single hon. member who spoke said that although they did not approve of all the steps taken, they nevertheless admit that timely action was taken in this specific case. The hon. members simply do not do this. When one listens to hon. members it seems as if they basically want to suggest that along the entire 2,000 mile coastline we must have enough ships available with which to tow other ships. I just want to tell hon. members that they are now being taken in tow after the Wafra&#x2019;s has been towed off the rocks.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In this Bill Parliament is requested to vote additional funds for the services of the Republic for the financial year ending on the 31st March, 1971. In the Appropriation Act of 1970, a total amount of R2,666,234,000 was voted. Now a further R60,064,548 is being requested, namely R36,597,721 on the Revenue Account, R13,886,300 on the Loan Account, R3,558,000 on the Bantu Education Account and R6,022,527 on the South-West Africa Account.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the total amount required is less than half the amount of R127.6 million requested in the Additional Estimates for the preceding financial year. In fact, this is the lowest amount requested <span class="col_2227-2228" refersTo="page_1127"/>in the Additional Estimates for the past few financial years, I believe, therefore, that the Government&#x2019;s appeal to Government Departments to restrict departmental expenditure has had a positive result.</p>

<p>Of the amount of nearly R36.6 million on the Revenue Account, more than R9.5 million has to be provided for the provinces as statutory and extra-statutory subsidies. I am glad to say that the investigation into a new subsidy basis has been completed and that a White Paper in this regard will be tabled during the course of this session.</p>

<p>A further R4.9 million is required on Vote&#x2014;Agricultural Economics and Marketing: General. Of this amount more than R4.6 million is for subsidies payable under the different drought relief schemes.</p>

<p>An amount of just over R4.5 million is required on Vote&#x2014;Bantu Administration and Development. Nearly R3.6 million of this amount is for the South African Bantu Trust Fund.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the House will have noted that on the Loan Account an additional amount of R13,886,300 is requested. Of this amount, R10 million is for transfer to the Railway and Harbour Fund to cover expenditure which has already been authorized by this House. The R3.25 million requested on Loan Vote&#x2014;Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is in respect of loan assistance to farmers, mainly as a result of drought conditions.</p>

<p>An additional amount of R3,558,000 is requested on the Bantu Education Account. The amount includes nearly R1.8 million as financial assistance to University Colleges and more than R1 million as a grant-in-aid to the South African Bantu Trust Fund.</p>

<p>The total amount of R6,022,527 requested on the South-West Africa Account includes R3.77 million on Vote&#x2014;Agricultural Economics and Marketing. Of this amount R3.22 million is in respect of subsidies payable under drought relief schemes. On Vote&#x2014;Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure R1.45 million is required as loan assistance to farmers.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that the House will not expect any further details at this stage. As is customary, my colleagues will be prepared during the Committee Stage to answer any questions which hon. members may want to ask. I am satisfied that the services for which these amounts are requested, are urgently required in the interest of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a committee of inquiry has been appointed to investigate the operations of the South African Road Safety Council. I was under the impression that too much money was voted for this council and that they would ask for a reduction. However, I notice in this report that an additional amount of R21,500 is voted for the South African Road Safety Council. I will be glad if the hon. the Minister would kindly explain to us what this additional amount is needed for.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to point out that the contribution to the funds of the South African Road Safety Council is being voted as a column 2 item. In this regard we are requesting that an additional amount of R21,500 be made available. The original estimate for the Road Safety Council for the year 1970-&#x2019;71 was R767,900, of which amount the contribution of the Central Government came to R339,500 as against the R250,000 in the previous year. It was in fact with a view to the investigation into the activities of the council that the Treasury was not prepared to approve the original amount that was requested. However, we were faced <span class="col_2229-2230" refersTo="page_1128"/>with the problem that in the meantime provision had to be made for the essential salary increases, which are also applicable to the Road Safety Council. Secondly, after the Road Safety Council had had to give notice to quit certain buildings which were rented at 7.1 cents per square foot, they had to rent new office space at 17 cents per square foot. In other words, the <i>status quo</i> had to be maintained while the commission of inquiry was engaged in its task. Therefore, this is essential additional expenditure.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during 1969 the Durban telephone system was taken over by the Post Office at a previously agreed price of R18,800,000. It was decided that payment should be effected by means of a cash payment of R3 million and a transfer to the City Council of R15,800,000 long-term Government stock. Although negotiable, the council was precluded from disposing of the stock without the prior consent of the Treasury. During 1970-&#x2019;71 authority was granted for the disposal of stock to the value of R5 million and there was a balance left of R10.8 million in Government stock, which was not negotiable at that moment. As hon. members know, since 1970 the interest rate on Government stock has increased considerably with a resultant decrease in the market value of the council&#x2019;s holding of the long-term stock. Following representations by the council, the Treasury decided that, as it was the intention that the holding of Government stock should be realized in instalments, the Public Debt Commissioners should purchase the remaining long-term stock and give the council certain short-term stocks maturing over the next four years in exchange. Due to the increase in the interest pattern, however, disposing of the long-term stock would result in a capital loss of R1,432,150 which could not be borne by the Public Debt Commissioners. It was consequently decided that the Government should accept the responsibility for this loss and provision is therefore being made to refund the amount in question to the Public Debt Commissioners by means of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. The whole thing boils down to this: Due to the rise in interest rates, the value of the stock that was paid for this telephone system has dropped and the long-term stock was taken over by the Public Debt Commissioners in exchange for short-term stock. The Government then decided to refund to the Public Debt Commissioners what they have lost on the long-term stock.</p>

As a result of the increase in salaries for the Government employees, all the salaries of the provincial servants <span class="col_2231-2232" refersTo="page_1129"/>also had to be increased.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pinetown must know that these things are really involved. These figures all relate to the undistributed profit tax. The hon. member knows that certain private companies have to pay undistributed profits tax unless they declare sufficient dividends within a specified period. The specified period is usually a year, ending six months after the specified date. In these 12 months they have to pay out the dividends which they receive. Otherwise they have to pay undistributed profits tax on the dividends. It often happens as it did in these two cases, that they have paid out all their dividends they received, but they have not paid out the dividends in the specified period; they did so either just too early or too late. In these cases they paid out the dividends too early in other words, before the specified period. They have paid out their dividends, but not within the specified period. Seeing that they have complied with the spirit of the law and paid out their dividends, we feel that it was only right that the undistributed profits tax for which they became technically liable should be refunded to them. This was the case in both cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to ask the Minister of Agriculture what Item P, assistance to pineapple industry, comprises.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture, the reply to the question of the hon. member is as follows. During October, 1970, the Cabinet approved the rendering of financial assistance to the amount of R250,000 to producers in the Eastern Province who produced pineapples for canning, so as to enable them to continue their production. Owing to serious drought conditions over the past few years, the crops were not only smaller, but also of poorer quality, with the result that prices which factories were prepared to pay were not sufficient to cover production costs. The basis on which assistance will be rendered, is R2 per ton for the quantity delivered to canning factories between 1st September, 1969, and 31st August, 1970 The quantity of pineapples concerned is estimated to be 125,000 tons. At R2 per ton the total amount is therefore R250,000. Owing to the difficult position in which the pineapple producers found themselves as a result of the decrease in the payments to canners after the devaluation of sterling, and also owing to drought conditions which had a detrimental influence on the products, and including also stricter grading on intake by canners, assistance to the amount of R240,000 was also rendered to the industry during 1969-&#x2019;70.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the <span class="col_2233-2234" refersTo="page_1130"/>Minister of Agriculture, I should like to furnish the reply to this question. Various properties for the purposes of the P. K le Roux Dam were purchased by this Department. In many cases, the properties of the owners were purchased in full, that is those sections situated above the controlling line of the Department of Water Affairs and which therefore no longer comprise viable farming units. It is the policy to lease per tender, on a temporary basis, those parts which lie above the controlling line and which will therefore not be required for the dam basin as such, until such time as this land can be finally disposed of. Since tenders for the rental of this land were called for, the grazing has deteriorated drastically as a result of the persistent drought, as the hon. member of course knows. The lessees in question consequently addressed representations to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture for a decrease in rentals because they were obliged to decrease the number of their stock drastically. On 21st December, 1970, the Treasury, after a submission in regard to this matter, approved of the rentals of 21 lessees being reduced by 50 per cent for the period 1st April, 1970, to 31st December, 1970, which resulted in a net loss for the State. However, this approval is subject to the prior authorization of Parliament being obtained.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this additional expenditure was primarily the result of events last year in Lesotho. It was then deemed advisable that South African officials who were working in Lesotho and who had been seconded to the Government of Lesotho, would with their families go and stay outside Lesotho temporarily. This of course gave rise to additional expenditure. Over and above this expenditure, there was also other technical assistance to a small amount which was not foreseen and for which provision had to be made in these Additional Estimates. The hon. member will realize that when an amount such as this is estimated, it consists mostly of approximations. The fact that more was requested than was estimated, is in fact encouraging.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the amount which South Africa contributes to the U.N.O., as it appears annually in the Estimates, is based on an approximation. The final figure is only worked out much later in the year. I must point out that the U.N.O. also has an additional appropriation The original figure is therefore an estimate every year. In this particular case the estimate was R14,000 too little, taking into account the amount withheld by the Government. We refuse, for example, to support certain items financially. There is the expenditure incurred at the time in regard to the Congo, the so-called &#x201C;bond issue&#x201D;. Then we also refused to contribute our <i>pro rata</i> estimated share to the costs incurred by excessive visits to Africa by subcommittees of the U.N.O. and expenditure incurred by the Public Information Office of U.N.O., which distributes propaganda against South Africa.</p>

<p>This R75,000 is for the subsidization of workshops for the blind, and represents the increased allowances given to the Care of the Blind as well as to the instructors. As far as the allowance for the blind is concerned, the position is that it was last determined in 1950. We have not received any representations since then, but in 1969 the Council for the Care of the Blind requested an increase in the allowances payable to the blind workers in the existing eight factories. We then submitted it to the Treasury and the Treasury agreed on 28th April, 1970, that these allowances could be increased. Then it also represents salary increases to the instructors. The salaries of the instructors were last increased in 1966, and here, too, it was felt that it would be appropriate to increase their salaries. Then there is in addition a third group that received an increase, and this is the ordinary non-classified worker at such a factory, workers such as artisans, truck drivers and casual labourers. They last received an increase in 1950. The amount which is being requested here is in respect of salary increases in these three groups.</p>

<p>This amount of R9,000 actually consists of a few items. There is, firstly, an increase of R6,000 as a result of official overseas visits by the Assistant Works Manager and two foremen to make a study of a new stamp printing machine. Ministerial approval was obtained for that. Then there is an increase of R5,000 consisting, in the first place, of an increase in the rate payable for Government motor vehicle transport; Treasury approval was obtained for this. A further reason for the increase is the fact that mass consignments of printed materials consigned per rail to the post office stores and other State departments, which was previously collected by the South African Railways at the Government Printing Works, was, with effect from 1st July, 1970, transported per motor truck to Pretoria environs, and the other ordinary consignments, the volume of which is too small to be fetched <i>en masse</i> by the Railways at the Government Printing Works, are consequently also transported in this way to the goods shed at Visagiekraal. Then there is an item which amounts to a decrease as a result of an over-estimate in the deliveries of printed material and paper to the post office store at Koedoespoort. There was an overestimate of R2,000. This, then, is the total of R9,000.</p>

<p>Item D also consists of quite a number of items which I should like to explain. There is an item of R57,500, and this is as a result of an increase in the printing costs, mainly due to the increasing costs of printing materials, particularly paper supplied by the same company previously mentioned, Sappi, in terms of the contract which came into operation with effect from 1st April, 1970. Then there is an increase of R500 as a result of the urgent necessity to advertise the vacancies for perforating machine operators in order to cope with the hiatus caused by the resignation of artisans in the setting works division. Then there are two items which jointly comprise R62,000. The first of those items is the increase in printing costs as a result of salary increases. The hon. member knows that with effect from 1st January, 1971, there was an increase of salaries of public servants. Then there was, in terms of a new industrial agreement for printers in the newspaper industry, another increase as from 1st January, 1971. Then there was an increase in the weekly bonus payable to factory staff, for which Treasury authorization was obtained on 10th December, 1970. I have already mentioned to you the salary increases of public servants. In addition there was the increase in costs of the <i>Gazette</i> printed on contract with effect as from 1st January, 1971, and this all together represents an amount of R62,000. The total is R120,000,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to know from the Minister why there is such a big payment under H in respect of <i>ex gratia</i> assistance to Bantu. Where do the extra needy Bantu come from&#x003F; Also, why is there such a big amount under N for grants-in-aid for the S.A. Bantu Trust&#x003F; Is that for the anticipated purchase of land&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>As far as subhead H is concerned, it relates to a new approach to drawing up the Estimates. I can furnish the details thus. In drawing up the draft estimates for 1970-&#x2019;71, during October 1969, the number of pensioners for the four reconstituted territorial authorities which would, on 1st April, 1970, convert to the new financing pattern, and the remaining number of non-activated authorities in White areas, had to be determined, so that the necessary division of the financial provision for this service between subhead H <span class="col_2241-2242" refersTo="page_1134"/>and subhead N could be made. At that stage proper statistics were not available. Owing to a lack of statistics, it was not possible to make an accurate division between these two heads, and it subsequently appeared that the amount requested under subhead H was R500,000 too little, while a corresponding excessive amount was requested under subhead N. However, the provision under the two subheads in question was pruned to an amount of R500,000 by the Department of Finance, which brought the defacit under subhead H up to R1 million. In view of the fact that the payment of benefits under the subhead takes place on a statutory basis, it was not possible to apply effective economizing measures, and that is why it is necessary to classify this amount of R904,000, where the original estimate was for R1 million, just the other way around, and this R904,000, is now being requested. The hon. member will realize that no economizing is possible with <i>ex gratia</i> assistance and pensions which have to be paid if these people qualify. That is as far as subhead H is concerned.</p>

<p>At the same time the next point was raised, and I shall explain that as well. The amount involved here is R3,595,000. There was a new approach here too, and in this case the position is that the Department of Health is now attending to health services on a contractual basis for the Department of Bantu Administration. Previously this was done by the Department of Health and by the four provinces, and each played a part in these health services. Provision was initially made, but it was difficult to determine this precisely for the estimate because these different bodies do not have accurate statistics. In this way provision was made for R24 million. Subsequently it appeared that other inevitable costs had also been incurred, which it was not possible to foresee when the estimate was being drawn up.</p>

<p>I just want to mention a few of them so that the hon. member can see what it is all about. The first is the question of salary improvements for medical staff. With effect from 1st April, 1970, increases were granted to non-White staff and the general salary adjustments of White and non-White staff came into operation with effect from 1st January, 1971. Then there are amounts which have to be included which I should also like to elucidate. There is the vacation savings bonus which now accrues to certain numbers of Bantu staff, which was not previously paid. There is the creation of more posts in the establishment of the Department of Health, for which no provision was made. It was not possible to foresee that the Department of Health, with the takeover of this service, was going to require that extra staff, and it was not budgeted for. There was an expansion of the subsidy scheme whereby skimmed milk powder was supplied to Bantu authorities to combat nutritional deficiency diseases. With the takeover of health services by the South African Bantu Trust, the basis of the subsidization of mission hospitals was changed. A new basis now applies in that regard. They are now being financed according to the difference between revenue and expenditure. This has necessitated a considerable greater appropriation. The same also applies in regard to the combating of tuberculosis. The general expenditure of the revenue Vote &#x201C;Health&#x201D; had to be divided between the Department of Health and the S.A. Bantu Trust. The general expenditure and specific expenditure of the Trust Fund had to be sorted out, and each had to receive their own portion. It has now become apparent that provision for certain services under the subhead of the Revenue Vote &#x201C;Health&#x201D; was erroneously made, with the result that a saving of approximately R1 million can be expected under the latter subhead with a corresponding deficit in the South African Bantu Trust fund.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not really an error. It was requested under the wrong head. It was requested under the head &#x201C;Health&#x201D; instead of under the head &#x201C;South African Bantu Trust&#x201D;. We could not at that stage say precisely which amounts which were being spent in respect of tuberculosis had to be supplied out of the South African Bantu Trust.</p>

<p>As in the case of tuberculosis, we have to a great extent the same problem in regard to contagious diseases. The Bantu Trust Fund must now pay, while the Department of Health and other Departments previously paid the overall amount. Now the Trust had to obtain proper statistics from each one. However, these statistics were not available. The provision which was made, appeared to be insufficient. An additional amount now has to be requested. <span class="col_2243-2244" refersTo="page_1135"/>These are all the points which relate to the amount of R3,595,000.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The position here is as follows. There are various subheads under which the amount of R3&#x00BD; million is being requested. The first is subhead A&#x2014;salaries, wages and allowances, R94,000. This increase is attributable quite simply to the adjustment in salaries of Bantu teachers with effect from 1st April, 1970. It also includes the payment of vacation savings bonuses to Bantu employees, in terms of Public Service Notice No. 5/6/5 of 13th January, 1971. It is therefore merely a consequential expenditure, about which nothing can be done.</p>

<p>In regard to subhead E&#x2014;subsidies, R176,000, the explanation is exactly the same. An additional amount was requested in respect of salary adjustments for Bantu teachers, with effect from 1st April, 1970, and 1st January, 1971, as well as vacation savings bonuses payable in terms of Public Service Notice No. 5/6/5 of 13th January, 1971.</p>

<p>Then there is subhead M&#x2014;financial assistance to university colleges, R423,000. I may as well furnish the hon. member with full details in this regard. It is for additional funds required by the universities, as follows: the University of Fort Hare, R237,000. I shall explain in a moment what this is for. The University of Zululand receives R98,000. This I shall also explain. Then, the University of the North receives R88,000. This then gives a total of R423,000 for subhead M. The R237,000 for Fort Hare comprises the following items. Firstly, there is flood damage, R6,500. The flood damage was as a result of the recent floods. Secondly, there is salaries R149,000. These increased salaries were payable to teaching staff as from 1st April, 1970, in terms of Public Service Notice No. 169G-22 of 1st October, 1969, and Treasury approval dated 23rd February, 1970. This was estimated at R149,000. Is that what the hon. member wanted&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the Department is giving a lot.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but we are compelled to do so. In addition there is subsistence and transport &#x2014;this is still under Fort Hare&#x2014;R17,000. The explanation for this is that owing to the isolated situation of the University, the transportation of students creates a problem. The University has only one old and unreliable vehicle, which has been in use for a long time, at its disposal. This has already given rise to displeasure among the students. It was essential that the bus be replaced. This represents the amount of R17,000. Then there is printing work, R11,500. As a result of a large number of vacancies and the creation of new posts which had to be advertised, the expenditure incurred on these advertisements was more than was originally estimated. This represents the amount of R11,500. Then there is an amount of R7,500 for diverse expenditure and an amount of R45,000 for supplies and services. This then gives the total amount of R237,000 for Fort Hare.</p>

<p>For the University of Zululand there is an amount of R98,000. The amount consists of the following: Salaries, R45,000. The same explanation applies here as the one I furnished a moment ago in respect of Fort Hare, and also applies with effect <span class="col_2245-2246" refersTo="page_1136"/>from April, 1970. Then there is an amount of R53,000 for supplies and services. The explanation for that is as follows: As a result of the great increase in the number of students and the backlog in respect of equipment in the various faculties, which has been building up over the past few years, the University finds it impossible to cover expenditure by means of the appropriated funds.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the University of the North. There, R74,000 is required for salaries, R5,000 for subsistence and transport and R9,000 for diverse expenditure. This gives a total of R88,000. The hon. member asked me for an explanation in respect of the total additional amount which must be made available, namely R3 558,000, and I have now furnished him with the full explanation. The additional amount of R148,000 which is being requested under subhead N&#x2014;Provision for retirement benefits&#x2014;is attributable to the salary adjustments with effect from 1st January, 1971. This is a consequential obligation. The amount of R1,097,000 which is being requested under subhead O&#x2014;Grantin-aid to the S.A. Bantu Trust Fund&#x2014;is made up as follows: Vacation Savings Bonus&#x2014;R854,000, in respect of which the same explanation I gave a moment ago in regard to the Public Service Commission notice applies. An amount of R243,000 is required for the Tswana Territorial Authority, as a result of four new secondary and primary schools opened at the beginning of January, 1971, at Mabopane to accommodate the children of the large number of Bantu who have been resettled in Mabopane. No provisions has been made for the equipment of the schools, the salaries of teachers and the adjustment of salaries of Bantu teachers with effect from 1st April, 1970, nor for the general adjustment of salaries with effect from 1st January, 1971. The additional amount of R854,000 is made up as follows: Ciskei&#x2014;R204,000; Tswanaland &#x2014; R263,000; Vendaland &#x2014; R72,000; Matshangana Territorial Authority&#x2014;R63,000; Lebowa&#x2014;R249,000 and Basuto bo Borwa Territorial Authority&#x2014; R9,000. That is the complete explanation for this additional amount.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the position is that the various university staffs are not all of an equal size. It is therefore not inevitable that this amount will be the same for one university as for another. Therefore, the amount for Fort Hare is larger because the staff position is such that it has made a larger amount necessary there than for the other universities.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the number of personnel of Fort Hare is not so much greater than in the other universities. We received figures in this regard, but unfortunately I do not have them here with me now. However, there is no comparison whatsoever on the figures given by the hon. the Deputy Minister. He for instance said that an additional amount of R98,000 is to be voted for education purposes in Zululand. That is the total amount for Bantu education there and not only for increases, as compared to the R194,000 voted for increases in salaries only at Fort Hare. There does not seem to be any comparison.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in my reply to the hon. member I pointed out that two increases were granted. On 1st October, 1969, an increase <span class="col_2247-2248" refersTo="page_1137"/>in salaries had already been granted. With effect from 1st April, 1970, an increase was also granted, and a further increase was granted on 23rd February, 1971. The great difference in these amounts is therefore attributable to the size of the staff of the University of Fort Hare and the fact that at Fort Hare specifically two salary increases were granted. The position is simply that all universities, as far as this matter is concerned, are not all treated alike. We receive representations from Fort Hare in respect of the position. According to the representations before us, it was the correct thing to do and that is why it was done in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the additional amount of R44,500 is the deficit which remained in spite of certain savings which were effected. As hon. members know, the State Attorney incurs legal expenses on behalf of all departments and departmental bodies. What the number of cases will be and what the expenses involved will be are, of course, completely unpredictable and indeterminable. As it happened, we had quite a few major cases in the past year. These include, <i>inter alia,</i> the Agliotti case which cost R36,633. Incidentally, that saved us R5 million. [Interjections.] Then there was the case of <i>Von During</i> v. <i>Agricultural Credit</i> which cost R22,710. In addition there was the case of <i>Glenvista</i> v. <i>the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure</i> and that cost R13.970. There was also the case of <i>Motor Columbus</i> v. <i>The Department of Water Affairs</i> which cost R32,300. There is another case pending, i.e. that of <i>Rainbow Chickens v. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services. These are only a few of them.</i></p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PRISONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the increase of R853,000 on the original estimate of R8,470,000 is attributable to an increase in costs. The department naturally buys an enormous quantity of supplies. Supplies have become more expensive. The amount is being asked for supplies and services. As far as services are concerned, an amount of R53,000 is mainly attributable to the increase in medical costs. Moreover, enormous quantities of supplies, such as blankets, beds, mattresses, pillows, sheets, spades, picks, and many others, are, of course bought for the department. All these things contributed to the increase on this item.</p>

The increase relates to no particular or extraordinary item of expenditure&#x2014;it relates purely to normal increases of cost.

<p>If he is interested in this, of course, it is a different matter. Hon. members do not realize what the position is as regards a prison service. In the prison service all prisoners receive free medical treatment. If necessary, they are treated by specialists or they are treated in private nursing homes, which costs an enormous amount of money. In addition to that, the staff, too, normally receives free treatment. If they require treatment by a specialist, they pay one-seventh. This is one of their conditions of service. Throughout the years this has been the position. Now there has been an increase in medical fees of between 20 and 25 per cent&#x2014;this has given rise to the amount of R530,000 out of the total amount of R853,000, which I have mentioned here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to furnish the following explanation on behalf of the Minister: This has to do with quartzite mined by the Divisional Council. The following is a full explanation of the case: The remainder of erf No. 590, Bethelsdorp, Division of Port Elizabeth, was registered, from 1949 to 9th August, 1966, in the name of the Divisional Council of Port Elizabeth by whom it was administered under a separate account as a local area for occupation by non-Whites. The title deed on the land contains a condition regarding all minerals in respect of the State. On 9th June, 1969, it came to the notice of the Mine Commissioner, Barkly West, in whose mining district the above mentioned land is situated, that the Divisional Council, up to 17th May, 1965, was mining a quarry on the land, from which altogether 561,507&#x00BD; cubic yards of quartzite were removed. This action was irregular because the Divisional Council neither had any authority from the Department of Mines to that effect nor had it complied with the prescribed legal requirements. However, everything pointed to the fact that the Divisional Council acted entirely in good faith and the removal of the quartzite took place as long ago as prior to 17th May, 1965. On 10th August, 1966, the land in question was transferred to the City Council of Port Elizabeth subject to the same conditions in regard to minerals, and on that date the accounts and surplus funds were handed over to the city council. In the case in question the Minister of Mines indicated on 15th January, 1970, that royalties amounting to <i>2</i>&#x00BD; cents per cubic yard of quartzite removed would be a reasonable amount to be paid to the State in respect of royalties, and on this basis the Department of Mines endeavoured to recover the amount of R14,037.68 from the Divisional Council.</p>

<p>However, the Divisional Council advanced as an argument the fact that it was not in a position to pay this amount since it had administered the land in question under a special account and was legally compelled to plough back the income it had derived from the land into the area in the interests of the non-White inhabitants. The Department has no reason to presume that this was not actually done. Secondly, the accounts and surplus funds were handed over to the City Council of Port Elizabeth on 10th October, 1966. Whether a portion of this income was derived from the quarry situated on the land is impossible to say. Thirdly, if the Divisional Council were forced to refund this amount, it would necessarily have to do so out of the pockets of the other ratepayers who never enjoyed any benefit from the exploitation of the quarry in question. After discussions which took place between the Treasury and the Deputy State Attorney, Cape, the former decided on 17th April, 1971, under his reference B.10/2/4, to approve the <i>ex gratia</i> remission of the royalties which were due, i.e. subject to confirmation by this House.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The explanation I have here on behalf of the hon. the Minister is as follows: It does not seem to me as if the explanation furnishes the particulars about the mines. Since the beginning of the year the running costs in the gold-mining industry have shown an appreciable increase over the accepted gradual increase. This increase was to some extent neutralized by the slight increase in gold premium receipts. Both these factors have a considerable effect on the amount which can be claimed in terms of the statutory tax credit formula. This is the only explanation I have here.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The information which I have here on behalf of the Minister is as follows: The anticipated excess on this subhead is estimated at R1,730,000, but in view of the fact that it is expected that R1,019,000 can be met from savings on other subheads of the Vote, only the balance of R711,000 requires appropriation in the Additional Estimates. The major portion of the anticipated excess appears on the first three items, namely, medical services (fees and allowances), medicines and dressings (or allowances <i>in lieu)</i> and surgical appliances. The exceptionally high estimated deficit is attributable to the following factors: (a) Up to the 31st March, 1969 the Provincial Administrations accepted financial responsibility for the medical treatment of indigent residents in old-age homes in the larger centres of the Republic, but as from the 1st April, 1969 this responsibility was taken over by the Department, and the provision on the second item of the subhead was specially increased by an amount of R200,000 in terms of Treasury authority dated 31st January, 1969. However, due to the late submission of accounts by pharmacies and the Transvaal Pharmaceutical Society, in the latter instance owing to acute staff difficulties, and the fact that all the old-age homes did not immediately and fully avail themselves of these facilities, a saving of R350,000 was effected on this item during the 1969-&#x2019;70 financial year. From 1st April, 1970, an amount of R600,000 was transferred from the second item to Subhead 10 of Vote 27, Bantu Administration and Development, in respect of the medical treatment of Bantu indigents residing in the Bantu homelands. It now appears that the amount transferred was over-estimated to the extent of R200,000. In view of the fact that medical practitioners are loath to accept appointments as part-time district surgeons at a fixed salary and an inclusive drug allowance, the department is reluctantly compelled to utilize the services of private practitioners in an ever-increasing number of vacant district surgeoncies. As such practitioners are remunerated at tariffs applicable to medical aid societies and the medicines prescribed are obtained from pharmacies, the cost to the department is considerably more than it would have been had the services been rendered by part-time district surgeons and the medicines supplied out of their drug allowance. In several instances these private practitioners are the former incumbents of the vacant district surgeons&#x2019; posts and at many centres the cost to the department has more than doubled. Full-time district surgeons including locos tenentes employed on a session basis against vacant posts in all the big centres and part-time district surgeons in certain areas issued prescriptions on local chemists for the supply of the bulk <span class="col_2257-2258" refersTo="page_1142"/>of medicines and dressings required by indigent patients. Part-time district surgeons in receipt of an inclusive drug allowance are also permitted to issue prescriptions in respect of expensive drugs required by indigent chronic patients receiving treatment at home or elsewhere outside hospitals. In the treatment of indigents, district surgeons are increasingly using the latest and more effective remedies, but owing to the high cost of such remedies the expenditure reflects a continuous rise. Furthermore, the rising cost of medicines and drugs and the increasing demand for these services by indigents accounts for a considerable portion of the increased expenditure. It is unfortunately not possible to curtail these services. As the result of the further increase in the tariff of fees, the cost of dental services rendered to indigents has also increased considerably.</p>

<p>This is, of course, the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of National Education, but in terms of the Appropriation Act of 1970 my department continues to be finally responsible for dealing with this Vote, and this is why I reply to it.

This amount is also required for expenditure in respect of increased staff benefits as well as higher programme costs and the cost of additional programmes and frequency schedules.

I notice, incidentally, that this amount of R190,000 has already been covered by a State President&#x2019;s warrant. Does this represent the cost of the purchase of the block of flats named Highlands in Alexandra Road, Pietermaritzburg&#x003F; Does it represent wholly the cost of the purchase of the building, or does it also include the amount which would be required for the transfer in the Deeds Office, agent&#x2019;s commission and various other aspects as well&#x003F; In his reply I would like the Minister please to give us details. If there is an agent&#x2019;s commission to be paid, is it included in this amount&#x003F; If so, what is the amount and to whom is it to be paid&#x003F; There is also the question of transfer costs involved in the transfer of this property from the past owners to this hon.

<p>The most important aspect of this is that this seems to indicate a change of policy on the part of that hon. Minister and his department. This is for the purchase of quarters.

<p>They want to know whether it is the intention of the hon. the Minister to purchase other blocks of flats in Pietermaritzburg. On this question of change of policy, the hon. the Minister has known for three years, or his department should have known for three years, that he would have to provide this accommodation. If the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development did not tell him, that is not our fault. I feel that his department ought to know. Why have they not taken the necessary steps to provide this accommodation rather than invade the private sector and take this accommodation from those families who are in Highlands today&#x003F;</p>

<p>The first question is whether he is going to purchase other blocks as well. Another point arises. Will the hon. the Minister find alternative accommodation for the present tenants of those flats&#x003F; I know that he has on two occasions given me an assurance that nobody would be thrown out onto the streets. But, Sir, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s local representative in Pietermaritzburg has made a contradictory statement. The people of Pietermaritzburg are upset about this and they want to know the truth. Will the hon. the Minister abide by the undertaking he gave me&#x003F; He is an honourable man and I am sure he will. The people of Pietermaritzburg would like to hear from him personally that he will help them to find suitable and similar alternative accommodation.</p>

<p>If the hon. member so wishes, it will be read. It is a question of whether or not there is alternative accommodation available. I have alleged that there is no, or very little, alternative accommodation available, certainly not accommodation similar to that which they have today and at a similar rental. The letter which the hon. the Minister refers to is a letter received from someone in Pietermaritzburg who wrote to the hon. the Minister. I do not think we should mention the person&#x2019;s name at this stage. If the hon. the Minister wishes to, he is free to do so. In this letter this person alleges that there is now a flat available in one block in Pietermaritzburg, a flat consisting of two bedrooms, lounge &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>If you rule that I must come away from this letter and come back to the question of the application of R190,000, I abide by your ruling, Sir.</p>

<p>The next point I want to make is whether the R190,000 includes compensation to the present tenants of the flats. The present tenants have been given notice that they must move by the 30th June. They are going to incur certain expenditure in moving to other accommodation, if and when they can find it. Does the hon. the Minister accept that he should be liable to compensate them for this move, which is not a voluntary move in the normal course, but an involuntary one caused by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s actions.</p>

<p>Well, then the Minister has that point. Then there is the cost of improvements. One of the tenants in this block of flats has over the last three months spent over R100 on improving the flat by repainting and redecorating it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Because in terms of the lease the onus is on the tenant to look after the interior of the flat. The hon. the Minister airs his ignorance again. As I have said, this particular tenant has spent over R100 and he has spent it believing that he is protected by the terms of the Rents Act. He now finds that that protection has been removed from him. I hope that in the R190,000 is included amounts to compensate tenants for just that sort of expenditure which they have undertaken.</p>

<p>To summarize briefly, is this amount only for the purchase of Highlands, or is it for the purchase of other blocks in Pietermaritzburg as well&#x003F; And will it cover compensation to the tenants for the cost of moving and compensation for renovations which they have undertaken&#x003F;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the additional amount of R50 is down here as payment for the block of flats which was bought from these people in order to house the personnel of the Edendale Hospital. The rest of the amount, namely R189,950 will be met out of savings. That is the total amount which will be paid&#x2014;nothing more <span class="col_2263-2264" refersTo="page_1145"/>and nothing else. As far as the people who are in these flats are concerned, those people who fall within the purview of the responsibility of my department I will see to it that they get alternative accommodation. As far as the other people are concerned, it is their job to see that they get alternative accommodation but we will do everything in our power to help them with that. I wonder if my hon. friend will be so kind as to send that letter across to me, so that I can just read it to the House. I think it is a very interesting letter. I think this also replies the question of the hon. member for Green Point as well. This is the letter. I will not say from whom it comes. It is addressed to me and I was kind enough to send the hon. member a copy of it. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir: We have heard so much about the tenants of Highlands Flats in our local newspaper, the <i>Natal Witness,</i> of the hardship these people will suffer in finding other accommodation after June, which is all poppycock and bunkum. My husband owns a few blocks of flats, Montana Court in Claremont Street and Windermere in Loop Street, all on the same site, right in the centre of Maritzburg, 21 flats in all. We have a two-bedroomed flat, kitchen, dining room, etc., beautifully painted, etc., at R55.35 for a tenant from Highlands and she came to look at it. She said that the flat was very nice, but she did not want to take it.</block>

<p>There is therefore an alternative flat for her. There are in fact 21 alternative flats in two buildings.</p>

<p>Arising further out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply and particularly with regard to his reading of this letter, if I might mention it, I think the hon. the Minister must read the letter again.

<p>That is correct. But has the hon. the Minister satisfied himself that the present tenants of Highlands will not be worse off by moving to these blocks of flats than they are at the moment&#x003F; This is the important principle that is involved here, namely that there should be suitable similar accommodation at a similar rental. This is the whole point. The hon. the Minister now appears to be going back on the undertakings which he gave me before. He is now sticking to the story of his local representative in Pietermaritzburg, namely that only those tenants who fall within certain income groups will be assisted by him. He is not sticking to his original undertaking, namely that he would see that nobody slepts on the streets and that he would see that everyone of these tenants got alternative accommodation. He gave me that undertaking twice. This is the doubt which exists in the mind of those people today because of this very vacillation. I asked the hon. the Minister again to give a categoric assurance to the people of Pietermaritzburg that they will be assisted by him and his department to find suitable similar accommodation. And not only those people who fall within these income limits, but all the tenants of this block of flats. Let me just put it to the hon. the Minister in reply to the writer of that letter. I have here a copy of the <i>Natal Witness</i> of Saturday, 6th March. This is the paper in which most people look for accommodation. What do we find in this newspaper&#x003F; We find only one flat to let in the whole of Pietermaritzburg. This flat is available for five months or longer, is unfurnished, self-contained, a three-bed-roomed half-house. The rental is R100 per month. If one looks at houses to let, one finds that there are six houses to let. That is all. This gives a total of seven in the whole of Pietermaritzburg. However, even those six houses are not in Pietermaritzburg. The first one is a swop. The advertisement says: &#x201C;We have been transferred to Ladysmith and we would like to arrange a swop with somebody who is being transferred to Pietermaritzburg&#x201D;. The second one is available at a rental of R180 per month, and is unfurnished. The third one is fully furnished and is available for two months only. No rental is mentioned. The third one is a three-bedroomed farm-house which is situated 12 miles from Greytown, 40 miles from Pietermaritzburg &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with respect, this is dealing with the question of the policy of the hon. the Minister in this regard. Here he is displacing tenants from flats; he is actually ejecting them. I am also dealing with the question of whether or not there is alternative accommodation available for them. Surely this must be taken into consideration when the hon. the Minister takes these steps. He must take this into consideration. This is a new item and a new policy. Here he is taking a block of flats.

I am at least earning my money, as was stated in a letter written to the hon. the Minister, because I am looking after my people. However, there appear to be members who are not looking after their constituents. This is definitely the case if the hon. the Minister admits that he has done this in the past and got away with it.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is utter tripe if that hon. member says that I have promised that all the people will be assisted with accommodation. I gave the undertaking that those people who fall under the responsibility of my department, in other words, people who fall within certain income group, would be looked after and that I would see to it that they got proper accommodation. The other people were given more than six months to look for accommodation. If they cannot find any, my department will give them all possible assistance to get that accommodation. What responsibility does my department have when that hon. member is ejected from his house&#x003F; Does the department have to find him alternative accommodation&#x003F; <span class="col_2267-2268" refersTo="page_1147"/>There is no necessity for the department to do so, because it is not its responsibility.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has indicated to us that he is asking us to approve of this policy, a policy which I think he should avoid adopting. I am referring to the taking over or purchasing of existing residential accommodation. In this instance it is some distance from the hospital concerned. Surely, in circumstances such as these where we have a shortage of housing in the country, his department should erect premises when accommodation is required for the personnel of any department. His department should not take over or purchase existing buildings. The position in Pietermaritzburg is not different from what it is anywhere else. These flats are already occupied. There is not an abundance of outside accommodation. I would have thought that the policy of his department would rather be to erect the premises required for personnel than to take over existing premises. There are various factors which have to be considered. Once the Government takes over a property, Rent Board regulations and rent control fall away. The Government itself can decide what its terms and charges are to the persons who occupy that accommodation. The very figure the hon. the Minister has given us, namely the purchase price of accommodation for 24 families, will provide reasonably priced accommodation for 24 families in Pietermaritzburg for the general public and not only for State employees. There is another reason why I say this is a wrong principle to adopt, namely for the State to purchase blocks of flats. The hon. the Minister is well aware that State employees, after being in the service of the State for a short time, are entitled to a 100 per cent housing loan. The facilities are there for a State employee to build his own home, but those facilities are not there for the man in the private sector. He has to struggle to get a building society bond and to try to make ends meet when he tries to put up his own dwelling. I therefore think it is entirely wrong for the State to take over existing residential accommodation as is envisaged here to house State servants when those servants themselves are entitled to 100 per cent housing loans from the State under the existing arrangements.</p>

<p>Mr Chairman, I cannot give that undertaking. I have been asked to do this by the Department of Health. I agree with the hon. member for Green Point that this should only be done in exceptional cases. It has been done in Pretoria recently, where the Administrator of the Transvaal bought a block of flats to provide accommodation for the Teachers&#x2019; College. There was also an outcry as to where those people would find alternative <span class="col_2269-2270" refersTo="page_1148"/>accommodation, but every one of those people was accommodated elsewhere in Pretoria. I want to give hon. members the undertaking that after the 30th June there will not be one single person who does not have accommodation in Pietermaritzburg, who will not be suitably accommodated elsewhere. The hon. member is kicking up a completely unnecessary row. These people must not, however, think that they do not have to look for alternative accommodation themselves. They must not think that they can rely on the department to supply them with accommodation. The department will give them all possible assistance, and the hon. member will have reason to grouse and to move a reduction in my salary next year if there is one family on the street after the 30th June.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this increase is attributable to the furnishing of new and additional accommodation both in the Republic and abroad.

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is very easy to explain this amount. Because of the scarcity of building materials, the delays in the building industry, etc., an amount of R754,000 was surrendered last year, 1969- &#x2019;70. It was to be spent, but could not be spent because of these difficulties in the building industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sure the moving speech of the hon. the Minister on the crying need for furniture for Ministerial homes has moved all of us to tears.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s colleague said they would otherwise have to sleep on the floors. Here the hon. the Minister is requesting money for furniture for ministerial houses. Can he give us any idea of the condition of the furniture which is now to be replaced&#x003F; Are they, for example, going to place this old second-hand furniture which is collapsing, on an auction so that one may buy it&#x003F; What is going to happen to that furniture&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>
