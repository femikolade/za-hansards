<heading>PART APPROPRIATION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>When I moved the Second Reading of this Bill on Wednesday last week, I did so in the spirit of profound and sincere earnestness, an earnestness befitting an occasion such as that one. That earnestness was not born of the idea that there might be something radically wrong with the economy of our country; it was born of the conviction, a conviction which I have always had, that problems such as these&#x2014;problems which have a bearing on the economy of our country as a whole, which have a bearing on the welfare of every man, woman and child in our country&#x2014;should, in a place like this, always be treated with the greatest measure of earnestness. That is why I expected to find, also on the part of the Opposition&#x2014;which, after all, should also have the interests of the country at heart and which also forms part of this House of Assembly&#x2014;the same measure of earnestness, as well as a sincere endeavour to come here not only with criticism and negative statements, but also with a sincere attempt to contribute something positive to the solution of our problems. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, you can understand how disappointed I and we on this side of the House were to see how many hon. members opposite were treating the major problems threatening us today without any earnestness, and often with a measure of frivolity. It was almost with jubilation that they took pleasure in splaying out before the world supposed difficulties and weaknesses which may be present in our economy; we have seen how hon. members opposite, the one after the other, came forward with destructive criticism without any well-considered plan&#x2014;and I shall prove this&#x2014;for the solution of our problems. If one were to sift all those words that came from the other side of the House, from the first to the last speaker, and if all the chaff went through, one would only find an occasional grain to which attention has to be given.</p>

<p>I think hon. members would welcome it very much if I were to sit down, but I am not going to do so. It is striking that such contributions of any positive significance as were made on the other side, were not made by the frontbenchers on that side; on the contrary, the positive ideas&#x2014;whether or not one agrees with them is a different matter, but the positive ideas to which one may pay attention&#x2014;and suggestions came from the newcomers, from the backbenchers on that side. It is not that one agrees with those ideas, but the ideas which were tangible and could be considered, came from the hon. members for Constantia, Gardens and Von Brandis, young members in this House.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members sitting in the front benches have given us very little food for thought. Sir, if you listened to the rhetoric of the hon. member for Yeoville, the poetics of the hon. member for Parktown and the comedy of the hon. member for Durban Point, you would find that virtually nothing new, nothing positive, nothing constructive came to light in those speeches, but what we did find in them was hair-splitting and verbosity. To be honest, we found that nobody on that side had a concrete solution to our problems. Mr. Speaker, I think I can really say in all honesty that our hon. friends on the other side of the House did not act like members of the House of Assembly but like politicians.</p>

<p>Who is talking now!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>One would have said that we were on the eve of an election, for the majority of them were still making their election speeches here. In a difficult situation for our country and for our people&#x2014;and the economic situation is a difficult one&#x2014;they tried to derive for themselves as much political gain as possible. At this very stage, when they had to think of South Africa, they thought of themselves and they considered how, by exploiting the opportunities they are afforded here, they could derive the maximum party-political gain for themselves. For that reason they took pleasure in giving an exaggerated outline here, before the whole world, of the problems which our country, like other countries, is experiencing. They revelled and took pleasure in splaying out these problems in order that they might tell the world: &#x201C;This is what South Africa looks like,&#x201D; as reflected by them.</p>

<p>Sir, I wonder whether any person who listened to hon. members opposite during the past week, to the dark picture being sketched of our country, would ever invest a cent in South Africa&#x003F; They never came near to the real problem. We are saddled here with a problem of inflation, and I am levelling the accusation at hon. members of the Opposition that they never came near to the crux of that problem. They did not analyse it properly. They only came forward with one aspect, the aspect of labour, and even that problem of labour they did not analyse properly themselves. They never spotted the consequences, the implications, of their own policy.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They never proved to us the effectiveness of their solution, and I think that this morning we should devote some time to analysing more closely the solution of the labour problem which they are putting forward. Sir, nobody can say that this side of the House has tried to make political capital out of this occasion. The only political capital we could make out of it, was to reveal the nakedness of the Opposition. Sir, just look at the facts. We are introducing additional taxes here; we are asking the people for an additional R47 million.</p>

<from><span class="col_1185-1186" refersTo="page_0606"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We shall remember those words of the hon. member. In spite of what hon. members said here, I came into contact with people from all walks of life during the past few days, since last Wednesday, and without exception they thanked us for the fact that in a time like this the Government had the courage to take a step which it considers to be in the interests of the people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what has emerged from all the speeches made by these hon. members&#x003F; I want to refer, in the first place, to my hon. friend, the member for Parktown, who was the main Opposition speaker on economics. I like the hon. member, but, Sir, unfortunately he has been developing a tendency of late for his ideas to be engulfed by his flowery style. The hon. member told us that there was &#x201C;a new strain of inflation&#x201D; in America and in the world today. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A new strain of inflation has become a hard reality for millions of Americans. So far it has proved stubbornly resistant to the classic remedy of business slowdown that has cured inflation in the past. I do not believe that our situation is exactly the same. However, as I said in the no-confidence debate, there is a new strain of inflation. The world is very, very unhappy and has not yet found the mechanism to deal with this type of inflation.</block>

<p>Sir, by telling us openly&#x2014;here it stands recorded in black and white&#x2014;that inflation is not a problem found in South Africa alone but a world problem, the hon. member has well and truly let the cat out of the bag. Whereas hon. members on that side attacked the Government by accusing it of having caused inflation, he negated everything that was said here by them by stating that this was a new strain of inflation about which the whole world was concerned. The hon. member must indeed have a very high opinion of the National Government on the basis of what it did in the past and the tremendous revival it has brought about, to say that the National Government should now, according to him, be able to accomplish what the whole world has not been able to do. I thank him for that confidence. At the same time the hon. member said that a mechanism had not yet been found for fighting this &#x201C;new strain of inflation&#x201D;. Now hon. members opposite, one after the other, are attacking the Government for not having succeeded as yet in fighting this inflation, although in our country the rate of inflation is lower than it is in any comparable country. What happens to the arguments advanced by the hon. members opposite when a frontbencher of theirs is negating everything they said by virtually saying that inflation is not an exclusively South African problem, that it is not the Government that is to blame for it, that it is a new world phenomenon and that nobody has as yet found a solution to it&#x003F;</p>

<p>This is the double-talk to which we have been referring and which is characteristic of members on the other side of the House. On the one hand they say this, and on the other hand they are availing themselves of the same opportunity to accuse the Government of what they absolve other governments from. Now they are displaying that arrogance&#x2014;I call it arrogance&#x2014;in that the hon. member says that no country in the world has as yet found a solution to the modern problem of inflation, but they, the United Party, have a solution. I think the world would be very grateful if these hon. members would explain to the world at large what the world solution is which they have found and virtually patented.</p>

<p>This solution lies in the sphere of labour. Inflation will be solved through a more effective utilization of the available labour, through drawing in a larger number of non-White labourers to replace other labourers. Now I want to make the statement that that whole theory of the Opposition of regarding labour as the only solution to the problem of inflation, is a claim which verges on superficiality and which has not yet been considered properly. Labour is a very important means of production and it has to be used to the best of our ability, but what proof do the hon. members have that by making greater use of labour, by drawing in more labourers, it will be possible to solve the problem of inflation&#x003F; This claim was made by all of them and it s being accepted outside that we merely have to bring in more workers and the problem of inflation will be solved, but what proof have the hon. members ever furnished to the effect that the problem of inflation will be solved by drawing in more workers&#x003F; One may assume that if one brings in more labourers, it is possible that one may have an increased volume of production, but can one always say that under given circumstances more labourers <span class="col_1187-1188" refersTo="page_0607"/>will mean less inflation&#x003F; That is what it amounts to.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That depends on how they are trained.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The question is whether more labourers, trained or not trained, will mean less inflation. I want to make the statement here today that it is no hard and fast economic law that increased employment means less inflation. It is no hard and fast economic law that increased employment means less inflation, but that is the attitude which the hon. members have adopted time and again.</p>

<p>Stop trying to get away from your own spectres. It is always being said that we are sitting here with a tremendous source of labour in South Africa, greater than those in other countries, and why are we not making more and more use of that source of labour&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have noticed recently that these hon. members are swinging away from this idea and have arrived at the idea of the greater efficiency of existing labour, but behind this entire school of thought the idea has always been that we have a reservoir of labour here, a large mass of people who have to be drawn in, and that with full employment we shall overcome inflation. Let us take a look at this theory.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That can be trained; and in all those countries, in spite of all that labour, there is a tremendously high rate of inflation. Take the Western world and take a country such as Spain, not one of the most highly developed countries, but an industrial country. They have a major source of labour there, but inflation prevails in Spain. Take a country such as Italy.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, but Spain has a tremendous tourist industry, which brings in more than gold does. That is an argument which passes my understanding. But let us take Italy. Of course, you know, Sir, that Italy has thousands of workers who go to the western countries of Europe every year to offer their labour there; good workers, not unskilled workers only; they are fine, capable people, and we came to know them here in South Africa. But in spite of all its manpower there is a high rate of inflation in Italy.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>But they have socialism there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This has nothing to do with socialism. Go to Britain where they had socialism, and where under the socialist government they had unemployment under Wilson. Skilled people did not have any employment and there was a high rate of inflation. Go to the U.S.A. Today the U.S.A.&#x2019;s problem is unemployment amongst unskilled and skilled people, and yet it has inflation. Surely, the U.S.A. could have solved its problem very easily, and Britain and Spain and all those countries could also have solved their problems very easily if they had used their tremendous source of labour to combat inflation. But, on the contrary, what did America do&#x003F; Recently America has, unfortunately, been promoting inflation. It created new inflation in order to absorb its redundant labour.</p>

<p>Now, I want to go back, Sir, and I hope you will understand that I do not want to go back to the rinderpest. [Interjections.] Yes, I am going back to the report of the Reserve Bank as well, and if the hon. member does not take care, I shall go back to the report of the Reserve Bank for 1949. But I want to take a period in our history, from 1945 to 1948, when another party was in power. During that period the S.A. Trades and Labour Council handed over to the Government, to Gen. Smuts, a memorandum in which they complained about the tremendous increase in the cost <span class="col_1189-1190" refersTo="page_0608"/>of living, i.e. over that period from 1945 to 1948. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government so far has ignored the trade union movement and has in many instances pursued a policy diametrically opposed to the interests of the workers. The standards of living of the better-paid workers are rapidly declining, while the lower-paid workers are not even in the position to secure for themselves and their dependants the ordinary amenities of life. As a result of the calamitous increase in the cost of living, the real wages of workers are lower than in 1938, although the actual cost of living has increased by 70 per cent.</block>

<p>The hon. member says that was after five years of war, but here the hon. members had three years of possible growth and development, from 1945 to 1948. They had this whole source of non-White labour to draw on, and they had the whole of Europe to draw on in order to promote immigration. They had the soldiers who were coming back from the front, White soldiers, skilled and unskilled people. They had all the labour on which they could lay their hands, but, nevertheless, they did not succeed in curbing inflation, and in those times we saw the following statement in the <i>Sunday Times:</i> &#x201C;The cost of living has risen 69 per cent in eight years.&#x201D; Is that not something which reduces the entire argument of my friends opposite to a <i>reductio ad absurdum&#x003F;</i></p>

<p>Well, here I have the newspaper. It is the <i>Sunday Times,</i> your own paper; in it figures and graphs are used to support this statement.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member also referred to growth. That side of the House has been accusing us of not being in favour of growth and of wanting to check growth in this country. They have said that we belong to the damping school and not to the growth school. Those hon. members have once again found two words to play with. The politics of the future will, in the economic sphere, now be dominated again by two words, i.e. the &#x201C;growth school&#x201D; and the &#x201C;damping school&#x201D;. That will give them satisfaction. After all, it is childish of my friends opposite to claim that this side of the House belongs to the damping school. Have we not seen 20 years of growth behind us&#x003F; Now I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this question: Is it not true that over the past two decades, since the National Party came into power, we have seen the most spectacular growth which has ever taken place in South Africa and which is comparable with the best in the world&#x003F; We are the people who caused the growth in this country.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, we have joined the damping school&#x003F; I shall deal with that. Every overseas visitor who comes here, says that he is stunned by the tremendous growth that has been taking place in South Africa in recent times. If hon. members do not want to believe me, I want to read out to them what was said last November by a person whose words they probably will have to accept. This person, whose name I shall mention in a moment, said the following in his speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have painted a picture of inflationary pressure in our economy during 1970. However, we must keep the picture in perspective and I think we should remember that we South Africans have enjoyed a wonderful tempo of economic growth, especially in the last decade or two, in recent years at the rate of six or seven per cent per annum in real terms &#x2014;one of the highest growth rates in the world. Our economy has become widely diversified and the growth in every sector has been impressive. The average domestic product per head of our total population is probably at least double that of the next most prosperous country in Africa. The White peoples of our country probably have the highest general living standards found anywhere in the world, and the non-Whites possibly have the highest living standard in general to be found among non-Whites in any country outside Europe, with the exception of the United States and Japan. We have attracted foreign investments on a large scale. We have excellent trading relations with most countries of the world. We are attracting substantial immigration and our tourist traffic is also rising considerably. In short, we have a modern and sophisticated economy. All this has been achieved without a single <span class="col_1191-1192" refersTo="page_0609"/>cent having been received in foreign aid of any kind, our country being one of the few in the entire world of which this can be said.</block>

<p>This beautiful testimonial on the growth in the past six years, which hon. members opposite cannot deny, comes from a speech made by a very honourable person, Mr. H. S. Mayburn, executive director of the Association of Chambers of Commerce in South Africa. Sir, this party has exerted itself for creating the circumstances and the framework within which real and actual growth could take place. This I want to tell hon. members and the world outside: We shall once again take this country to tremendous heights as far as its economic growth is concerned. We know that we must do this, because of the composition of our population. We know that we must do this; otherwise we shall go under. We also know that we must do this, for if we do not, we cannot implement our own policy in this country and we would be powerless against the outside world.</p>

<p>Although I am now predicting and undertaking that in the decades that lie ahead the National Party will once again take our economic growth to unprecedented heights, there are two standpoints from which we shall not deviate. We do not believe in growth at all costs. Nor do we believe in unbalanced growth. There are certain forms of growth that require one to abandon values, values which mean much more to one than economic prosperity does. We are not prepared to pay that price. There is a form of growth which brings instability and uncertainty into the economy, which goes hand in hand with a deterioration of one&#x2019;s currency and with inflation. That kind of growth we want to avoid. I want the U.P. to state to us on some occasion, even if it is in the course of the Third Reading debate, their standpoint in respect of inflation. Nobody knows what they want. On the one hand they are arguing against inflation as a major evil in the economy and, on the other hand, they are supporting a standpoint which implies growth at any price, and inflation. It often seems to one as though members of the U.P. are entertaining the idea that inflation is a condition for growth, and that one has to retain inflation in order to promote growth. This is an extremely dangerous standpoint. It is true that moderate inflation may stimulate growth temporarily, but in the long run inflation destroys growth.</p>

<p>I want to prove this in two ways. Inflation destroys one&#x2019;s growth in the long run in that inflation brings along with it something which one finds in many countries, i.e. an unprecedented rise in wages and costs in the industrial sphere. In due course the costs and the wages in the industrial sphere rise to such an extent that no profits are being made any more. Rising costs, rising turnover and diminishing profits are found in certain countries, such as America. There one has tremendous price increases, but no or a negative real growth in the country. This is followed by the period to which the hon. member for Hillbrow referred, i.e. the period of stagflation, of stagnation and inflation, where there is inflation on the one hand and stagnation, or a standstill, on the other hand. All inflation eventually leads to stagnation. In our country it has not done so yet. In spite of the inflation we have here, we still have a high rate of growth, i.e. 7&#x00BD; per cent in 1969 and a possible 6 per cent for last year. As yet we do not know precisely what it is going to be, but it is a fairly high growth rate. It is far from a state of stagnation.</p>

<p>The second point is that inflation destroys saving. We have seen how the figure for saving has begun to drop. Saving is the investment for one&#x2019;s future growth. It provides the capital for going ahead in the future. For that reason alone hon. members and I must not adopt a half-hearted attitude towards inflation. We must not think that inflation may promote our growth. Inflation is fatal to all growth, and the sooner it is squashed, the better. Drastic measures are necessary, even if we have to pay dearly for them. Even if the price we have to pay at the outset is also a painful one, it is better to do it now than to do so later in the form of delayed or negative growth.</p>

<p>Sir, we are the growth people. We proved this in the past. We do not check growth. We check inflation for the sake of growth. If we did not check inflation, a new building of continued stable and steady growth would not rise on the new foundations laid by us.</p>

<p>I am coming back to the problem of labour. I have already said that labour forms a very important ingredient of the production, but it is not the only ingredient. One cannot solve this problem by means of the labour factor alone, as the hon. members opposite want to do. Labour is only one of the factors in the production <span class="col_1193-1194" refersTo="page_0610"/>process. Even if one had all the labour in the world, skilled or unskilled, it would still be impossible to make any progress if certain other elements were lacking. My hon. friends opposite have never recognized the necessity for those elements. I want to refer to three of those elements.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is the necessity for capital. Many of the growing development countries of the West have the labour, but they do not have the capital. For rapid growth a great deal of capital is necessary. The hon. member for Lydenburg referred to the fact that it had been calculated here in South Africa that the capital return ratio in South Africa was 2.4. One has to invest R2.4 to get a return of R1. If, for argument&#x2019;s sake, one wants a return or an increased gross product of R500 million, an amount of R1,200 million has to be invested. Labour is a tremendously important factor, but now my hon. friend has once again come forward here with strange, winged words. He said, &#x201C;There is no capital shortage.&#x201D; There is no scarcity of capital in South Africa. What we have in South Africa, is a monetary distortion. Is that true&#x003F; This is a beautiful phrase, but I wonder whether hon. members understand it. I do not.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s trouble.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is the trouble. I wonder whether the people outside, to whom the hon. members are referring so often, understand it. I wonder whether the people who are searching for capital today, understand it. I wonder whether this is being understood by the people who have to pay these higher rates of interest to obtain capital for carrying on their industries. No scarcity of capital! This is almost like the person who would say: There is no drought in this land; it is merely that there are scattered thunder showers elsewhere. At present everybody is talking about this scarcity. Everybody is feeling that scarcity. We would go to countries abroad, if the position is better anywhere, and we could try to get hold of capital there. Admittedly, we can obtain short-term money; that is something different, but we cannot obtain investment capital. I think that it is very strange of my hon. friend to tell the House here that there is no scarcity of capital in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the second place, over and above capital and labour, a country also requires an infrastructure. We need postal services and transport services; we need schools, hospitals and universities; we need harbours and we need scores and scores of services which the Government has to provide. The Government is constantly being criticized in this House by hon. members opposite in regard to shortcomings in the infrastructure in the country. We know that a great deal is being done, for instance, to extend the postal service in our country. We know that the postal services and the telephone service in our country are not perfect, in spite of the fact that large amounts have been voted for these services. [Interjection]. We are honest and admit that these services are not perfect in spite of the large amounts spent on and tremendous activity devoted to them, because South Africa has grown so rapidly that the postal service has not been able to keep pace. We know that complaints are often heard about the transport services. In spite of the tremendous amount of work done by my colleague the hon. the Minister of Transport, the large amounts of money continually being pumped into these services and the construction of transport lines, there is still a scarcity of the necessary infrastructure in the growing economy. The other day an hon. member opposite childishly wanted to know why we had not built the Orange River scheme a long time ago. But, surely, as far as that is concerned, we may as well ask why we are not building the entire infrastructure of South Africa right now, even what it will need in a hundred years&#x2019; time. But Rome was, after all not built in one day. We must go on providing the infrastructure we need. Hon. members opposite have been offering this simple solution&#x2014;labour and labour alone; they do not have any regard to the capital, nor do they have any regard to the infrastructure. This is an extensive country, a large and extensive country with a sparse population. For that reason it is not as easy for us to provide an infrastructure as it is for a small and densely populated country to do so. In our country this creates major problems and requires a tremendous amount of capital. That is why it is futile to speak of labour and of labour alone.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they are forgetting that there is such a thing as a balance of payments, that one has to have regard to one&#x2019;s imports and exports of goods and of money and of services. A country&#x2019;s balance <span class="col_1195-1196" refersTo="page_0611"/>of payments plays a tremendous role in its economic growth.</p>

<p>Countries which grow rapidly, have a better balance of payments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The general phenomenon is that countries which grow rapidly, develop a negative balance of payments. I am not referring now to well-established industrial countries such as West Germany, where the production apparatus has already been established over the years. No, here in our country everything has to be built up from scratch since we are a young country, and that is why rapid growth and economic development involve increased demands on one&#x2019;s reserves and pressure on one&#x2019;s balance of payments. This is an economic fact. We are not the only country which has to keep this in view; we are not like the U.S.A., and my hon. friend the hon. member for Parktown will know that. The U.S.A. has said that the question of a balance of payments no longer counts, because they can always pay in dollars. But no other country can do that. We, for instance, must have regard to our balance of payments. I want to assure hon. members of something they already know, i.e. that we in South Africa already have a particularly high growth rate, and that if we consider further growth, as we shall do, we shall not only consider labour, but properly take into account all the factors required for a steady growth. In this regard I want to refer to an article dated 14th February and written by Dr. Desmond Krogh, director of the Federated Chamber of Industries. By way of introduction the following was said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Krogh says that South Africa with its enviable, long record of rapid and steady economic growth is one of those countries in the world which can afford a debate on the pros and cons of a higher or lower growth rate. Whether we should grow even faster than we did in the past, remains an open question, for to attempt to develop more rapidly than the potential of a country permits, inevitably results in the disadvantages increasing and the advantages diminishing.</block>

<p>Dr. Krogh says the same thing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To try to do too much in a short while, without sacrifice and exertion, is the root cause of our present and future economic problems.</block>

<p>This is what the director of the Federated Chamber of Industries has to say. A moment ago I referred to what was said by the director of Assocom, and here Mr. Krogh also says what we have always been saying&#x2014;to try to do too much in a short while, without sacrifice and exertion, is the root cause of our present and future economic problems.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another point which was so often discussed by hon. members opposite, i.e. our monetary and fiscal policy. Hon. members opposite have all been criticizing the application of our monetary and fiscal policy as an instrument in the fight against inflation. In fact, over the years they have been levelling criticism against that policy, against the policy of the Reserve Bank, against the policy of a credit ceiling, against the interest rate policy and all those things. They have always been levelling criticism against our fiscal policy and, now again, against the taxes we proposed here recently. Instead of that they are proposing purely a labour policy&#x2014;no longer a monetary or fiscal policy, but purely a labour policy. And yet our fiscal and monetary policy has always rendered South Africa great services. It is the fiscal and monetary policy implemented by us over the past five to six years which has seen to it that our rate of inflation has remained amongst the lowest in the world. Similarly, it is the <span class="col_1197-1198" refersTo="page_0612"/>monetary and fiscal policies of countries such as France and West Germany that has stabilized their economies to a certain extent. But hon. members opposite pretend to know everything. Of course, I have no objection to a person expressing his opinion; he is entitled to do so. But they are saying now that everybody is against us, that we are alone in holding the views we do, and that only they are right as regards our fiscal and monetary policy. In this regard I want to quote to hon. members from the latest study undertaken by the O.E.C.D., a study which dealt with &#x201C;the present problem of inflation&#x201D; and in which the following was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All member countries should aim to restore at least a degree of price stability, associated in the past with sustainable levels of employment and economic growth. To this end cautious demand management policies are required. Excess demand should be eliminated and governments should be prepared where necessary to accept a temporary reduction in the rate of activity until there are signs that better price stability has been achieved.</block>

<p>This is the policy which we on this side are pursuing, a policy which hon. members opposite want to query. It is a policy which is being laid down here by an authoritative body such as the O.E.C.D. But, what is more, if there is any person who can speak authoritatively on monetary policy, it is probably Mr. Schweizer, the managing director of the I.M.F. Recently he said in Copenhagen&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In their efforts to eliminate inflation industrial countries must rely primarily on fiscal and monetary policies.</block>

<p>This is what is being said by Mr. Schweizer and all his advisers, who visit us every year. This is the tone they maintain in their advice&#x2014;&#x201C;rely primarily on monetary and fiscal policies&#x201D;. The view taken by hon. members opposite, i.e. that we are supposedly alone in our policy, does not tally with the true facts. I have mentioned to them here two leading authorities. I am going further than that. I have here a publication that appeared recently, &#x201C;Further Weapons against Inflation: Measures to supplement general fiscal and monetary policies,&#x201D; by the Committee of Economic Development of the United States. Hon. members know who the members of the Committee of Economic Development are. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">General fiscal and monetary policies must continue to constitute the most important weapon in the battle against in-inflation. We strongly believe, however, that justification clearly exists for adopting a series of measures to supplement these general policies. Such measures should be designed to change the structural and institutional environment in which demand policies operate so that a given restraint of demand will be accompanied by a greater diminution of price pressures, by a smaller and less burdensome rise in employment that is at present indicated.</block>

<p>In America these authoritative bodies are saying that we should adhere to the policy of fiscal and monetary measures in the fight against inflation, but it should be supplemented by other policies and, in particular, a policy which goes into the question of demand with a view to reducing the demand. Sir, I think I have quoted here very important passages taken from authoritative sources in order to prove that our policy is in keeping with the general world policy. It is only hon. members opposite who do not know what it is, for they do not want to know.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I want to deal now with a few major problems. In the time I have left I shall, unfortunately, not be able to deal with everything I should have liked to deal with and to reply to all the questions that were put by hon. members. I should very much like to deal briefly with the question of fish concessions, which was touched upon here by the hon. member for Simonstown. The hon. member will appreciate that it will take time to do so. On a later occasion he will be given a full reply, as I also gave previously, when I was Minister of Economic Affairs. On that occasion he will get that reply, but I just want to put again one question to that side: Why are hon. members opposite talking about the two South African factory ships, and why have we not heard a single word about the large numbers of foreign ships from other countries which are catching fish just off our coast-line and outside our territorial waters&#x003F;</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member appreciates that I cannot deal with the entire problem now.</p>

<p>The last few minutes which I have left, I want to devote to the question of the cost of living. It has been said to us here that we are taking a step here which will lead to an increase in the cost of living in the country. As usual the hon. member for Durban Point lamented the increased cost of living. That is nonsense. Sir; that is purely politics. Not one of them has ventured to say to what extent these new sales duties are going to influence the cost of living. They merely made general statements to the effect that the cost of living would rise to such an extent that wages would have to be increased, but not one of them furnished figures to substantiate such a statement.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not saying that they will reduce the cost of living. I shall now tell the hon. member what the position is; we are not trying to obscure it. When we originally introduced the sales duty, we expected it to result in a non-recurrent increase of 1&#x00BD; per cent in the cost of living.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Non-recurrent but permanent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately the hon. member does not understand the concept. What did we find after making calculations&#x003F; We found that that increase of almost R100 million resulted in a non-recurrent increase of .9 per cent in the cost of living. On that basis we can now say that this new introduction of sales duty to the amount of R47 million, involves an increase of .45 per cent in the cost of living. To my mind it will be less, because the recent increase in the sales duty relates more to genuinely more luxurious articles and imported articles. We assume, therefore, that the non-recurrent increase in the cost of living which these new sales duties are going to bring about, will amount to less than .5 per cent, and these are no grounds for an increase in wages. In my opinion it would be dangerous for our workers to aim at higher and higher wages all the time. In due course higher and higher wages defeat their purpose. The labourers are entitled to a just wage, but when that wage becomes too high, it destroys the basis of their cost of living. I find here, in another American publication, that Mr. Weidenbaum, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, has said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In earlier periods when wages went up less rapidly, real living standards of the average worker rose steadily, but since wage rates have escalated the average worker&#x2019;s real living standard has tended to stagnate. The faster we go the be-hinder we get.</block>

<p>I think there is a great deal of truth in these words. If we push wages too high, we run the risk of really undermining the standard of living of our people.</p>

<p>But let us get back to this sales duty and the tremendous impact it will have on the standard of living of our people. Over the past five years, from 1964 to 1969, wages and salaries rose much more rapidly than did the cost of living. I want to emphasize that during these five years the cost of living rose by less than 3&#x00BD; per cent per year, whereas wages and salaries rose more rapidly, i.e. by 5&#x00BD; per cent. Hon. members should not talk about a lowering of the standard of living of the labourers and our people and our wage-earners, for during the past five years, from 1964 to 1969, the wages and salaries rose more rapidly than did the cost of living. Therefore, they are better off, and during the past year, during 1970, wages and salaries even rose much more rapidly than they did during the previous period. I just want to mention the figure relating to the scope of the sales duty in the economy as a whole so that hon. members may appreciate <span class="col_1201-1202" refersTo="page_0614"/>its significance. If hon. members take the gross return of our local manufacturing industry, they will find that the articles subject to sales duty amount to only 13.9 per cent. Only 13.9 per cent of the goods manufactured locally, are subject to sales duty. If we take the sales duty collected by us in relation to the gross domestic product, we find that the sales duty is only equivalent to 1.393 per cent&#x2014;let us say 1.4 per cent&#x2014;of our total gross domestic product.</p>

<p>Hon. members asked me to go into the question of why we did not introduce the sales duty at the final stage but in fact at the source. This is a very important question. I should have liked to go into this matter if I had had the time, but I shall perhaps do so on a later occasion. I just want to say that this matter of whether the sales duty should be levied at the final stage, at the retail stage, as was requested by the hon. member for Yeoville, or whether it should be levied at the source, i.e. at the import or at the manufacturing stage, is a matter that was studied in detail by a commission of experts, the Franzsen Commission, which made a study of all the systems in the world. After thorough consideration of the pros and cons, they arrived at the conclusion that the best way for South Africa would be to collect the sales duty in the way we are doing it at present, i.e. at the source and not at the final stage.</p>

<p>The hon. members are complaining about a labour shortage. Are we then to use the labourers we have in unnecessary ways&#x003F; Are we to waste this labour&#x003F; Let me tell hon. members that if we had collected this duty at the final stage, we would have had to register approximately 125,000 to 150,000 factories, importers, co-operatives, retailers, etc. We would have had to register and keep an eye on between 125,000 and 150,000 points, but under the present system there are only 5,500 points which we have to supervise for the purposes of collecting the sales duty. And the cost involved in keeping an eye on all of these 125,000 to 150,000 points, would have been enormous. The Franzsen Commission calculated that 87 per cent of the retailers of South Africa, with a trade income of between R1,000 and R100,000, have a net profit margin of 5 per cent. In other words, a retail business with an income of R100,000 has a net profit margin of R5,000. Now, can hon. members imagine what would have happened if that retail business had still had to find people to administer that sales duty at the final stage, what it would have cost and the labour it would have required&#x003F; If they can imagine that, I think they will appreciate how expensive and how difficult this would have been.

<heading>BANTU AUTHORITIES&#x2019; SERVICE PENSIONS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>The provisions of this Bill have already been explained in a memorandum which has been tabled. As appears from that memorandum, this Bill deals only with matters concerning pensions for persons in the service of Bantu authorities in the Republic and corresponding authorities in South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Pension funds for the authorities concerned can of course be established under the appropriate legislation relating to the establishment of the authorities. Thus a complete pension scheme for employees of Bantu authorities in the Republic can be established in terms of the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, and legislation by Parliament will be necessary only in so far as it is necessary to arrange for the transfer of the rights of persons who are members of existing schemes and who enter the service of Bantu authorities.</p>

<p>As stated in the memorandum, there are, however, certain reasons why the authorities concerned are not yet in a position to establish and administer their own schemes. The main reason is that, especially when established for relatively small numbers, a pension scheme can cause rather difficult administrative problems and it was, therefore, thought fit to start off with a centrally administered scheme. It will then be possible for the different authorities to participate in that scheme until such time as they establish and administer their own scheme. The central administration will consequently be run in such a way that it will be easy for an authority in due course to establish its own scheme and to withdraw from the central administration.</p>

<p>It is particularly with a view to <i>inter alia</i> a centralized administration that provision is made in the Bill for the delegation of certain powers, functions and duties to officers of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions so that the expert knowledge and assistance of that department, which already specializes in the administration of pension funds, can be utilized to the benefit and in the training of the authorities.</p>

<p>The fact that there are different authorities with differing needs, is one of the reasons why provision is made in the Bill for basic matters only, while the detail will be arranged by means of regulations so that the circumstances of the different authorities can be borne in mind.</p>

<p>I wish to state here that the different territorial authorities and other bodies which are mainly concerned, have been duly consulted in regard to the principles and have expressed their agreement therewith, but have indicated that they would like to be consulted on the detail, and each authority concerned will consequently be consulted beforehand about the regulations which will apply to it and its staff.</p>

<p>I have already referred to persons who are members of existing pension schemes and who enter the service of authorities, and I would like to enlarge upon this. Bantu in the service of State institutions <span class="col_1205-1206" refersTo="page_0616"/>may, depending on the nature of their work, be members of, for example, the Public Service Pension Fund, the Police and Prison Service Pension Fund, the Provincial and the Territory Service Pension Fund or the Government non-White Employees Pension Fund, and it is possible that a member of one of these funds may at some stage enter the service of a Bantu authority. In terms of the laws governing the different funds, he may not continue to be a member if he changes his employment; from the nature of things it will in any event not be proper if he continues to be a member of the fund concerned. The only suitable alternative is to provide for his transfer to the appropriate Bantu Authorities&#x2019; Fund.</p>

<p>It is of course standard practice that membership of a particular fund is determined by the nature of the employment and the employer in whose service the member is. Thus one will not find that a public servant is a member of a municipal pension fund even if the person concerned were previously employed by a municipality. In this regard, the establishment of suitable new funds for Bantu authorities and the transfer from other funds to the new fund, do not involve new principles.</p>

<p>As the whole system is in the initial stages, the exact nature of the cases which will arise cannot now be foreseen. For this reason the legislation must of necessity be all-embracing and consequently provision has not only been made for transfers from State institutions, but also from municipalities. In this connection I refer to the definitions of &#x201C;revenue&#x201D;, &#x201C;municipal pension fund&#x201D; and &#x201C;declared department or body&#x201D; in clause 1 of the Bill, which can be used in conjunction with other provisions to adjust individual cases.</p>

<p>Although the Bill may at first glance appear to be long and involved, this is due solely to the different circumstances for which provision has to be made, and the whole position is summarized in what I have now said and in the memorandum.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support this Bill which is before us, in principle as it extends and makes available facilities for persons who are in the employment, whether or not it be permanent employment, of these authorities to belong to a pension fund or to a superannuation fund. We realize that this Bill is essentially a Pensions Bill and that the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions has played a major part in drafting the legislation which is now before us. We also realize that this legislation is in fact enabling legislation to bring about the administration and the establishment of a joint pension fund and a joint superannuation fund. There are certain observations which we would like to make at this stage concerning certain aspects of this Bill. Although the Committee Stage will give us an opportunity to perhaps discuss some of these matters in more detail we would like at this stage to bring them to the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>First of all there is the question of preserving pension benefits which is of major importance, when considering any Bill which is formulating a structure for a pension fund or a superannuation fund. Here the hon. the Deputy Minister has referred to certain clauses dealing with the transferability of pension rights and accrued pension benefits which might have accrued whilst that person was an employee contributing to another pension fund. We feel that this is an important aspect particularly in view of the fact that in recent times it has become more and more apparent that there is a shortcoming in many sections of our pensions legislation, as regards the transferability and the preservation of accrued pension rights.</p>

<p>That is why, on closer examination, there are certain questions we would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister. There is for instance the position as far as the Transkei is concerned. This Bill states in terms of the definitions that &#x201C;other pension fund or a provident fund&#x201D; means other pension funds and provident funds administered by the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions in terms of any other law or Act. It then goes on to mention schemes established by a pension law which are administered by the Government of the Transkei in terms of the Transkei Constitution Act of 1963. We would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether this in fact means that those persons who will be in the employ of the Transkeian Government, or a body established by the Transkei Constitution, who are then transferred to another body and who would then be liable to join the Bantu Authorities&#x2019; Service Pension Fund, will have full transferability of their pensionable rights in terms of that definition. In other words, whether this legislation which is now before us will also <span class="col_1207-1208" refersTo="page_0617"/>cover the situation as far as employees of the Transkei Government are concerned.</p>

<p>Then there is the principle involved in establishing whether those persons who are in employment, whether permanent or not, shall be deemed to be members of the funds that are established in terms of this legislation. We realize that there are a number of details which will be dealt with by means of regulations. When one studies this Bill one soon observes that it is merely in line with many other pieces of legislation enabling the establishment of various pension funds and delegating the authority to make regulations which become part of the final Act. However, we are not able to discuss the question of these details that will be defined in terms of regulations, but it is hoped that these regulations, which are very wide&#x2014;indeed, the clause which covers regulations covers several pages in this Bill&#x2014;will be more or less on a standardized basis so as to facilitate the transferability of pension rights when a person joins a pension fund or is transferred and falls under the jurisdiction of a Bantu authority and is compelled to join that pension fund. There is no right of election as exists in other pension legislation passed by this House. It is therefore important that there should be a standardization of these regulations so as to facilitate such transferability. The commission, which discussed the question of transferability and preservation of pension rights and benefits, indicated clearly that this was desirable, but that it will not be possible until such time as there is greater standardization as regards the rules of pension funds and as far as State pension funds are concerned.</p>

<p>The other aspect we would like further clarification on is the question of definitions, which was referred to by the hon. the Deputy Minister. In terms of the Bill now before us, there are one or two items which are new as far as pension legislation is concerned. Here I refer to the definition of a child in clause 1 of the Bill. As this is a Bill which will be applicable to Bantu persons, it is important to have clarity in regard to the question of who is a dependant as far as children are concerned. The definition embraces a child born out of a customary union, as defined in the Bantu Administration Act of 1927, and also the child of a deceased member who was born out of such a customary union or a marriage as so defined. However, there is the position of the adopted child which is not included in this definition. Incidentally, this definition is something which I have been unable to find in any other Acts dealing with pension schemes and the various State pension funds as they exist at the present time. Then there is the position of the Bantu who has a child who was not born out of such a customary union or out of a normal marriage, but who is paying for the maintenance of such a child. Such a child is therefore a dependant. We would like to know whether it is not possible for the hon. the Deputy Minister to give consideration to this aspect so as to broaden the basis on which this joint pension fund is to be established. The other aspect also concerning the child and dependants of members included in this Bill is that in other pension funds and legislation regarding pensions, provision is made whereby dependants can also be classified as a dependant where that child is still attending a full-time educational institution. The definition of a child is clearly stated as someone who has not attained the age of 18 years. In other words, if a member of the fund dies while he is still in service and he has dependent children who are still attending an educational institution after the age of 18, which is the case in many instances, such a child will not be considered to be a dependant in terms of this Bill. Perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister could give his consideration to this as well to see if it is not possible to bring about a greater degree of flexibility as far as this aspect is concerned.</p>

<p>The other funds referred to in the definition of &#x201C;revenue&#x201D;, like the Government non-White Employees Pension Fund and others, are also important aspects of this Bill. We have had the opportunity to compare the various provisions provided for in this Bill with existing legislation. The hon. the Deputy Minister referred to the position of local authorities and clause 3 (7) deals with the question of a person who is in the employ of a local authority when that local authority is declared as a department or body to be taken over by any undertaking in terms of this Bill by a Bantu authority. In other legislation passed in this House it was seen fit to have an enabling clause for such persons to have the right to elect whether they should join the fund or not of the new organization or body of which they have now become permanent employees. There is no election in this regard and it is felt that the hon. the Deputy Minister should perhaps give further thought to this particular aspect. It <span class="col_1209-1210" refersTo="page_0618"/>is sometimes very important, as in other legislation which was passed by this House fairly recently where special schools were taken over by the Central Government and where those persons were given the right to elect whether to remain a member of the Provincial Pension Fund to which they had previously belonged or whether to transfer their pension rights and become a member of the Government Service Pension Fund.</p>

<p>Similarly, when the Durban municipal telephone service was taken over by the Post Office Administration those employees were given the right to decide whether they should retain their pension benefits under their existing pension scheme, or whether they should transfer to the Government Service Pension Fund. Here there is no option, however. It is clearly stated in the Bill that they shall transfer their pension rights to the Bantu Authorities Service Pension Fund or the Superannuation Fund, if they belong to a provident fund of the local authority. This is one of the points we believe is an important one although one sees that provision is made at the end of the clause whereby it is stated that the benefits shall not be less or to the detriment of the employee on such transfer to the employ of the Bantu authority.</p>

<p>I think there are several other items which we on this side of the House would like to examine further during the Committee Stage and I therefore do not intend to deal with any details of some of the other clauses which are now before us. One important point is that we certainly accept the principle that where a person is in the employ of a State department, a local authority or a Bantu authority or an ordinary employer in the private sector, he should be entitled to belong to a pension fund, to contribute towards such a pension fund and, if they are not in the permanent employ of such an authority, to a superannuation fund or a provident fund. This has become an accepted fact among all the racial groups and we know that some of the legislation passed in this House has in recent times extended this to our non-White groups. I believe it is an encouraging sign that the Bantu people are now accepting the concept of the necessity of making provision for their old age, for their widows and for their dependants. This Bill sets out to do just that. It does provide an incentive for these people and indeed makes it compulsory for them to provide for the security of their old age, of their widows and of their dependants. In principle we accept this as being on the right lines, to see that all these persons are covered by a pension or a superannuation scheme.</p>

<p>My last point relates to the question of the delegation to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions of the administration of this Bill. We agree that this is essential. This department at present administers something like 30 pension funds and thus is the ideal department to deal with this matter too, because of the vast experience it has had in the administration of such funds. But this legislation appears to be Government policy in reverse. In the past we have had legislation which was introduced by the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions with provision for that legislation to be delegated to other departments, such as for Coloureds, for Indians and for Bantu. Now, however, we have a Bill being introduced by Bantu Administration delegating the power of administration back to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions.</p>

<p>With these comments I should like to say that this Bill is fully acceptable to us and we wish to see it being implemented successfully by the Bantu authorities when they have the opportunity of extending their own pension schemes to be covered by the provisions of these two funds.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I want to express my thanks, in particular to the hon. member for Umbilo for the calm and collected way in which he stated his case, and in general to the Opposition for the fact that they support this Bill. We know the hon. member for Umbilo to be a knowledgeable person on matters regarding pensions, and for that reason we welcome and appreciate the fact that he participated in this debate. We are dealing here with an important and a salutary matter; we are doing the Bantu a great service here, since we are here making machinery available to the Bantu, and want to help them to take over that machinery themselves in due course and want in that way to lead them to a point where they are eventually able to help themselves. I am glad the hon. member for Umbilo also views this matter in this way.</p>

<p>He is correct when he states that there are quite a number of matters here which can to far greater benefit be discussed in <span class="col_1211-1212" refersTo="page_0619"/>the Committee Stage. However, there are a few points which he mentioned to which I want to furnish a reply at this stage already; perhaps this will facilitate further discussion. The hon. member referred to the case where a Bantu official of the Transkei, for example, is transferred to another territorial authority, and asked whether in such a case it would be possible for his pension benefits to be transferred as well. This Bill makes provision for that, and my reply to the hon. member as far as this is concerned, is therefore &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As regards the definition of &#x201C;dependant&#x201D; and of &#x201C;child&#x201D;, these are matters in regard to which one could have a long, general and interesting discussion. As the hon. member was quite right in saying, we are dealing here with two aspects: On the one hand the customary Bantu law in regard to ties and on the other hand ties in terms of our Christian traditions and set-up. That is why we must, when we are defining &#x201C;dependant&#x201D; and &#x201C;child&#x201D;, take this thoroughly into account. I can give the hon. member the assurance that this has in fact been done.</p>

<p>Before elucidating this matter further, I just want to say that the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions was naturally involved in the drafting of this Bill; in fact, it was drawn up by them, in conjunction of course with senior officials of my Department. The obligation to support an illegitimate child&#x2014;I am mentioning this as an example to show how we set to work&#x2014;rests, according to Bantu law and Bantu custom, on the parents of the mother. The parents may, however, in terms of Bantu law and Bantu custom, lay a claim against the natural father, a claim for damages, for example. Our courts recognize this Bantu law and Bantu custom, but went even a little further by saying that when the grandparents cannot for some reason or other support the child, the courts of course hold the father responsible. The welfare of the child is the decisive factor.</p>

<p>In this Bill &#x201C;dependants&#x201D; are defined for the purposes of the Bill itself&#x2014;for example in clause 3 (a). In addition provision will be made in the regulations in terms of clause 5 (1) (b) for the person who is entitled to benefits upon the death of a member of the pension or superannuation fund. The same thing is being done in the Public Service, that is, it is being done by way of regulation. Provision will be made therein for any person who in terms of law should have been maintained by the deceased member, as well as for any person whom he was normally maintaining. In other words, we are going even a little further here than was requested by the hon. member, if I understood him correctly. It includes the maintenance of an illegitimate child, for whom the natural father was responsible. It will also include cases where a member was supporting his aged or indigent parents. Hon. members will note from this that we are approaching this matter sympathetically, and that it is our intention to make provision in the regulations for dependants in a wide sense &#x2014;as in the case of the Public Service Pension Fund. In point of fact this Bill followed the pattern of the Public Service Pension Act; except for minor differences it is basically the same.</p>

<p>When I say that we are approaching this matter of dependants sympathetically and will attach a wide interpretation to the concept in the regulations, I must in the same breath utter just a few warning words. The hon. member will know that according to Bantu custom in regard to children and dependants there is an extensive system in terms of which the Bantu themselves make provision, in accordance with their traditions and customs, for their dependants. We must therefore try to create the necessary balance here between that traditional Bantu custom, which is a fine one, of caring for their children and dependants themselves, and on the other hand to make the necessary provision, as we are doing in this Bill, for the dependants, by way of pension benefits.</p>

<p>I want to give the hon. member for Umbilo the assurance that this is precisely what we will try to do. We will try on the one hand, in conjunction with the Department of Pensions to take the traditional Bantu law and customs into account and not try to detract from them, and on the other hand to display sympathy in actual cases of deprivation, where we will attach a wider interpretation to the law to include not only illegitimate children or children who must be supported, but even dependent grandparents as well. In other words, we will try to implement the legislation in a sympathetic way.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised another point which is very important in respect of subsection (7) on page 12, which deals <span class="col_1213-1214" refersTo="page_0620"/>with local authorities. He requested that a member of the pension fund be able to exercise a choice. I want to tell the hon. member that I am prepared to reconsider this, but I do not think that it will be very easy to give effect to that request of the hon. member. The matter was discussed thoroughly with the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions in the course of our discussions when drafting the Bill. They pointed out that the right to exercise a choice would create problems since we are dealing here with Bantu. The hon. member is of course correct in saying that the Bantu are given a choice in the other Bill which I shall submit soon, viz. the Bantu Affairs Administration Bill. The choice is in fact left to a member there that he can remain a member of the pension fund of the local authority, or may become a member of the pension fund of the new council. But in this case the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions felt strongly that it should rather not be stated in that way, i.e. that a choice may be exercised here, but that the principle must be accepted that a member will not lose out if he transfers to the other pension fund. That is why the Bill reads as it does here, because the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions states that it will create confusion if such a choice is allowed.</p>

<p>Sir, with this I think I have dealt with the most important points raised by the hon. member. If there are any further points to which I have not replied, I shall gladly do so in the Committee Stage. It has been a great pleasure for me that we have been able to discuss this Bill in such a pleasant manner, a fine Bill in which we are trying to do the Bantu a service.</p>

<heading>ROAD TRAFFIC AND ROAD SAFETY SYSTEM</heading>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move the motion standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the desirability of establishing a centrally controlled, co-ordinated road traffic and road safety system, and in doing so to give particular attention to&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) possible amendments of the penal provisions;</li>

<li>(b) stricter application of traffic laws; and</li>

<li>(c) protection of road surfaces against destruction in consequence of overloading.</li>

</ol>

<p>This motion is actually in the form of a serial, because year after year this same subject is debated either here, in the Other Place, by way of a private motion or in a debate. I should like to refer to an occasion in 1964, Sir, when you were kind enough to allow me to debate this subject in terms of section 25 of the Standing Orders. In commencing I should like to quote what the hon. the Minister of Transport said on that occasion. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When one considers that an average of 12 people lose their lives and that 170 people are injured on our roads each day, one is completely horrified. It is not only the financial loss that our country suffers, but it is also the loss of manpower and of young lives. About 65 per cent of the accidents are to persons between the ages of 25 and 49&#x2014; people who are in the prime of their lives. Efforts are made by bodies, organizations, the Press and the radio to reduce this toll, but it seems as though these appeals simply make no impression on people. It is a tragic but true fact that 90 per cent of accidents are caused by human error. The number of accidents caused by mechanical failures is comparatively small. Human fallibility, negligence, indifference and thoughtlessness cause 90 per cent of the accidents.</block>

<p>There we have the hon. the Minister of Transport in 1964.</p>

<p>But, Sir, now seven years later we are faced with the problem and find that the position has in no way changed since the hon. the Minister made those statements. That position continues, and if we look at the present statistics&#x2014;and I do not want to bore you with a lot of statistics&#x2014;we find that the position is deteriorating every year and that the problem is actually getting <span class="col_1215-1216" refersTo="page_0621"/>bigger and bigger. Sir, I just want to quote you two figures in connection with the number of traffic accidents that have increased as follows: In 1966 there were 152,000 in round figures; in 1967, 163,000; in 1968, 168,000 and in 1969, 192,000, a gradual increase. Then let me quote you the number of casualties during these years: 1966, 5,700 people killed; 1967, 5,900; then a slight decrease in 1968 to 5,800, and in 1969 an increase to 6,600. Stated in different terms this means that the annual number of people we kill on our roads is equal to the number of White inhabitants of a town such as Mafeking or Delmas or Parys in the Free State or Riversdale in the Cape. This means that the total number of White inhabitants of such towns are wiped out annually on our roads.</p>

<p>What is alarming is that the accident rate in our own country is three-and-a-half times greater than that of Britain and Australia, but six times greater than that of the United States of America. Another disturbing fact that I want to mention to you is that an insurance company found that 52 per cent of the claims resulting from the death of persons younger than 25 years of age were the result of road accidents. This means on the one hand that it is chiefly young people who are the victims of the road accidents, but on the other hand it means that the type of person who has his life insured is specifically the man who has qualified himself in a field or who is indispensable; he is usually someone who has studied and someone with a family. The extent of the tragedy is therefore greater than one notices at first glance. Sir, so much for the problem.</p>

<p>The answer to this problem is not a simple and obvious one, and the solutions are in no way simple ones at all. A very large number of factors are responsible for the slaughter taking place on our roads. Finding the solution to it is a whole complex problem. Sir, I want to make the statement that our road traffic system is obsolete and useless and in places also dangerous. Time does not allow me to elaborate on this in detail; I shall just mention a few examples to you briefly in proof of my statement. Firstly, as regards the approaches to our freeways we find from place to place that the control over traffic that can land up on the wrong side of a freeway is altogether inadequate. Provision is simply not made, particularly in bad light, to ensure that traffic does not land up in the wrong lanes of a freeway. You see examples of this very near at hand, here in the Cape. I shall mention another example where planning is very bad and can possibly cause accidents. If one drives up from the docks along the Heerengracht one finds that there are pedestrian robots immediately preceding traffic islands. The drivers of motor cars are so conditioned that when a light turns green it means that they can drive off, but then they must still take traffic into consideration that has already entered the traffic circle and therefore enjoys precedence. A position is therefore created in which an accident could very possibly take place if a person did not take that into consideration. I want to mention another example to you in the Cape, and I am now not singling the Cape out for one or other reason; I am only doing it because all of us here are familiar with the position. We have a corner here in the Cape at the intersection of Buitengracht and Waterkant Streets where Somerset Road enters. Five roads intersect there without there being any control whatsoever. There is an unbroken white line round a corner to Somerset Road, but no-one has yet been able to tell me who has precedence there and who does not. A situation has been created there that could lead to an accident at any moment, and no-one knows exactly what to expect there.</p>

<p>But there is also another aspect of our obsolete traffic control, and that is the obtusion we are instilling in our people. We condition our people to ignore certain traffic signs. Sir, if you drive in from Paarl there are repairs being done to the freeway in the vicinity of Brackenfell. There is a traffic sign erected with a speed limit of 25 miles an hour, but at that stage the work had already been concluded; the tar road has been repaired and there is still machinery to indicate that work had been done, but there is still a speed limit of 25 miles an hour. I am convinced that there is not one motor car in ten thousand using that road that keeps to that speed limit. Our people are being blunted into ignoring such road traffic signs. If we drive through our country we very frequently find that at the approach to a town, where the municipal land begins, there is a speed limit. It is in the veld, half a mile or a mile away from the built-up area, but because it is by chance municipal property, there is a speed limit for which there is no sense or reason and for which one cannot see <span class="col_1217-1218" refersTo="page_0622"/>the logic. The result is that 99 per cent of motorists ignore it and the obtusion process therefore continues, so that people do not pay attention to road traffic signs.</p>

<p>Sir, at present we have beautiful freeways in our country. I wonder how many motorists use those freeways correctly and utilize their full potential. We have heard that in the Transvaal there is an ordinance that provides that a certain minimum speed should be maintained on the freeways, but I wonder if prosecutions have ever taken place of people travelling too slowly and presenting a very great danger on those freeways. It is simply not done. In all the miles that I have driven on these roads I have never seen a traffic officer stopping anyone travelling in the right hand lane and telling him that he is a danger to other traffic on that road. Our concepts in this respect are obsolete. In order to make my next statement I want to quote the hon. the Minister again, once more from Hansard of 1964, column 2305. On that occasion the hon. the Minister of Transport said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wanted very much to introduce the Central Road Traffic Bill&#x2014;not that I thought for one moment that it would reduce the number of accidents because one cannot reduce the number of accidents by means of legislation&#x2014;but I did think that it would contribute to that end. It would at least have been a start, not only to bring about uniformity because we already have a reasonable amount of uniformity today as far as the ordinances in the various provinces are concerned but it would at least have eliminated the long delays that take place when those ordinances have to be amended. There are sometimes long delays in having sound proposals that are made embodied in those ordinances, proposals that will assist in avoiding accidents, and a law of this nature would eliminate those delays.</block>

<p>Sir, legislation had already been drafted at that stage. For the reasons he mentioned the hon. the Minister of Transport decided not to submit the legislation. But the hon. the Minister said that it was a start, and I want to make use of the same point of departure and say that if we can obtain uniform legislation, if we can obtain a uniform, centralized and co-ordinated road traffic system, it is not necessarily a magic formula to solve all traffic problems, but it is a point of departure from which development will take place and from which a great deal that is beneficial can result.</p>

<p>I want to state here that during a period of seven years, since that debate took place here, the provinces have in no way succeeded in reducing the accident rate either by way of ordinances or by way of control, neither have they created a basis for the solution of the problem. Therefore they appear powerless to handle this problem as desired. Hence my repeated plea today that this House should pass legislation to tackle this problem.</p>

<p>The Road Safety Council is doing a great deal of meritorious work in this connection, and I should like to give them the praise they deserve. They made certain recommendations, and I merely want to mention a few of them. Time does not allow me to quote. The Road Safety Council is giving constant attention to the problem, and doing what is necessary in that connection in terms of the Act which called this Council into being; but the Council does not in any way have the executive powers to have their recommendations implemented. I gather that the commission of inquiry that was appointed to investigate this Council is present, and I do not in any way want to anticipate their findings or their subsequent report. I just want to say that I believe that the time has come for the Act to be so amended that the Road Safety Council can also draw up legislation and submit it to this hon. House so that more rapid action can be taken with the bottlenecks that exist.</p>

<p>I want to refer to a centrally-controlled traffic force. It is a present-day phenomenon that almost every town in the country has its own traffic force, larger or smaller as their needs may be, and in addition that we also have a separate traffic force in each province. Apart from the fact that everyone&#x2019;s uniforms differ and that one never knows precisely with what authority one is dealing, particularly if one is not an inhabitant of the area or province and is a tourist, no uniform training whatsoever exists, no uniform code according to which they act and no centralized organization. I do not want to go into this point any further. Other hon. members on my side of the House will refer to this in greater detail at a later stage.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the penal provisions referred to in my motion, and here I want to quote the hon. the Minister once more. In 1964 the hon. the Minister again said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1219-1220" refersTo="page_0623"/>The strict application of the law is also a requirement. One of our difficulties is that the law is not always applied strictly enough. It is as I have said on a previous occasion. A person may be an absolute coward, a complete nonentity but when he gets behind the steering wheel of a car, he becomes a confident hooligan. The only way to deal with that sort of person is to apply the law strictly. That person ought never to be allowed behind a steering wheel. If a person drives a car while under the influence of liquor, he is guilty of murder if he runs somebody down and kills him. If he kills a person in any other way while he is under the influence of liquor, he is very severely punished by the court. Drunken drivers who kill people are actually guilty of murder and the punishment imposed by our courts is sometimes completely inadequate. I say that the strict application of the law is a must.</block>

<p>We find a strange phenomenon in our application of the law in respect of traffic accidents. I just want to mention a few examples to illustrate this. I read in the newspaper recently that a person had picked flowers at Hout Bay and received a R400 fine for doing so. Another report referred to a person who had shot a klip springer buck in the vicinity of Touws River and was fined R700. And it is a well-known fact that if a person goes hunting illegally in the Transvaal Lowveld and in certain other parts of the country, his gun and his motor car are confiscated, in addition to any subsequent punishment the court may impose. We find strangely enough, however, that people commit very dangerous traffic violations, where human lives are endangered and frequently forfeited, without any comparable punishment being imposed upon them. We can wax lyrical about these small things such as game and flowers, but in these cases human lives are not yet at stake. When it comes to crimes against the person, I regret to say that in no way are the same criteria and the same seriousness reflected in the action that is taken. In saying this I do not in any way want to reflect upon the discretion of the courts. The principle of minimum punishment exists in our legal system. I think the time has come for minimum punishments also to be incorporated into our law in respect of traffic offences. With our present-day standard of living it is no punishment to speak of if a fine of R50 or R100 is imposed on anyone. I think it must be brought home to a person in physical terms. In this connection I want to refer to an example here in Cape Town. I read in the newspaper recently that Dr. Chris Barnard was very upset because his motor car had been towed away after he had been guilty of a traffic offence in the city. Sir, I do not believe that it would have inconvenienced him very much if a slight fine had been imposed upon him, but the very fact that he was very tangibly made aware of an offence he had committed upset him a great deal more. In all probability he will not commit the same offence again. I gather that in a South American country there is no such thing as a punishment for someone who over-parks. A traffic officer who notices something like that simply lets the air out of the car&#x2019;s tyres and leaves it there. I am told that people in those countries simply do not over-park. Our concepts must change. We must bring such an offence home to people in a tangible way.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary for us to have special traffic courts to handle traffic offences. I am informed that at present our courts are overburdened and that the time simply cannot be found for dealing with these cases as desired. There are many magistrates who have reached retirement age who can still give very valuable service to our country. Then there are also retired prosecutors and other staff that can give a great deal more service. I think that they could very profitably be used in traffic courts.</p>

<p>A past hon. member of this House, Major Van der Byl, recently recommended that so-called T-men be appointed. These persons would belong to a voluntary organization that will be empowered to report traffic offences. Time does not allow me to discuss the merits of the case, but I consider it to be a valuable suggestion in the sense that it will help us to identify the roadhog. If they are linked to the central traffic bureau they will be in a position to find out eventually who the people are who repeatedly commit such offences.</p>

<p>I now come to the last part of my motion. This is the question of road surfaces and their destruction as a result of heavy vehicles. I said earlier that we had beautiful freeways in our country. I am thinking, for example, of the Ben Schoeman highway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which carries very heavy traffic and provides for a very big need. Some of <span class="col_1221-1222" refersTo="page_0624"/>these roads cost between R400,000 and R600,000 per mile. We have a beautiful freeway into the Transvaal from Johannesburg and Pretoria East. We have a lovely freeway between Paarl and Cape Town. Is it really necessary for heavy vehicles, with all their limitations, to be allowed onto those roads&#x003F; There is always the old road that was used before these freeways were made available. The heavy vehicles always made use of it in any case in conjunction with other traffic. I do not consider it an unreasonable suggestion that heavy vehicles should use the roads that existed before the freeways were constructed. The freeways can then be set aside for fast traffic. They will then really serve the purpose designated by their name. Those other roads, the old roads, can in any case still carry the heavy vehicles, because such vehicles move at a slower speed. One of the problems we encounter on these roads is the consistent overloading by heavy vehicles. Another hon. member will refer to the damage done on these expensive roads by heavy vehicles, without any reason existing why they should make use of these roads. The excuse has been mentioned that these heavy vehicles will be compelled to maintain a minimum speed of 35 miles per hour. But this does not happen in practice. No attention whatsoever is given to offences in that connection. On the contrary. One frequently finds that a heavy vehicle is moving at 20 miles per hour, while another one is moving behind him at 25 miles per hour. It makes use of the other lane to pass the first lorry, with the result that for a whole mile there are two lorries in the road that no one can get past. American researchers have determined without doubt that speed as such is not the cause of accidents, but that in this connection uniformity of speed is important. When a number of vehicles, properly spaced, are moving along an expressway at high speed there is little danger of accidents. But when speed irregularities develop as a result of one heavy vehicle passing another, or something of that nature, the accident potential increases by a tremendous percentage. Therefore, in order to utilize those expressways to the full it is necessary that these heavy vehicles be prohibited from using these expressways.</p>

<p>My time is almost up. In conclusion I just want to say that I believe that the Road Safety Council must still be used as a condenser to condense all the diverse factors giving rise to our high road accident figure into a form in which they can be made available to this hon. House, which in turn can convert this into legislation. I feel that rapid legal amendments are necessary when bottlenecks develop in our traffic ordinances and traffic laws. There must be no hesitation in applying stricter laws. What I suggest is no instant solution. Indeed, no instant solution exists. But it is nevertheless a start along a long and very difficult road towards the eventual end. We must start somewhere. I believe that if this is done in the way I advocated, we have made a correct start.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Middelburg on the presentation of his case in regard to road safety. I intend in the course of my speech to deal with the various points that he made.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that no single problem probably confronts South Africa as much as road safety itself, because all of us know of family or friends who have been affected by the high accident rate on South Africa&#x2019;s roads. No other subject has probably received more discussion privately than road safety. In no other field I believe are there so many experts as there are in the field of road safety. Any discussion among two or three people will result in every single one of them putting forward a different idea as to the cause of road accidents and how to eliminate them. But because there are so many experts or so-called experts and because so many of us are jealous of our rights as drivers or representatives or officials of bodies, perhaps so little has been effectively done to reduce the high accident rate on South Africa&#x2019;s roads. I can remember when we discussed, not very long ago, the 70 miles per hour speed limit in this House. Members on both sides of the House agreed or disagreed that speed was a relevant factor in motor accidents. I can remember people on both sides of the House saying that 70 miles per hour as a speed limit was far too low. Such an august body as the Automobile Association was hesitant about suggesting that the introduction of a 70 miles per hour speed limit would help to reduce accidents on our roads. And, of course, the hon. member for Paarl does not like the 70 miles per hour speed limit either. I believe too that the driver of the Administrator of Natal does not like the speed limit of 70 miles per hour either. I <span class="col_1223-1224" refersTo="page_0625"/>do not want to labour the issue whether speed is or is not the guiding factor in regard to accidents. I am also one of the thousands upon thousands of experts on road accidents in South Africa and I am one of those who believe that speed is an overriding factor in all motor vehicle accidents. Whether this in itself is important, is another matter. I would like to suggest that one of the guiding factors, certainly in regard to the freeways the hon. member for Middelburg mentioned, is that people who have been travelling on a freeway at a speed of 60 or even 70 miles per hour, when turning into a side road, find it hard to reduce speed to 35 or 25 miles per hour. I believe that this is one of the faults of our traffic engineers. Here again, I am playing the expert, as well, on how to avoid motor accidents.</p>

<p>One of the most important points in my mind is that we in South Africa do not give sufficient attention to the people who control our road traffic, namely the road engineers. I believe that one of the first things we must do in South Africa, is raise the status of people responsible for road safety. I think this is a most important matter. Surely the road engineer, who is responsible for the design of the roads, its camber, its locality and for the construction of the road, plays a most important part in road safety. Therefore his status should be elevated to the position it deserves.</p>

<p>We have had criticism of the type of paint used on roads. The yellow paint was criticized in Cape Town recently as causing skidding in rainy weather. Here again the road engineer plays an important role. It has been suggested that we should have fewer road signs on our major roads, rather than the many we have today. All these are factors in the control of road safety. All too often the recommendations of the people concerned with road safety go ignored. We have had reports issued in South Africa, going back for many years, but when one analyses these reports, one soon discovers to one&#x2019;s horror that very few of their recommendations have been implemented. In my own constituency there is a tree which is known to have caused at least two fatal accidents. On receiving the advice of the Road Safety Council of the city that the tree be removed, the local authorities decided they preferred the beauty of the tree rather than have it removed in the interest of road safety. This is something which has been happening over the years. We have had road safety councils and authorities recommending that intersections in certain areas be done away with. But all their recommendations fall on deaf ears and the accident tolls at those particular intersections continues to mount. One of the major faults of road safety in South Africa is that the experts are ignored, because they have too little authority.</p>

<p>We have been told that, where we must start with regard to road safety, is to educate the driver, but we must also educate the pedestrian, particularly the African who is so often the victim. We must realize that the driver as well as the pedestrian are human beings with human failures and that the effect of the education of the driver and the pedestrian is going to take a long time to be felt. What we can do, and do speedily, is rectify some of the matters under our control. For instance, the testing of drivers varies from province to province. It varies from city to city and from town to town. In some towns the driver&#x2019;s licence test is a very severe one, but one can travel no more than 20 miles to the next town and find that one can obtain a driver's licence very easily indeed. It has always been strange to me that a person once having obtained that driver&#x2019;s licence, retains it for life. I believe that there should be some form of re-testing of drivers. I believe that this is one way in which we can ensure that the people driving on our roads are at least qualified to do so.</p>

<p>I would mainly like to deal with the traffic police, who play such an important part in road safety. It has been said that one of the greatest effective deterrents with regard to road safety is for the driver to see a traffic policeman in his rear view mirror. I can remember that the then member for Durban Central, Dr. Radford, made a suggestion in this House that our traffic police should not hide behind corners and in ditches, but rather that they should be seen. At that time he even suggested, as a possibility, that the traffic police might be dressed in red uniforms so that everyone could see them. I am not suggesting that our traffic police should be dressed in red uniforms, but the point Dr. Radford was making at the time was that the very presence of a policeman has the effect of reducing accidents. In Japan they have gone so far as to erect plastic dummy traffic policemen, because they found that the presence of these dummy policemen on the roads reduced the toll of accidents on that <span class="col_1225-1226" refersTo="page_0626"/>particular road. The driver never knows whether the figure he sees is a dummy or a real live person. We so often find in our cities in South Africa that the time of our traffic police is taken up in issuing tickets for parking offences and so on. In the city of Durban the traffic police force is 60 per cent under establishment, though the number of vehicles has increased by over 60 per cent over the last ten years. The only part of the force which is up to establishment is the meter maid force. It seems to be the pattern throughout the major cities in South Africa that local authorities concentrate on earning revenue by issuing parking tickets for parking offences rather than preventing accidents and keeping their vehicles moving. It has been suggested and it works in certain States of America, that the traffic force be concentrated only on the major arterial roads of the cities. The force is concentrated in full there, so that the driver sees the traffic policemen on the road and becomes disciplined to the presence of a traffic policeman. He finds himself applying this discipline, which he learns on the arterial roads, on the minor roads of the cities. As with the roads engineers, one of the first things we must surely do, is elevate the status of all traffic policemen. Their rate of pay is far too low for the work they do or the responsibility they carry. It is my firm conviction that we will never come near to solving our road traffic problem until we treat traffic policemen and all people concerned with traffic control far better than we do at present, and that we pay them at least according to their responsibility of the job that they hold.</p>

<p>In some parts of the world traffic wardens are employed. In certain cities in this country we now have traffic wardens or traffic police reservists used to direct traffic. I want to suggest that our traffic authorities in South Africa give serious consideration to this particular point and make far more use of traffic police reservists because, with the shortage of manpower, it is unlikely that we will solve our traffic police shortage very easily. Traffic wardens could serve the same purpose as the South African Police reservists do at the present time, but I believe that traffic wardens will be ineffective if they are used to control stationary traffic. They must be supplied with vehicles to enable them to patrol moving traffic. It is no earthly good putting them on point duty or issuing parking tickets. The problem of traffic in South Africa and the high accident rate on our roads is caused by moving traffic offences and not by stationary ones. Our traffic control, and our traffic police reservists, or wardens, should be used for this purpose and this purpose only. In America they have a system of sending out warning letters. When they notice an offence, members of the traffic police reserve report it to a central body and this body sends a warning letter to the offender. The offender can, after having been sent a number of warning letters, be brought to court. In England the use of the breathalyzer has resulted in a reduction in the number of accidents in the U.K. Thus, in the period 1962-&#x2019;68 the number of traffic accidents were reduced despite an increase of 48 per cent in the number of vehicles on the road. There is too little propaganda here about the use of traffic belts and too much propaganda about the speed of vehicles. One can see an advertisement being shown in our cinemas at the moment in which the emphasis is entirely on the speed that particular vehicle can attain. While I do not suggest that we should have some form of control over our advertisers, I nevertheless believe that if we were to make our feelings felt strongly enough people responsible for advertising of this sort would realize that it is not popular because it only adds to the traffic hazards and deaths on our roads.</p>

<p>I also feel we should have a standing committee for the consideration of all suggestions in regard to traffic improvement. A number of suggestions have been sent to me over the past few years, suggestions motivated by a sincere wish to supply a need. I suppose the hon. the Minister knows about the gentleman in Pretoria who designed a barrier for unprotected railway crossings. However, it seems to me that these suggestions invariably reach a dead end. Who is there to implement their ideas&#x003F; Therefore I should like to see a standing committee for the purposes of considering such suggestions. The hon. member for Middelburg made reference to traffic courts, and I agree with him. We shall never make the best use of our traffic police while they have to waste their time waiting to give evidence in magistrates&#x2019; courts sometimes for very minor offences. Therefore I feel that we should give serious consideration to this suggestion of the hon. member. This is the only way in which we shall be able to make full use of the available manpower.</p>

<p><span class="col_1227-1228" refersTo="page_0627"/>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to pay particular attention to State vehicles. These vehicles are responsible, on average, for a higher rate of accidents than the vehicles of the public. It may well be argued that these vehicles have to travel on all sorts of roads and under all sorts of conditions, but propaganda in regard to road safety may well be directed towards these vehicles as well. What we really need is a streamlining of our present system. Far more powers should be given to our regional councils, our regional road safety councils, more power than they have at present. At the present moment a regional council has to approach its head office for the most mundane type of thing. Furthermore, I feel that if road safety councils were reduced in number they could be more effective. Too much money allocated to the Road Safety Council is being wasted on administration; their staffs are far too large. On the Road Safety Council itself there are representatives of bodies who do not have the same degree of interest in road safety as others who are perhaps not represented. What we really require, I think, is an executive made up of the 15 regional councils plus ten representatives from organizations who are intimately concerned with road safety. This can bring about a far more effective control than we have at present.</p>

<p>With this in view I should like to move as an amendment to the motion proposed by the hon. member for Middelburg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;centrally controlled&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;more effective&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to support the motion of the hon. member for Middelburg on the basis of certain remarks I shall make in the course of my speech. At the same time I want to thank the hon. member for the enthusiasm he has displayed in again bringing this matter to the attention of the House today for the umpteenth time. It is virtually a platitude to say that as far as safety is concerned, we are dealing with one of the greatest enemies of our people. At the same time we have here one of the most complex and intricate problems of modern times. Road accidents not only claim an appallingly high toll of human lives annually, but are at the same time responsible for, relatively speaking, the greatest number of disabled, people who are injured in road accidents and cannot develop to their full potential. That is one of the tragic consequences of road accidents, alongside of the fact that annually so many human lives are claimed.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#schoeman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before the adjournment this morning I made the statement that road accidents could be regarded as one of the biggest causes of retardation throughout the whole world. In my humble opinion it is time for us in South Africa to give proper and very serious attention to the possibility of applying a very much more dynamic programme to the combating of road accidents. It must not only be dynamic, but very serious consideration must also be given to the possibility of letting the emphasis fall on other fields and on more fields than has been the case up to the present time. South Africa not only has the highest accident rate in the world, relatively speaking, but it has also been proven here, as it has elsewhere, that the enemy cannot successfully be dealt with by regulation alone. We have proved that the symbol of the uniform has not yet got through to people sufficiently.</p>

<p>For that reason it is my well-considered opinion that it has indeed become time for us to give attention to other areas upon which the emphasis must fall. Apart from this one must, to one&#x2019;s own sorrow, and unfortunately without fear of contradiction, admit that the South African pedestrian and cyclist are among the most undisciplined in the world. It is generally accepted that human beings in motion, in order of importance, contribute at least 80 per cent to this question. Road construction and motor vehicles are only responsible for the remaining 20 per cent. An endeavour to approach people in the first place and to persuade them is in my opinion the basis of the renewal that must come in the approach to this problem. In the approach to this problem we must single out, from amongst the basic <b>factors,</b> the lack of safety consciousness and the possible absence of the minimum intellectual ability necessary for the development of safety consciousness. Every person in South Africa must today be regarded as a potential source of power for the development of our country. This applies in respect of culture, economy, the sciences and all <span class="col_1229-1230" refersTo="page_0628"/>other sectors of our national economy. The destruction of life and happiness, of potential and production ability through road accidents, is a matter that strikes deep. It is also a platitude to say that no-one today will deny that road accidents are chiefly the result of carelessness and lack of education on the part of the drivers on our roads. We are very glad for what Education and organizations such as Road Safety are trying to achieve today to better equip and educate our people. But unfortunately we must admit that this is hopelessly inadequate. Awareness of danger is a matter of the mind, and what we need here is a stimulation of minds to activate them to such an extent that they will declare war on this merciless enemy. This brings me once again to my point of departure, that education is the basis in our tackling of this problem. The question crops up about what is being done today in our private homes, in our schools, in the army, among our motor mechanics and their apprentices and at our technical colleges in order to make a contribution. This is such a serious matter that we must be satisfied with nothing less than that the awareness of danger and an orientation towards the avoidance of road accidents must become a part of our personality structure; if this does not happen we are wide of the mark. This applies particularly to our young people, who furnish the greatest number of people who lose their lives in road accidents are under 18 years of age and 65 per cent fall into the age group between 18 and 50 years, more than half of which again fall into the age group between 18 and 24 years. In other words, more than half of the total number of fatal accidents belong to the age group 24 years and younger&#x2014;the future citizens of our country. One sometimes gains the impression that this matter is not judged at its true value, and the question arises about whether the time has not come for serious attention to be given to getting road safety instituted as a statutory body under the Department of Transport, particularly with a view to standardization and co-ordination of all activities in this field. If one takes into consideration the number of funds made available for this matter and the body that must apply this for advertising purposes, one cannot but deduce that this is a terrain where we have let things slide a little. There will be excuses&#x2014;for example it will be said that enough of a positive nature is being done; what more can be done&#x003F; In the thirties a balanced programme was introduced in America to fight this enemy. Then the figure stood at .28 per annum for every million traffic miles. In 1960 the figure stood at .053&#x2014;a decrease of 80 per cent! And that as a result of the programme that was set up to deal with this enemy. This is indeed a very praiseworthy effort. Also, it ought to serve as a stimulus for us to give this matter very serious attention after we have made the necessary investigation. In my humble opinion there are already sufficient statistics and there is sufficient proof at our disposal for us to adopt a final positive and progressive standpoint in this connection.</p>

<p>In support of this motion I should like to make very serious representations to the hon. the Minister himself, to the effect that he and this Department of Transport should take the necessary positive steps to consider whether what we have suggested is not possible. In my opinion the following argument is very simple logic. This problem must first be approached from the point of view of local communities. We must consider establishing local bureaux; an office in each town that will be orientated towards trying to preserve life on the road. As an aid to these offices there can be a central control that will channel standardization, the necessary information and education through such a local office to the various fronts and layers of our society to which I have already referred. We must give consideration to offices where travelling motorists can report other reckless drivers. They can, for example, furnish the registration numbers of such cars. Cameras can be placed at strategic positions so that photographs can be taken throughout the day of people driving on the wrong side of the white line, who do not stop, who are reckless and who are driving too fast. With the aid of closed circuit television similar information can be gathered and furnished to that travel or traffic bureau. These traffic bureaux can be manned by officers who can confront the guilty parties with that information. In the first case it can take the form of a warning. This can be done by post if need be. These officers can carry out the same function as our welfare officers in our Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. They will be locally linked up with a traffic court. Such an offender can be warned three times. After that the law can be set in motion. We have already admitted that the uniform <span class="col_1231-1232" refersTo="page_0629"/>and regulations alone are not sufficient. We must act positively and sympathetically as public relations officers that can guide the public throughout the year and serve on the delimited level of local communities. I have no doubt that we will achieve positive results in this connection.</p>

<p>There must be continuity and standardization. This can only happen with the help of centralized control. This is nothing unusual in our society. Up until 1936 the traffic police formed a section of the Department of Transport. Then, however, it was abolished. I personally do not quite know for what reasons this was done. The traffic police could easily be linked up to that Department again so that we can have a fixed ethical code according to which action can be taken by all traffic officers throughout the country. The traffic tickets, the cabling across the roads and the positioning behind trees must make way for the public relations officer and the sympathetic leader of such a community. How much time is not lost in trifling convictions&#x003F; How many manhours are not lost every day&#x003F; There are public prosecutors who admit that they handle as many as 10,000 traffic offence cases per year. A defendant must bring one or two witnesses along who have to spend a whole day in court, and two days if the case is postponed. One can work out how many man-hours are lost in this way, and frequently the accused is also found to be innocent and acquitted. In speaking of a code of honour I should like to refer to one example. A regulation exists as a counter measure, but it is an impersonal matter. It obtains its personal facets as a result of the interpretation process by the person handling it, i.e. the traffic officer. The traffic officer gives a soul to regulations or laws. He works with the public and must therefore cultivate a particular understanding and orientation. One gets the impression that these laws and regulations are being violated. Laws and regulations are being deprived of their personal facets. They are becoming dead letters of the law and an enemy of man. Man was surely not made for the law, it was the law which was made for man. One misses this too frequently in today&#x2019;s public life. I want to refer hon. members to a single example in clarification of my statement. In my constituency there was the case of a cartage contractor who was stopped by a traffic officer one day. That officer drew his finger across the lorry&#x2019;s bodywork and found that it was covered in soot. He then told this man that his lorry&#x2019;s diesel engine was emitting too much smoke and issued him with a ticket. The man then said that he was innocent, but the traffic officer paid no attention to him. The man then told the officer that he had transported coal on his lorry the previous day and that the soot had nothing to do with his lorry&#x2019;s engine. In court this man was found innocent because he could produce a certificate to the effect that his vehicle had been approved by the Johannesburg Municipality the previous day. He and his witnesses, however, lost one day. Here we have a case of the faulty interpretation of circumstances, and also of a regulation that is being made lifeless instead of being given life. The uniform must be relegated to the background and the man in the uniform must come forward as a sympathetic leader of the public. He must convey to the public and instill in them the fact that he is concerned about the life of the reckless driver and also his fellow travellers on that road. I personally think that we would then make greater progress.</p>

<p>My time is up, but before I resume my seat I should like to refer to the speech of the hon. member for Port Natal. When he began his speech I thought that we now had a case of the lion and the lamb lying down together in the face of the common enemy, i.e. death on the roads. That was unfortunately not the case. The lion and the lamb got a whiff of politics, and this amendment which the hon. member moved smells to me like a fine bit of politics. It smells so much like Natal that does not want to resign itself to centralization in this connection. I do not blame the hon. member because it is tactically correct. However, I just want to tell the hon. member that we do not agree with his amendment.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>At the outset, I am given to understand that the members of the Road Safety Council inquiry are present this afternoon and is also the general manager of the Road Safety Council. If I may. Sir. I would like to welcome them here this afternoon and thank them for the interest they are taking in this very important debate.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as the motion is concerned, the United Party supports it because it is actually United Party policy and consequently have always supported it. As the last speaker has said, with the exception of <span class="col_1233-1234" refersTo="page_0630"/>the few words &#x201C;centrally controlled&#x201D; we support this motion. I would like to thank the last speaker for the seriousness of his words in this debate; it is in fact a very serious matter. I would also like to thank the hon. member for Middelburg, who saw fit to introduce the motion during this Session. We were together in the Provincial Council in Natal for several years and I never knew that he took so much interest in this matter but I am glad to see that he does and I again thank him for introducing this motion.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Randburg mentioned the group of people of roundabout 25 years of age. Sir, to show you the seriousness of the matter, I want to say that I believe that for the first time in the history of South Africa there are more people under 25 years than people over 25 years, and I sincerely hope that that age group will take note of what the hon. member said here. When a suggestion is made in very good faith from this side of the House, it is automatically criticized by members on that side and very often vice versa; it is invariably claimed that the one or the other is making political propaganda. We will never make headway with road safety if we cannot co-operate in an endeavour to find a solution to this matter of great national importance. During the last session of Parliament I was taken to task by hon. members on that side, including the hon. the Deputy Minister for apparently having the temerity to criticize the S.A. Road Safety Council. Surely I would have been neglecting my duty if I had not done so when I felt that it was a worth-while national cause. Is the Council supposed to be immune to criticism&#x003F; Sir, my critics informed me that the hon. the Minister had already appointed a committee of inquiry to investigate the workings of the Road Safety Council. If there was no necessity for criticism, then why appoint a commission&#x003F; Apparently as a result of my criticism, the chairman and the members of the committee called upon me in that very connection. The first point I made was probably the most important. I informed them that if they wished to serve the country and road safety they should recommend that &#x201C;road safety be entirely removed from the political arena&#x201D;. I gained the impression in the past that we were debating from at least two different political angles with the result that we failed to achieve anything positive. This is bad. Sir, and we are probably to blame for the fact that the Road Safety Council now finds itself the subject matter of an official inquiry. What made matters worse, is the fact that the hon. the Minister of Transport denied that he had anything to do with the council and said that they were only there to advise. Surely they must fall under one or other ministerial portfolio; surely they must be under the protection of some Minister. The hon. the Deputy Minister virtually accused me of delivering a funeral oration on the Road Safety Council. Did he expect me to play a wedding march&#x003F; In the same breath, however, he said that there may be a great deal of truth in what I said. Of course, I agree with him on this last point because since the inception of the Road Safety Council, the general manager has built an empire around him in Pretoria, as I have previously stated, just another Government department. Subject to correction, Sir, I believe that we are paying for a staff of plus-minus 70 persons at some time or another. The Road Safety Council was brought into being by Act of Parliament during 1960. What, may I ask, have we seen for all the thousands of rands spent by them during the past decade&#x003F; Apart from the highway code, which has been revised and re-printed from time to time, road safety pamphlets and posters have lost all appeal to the general public. But the hon. the Minister had a surprise for us last year, as he described it&#x2014;something pleasant about the Road Safety Council. He announced that at long last they had published a booklet called &#x201C;Enjoyable Motoring&#x201D;. Here it is, if hon. members wish to see it. I immediately thought that here at last was something positive off the drawing boards of the Road Safety Council but, no, another disappointment! With the exception of one article, all the contributions are contributions from outside, with some extracts from well-known pamphlets. What was the purpose of publishing this &#x201C;Enjoyable Motoring&#x201D;&#x003F; Were copies distributed to schools and universities, White, Brown and Black, as road safety does not recognize colour or creed&#x003F; May I ask, who paid for the printing&#x003F; My copy cost me R1.50, so it was not intended for the low-income group of drivers. After all, let us be honest and admit that only a very small minority group of drivers can afford to pay that price to enable them to enjoy their motoring. This reminds me of a most useful booklet which a motor engineer in Pietermaritzburg compiled some years ago on kinetic energy and speed in feet per second, two of the most important aspects <span class="col_1235-1236" refersTo="page_0631"/>involved in accidents. This was submitted to Pretoria for publication, but as it did not originate from Pretoria we never heard of it again&#x2014;sad but very true.</p>

<p>Too great a proportion of the Road Safety Council&#x2019;s expenditure is, I suggest, devoted to never-ending research, the results of which are out of date before they become available, and to the production of verbose action programmes that never get off the table. Mr. Speaker, voluntary serving members of local road safety associations have long since lost all their interest in road safety mainly because of this dictatorial attitude of the Road Safety Council. I have stated that I personally think a motor engineer should be appointed as the new general manager to co-ordinate, and not to control, the activities of the five provincial road safety associations, including South-West Africa. But according to the motion it would appear as if the prince for the position has already been nominated and all that is required is this motion under our authority to crown him and to re-establish the council in Pretoria, so that we are back just where we were. I say distribute funds and allocate them evenly to the provinces and then let them get on with road safety and let them show provincial pride in their work in their provinces.</p>

<p>The authority of traffic officers is far too limited. They can arrest and detain a drunken driver, but as soon as possible they must hand the offending driver over to the S.A. Police to be charged and here their authority ceases. During the past festive season the newly appointed M.E.C. in charge of traffic control in Natal decided on a tough line of action. He ought to be commended for that, Sir. He stated in the Press that drivers found under the influence of liquor would be arrested and kept in gaol until they appeared in court. Statistics show that this had the necessary effect, as there was a marked drop in drunken driving offences, but unfortunately there was no law to enable traffic officers to carry out the threat of the M.E.C. As soon as these drivers were handed over to the police they became subject to the ordinary Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act, with the result that immediately they sobered up they applied for bail as they were entitled to do. Their applications were granted, in one case at the request of the person&#x2019;s attorney. Three hours later this person was re-arrested 50 miles away in another town for the same offence. I leave to your imagination, Sir, what the traffic officer had to say! Ten years ago, while still in the Provincial Council of Natal, I pleaded for the establishment of special traffic courts completely divorced from the criminal courts, and for the automatic suspension of driving licences for serious traffic offences, especially where persons were injured or killed or where there was driving under the influence of liquor. I do not wish to detain the House, but just to prove my point I should like to read a short article from the <i>Daily News</i> of 15th May, 1962, nearly a decade ago, and the heading is &#x201C;Road safety chief wants special traffic courts&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Special traffic courts with powers to suspend driving licences for reckless driving and for speeding were advocated in the Natal Provincial Council here last night by Capt. Smith of Pietermaritzburg South, the Secretary of the Pietermaritzburg and Midlands Safety Association.</block>

<p>It went on, and the one point I wanted to mention was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is it not worthwhile to take away the licence of a driver who infringed the law, say one month for the first offence, three months for the second, and six for the third&#x003F;</block>

<p>What happens on our roads today&#x003F; During a traffic blitz in Natal the other day a sports car was timed at 216 kilometres, 134 miles per hour, on the national road between Ladysmith and Van Reenen. He went so fast that they never caught him. Why must we have any consideration for drivers like these&#x003F; These are matters that the Road Safety Council should have taken up with the Minister with a view to having the law amended, but nothing has ever been done. I suggest that our ordinary criminal courts should be used during the evenings for this purpose. Retired magistrates, Police officers and Defence Force officers could adjudicate. They all have sufficient knowledge of court procedure. If holding a court at night is considered inconvenient for the accused, all the better, because this will further impress upon them the seriousness of their anti-social habits.</p>

<p><span class="col_1237-1238" refersTo="page_0632"/>*We can no longer afford to close our eyes to this serious matter. During the decade from 1960, since the functions of the Road Safety Council were placed on the Statute Book, accidents, fatalities and injuries have increased astronomically. Accordingly I cannot see how the Road Safety Council can claim any success as a direct result of their propaganda machine, whatever this may be. The figures speak for themselves, and they are disturbing. The number of accidents increased from 116,000 to 192,000. The number of persons killed in accidents increased from 3,040 to 6,605. The number of persons injured increased from 39,000 to 59,000. How can we afford this&#x003F; The question is, how dare the Government of the country allow the slaughter on our roads to continue unabated without doing something drastic to stop it, without mentioning the economic implications of the destruction of thousands of motor vehicles, which most probably run into millions of rands&#x003F; On page 5 of this booklet <i>Robot</i> we find the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Future task: Undoubtedly these proposals were put forward as clearly and explicitly in many previous annual reports. And the result&#x003F; Accidents keep on increasing rapidly, with the gruesome results of death and injury.</block>

<p>In column 5 on the same page it is suggested that the Government should provide more financial assistance. This amazes me, because I was under the impression that too much financial assistance was already being granted. It is in terms of an instruction of the committee during the 1969 financial year that they have to spend most of the amount allocated to them. They had too much money. I agree with the main speaker&#x2019;s appeal, or &#x201C;reveille&#x201D;, as it is termed, at the annual meeting. In the last paragraph they say that enough has been written and said about road safety. In order to make things safer for road users we should not delay any longer. Act now. Take positive action now. Do it now! And I add: What, in fact, must be done now&#x003F; The only sentence of any importance to the ordinary motorist is disqualification, and consequently the automatic suspension of licences of those drivers found guilty of causing serious accidents, one month for the first offence, three months for the second and six months for the third. This is reasonable, and the fourth offence should bring irrevocable cancellation of the licence; and believe me, Sir, there will be very few cancellations, and when licences are in fact cancelled, I say that society demands it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I regret that I have to give up some of my time to reply to the more negative parts of the speech of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. In the first place he quoted examples from his own field of experience. Those examples come from the province of Natal where there was a provincial council in power to which that hon. member could surely have stated his case. But nothing was done there.</p>

<p>The Road Safety Council is a body that gathers and processes information, that carries out research on a modest scale and then disseminates that information to the provinces again. One of the matters being debated today is specifically the question of whether that information and the results of their years of experience were properly disseminated and adapted in the Ordinances.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not know how long the hon. member has been sitting here. He has just come in. He should have been here when his hon. bench mate was speaking. He would then have known who brought politics into this debate. What is more, the hon. member reproaches us for having spent too much money on a body such as the Road Safety Council, but at the same time he appeals to the Government to promote road safety and put a stop to the slaughter on our roads. However, he does not take into consideration that in terms of money that slaughter on our roads costs us R96 million a year.</p>

<p>The hon. member has apparently read <i>Robot,</i> but does he know that it has been proved conclusively by a statistician of stature that the recent safety campaign among cyclists was extremely successful and that the casualties in a certain area decreased from a certain percentage to zero&#x003F; The hon. member has apparently only read the issues up to 1953. Has he any knowledge of the work of the C.S.I.R.&#x2019;s agency, the National Institute for Road Research&#x003F; That body manages with a minimal sum of money. The Government finances them with barely R&#x00BD; million and their results are phenomenal. Does the hon. member know of a periodical published by <span class="col_1239-1240" refersTo="page_0633"/>that body, a periodical called <i>Via</i>&#x003F; In it we are taught new lessons from day to day. Does he know of the well-known publications&#x003F; Apparently he does not.</p>

<p>Sir, I have said that this slaughter on our roads costs us R96 million. We are the silent witnesses to that slaughter. To give a better illustration, five disasters each equal in extent to those at Ceres and Wolseley are the equivalent of the slaughter on our roads. Sir, you know how quickly we reacted to that disaster. We must therefore react more quickly to the clarion call emanating from this House today. Thirty-seven per cent of the R96 million that it costs our country finds an echo in human suffering and pain. Today we have the opportunity of sending out a clarion call from this House for a dynamic, short-term campaign to bring road safety home to each and every one. It is very clear to me that when we debate this matter we must take various factors into consideration, factors such as traffic communication, the motor car and the road. We must give particular attention to human beings. They represent 89 per cent of the causes of road accidents. On a short-term basis we can very effectively address ourselves to the human weaknesses that result in these casualties. Here we have the opportunity of launching an imaginative and dynamic campaign. We have the opportunity of capturing the public&#x2019;s imagination with unique measures, with exceptional measures, because we are dealing with an exceptional matter.</p>

<p>On a short-term basis we shall aim at educating the present and future road users alongside the training and education given to our children at school. On a short-term basis we shall aim at discouraging traffic offenders. We shall aim at refusing the use of the road to traffic offenders who are a danger to their fellow-men. How can we do this&#x003F; I have already told hon. members that a successful and nation-wide campaign will have the desired effect. The campaign must be tackled on a nation-wide scale, like the Water Year. We must be prepared to invest money with a view to obtaining dividends in the form of human material. It must be spectacular. I want to suggest a few examples in this respect. What about an endorsement on an offender&#x2019;s motorcar, an endorsement, engraved on the car in red, which a motorist may not remove for a year even though that car is sold&#x003F; He will never be able to sell it. Set up a reserve force of a few thousand men to supplement our traffic police force. They could act very efficiently. And if we could include our high school children it would be that much more interesting for them. Reduce the speed for one week to 50 miles per hour so that the driver&#x2019;s blunted conscience can again be shaken out of its sleep. During that week this reserve force of 10,000 men or more could operate efficiently. We could even use our ballotees for this. I cannot think of a bigger and more interesting task than the undertaking of this campaign. Charge a few people with murder, because there is in fact no difference between a man who fires a pistol in a street where people are moving around, knowing full well that he must hit someone, and a man who drives amongst moving people at a very high speed, as we see happening so frequently. There is no difference. It is precisely the same set-up, because they ought to know that there will be casualties. In our administration of justice there is an example of such a prosecution. We do not necessarily have to obtain a conviction, but the object is to awaken that social conscience.</p>

<p>To temper all this a benevolence week can be held in which the traffic officer can be made a friend of the public. This must form the basis of our future success. We must set up this central traffic bureau quickly and we must ensure that it works on such a basis that we can refuse the use of the road to those road users who are a danger to life. This will only be possible if we have centralized control in respect of this matter. We must co-ordinate the issuing of licences. What is the position at present&#x003F; It is possible for a person who is refused a licence in one province to obtain it in another. It is possible for a person whose heavy duty licence has been endorsed, to obtain a licence for a light vehicle.</p>

<p>In conclusion we must ensure that when we prosecute it is really done effectively. When a person is punished it must stir the public&#x2019;s conscience. At present it is unfortunately sometimes regarded as an achievement to get away with a traffic offence, or to outsmart the traffic officer concerned. I say again, this is the way in which we shall have to reactivate our consciences with regard to traffic matters. It ought to form the basis of a successful campaign.</p>

<p>Then traffic courts must be set up to co-ordinate all these matters, courts consisting of people who are knowledgeable about and have a grounding in traffic matters. It must <span class="col_1241-1242" refersTo="page_0634"/>be ensured that our highway code is standardized and applied realistically in respect of traffic crimes which are proportionally just as serious as any other crime for which a heavier punishment is imposed. All this can be achieved if we accept this motion today; centralization of control is absolutely necessary for this purpose.</p>

<p>In support of the third aspect of the motion I just want to focus hon. members&#x2019; attention on the fact that through its agency, the National Institute for Road research, the C.S.I.R. has come to the conclusion that one vehicle with an 8,000 lb. overload does as much damage to a road surface as 25,000 large passenger cars. We have invested R1,800 million in our existing traffic system. It is therefore necessary for the so-called &#x201C;axle load&#x201D; of each of these vehicles to be fixed with a view to protecting this investment. Hence my support in respect of the third aspect of this motion.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that we have been afforded the opportunity today to discuss this very important subject. By and large, I agree with the motion put forward by the hon. member for Middelburg. I say &#x201C;by and large&#x201D;, as there is not much wrong with the motion, except that I do not agree where he says that it should be &#x201C;centrally controlled.&#x201D; I have always believed that we should recognize the functions of our provincial administrations and that we should, as far as possible, not interfere with their autonomy. I do not believe that the problem facing us on our roads today rests just there, namely that it should either be controlled by the Central Government or by the Provincial Administrations. The subject is very much further involved than just that. Very good suggestions have been made here. I believe, too, that we should be more positive and dynamic in our approach to the problem.</p>

<p>*The hon. member who spoke a few moments ago, mentioned liaison officers who can act between the public and the traffic police or officials. I fully agree with that. But unfortunately the hon member did not go far enough. This afternoon I want to go a little further and approach this problem in a more positive way.</p>

<p>&#x2020;No one, of course, will deny that road safety is of paramount importance in South Africa today. And yet so few of our people, the travelling public in particular regard the road safety councils as a means to an end. I believe that these councils should be assisted more by the public than they are at the present moment. When it comes to uniformity we know the Administrators meet regularly at least once a year with their officials to discuss uniformity among all the provinces in this regard. This is a very good policy.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it gives them an opportunity to discuss uniformity and problems of national importance. Opportunities will arise where they can discuss this very problem. But we, the travelling public, should play a bigger role in trying to solve the problem. This is not generally observed by the public. Statistics were given to us this morning by the hon. member for Middelburg, but he did not mention that most road accidents occur on Fridays and Saturdays, that is over the week-ends. The reason is simply that there is more traffic on the roads and we do not have the manpower to deal with that traffic. I agree that the uniforms of traffic officials could be changed to make them more conspicuous. Giving them red uniforms, or brown uniforms, or blue uniforms, as has been suggested, is fair enough, but it will not assist us very much. We do not have enough of these people because we do not have the manpower. The financial resources too, of course, play a large part in maintaining a strong provincial traffic force.</p>

<p>The statistics which the hon. member quoted show us that of the 6 605 people who died on the roads in 1969 more than half were Bantu. 3,721 were Bantu. This brings me to the suggestion which I want to make. In the Eastern Cape, and particularly in the East London area, we have a problem which I do not think faces many other road safety councils. I happen to serve on this council. The jurisdiction of that council extends to the Transkei, right to Umtata and beyond. It is not necessary for me to tell this hon. House what the problems in the Transkei are. However, I just want to refer to the large number of uncontrolled animals that roam the roads particularly at night. These are horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, etc. There is very little control over the animals in the Transkei. I must admit that some of the roads are fenced in, but I seldom see a <span class="col_1243-1244" refersTo="page_0635"/>gate closed. This is a danger facing anybody travelling through the Transkei. I have had many complaints from our road motor transport drivers.</p>

<p>Yes. We have been able to establish a small road safety branch, an appendix to the East London Road Safety Council, in Umtata with a small committee. Mainly Bantu serve on this committee. They try to do what they can. Our council in East London tries to enlighten them in this regard and teach them the functions which a branch should perform, but it is very difficult indeed. The hon. member for Randburg says that we should use &#x201C;skakelbeamptes&#x201D;. I want to go further than that, because we have to do something and do it quickly.</p>

<p>I want to suggest that drivers who have an accident-free record of at least 10 years should be given some recognition. I myself, and I am not patting myself on the back, have been driving motor vehicles for 35 years. Believe it or not, I have never yet had one accident, not even so much as having scratched another motor vehicle. The hon. member for Carltonville pats himself on the chest. I want to congratulate him, because to have an accident-free record does not come just like that. It does not just happen. There is not much luck on the South African roads. It takes caution, careful driving and responsibility at all times. If I should find myself returning from a party at night and if I believed that I was not fit to drive, I would find someone else to drive.</p>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>One should know how much to enjoy yourself, and also how fast to travel. I have never been a fast driver because I do not believe in fast driving. I believe that by and large, driving at reasonable speed circumvents accidents, but also it is more economical to drive at a reasonable speed. I now want to come back to my point. If a driver has an accident-free record he should be appointed by the traffic authorities to act as an assistant eye to traffic policemen. In other words, he should be given some form of recognition like a badge or an emblem to put on his car, and carry a certificate. When I see a driver infringing the rules of the road I report that driver to the traffic police regardless of his colour or anything else. But what happens after that&#x003F; If he decides to contest the case I am called upon to give evidence, and few people like doing this. Very often you report a driver from another province, and it does not always suit one to go and give evidence at far away venues, and so these drivers get away with it every time.</p>

<p>I want to suggest that if these appointed drivers, responsible drivers with good records who know and respect the rules of the road, report another driver for infringing the rules of the road, let it be what it may, that the guilty person should have a file opened for him. Every time this driver is reported for bad driving it should be recorded. This will assist the traffic police to keep an eye on those particular drivers. One finds that only certain drivers make themselves guilty of these offences. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City has told us of the driver who was warned of an offence and who committed the same offence again less than 50 miles from where he committed the first. It is clear that there are only certain irresponsible people who should be watched.</p>

<p>I know that many of us are trying to do this in our unofficial capacity, but psychologically it would be an excellent idea if every driver on the road, or every pedestrian, realized that somewhere or other, either in front of him or behind him, there could be someone keeping an eye on him. He need not be conspicuous and no one need know who he is. But people should know that if they infringe the rules, they will be reported that they will have a black mark against them in their file, and that this will count against them if they are taken to court some day, I believe that we must think of some way to try to solve this problem. We cannot rely solely on our provincial traffic policemen. They are doing a wonderful job. In fact, I have seen them assisting people on the roads. Not only do they try to keep death off the roads, but they assist people at breakdowns and they even sometimes assist people who run short of fuel, or who have punctures.</p>

<p>Then there are two further suggestions which I should like to make. I have travelled and driven vehicles in other parts of the world, in other countries and other big cities, and quite the worst city in which I have ever had to drive a heavy vehicle <span class="col_1245-1246" refersTo="page_0636"/>is Cairo. I have never seen so much disorganized traffic in all my life. There is no discipline whatsoever. But what shakes me is that when one reads and studies statistics one finds that although in a city like Cairo there is no road discipline at all, the death rate in Egypt is lower than that in South Africa. I cannot believe it but there it is; I must accept the figures. In Rhodesia I saw a very good system which I believe we should adopt more and more in South Africa. To some extent we are already practising it. All vehicles moving on the right should have the right-of-way at intersections where there are no robots. I repeat, all vehicles moving on the right should have the right-of-way. This would not necessitate stop-streets either. When I was in Rhodesia I did not see stop-streets in those cities. It is an accepted fact that if a vehicle is on your right, he moves and you wait for him to pass.</p>

<p>The second point I want to mention was brought to my notice by an insurance company. I am informed that most vehicles which are damaged or meet with accidents are green in colour. Some people believe that green is an unlucky colour but in fact there is no such thing. But it seems strange when one hears from insurance companies that most of the accident claims made upon them come from people who drove green motor cars. The explanation which I was given is that they are not so easily seen, and possibly this is something we could consider too.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I see my time is up. This is such an important subject that I regret we could not go on debating it all afternoon.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>To me it is very clear, and, I think, to this House as well, that the hon. member for Middelburg is not the only one who is extremely concerned about the accident rate in South Africa, but that all the members who participated in this debate are equally concerned. I do not believe the hon. member for Middelburg need make any excuse for coming to this House with a motion of this nature time after time. In 1964 he moved a similar motion. I think South Africa and this House owe him a debt of gratitude. I think it is necessary for us to keep the spotlight on road safety in South Africa at all times. We must have regard to the appalling slaughter which is taking place on our roads today.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I think the House and not only the House but the Press and the whole of South Africa should take note of the road accident situation in South Africa at present. According to a report recently released by the National Institute for Road Safety Research of the C.S.I.R. the fatality rate for the Republic, that is to say, the number of persons killed per million vehicle miles travelled, is almost three and a half times as high as the fatality rate of Great Britain and Australia and six times as high as the fatality rate of the United States, while the total accident rate for South Africa in fact compares favourably with similar rates reported in the same overseas countries.</p>

<p>The unduly high fatality rate for South Africa with a reasonably moderate total casualty rate as compared with those of other countries means that here a greater percentage of casualties are injured fatally than is the case in the other countries. Comparing the rate in different countries, allowance must be made for various circumstances. For example, pedestrian fatalities comprise only 18 per cent of all fatalities in the U.S.A., but 42 per cent of the fatalities in South Africa. In another report of the Institute analysing road accidents and statistics for the eight-year period from 1960 to 1967, the results indicated that pedestrians constituted the largest group of fatalities, or 42 per cent. The majority of these, namely 89.9 per cent, were non-Whites, who represent 80.9 per cent of the total population of South Africa.</p>

<p>I fear no contradiction when I say that in road traffic accidents there are three elements, namely the vehicle, the road and road user, with the interaction between these three elements causing the accident. Although a single factor may in rare cases be responsible, such as a driver losing control over his vehicle as the result of a heart attack, an accident is seldom attributable to a single cause. Research in the Republic and abroad has indicated that road accidents are the result of varying factors and that the human factor as such plays a major part in almost 90 per cent of all accidents. In the light of the above-mentioned research the main causes of road accidents can be summarized as follows: Ignorance, especially with regard to self and environment, including the vehicle, <span class="col_1247-1248" refersTo="page_0637"/>the road and the climatic factors; and, secondly, ill-breeding. Factors such as lack of culture, poor disposition and general outlook on life play a part in this, but I will come back to this ill-breeding.</p>

<p>This brings me to the hon. member for Port Natal. I wanted to congratulate the hon. member for Port Natal for his own positive approach to this problem and for the constructive suggestions he made, but then he came with a dummy amendment, not a dummy traffic policeman as he mentioned, but a dummy amendment which I am sorry I cannot accept. But he came to something else. He mentioned the accidents caused by State-owned cars and I want to analyse that. If I look at the total accidents for the two months in South Africa from 1st December, 1969, to 31st January, 1970. I find that we had 1,143 accidents. 366 White people and 1,315 of all races were killed. That is an average rate per day of 18 accidents, with 6 Whites and 21 all races killed per day over those two months. I want to compare that with the accidents caused by State-owned cars.</p>

<p>*Now I want to say that vehicles of the private sector in South Africa kill from two to three times as many people per day as the total number of State-owned vehicles do in a full year. In my opinion it is wrong in a debate such as this one to try to make the political point that Government Garage vehicles are involved in such a large number of accidents.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, the hon. member did. For the sake of the record, because the hon. member mentioned figures, I have to point out that we had 1,887 accidents in the year 1967-&#x2019;68, 1,758 in the year subsequent to that, and 2,030 accidents for the full year in 1969- &#x2019;70. But, Mr. Speaker, these State-owned vehicles travelled 88 million miles during that period. This represents an increase in the period during which the accidents occurred, i.e. in the last year I mentioned, of 103.2 million miles. This shows that accidents involving State-owned vehicles are much fewer. In this regard there is a number of aspects to which regard should be had. One of these is that State-owned vehicles often have to be used in much more difficult circumstances than those of the ordinary public. An example of this is one&#x2019;s traffic patrol vehicles. At times they have to be driven at high speeds. But I want to mention another important aspect. Of the 1,887 accidents reported in 1967-&#x2019;68, 602 involved no damage to the vehicles. In 210 cases the damage amounted to less than R10, whereas in 279 cases the damage amounted to a figure between R10 and R20. In 595 cases the amount varied from R20 to R100. The damage to the vehicles indicates the nature of the accidents. These figures may in turn be compared to the figures I mentioned before, figures in respect of the alarming number of accidents in South Africa.</p>

<p>These accidents do not represent a pleasing picture. They represent an appalling loss of human lives. When we consider this problem, we find that motor car accidents no longer have any news value to the Press. The Press no longer derives any news value from such accidents. They pass virtually unnoticed. It is said that during the latest moon flight Americans no longer sat in front of their television sets. They have become accustomed to people flying to the moon. It no longer has any news value. This reminds me of the story of the boiling of live rock lobsters. When somebody objected to that being done, he was told, &#x201C;never mind, the rock lobsters are used to it&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I do not wish to refer to the terms of reference of the commission now. However, I am pleased that the members of the commission who have to investigate the results submitted to us by the Road Safety Council are present here while this debate is being conducted. I believe they have found the ideas of hon. members, not only of hon. members on this side of the House whom I sincerely thank, but also of hon. members on the opposite side of the House, very useful and that they will be able to include these ideas and elaborate on them in their report, which we hope will be made available to the Minister before long. The appointment of this commission is proof of the Government&#x2019;s concern in this regard.</p>

<p>In the short time I have at my disposal it is necessary for us to consider a few important factors. I hope I shall be allowed injury time. In the first place, road traffic control and legislation in the Republic and South-West Africa are the exclusive responsibility of the four provincial administrations and the administration of South-West Africa. As far as the Transkei is concerned, this responsibility is vested in the Transkeian Government. The hon. <span class="col_1249-1250" refersTo="page_0638"/>member for Pietermaritzburg City took it amiss of the hon. the Minister for having said that he did not have the power in this connection. In terms of the legal position this responsibility is vested exclusively in the provinces at the moment. As far back as 1962, in consequence of the department&#x2019;s concern about this matter and a proposal which had been made, a Bill was prepared at the instance of the Minister in 1963 with a view to creating uniform legislation. But the administrators of the various provinces requested the Minister kindly to leave the matter in their hands. The Minister left the matter in their hands, in recognition of their democratic right and their autonomy. What happened then&#x003F; The provinces themselves met and appointed the Du Plessis Committee. This committee had to investigate road traffic legislation in the four provinces. It had to ascertain what steps were to be taken in order to bring about uniformity. That investigation led to a report being presented by the committee on 6th November, 1964. In the first place that report resulted in the establishment of the Inter-provincial Advisory Council on Road Traffic, consisting of the following people: The Administrator as chairman, and five members, i.e. a member of the executive committee of each of the four provinces and South-West Africa, and the Secretary for Transport. This interprovincial advisory council was assisted by a technical committee or board. Time will not permit me to give the constitution of the technical committee here. They were instructed to ensure the introduction of completely uniform traffic legislation in South Africa on the same date. That was done and the legislation was introduced. I must say at once that with regard to the South African Road Safety Council, the committee recommended that the constitution of this action committee should be different, i.e. (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By appointing the deputy chairman in a full-time capacity; such appointment to be made after consultation with the Administration of the provinces and South-West Africa; by enlarging the representation of the provinces in the action committee so as to allow of the Administration of each province and of South-West Africa being entitled to a representative.</block>

<p>The problem which the hon. members opposite refused to take into account, especially in the form of their amendment, is that this Road Safety Council, as well as the Inter-provincial Advisory Council, has absolutely no executive power. They simply make recommendations to the provinces, and that is the only thing they may do. When the inter-provincial advisory council meets and its members differ among themselves, a recommendation is not even made. In that case the matter is left at that and no further action is taken. In other words, we still find ourselves in the impossible situation of having a large, cumbersome road safety council and an inter-provincial advisory council, but they have no authority to see to it that the research which has to be done, the essential legislation which has to be introduced and the traffic control which has to be uniform, will be undertaken and carried into effect, because there is no legal provision for that. That is why I cannot understand the concern of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District when the hon. the Minister said that he could not accept responsibility for the Road Safety Council.</p>

<p>Seeing that this is the position, my predecessor wrote to the provinces as long ago as 30th November, 1966, and stated that he wished the following aspects to be investigated, and I am going to mention them in brief: The question of what is happening with regard to road control and safety control measures in urban areas; uniformity in municipal by-laws; &#x201C;traffic officers should be used judiciously&#x201D;. The plea of these hon. members was that the traffic officer should be an information officer or a liaison officer and not a prosecuting officer who simply collected fines. Another aspect was, &#x201C;allocation of traffic fines&#x201D;. If traffic fines are used as they are being used at present, the traffic officer is nothing but a collector who is ensuring that, the accounts of certain local authorities are balancing. In addition he asked for an investigation into uniform training for traffic officers. We have made progress as far as this matter is concerned. He also asked for an investigation into the powers of the transport inspectors with a view to bringing them into this to the extent of gaining their co-operation, especially in connection with the problem of the pirate motor cars, as this problem has been called here. These thousands of pirate motor cars are the very cars which are extremely unroadworthy and which are to a large extent responsible for these accidents. His next request was for an investigation to be made into the overlapping of the duties of traffic officers. <span class="col_1251-1252" refersTo="page_0639"/>I want to deal with this in brief. He said it was desirable to increase the number of traffic officers so as to keep abreast of the increase in traffic, but that it was realized that the shortage of manpower necessarily was a restricting factor. For that reason the existing forces had to be utilized as effectively as possible. Especially the elimination of any overlapping between the bodies concerned with traffic control, i.e. the South African Police, the provincial and local traffic officers, had to be ensured. In other words, the Government was fully aware of the fact that there was a job to do in this regard. The Government, however, went further than that. As far back as 1964 the provinces were informed that an investigation was to be made into the possibility of placing all traffic officers under one central control. This would ensure effective, co-ordinated action and an investigation was to be made as expeditiously as possible into ways and means of effecting this desired co-ordination. Because we realized the importance of this, all our thinking followed this trend. Subsequent to that my predecessor and the Government further informed the provinces that an investigation should be made into the desirability of having road accidents records and statistics which could immediately assist these members in their ideas. These would assist them in this respect; if one had the records and the statistics of these people, one could start bringing to book the man who repeatedly committed offences. The Government as well as the department felt at the time that there should be a central register of licensed drivers in South Africa. If a central register existed, a point system could be introduced with regard to that central register. It would mean that a person could earn points or could lose points depending on the accidents in which he was involved and on convictions for negligent driving. In this way it would be possible to indicate his negligence and his irresponsibility.</p>

<p>Hon. members raised the question of effective penalties, but the provinces had already been informed that an investigation was to be made into this matter. The penalties which are being kept in mind are the suspension and the cancellation of driver&#x2019;s licences, which was mentioned here by hon. members. Then there is the matter of retesting drivers, including clinical tests in suitable cases. In addition there is weekend imprisonment for dangerous offences such as negligent driving of a serious degree. Moreover, consideration is being given to impounding a person&#x2019;s motor car for a specific period in accordance with the seriousness of the offence committed by him. We also have corrective penalties in mind, for instance, compulsory attendance of schools for offenders. We are engaged in taking these steps.</p>

<p>Now I want to point out, and because this is important we should take cognizance of the fact that the full Road Safety Council and the action committee expressed the opinion through their chairman that we should not take the matter any further at this stage. They said we should confine ourselves to the Du Plessis Committee, with its two basic proposals of an inter-provincial advisory council and the technical committee, and that we should let the matter rest there. This is as far as the matter has been taken up to the moment. Now I have to say something, and I want to put it very clearly. The safety of the individual on our roads is not the concern of only the provincial and the urban traffic authorities. For that reason I cannot agree with the hon. member on the opposite side. It is in the first place the responsibility of the State to ensure that its citizens and other inhabitants of the country are not molested or harmed in any other way or maimed or killed recklessly by traffic. For that reason the State will have to step in if people think a driver&#x2019;s licence gives them a free licence for taking other people&#x2019;s lives. What is happening on South Africa&#x2019;s roads at the moment, is nothing less than licensed slaughtering.</p>

<p>In the second place, this is and still remains a function of the South African Police, because they are going to investigate cases, in spite of the fact that we have traffic officers, so as to ensure the maintenance of road safety, and they are going to investigate accidents in order to prosecute the guilty parties if necessary. To my way of thinking we should think the matter over so that control may be centralized. The fact that the State authorizes the provinces to fulfil certain functions in connection with traffic does not mean that the State has completely abandoned its powers and that it can evade its responsibility towards the public on that account. I think it would be wrong for me to anticipate the report of the commission of inquiry, because I do not know as yet what that report is going to contain. I do think, however, that even at this stage we should <span class="col_1253-1254" refersTo="page_0640"/>make South Africa realize full well that in the last instance it still is the Government that is accountable and that it may not hide behind city councils and provincial administrations while many thousands of the country&#x2019;s inhabitants die on the roads each year. Because this is so, I believe we shall have to consider making it possible for the Road Safety Council to submit its recommendations to an authority that can ensure the implementation of those recommendations in legislation.</p>

<p>The Road Safety Council should be able to ensure that all research work undertaken in South Africa with regard to road safety, road construction and the safety factor involved in road construction, and town planning, such as the example mentioned by the hon. member there, will be co-ordinated so that it may be translated into legislation or carried into effect. At present one finds that the universities and the C.S.I.R. are doing research while the Road Safety Council nominates certain people to do research and other bodies are also undertaking research. When such research is completed, it is left hanging in the air. Nothing comes of it. No-one uses it. No one is obliged to use it. For that reason I say we shall have to constitute the council in this particular way. It still depends on what the commission is going to say. A decision still has to be taken as to whether it should be an autonomous body under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transport, like the National Transport Commission, or whether the Minister, through the advice it gives, may instruct the provinces what uniform legislation ought to be introduced. The position is the same as regards the Department of National Education.</p>

<p>I want to mention another example, a very important one to me. Let us take a look at the metropolitan development complexes. Take for example Boksburg, Brakpan, Benoni, Springs, Johannesburg and Germiston. Each one is engaged in a transport system. Each of these transport systems causes traffic congestion at certain points, which gives rise to a higher accident potential as well as increased traffic frustrations and delays. If one had a council of this nature, one that could bring all these municipalities or city councils together and say to them: &#x201C;Let us investigate the entire system; let us investigate how the entire matter should be interwoven, so that the traffic may flow properly and the best safety measures may be taken&#x201D;, the difficulties could be ironed out.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then one would have the report. The Minister could go back to the provinces and tell them, &#x201C;Here is a task which you, as guardian of the local authorities, now have, i.e. to see to it that they implement this report on a joint and co-ordinated basis&#x201D;. In that case one would get somewhere with this development.</p>

<p>Another statement I want to make is that it will not be possible to eliminate overlapping summarily. It would be virtually impossible to interfere with the function of the Police without a thorough investigation having been made into the question whether it would be justified to do so. Secondly, the function of the inter-provincial advisory council is clearly set out in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Du Plessis Report, and actually relates only to obtaining uniform legislation on provincial basis and nothing more. For that reason I cannot associate myself with the idea of the chairman of the Road Safety Council, i.e. that we should let the matter rest at the report of the Du Plessis Commission. As regards the control of traffic as well as the appointment and co-ordinated training and use of traffic officers, the provincial advisory council can merely advise the provinces with regard to amending their ordinances in this respect. There is no binding factor. As a matter of fact, as far as the Road Safety Council is concerned, the Du Plessis Commission finds in paragraph 9 of its report, that with regard to the implementation of legislation the Road Safety Advisory Council has no such authority and that it is acting purely in a capacity of making recommendations, as the executive power in this regard is vested in the provinces and the other authorities. In paragraph 10 of this report, the following finding appears&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1255-1256" refersTo="page_0641"/>It is clear that the matter no longer is one of local interest. With the rapid development of road transport, it has now become a matter which is predominantly of national interest.</block>

<p>In other words, here we have a committee appointed by the four provinces and South-West Africa and that committee submitted a report to them in which it stated that the matter concerned was predominantly one of national interest. For that reason it is just as well that the hon. member for Middelburg introduced this motion. It affords us an opportunity of taking another look at this matter.</p>

<p>But in conclusion I want to say in the time I still have at my disposal, that proper human relations, in the first instance, are a basic necessity in road safety. I am pleased that this was mentioned by the hon. member for East London North. I want to give an example of proper human relations. When I was driving up the road this morning, I saw the hon. the Deputy Minister of the Interior in his motor car. The road was very busy and seven Coloured children wanted to cross over. He had the right of way, but he nevertheless stopped and showed the children that they could cross over in front of his car. If we showed more goodwill, more courtesy of this kind in South Africa, we would have far fewer accidents. If we want to have proper human relations it is, in the first place, a task of educating people. It is a matter of what kind of character one has; whether one is (prepared to give other people an opportunity as well. We can go to any city in South Africa and we shall see that if there is a continuous stream of traffic on a road and someone wants to enter that stream from a side street, he is simply not given an opportunity to do so. We are too selfish. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few minutes left at my disposal on this particular matter, I should like to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport, since the Du Plessis Committee of Inquiry has published its report, should have been well aware of all the points that he has made today in regard to what he calls central control. This is not a new issue that has been raised. It is an issue that was raised some years ago with the hon. the Minister. But the Du Plessis Committee of Inquiry made one specific point which persuaded the hon. the Minister of Transport to accept its recommendation.</p>

<p>That was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Committee is of opinion that exact uniformity in the contents and form of the traffic legislation of the Republic is essential in so far as it relates to the control of traffic on roads, road traffic signs, the construction and equipment of vehicles and the issue of drivers licences.</block>

<p>The report then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In regard to financial and related administrative aspects and matters of a local nature uniformity is not essential.</block>

<p>Following on that, if the hon. the Deputy Minister was aware of all the various legislation in the provinces with regard to motor vehicle control, he would realize that all these amendments have taken place to such an extent &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the following motion as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, in view of the serious handicaps experienced by the Coloured people in all spheres of life, requests the Government to consider the urgent implementation of a comprehensive programme for the rehabilitation and development of this population group, and, in this regard, specifically to take into account their requirements in the educational, economic, industrial and agricultural spheres so as to ensure that this group will have a worthy place among the citizens of South Africa.</block>

<p>I want to come immediately to the gist of what we are envisaging here today. We have had many commissions which were mere political moves in order to afford the Government of the day the opportunity of postponing or evading a difficult decision. This has caused many people to adopt a skeptical attitude towards the idea of a Government commission. There have <span class="col_1257-1258" refersTo="page_0642"/>nevertheless been commissions over the years which have become landmarks in the political history of South Africa. In the 1930s there was the Carnegie Commission into what was called at the time &#x201C;the Poor White problem&#x201D;. It was not a Government commission, but grew out of a national congress on the question of the Poor Whites held in Kimberley in October, 1934. The report of that commission in fact became a guide, a manual, for the Government at the time, the United Party Government of Gen. Hertzog, for solving, to a large extent, the Poor White problem. In the 1950s we had the well-known Tomlinson Commission. I think the Government made a mistake in not accepting certain important recommendations of that Commission. But in the 16 years that have passed since that Commission&#x2019;s report was published, it has in fact stood out as a charter for the handling of White-Black relations in South Africa. In the past 16 years, there has hardly been a debate on Bantu affairs in this Parliament in which the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission have not been mooted. In the 1960s, the Odendaal Commission on South-West Africa was published. In the course of one and a half years, that commission published a report consisting of 550 pages. It was one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching reports ever tabled in this Parliament. No matter what one thought of the political recommendations of the Odendaal Commission, this report has become a blueprint on which the Government has for years based and is still basing the whole economic and social, as well as the political development of the area, its people and every population group in that area.</p>

<p>We want to request something similar from the Government today, namely a charter for the future of the Coloured population. In the words of the motion &#x201C;a comprehensive programme for the rehabilitation and development of this papulation group&#x201D;. In other words, it is programme of national reconstruction for the whole Coloured community. We believe that the best way of achieving this is by means of a competent commission. Not a commission of yes-men or political slaves, and not one which will sit for years and want to read books, but a streamlined commission which will carry out its assignment as rapidly as the Odendaal Commission did and which will consist of men in whom the whole country will have confidence. In the 1930s there was a strong commission which had been appointed by the previous Government to investigate the economic and agricultural position of the Coloured population and other factors affecting their social welfare. Their political position was not then as uncertain as it is now. The chairman of that commission was Prof. Johannes du Plessis, one of the greatest missionary church-leaders South Africa has ever produced. Other members were Prof. R. W. Wilcocks, at that time Rector of the University of Stellenbosh; Dr. Wouter de Vos Malan, Superintendent-General of Education in the Cape Province; Dr. D. P. de Villiers, a health expert; Mr. H. C. Fowler; and&#x2014;this is important&#x2014;Dr. A. Abduruhman, a Coloured who was a member of the Provincial Council of the Cape Province, a man who became a legendary figure, and one of the outstanding Coloured leaders South Africa has produced in its history. Sir, it is a tragedy to see how we in South Africa have retrogressed. Thirty-four years ago it was a normal thing for a Coloured leader of the stature of Dr. Abduruhman to serve on a commission of this nature with the most prominent South Africans, the most prominent Afrikaners of the time. Today we have retrogressed to such an extent that a Coloured academic is not even allowed to sit with Whites on the Council and Senate of their own Coloured university. With reference to the commission, I want to say this as well: Unfortunately, Prof. Du Plessis died too soon. He was replaced by Prof. Wilcocks, and the commission was then given the name of the Wilcocks Commission. I have mentioned this because the calibre of men who served on that commission is the calibre we want on the commission proposed here. Immediately I think of a sociologist like Prof. S. P. Cilliers, of the University of Stellenbosch, one of the outstanding authorities on the Coloured community and their problems; outstanding churchmen like Rev. W. A. Landman, Rev. D. P. Botha and others; then there are businessmen like Dr. Anton Rupert, who devotes much of his energy to the development of Lesotho&#x2014;it is men like these who can be used. Dr. Jan S. Marais, and so many others who can be mentioned. Sir, these are all men who, politically speaking, mainly support that side of this House but who will have the confidence of the whole country and most certainly, I think, of the Coloured population as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="col_1259-1260" refersTo="page_0643"/>I have not consulted the report of the Wilcocks Commission, because you will concede that population conditions have changed so radically in 30 years that it has now become obsolete. Unfortunately, it also so happened that the report of this Wilcocks Commission was published at a time when virtually all the attention was being devoted to the Poor White problem, which the Government at that time tackled with great success. Shortly afterwards, the Second World War broke out, and apart from the more urgent matters which apply in a time of war, the attention was being devoted at home to an industrial revolution in South Africa which laid the foundation of South Africa&#x2019;s industrial development.</p>

<p>Subsequently the present Government came into power and for years concentrated more on apartheid than on development; and so, to our sorrow, we have to admit today that we have never developed a comprehensive charter for the rehabilitation of the Coloured community. Sir, I think it will be a glaring injustice, a glaring disservice to South Africa, if we delayed this any longer. I hope Government members will not adopt the same hackneyed approach this afternoon which we have heard from them so often in the past. We know that they are playing a little game of hide-and-seek with the political future of the Coloured people. In the course of this session we shall come back to the political position of the Coloureds many times. But what we will not be interested in this afternoon, is the old story that this Government is doing better than any previous government, that it is spending more money, and that this is enough. Sir, that is completely irrelevant. Technological developments have completely changed. I remember that when I was a boy, it took nine months to build one house; now, if you want to, you can build nine houses in one day. For that reason one cannot make comparisons of this nature; but I am willing to admit two things at once; I am willing to admit that there has definitely been progress in the lives of the Coloureds and that a lot of this is impressive. In addition, I am prepared to concede that there is a team of dedicated officials who are doing their utmost to make some progress.</p>

<p>But the point remains that there is no comprehensive co-ordinated charter according to which every social, economic and political programme for the Coloureds can be measured and tested and according to which it can be seen whether it is not eventually going to become a white elephant which will have to be abolished again. There is no charter available as a guide to officialdom, as there is in the case of the Bantu and in regard to the population of South-West Africa. Our point of view in regard to the Government today is this: Recently the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs stood up and appealed to the country to bring about closer association between Whites and Coloureds in South Africa. He did not in fact specify what degree of close association there should be. Shortly afterwards, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development stood up and appealed to the country for greater disassociation between Whites and Coloureds, in terms of which they would move further and further away from each other. He also omitted to say to what degree and how far this should be taken. Subsequently the Cabinet came and sat itself neatly down on two stools. The result is that today we still have to rely on the political statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;in my opinion the most unbelievable political statement I have ever heard since Emperor Caligula made his horse a consul. The statement of the hon. the Prime Minister to which I am referring, was made on the 6th February last year, and I shall quote from his Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I said on a previous occasion that I was busy laying foundations. I want to repeat: I do not know what the final solution will be and where the road will end &#x2026;</block>

<p>Just imagine; he said the road of the Coloureds would end; he did not know where it would end, but &#x201C;I am constantly indicating the road&#x201D;. Sir, have you ever come across a statesman in the world who said: &#x201C;There is a road; that road is coming to an end, but I am constantly indicating the road&#x003F;&#x201D; He continued that&#x2014;&#x201C;the Coloured people should proceed along their own course&#x201D;&#x2014;this is the road which is coming to an end&#x2014;&#x201C;and the Whites along their own course and that they can confer to and fro with one another on a friendly basis on their respective courses&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the problem is this: There are no two roads for Whites and Coloureds in South Africa. Fundamentally the Whites and the Coloureds are travelling the same road; they are inseparably travelling the same road; they are entering the <span class="col_1261-1262" refersTo="page_0644"/>same future. The life and decisions of the one affect the other, and vice versa, and so it will remain, and no government in South Africa will ever change that. Sir, I wonder how many people in South Africa today realize what is happening right under our noses here&#x003F; I do not want to say anything which may be regarded as being disparaging. We all know there are large numbers of Coloureds who have reached the highest levels in South Africa in their community under the most difficult circumstances imaginable, but the masses find themselves in a position which cries to high heaven and which cannot be attributed to any inherent weakness, but which must be attributed to the unjust social structure which has been built up against it and which is being built up against it day after day. Let me mention a few facts. The total population of the Coloured people in South Africa is more than 2 million at present and of this number, one whole quarter live here in the Cape Peninsula. Its natural increase is one of the highest in the world, and it is calculated that in 30 years&#x2019; time, when many of us will still be alive, we will have 800,000 Whites in the Peninsula alone, but the Coloured population in the Peninsula will be larger than the total population of Johannesburg today. In 30 years it will increase from 400,000 which is the number at present, to 1,400,000 in the Cape Peninsula alone. The population of the Cape Peninsula will thus be two-thirds Coloured in our time.</p>

<p>The nature, the character, the future of the Peninsula&#x2014;merely to mention one area, and this is going to be the case in many parts of the Cape Province&#x2014;is thus going to depend to a large extent on the development and the social standard which is attained by the Coloureds here. In fact, this is going to be the case throughout the entire country, because among the Coloureds there is a far more migration to the cities; they are going to become far more complete city dwellers than the Whites, for the simple reason that their territorial area is minimal in comparison with that of the Whites. Children whose parents are working on White farms today, will simply not remain there and in regard to the Coloured, we are going to have the most completely urban population in South Africa. The standard of living of a tremendously large section of the Coloured population is among the poorest and most miserable which one can find among Western people in any part of the world, and this in a country of milk and honey. There is not one single serious sociological problem one can think of which is not present to an enormous degree among the Coloureds. Every nation has its problems, but lack of bread, over-crowding, housing shortages, desperate housing conditions, adult crime, juvenile delinquency, illegitimate births, the breaking up of families, malnutrition and the permanent setback which it gives people, all those problems are present to an enormous degree in the lives of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In the field of housing it is estimated that at least one-third of the total Coloured population in the Western Cape are living in non-permanent and sub-standard housing, and it can be safely stated that between two-thirds and three-quarters of all Coloured people in the Western Cape live in overcrowded conditions. Stellenbosch experts have estimated that out of the approximately 130,000 Coloured families in greater Cape Town, 43,000 are in need of housing. With a view to the rapid expansion of the families of the Coloured people it is estimated that by 1980, nine years from now, at least another 54,000 dwellings will be required in greater Cape Town alone. So we see that in order to provide anything like adequate housing for the Coloureds in Cape Town alone we will need an average of 10,000 housing units per year. That shows the enormity of the problem facing the country and the speed with which we shall have to move.</p>

<p>One result of the housing shortage and the overcrowding, coupled with inadequate school facilities, poverty, low wages and poor health is the incidence of crime, which is much higher among the Coloured people than among any other population group in South Africa. It is probably one of the highest in the world. According to the latest statistics, for 1968, 13 out of every 1,000 White people were convicted of an offence, while the figure for the Coloured people was 69 out of every 1,000 Coloureds, five times the rate you find among the Whites. How long are we going to allow in our country conditions to flourish which cause this kind of situation&#x003F; In this respect I want to quote Prof. S. P. Cilliers. He said recently in a paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have no grounds for the assertion that the Coloureds are inherently more inclined to lawlessness than any other population group in the country. Crime is intimately bound up with the social <span class="col_1263-1264" refersTo="page_0645"/>structure. The living conditions of a large sector of this population group are typical of conditions which have been found all over the world to be the breeding-ground of drunkenness, violence and crime.</block>

<p>Sir, that is why we are calling today for a commission, not an ordinary commission but a commission in the tradition of the Carnegie, the Tomlinson and the Odendaal Commissions, to consider the problem of the Coloured people as a whole and to present South Africa with a comprehensive blueprint and a national charter for the future welfare of a population group which is one of the most important real assets that we have in our country.</p>

<p>We need a massive effort to eliminate social and economic conditions which favour crime and criminality, and of course education remains one of the most effective levers to social change. If we want to accomplish anything we should move rapidly, and by that I mean almost immediately, to a system of compulsory education for all. It can be done. There is no valid reason why a modern-minded Government cannot employ educational television and many other means which are employed in other parts of the world to bring the benefit of a decent education to every Coloured child in the country. It is monstrous that in a country like ours one single child under 16 should be allowed to roam the streets while he should by rights be in school. It is appalling to see the waste of human material in South Africa. No White man would allow that to happen to his children. Where we, the White people are the only population group with effective political power in South Africa, we should not allow it to happen to the children of fellow-South Africans simply because they are brown.</p>

<p>Also, Sir, as long as the present rate of natural increase among the Coloured people is as high as it is, it will be very difficult to obtain an improvement in the standard of living of the population group as a whole. There will have to be a bold and expansive family planning programme, and this will have to be given top priority in any plan for national reconstruction. But then I must add that if we want to make a success of this as far as the Coloureds or any other group are concerned, Government leaders will have to stop their infantile political appeals to White people to increase their families. In any case, it is quite senseless. No sensible couple are going to produce a White baby for the Republic, or for anything else, simply because a politician calls upon them to do so. In a multi-racial country it is essential that there should not be two standards. You should not call upon one section to follow a certain set of rules and another section another set of rules. The important question of family planning should be tackled on a similar basis for all. The Johannesburg Health Department reports that they experience fresh resistance to family planning services among Bantu every time a prominent Government politician sends out a call to White people to increase the size of their families as part of a political insurance effort against the Black. The sensible thing to do is to encourage all our people, Whites and Coloureds and others, to plan the size of their families according to their means, otherwise an intolerable burden will come to rest on our country as far as our health and welfare services are concerned, and a proletariat will develop here which we shall ultimately not be able to control.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, in the past 60 years and longer, our politics in South Africa has gone through various important phases. There was a time when it took the form of a political confrontation between Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking peoples. Then men like Dr. Malan made the appeal: Join together what belongs together. He then united the vast majority of the Afrikaans-speaking people of this country behind him. However, Afrikaner unity was not set as a goal in itself. He said that the time would come, especially after certain targets like the Republic had been attained, when attention would have to be given to a broader unification of what belonged together, without any abandonment of identity. Now we know that the old confrontation between Afrikaans and English speaking is a thing of the past. It will remain a thing of the past. A new phase has developed in the politics of South Africa. A much more serious confrontation is developing, in which South Africa as a whole is involved, and will become increasingly involved. This is the confrontation between Westerner and Communist. None of us here can feel unconcerned about the activities of Russian warships along our coasts, especially against the background of terrorists on our borders and the South-West Africa case. Who <span class="col_1265-1266" refersTo="page_0646"/>knows whether Russia is not planning an adventure which is aimed at harming us, in an attempt to consolidate the whole of Africa behind it with one onslaught. This is the type of confrontation which is developing. For that reason, I say that it has become time for sensible people on both sides of this House to see whether the term &#x201C;join together what belongs together&#x201D; should not be given a wider significance again. Let us develop a new relationship between White and Coloured in which each will retain his own identity, so that people who have a common Western background may co-operate with one another as closely as possible. The same perhaps applies to other population groups, but today we are concerned with the Whites and the Coloureds. How can we with any amount of reasonableness expect that the Coloured should devote his attention and energy to positive rehabilitation if there is a government which tells him: &#x201C;Posterity may decide otherwise, but under me you will remain half-citizens on the road to nowhere&#x003F;&#x201D; How must a man feel if he is a Coloured and has worked equally hard in order to obtain his qualifications and then finds that he must do the same work, but is paid only half of what his White colleague is being paid&#x003F; Do hon. members realize that if a man is paid half the salary he deserves on the basis of his qualifications and his work, simply because he is a Coloured, that he is in fact being taxed on 50 per cent of the income to which he is entitled&#x003F; Is it surprising that bitter feelings are developing today, as we saw during the last session of the Coloured Council&#x003F; How can a man develop his personality, and make progress, if all sorts of restrictions are being placed on him, such as labour restrictions, income restrictions and cultural restrictions which prevent him from becoming a full-fledged person in his own country&#x003F; How can a whole people elevate itself if it is continually being isolated&#x003F; So often we hear the story that the Coloured should follow the example of the Afrikaner. The Afrikaner helped himself and developed to where he is. This is a fine thought, but the Afrikaner was never subjected to a system of separation and isolation. Where would the Afrikaners have been today if their businessmen and industrialists did not have freedom of contact with businessmen and cultural people from other population groups from whom they could learn&#x003F; We must start realizing that contact does not mean integration and that co-operation does not mean assimilation. These are serious times. The Prime Minister chose a motto for himself, namely: &#x201C;Fulfil your calling.&#x201D; I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether he regards it as the White man&#x2019;s calling always to remain the overlord of White imperialist over the Coloured people&#x003F; No, Mr. Speaker, White imperialism in South Africa will have to make way for something better. We shall have to reconsider this matter honestly. We shall have to create a just order for the Coloureds and above all, we shall have to provide them with greater clarity in regard to their political future as citizens in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout went much further today than he went with his definition of &#x201C;petty apartheid&#x201D;. With that definition he wrote off separate development completely. He said that every act of discrimination enforced by legislation without the consent of a group, is inadmissable and that it is &#x201C;petty apartheid&#x201D;. When he wrote that he did not bear in mind that the colour bar in the mines is being enforced without consent. Many Bantu from other countries are working in the mines. I wonder how he wants to obtain their consent to make legislation to retain a colour bar. That he and his party can go and explain to the mine workers and other workers of South Africa. Today the hon. member went very far. He advocated any kind of thing; he advocated coalition, and in the end advocated a mere conglomeration. Today he advocated full integration. The important point&#x2014;and these are his own words in this motion&#x2014;is that a commission should be appointed, but to do what&#x003F; We know precisely, and the Coloureds know precisely, where we want to go. We know precisely what the deficiencies and what the shortcomings are. The fact of the matter is that it has not even been two years since we commenced a new dispensation for the Coloureds. That new dispensation must first be given an opportunity to develop. There is therefore no reason whatsoever to appoint a commission of inquiry at this stage. The fact of the matter is that 1966-&#x2019;67 we have a select committee, which was subsequently converted into a commission on the political rights of the Coloureds. They were given political rights, and their representatives were removed from this House to their own council on the basis of the recommendation of a commission.</p>

<p>We know where we are going. The hon. member said that the Coloureds and the Whites were inseparably travelling the same road. He included them in all the roads. Now I want to ask him and his party why they ran away from the promise they made to the Coloureds when they said to them that they would return them to the common voters&#x2019; role. Why are they dangling before their noses the carrot that there will be a separate voters&#x2019; role if we are inseparably moving along the same road. This motion puts me in mind of the old saying &#x201C;bolting the stable door after the horse has fled&#x201D;. This motion is one which reveals the guilt feelings of the United Party. They have guilty consciences and now they are using the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to free them from their guilt.</p>

<p>This motion talks about the rehabilitation of the Coloureds. What did the National Party get to rehabilitate&#x003F; What the National Party inherited from them was wreckage and ruin. We are not rehabilitating, we are building. We are building on foundations laid by us. There is not a single foundation for the Coloured population in regard to these matters mentioned by the motion in respect of which any United Party member on the opposite side can stand up and say that they laid those foundations and that we can continue to build on them. We inherited shanties, slums, ruins and wreckage from them. The tactics they are adopting here today are the same tactics they started to adopt before the general election. Every time they try to go through the gap. The United Party has become convinced that the Coloureds, in the same way as all the other population groups in South Africa, i.e. the Indians and the Bantu, are accepting separate development. All the non-Whites in this country are beginning to realize that differentiation is not discrimination. Differentiation is the policy of this party. Differentiation must not be read as meaning discrimination, because differentiation is the work of the Creator. We see this phenomenon not only in His creature, in man, we also see differentiation in nature. Because Coloured leaders are accepting this separate development or parallel development and are implementing it in practice, the United Party have come forward with this motion.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is cheap propaganda. What they are now requesting, this party announced in 1961 through the mouth of Dr. Verwoerd. These matters have all been transferred to the Coloureds themselves, so that they can deal with them under their new dispensation. They are administering these matters. They are doing so themselves. What the hon. member is actually doing here today is to tell the elected Coloured representatives of the Coloured population how they should govern their own people. These matters are being administered by the Coloured Persons Representative Council. For that reason to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House expresses its appreciation for the steps which have been taken for the advancement and development of the Coloured population, and for the progress which has been made in the educational, social, economic, industrial, agricultural and other spheres in implementing the Government&#x2019;s announced socio-economic plan, and requests the Government to continue on this course.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Sir, the points mentioned in the hon. member&#x2019;s motion are already being implemented. The late Dr. Verwoerd addressed the Coloured Persons Council in 1961, and at the time it was simply a Council which consisted of nominated members in the Cape. He held out to them the prospect of a National Council being appointed &#x2014;yes, at the time it was still appointed&#x2014; for the entire Republic, and that they would gradually be given these matters to administer. He said that they would have it within ten years. That was 1961. They did have it within ten years, in 1969. In 1968 the Coloured Persons Representative Council was elected, and in 1969 they were able to draw up their first budget. It was not for a full year; it was only for nine months. It was only last year that they were able to draw up a full budget.</p>

<p>We kept our word. We kept the promise which the late Dr. Verword had made. In 1967 the present hon. Prime Minister addressed that Council. That was the old Council. And then he was able to announce that progress had been made. He was also able to make the further promise that <span class="col_1269-1270" refersTo="page_0648"/>under his guidance as well his Government would keep its word to uplift and to improve the lot of the Coloured population.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, they are much better off than they were in Windermere in the time when that hon. member&#x2019;s party was governing. There they almost drowned every year. The steps which this motion requests, are already in the process of being implemented. All the fields mentioned here are today under the care of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, with its own Executive. All this motion is doing, is to tell those people how they must govern. The fact of the matter is that they have up to now only drawn up one full budget. They have these matters to deal with. All the money they requested, the Government approved. It was accepted by this Parliament. It was their budget, which they drew up themselves.</p>

<p>There has been phenomenal progress in the past few years. Let us take the field of commerce, where the Coloured Development Corporation is taking the lead. In the field of industry, in the economic sphere, more than R6 million in assistance has been granted since 1962 under the guidance of the Coloured Development Corporation. I am thinking for example of loans to businessmen to purchase business undertakings and hotels. There were no Coloured hotels in this Country. Today there are hotels of which the Coloureds are proud because they are theirs. Travellers on the road had no where to go. There are factories as well. It does not stop at commerce, we must always consider training as well. The Landdros Hotel in Athlone is being used for the training of waiters. Eventually it will be used for the training of clerks and people on a managerial level. We must also consider that side of the matter. We cannot merely carry on regardless; the people are not there to do the work. Today businessmen are being trained under the guidance of inspectors from the Coloured Development Corporation. All this is taking place under supervision. The people are receiving guidance. In the Spes Bona bank Coloureds are being trained as clerks, cashiers and eventually as branch managers, because this is the Coloureds&#x2019; own bank. This is where they invest their money.</p>

<p>As far as the education of the Coloureds is concerned, we have nothing to be ashamed of. Nor do we have anything to hide, not from those hon. members, nor from the world. Unfortunately, there are no comparable figures. But in the time when that party was in power, Coloured education still fell under the Provinces. That party governed the Provinces for an uninterrupted period from 1910 to 1954. That is why I say, all they left behind was wreckage.</p>

<p>But I want to mention a few figures in this regard. The hon. member requested us to consider education. But the reply is obvious; this has already received consideration. In 1950 there were 203,922 Coloured children attending school. In 1964 there were 366,326 Coloured children attending school. In 1970 there were 504,598.</p>

<p>Today more than 80 per cent of the Coloured children are attending school. Let us consider the number of hostels. When they were in power, there was no such thing. In 1964 there were seven State hostels. In 1970 there were 15. Let us consider the number of teachers. In 1950 there were 6,166 Coloured teachers. In 1964 there were 11,783. In 1970 there were 15,942 and in 1971, 16,538. Since 1950, therefore, the number of Coloured teachers has increased more than threefold. In 1964 there were 37,264 high school pupils; in 1969 there were 50,109. Let us consider the number of students at the Coloured university, the establishment of which that party opposed so vehemently. This university was established against their will. They are the people who incited the Coloureds to say that it was an inferior institution. That incitement came from the benches on the opposite side of the House.

<p>In respect of the Coloureds consideration is also being <span class="col_1271-1272" refersTo="page_0649"/>given to differentiated educational services. There are the training colleges for teachers. There is also a technical college for the training of commerce teachers. In 1967 there were 199 student teachers. In 1969 there were 376 student commerce teachers. There is also a technical college for apprentices. In 1962 it was attended by 951 students. In 1969 there were 1,969. As far as the education of Coloureds is concerned, consideration is being given to every sphere. There is special education for the deaf, the blind, epileptics and cerebral palsied children. In addition there are nursery schools for children in need of care. In other words, there is differentiated education for the Coloureds as well. But that is not all, for we are also busy remedying the bungled work of the United Party. What they did not do, was left for us to do. We are also taking care of adult education. As far as adult education is concerned nothing had been done in 1965. In 1966 there were 2,650 and in 1969, 7,569. These are adults who are attending part-time classes. In addition there is occupational orientated training for the Coloureds. They are being trained as seamen, as caterers, garment workers and farm workers. In every sphere there are opportunities for them to receive training. They are also receiving free books, lodging bursaries and transport where there are needy children. Post-school bursaries are also being offered to them for teacher training, social work and librarianship. These bursaries are such that they are able to obtain a degree at a university with them.</p>

<p>However, there is still something lacking. This is the problem of the Government and of the Coloured Persons Council as well. There is a large percentage of Coloureds who are work-shy. Everyone admits it; the Coloured Persons Council itself admits it. This is the most important factor which is preventing rapid progress. It requires money and it requires trouble, but we shall have to establish more centres such as the one at Faure where extremely good work is being done. There is a large demand for people coming from there. If a Coloured has been there for only three months, the private sector wants him. He has then been disciplined to some extent and he is a usable person. We must establish more such centres, because if we can eliminate work-shyness among the Coloureds, we can make very rapid progress. This is the actual task which we must perform today. We are not rehabilitating. We had nothing. We began from scratch and with goodwill and co-operation we have been building. We want to co-operate; we are prepared to co-operate. This party and this Government has already proved its goodwill towards the Coloured population of South Africa. Matters are now in their own hands. They must help; their Council must help to help their own people and eliminate work-shyness among them. The task of family planning which that hon. member wants to throw into our midst here is their task. It is not our task; it is the task of the Coloured Persons Representative Council of South Africa, and I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and his party can safely leave it in the hands of the Coloured Persons Council itself to effect future family planning for their own people.</p>

<p>Every Government attempt to persuade them that they are a nation on their own is bound to fail. The only effective cohesive element that these people ever knew was their official link with us as part of the Western community in the Republic. Sir, the Coloured people form a distinctive community. No one will deny that, least of all the Coloured people themselves. A separate nation they are not and are never likely to be, no matter how far-fetched the Government&#x2019;s thinking on this issue may be. Sir, there is no doubt that attempts of a sporadic nature have been made to apply a programme of socioeconomic uplift to these people by this Government from time to time, but the root cause of the discontent of the Coloured people is the dilemma of their identity and the question of meaning also. They are being steadily cut off from our <span class="col_1273-1274" refersTo="page_0650"/>society, a society from which they themselves originally stem, at least in part. As the mover of this motion correctly stated, the general position of the mass of the Coloured people in South Africa today is one of steady deterioration. There are a number of reasons for that and I think we ignore them at our peril. The Coloured people as a community have been made to feel that they are God&#x2019;s stepchildren in South Africa in almost every aspect of their lives. The results for South African society may soon prove disastrous unless we deal with this problem now. You see, Sir, for them there is no real cohesive pattern of living. There are very few stabilizing factors in the socio-economic or even in the political fields as there are for the other racial groups. They are not identifiable as the Bantu, the Indians or the Malays are. They represent a kind of twilight community, labelled alternatively &#x201C;Coloureds&#x201D; at one moment and &#x201C;other Coloureds&#x201D; the next. If anyone can tell me what that means I shall be very glad to know. And the one community with whom they really have the greatest affinity, namely our own, has rejected them out of hand, thanks to the extraordinary insensitivity of the present Government. Moreover, there is a considerable body of evidence to prove that the social structure of the Coloured community&#x2014;and here I refer to the Coloured family in particular: harassed, largely ignorant, poverty-stricken and in many instances insulted as they are by legislation&#x2014;is in the very deepest trouble. Whilst it is true that many young Coloured people are moving ahead to unprecedented levels of achievement, many more are falling further and further behind at the present time. At the heart of this deterioration in the fabric of Coloured society lies the Coloured family itself. The family, after all, is the basic social unit of Western society, and if this is destroyed what do we put in its place&#x003F; On analysis I would say that the Coloured community is in the process of division between a stable middle-class group on the one hand, which is steadily growing stronger and more successful&#x2014;that we admit&#x2014;and an increasingly disorganized, irresponsible, ruthless lower class which represents the mass of the Coloured people and whose birth-rate is higher than that of any other population group in the country. I will deal with that later. There is no need to remind this House of the appallingly high rate of alcoholism and drug addiction&#x2014;and here I refer mostly to dagga&#x2014;vandalism and illegitimacy, fecklessness, violence and irresponsibility which characterize that particular element of Coloured society to a frightening degree today. Generations of Coloured children are growing up in our congested urban areas today, urban areas to which the majority of the Coloured people have now been attracted, without education, without discipline, without security, and the ultimate burden of dealing with these unfortunate youngsters must fall increasingly upon our welfare agencies and the State unless other steps are taken. A minority of the Coloured people have reached the top and these reached the top and these have proved to have capabilities every bit as great as those of anyone in this House. But when they get to the top, what do they find&#x003F; They find the same old prejudices, humiliations and discriminations directed against them as before. The old built-in prejudices remain. Their individual situation, in psychological terms, is, if anything, even worse than before. Their educational achievements, often very hardly earned as we know, must often, I think, have the taste of gall in their mouths when, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has correctly said, no single one of them is permitted, even with the qualifications of a senior lecturer, to sit in on the deliberations of the Council or the Senate of what is supposed to be their own university. And what must they think of a society in which their teachers, their doctors, their nurses and other professional people who have qualifications identical with those we set for ourselves but whose remuneration, set in the first instance on Government instructions by the Public Service Commission, is one-third less than we receive for the same work&#x003F; What possible justification can there possibly be for that&#x003F; There are many urgent reasons why the whole system of White-Coloured relationships should at this period of our history be reviewed. Attitudes to date on the part of the White community have been largely paternal. They have been based on fixed ideas of the role of the Coloured people in our society, with the conviction that they would always remain in one way or another, slightly inferior to us. Do not let us make any bones about it. That has generally been the attitude of hon. members opposite. But circumstances in South Africa have greatly changed in the last two or three decades, and if there is to be a change of attitude, and change there must be, then I would say that factors other than colour must be taken into account, factors such as degrees <span class="col_1275-1276" refersTo="page_0651"/>of sophistication, education, responsibility and character. Ironically enough, in terms of this Government&#x2019;s own policy, there are more direct contact situations with leaders of the Coloured community today, particularly at Government level, than at any other time in our history. Just look at the Department of Coloured Affairs, which is being turned over increasingly to senior Coloured officials.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks: &#x201C;What is wrong with that&#x003F;&#x201D; Let me say that, coupled with that, the country now has more stringent and far-reaching segregation laws to separate us from the Coloured people than at any other time in our history. This apparent contradiction, of course, applies to a great many other aspects of the relationship between Whites and Coloureds. Economic integration is not just a policy; it is a fact. Their religions are the same as ours. Their cultural background is a mixture of Afrikaner and English, the same as ours. Their standards of education, which are set for them by this Government, are in fact the same as ours. The languages they speak are the same. The key question here is: Do we keep them as friends or do we turn them into bitter opponents&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, when it comes to patterns of community living I believe that ethnic groups are essentially happier on their own. There is a positive side and not merely a negative one to these arrangements. All we hear from this Government are the negative aspects.</p>

<p>No, I am not. This was certainly the case long before this Government came into power and placed legally enforcable residential segregation laws on our statute book. Hon. members know that many Coloured, Indian and Malay communities were for instance scattered about amongst our suburbs and city centres. In every instance, as hon. members know, they voluntarily formed their own ethnic enclaves, just as we did, and followed their own individual patterns of community living. The first real signs of hostility and conflict in this field became apparent as soon as the Government set about their forcible removal, usually without bothering to consult them, to areas outside the cities. More important still, they were given little or no incentive in the process to get together and rebuild their old communities in happier and healthier surroundings. The usual pattern was and still is for the Government arbitrarily to proclaim an area White and thereafter to think about how to provide alternative accommodation for those to be shifted out. They thought merely in terms of housing units, and not, I want to emphasize, in terms of real community development, because real community development places the emphasis first upon people and their lives and not merely upon bricks and mortar. I believe that because of the manner in which these so-called urban renewal plans have been carried out, with the emphasis always upon group areas, rather than upon slum clearance and the rehabilitation of communities in the genuine sense, the Government will now never be able to catch up on its housing programme, no matter how much it may protest that it can. Removals or slum clearance arbitrarily carried out, particularly in an ideological context, without adequate consultation with the people concerned, without adequate compensation and without systematic case work to ensure that people so moved find themselves in a community with whom they have something in common, I find unnecessarily harsh. It encourages the latent hostility which is so obvious amongst large sections of the Coloured population today. The disastrous thing is that no effort is being made in the course of these removals, deliberately and with the help of social workers, to inspire those who have been moved to recreate the cohesive community life which they knew before.</p>

<p>I want to say that a city, or any new township, anywhere in the world, whatever the colour of the people living in it, must allow for some kind of communalism. After very much experience they are deeply convinced of this in America today, because community interests within a large metropolitan area, such as we have here in Cape Town or in Johannesburg, make their own distinctive and vital contributions to city life. Without adequate community life the concrete jungles or the rows of stereotyped houses in townships remain depersonalized and meaningless, somewhere from whence one simply joins the ranks of the daily commuters to and from work, and little else. It does not matter what colour you are. That applies to <span class="col_1277-1278" refersTo="page_0652"/>everybody. Here I want to issue a warning. The alarming phenomenon of ethnic groups deliberately withdrawing and uniting in order to establish an identity, not on a positive basis, but for the purpose of forcing home their demands in a variety of fields because of a sense of deprivation, appeared for the very first time in South Africa recently. In fact, it appeared for the first time in the Cape in 1969, when Coloured students at the University of the Western Cape, struck out against White liberals in particular and Whites in general, refusing contact with White students at a particular university on &#x201C;White&#x201D; terms.</p>

<p>This year the newly formed all-Black South African Students&#x2019; Organization stated its objects with great clarity through its 25 year old president, Mr. Barney Pityana. This is what he said and I think we should take note of it:</p>

<block name="quote">Black people must build themselves to a position of non-dependence from Whites. They must work towards a self-sufficient political and social unit. In this manner they will help themselves towards a deeper realization of their potential and worth as self-respecting people. We envisage a situation where we ourselves can make demands.</block>

<p>Hon. members should note that sovereign independent homelands are not at issue where that statement is concerned. This student leader was undoubtedly referring to those who have become part of urban, industrial South Africa for whom no plans have been made and for whom no bright future is promised by this Government. It concerns the Bantu in this context. But we are concerned here with the Coloured people, who have no homelands, who have been virtually rejected by this Government and who have no clarity as to what their future status in the Republic is to be. It is very significant that two weeks after the Black student leader&#x2019;s call to action, the deputy leader of the Coloured Labour Party, Mr. David Curry, issued a Press statement endorsing Mr. Pityana&#x2019;s views. This is what he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Coloured people and Blacks must withdraw into their groups in order to strengthen themselves. The leaders of all non-White groups must win over the minds of their own people by convincing them that they are equal to all Whites in this country. When all political groups have the support of the masses, then we can talk of &#x201C;bargaining power&#x201D; with Whites.</block>

<p>To anyone familiar with developments in the United States during the 1960s, those words must have a familiar and, possibly, even a somewhat ominous ring, for it means the beginning of confrontation politics and a perpetually overheated situation. That, I submit, is the danger. We have exercised our option to reject these people without thought for anyone but ourselves so often&#x2014;and this Government continues to do it&#x2014;that we must not now be surprised if they, in turn, reverse the position and reject us.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, if we are intelligent we take note of these things. The consequences of such a decision can prove alarming for the Republic. All that their attitude really reveals, in essence, is the Nationalist Government&#x2019;s own obsession with race in reverse. That is all it is. So, in place of dialogue and co-operation this type of movement, to which I have referred, always envisages, anywhere in the world, a racially based quest for political power as a prerequisite for achieving economic power, and ultimately, for achieving a radical transformation of South African or any other society. Who can blame them&#x003F; Coloured and Black nationalism is the very thing this Government has taught them all and encouraged from the start.</p>

<p>What, for instance, is to happen to all the resolutions rejecting apartheid, which were passed at the last session of the Coloured Representative Council&#x003F; Are they going to pile up on the hon. Minister&#x2019;s desk&#x003F; Are they to be ignored&#x003F; For too long we have sat m the seats of power, telling everybody else in this country just what the pattern of their lives shall be without seriously bothering to consult them on any of the major decisions we have made in the process. Let us be frank about it. This heavy and at this stage in our history, arrogant form of paternalism will no longer do; not because of outside pressures, not only because we might be afraid, but because circumstances in South Africa <span class="col_1279-1280" refersTo="page_0653"/>itself have changed. In this context, it might be as well for us to remember the Biblical text: &#x201C;He who loveth his life shall lose it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If one scans the debates in this House, and if one studies our history through the years, it is an appalling thought that hon. members on that side of the House are producing much the same type of argument today with regard to our non-White people and our relationship towards them as were produced 40 years ago. No one will dispute the wisdom of maintaining civilized standards nor that of group identity within the nation. However, when our one-time wards themselves achieve those standards, as an increasingly large number of Coloured and Indian people have done today, what then&#x003F; Surely the time has come, and it is in our country&#x2019;s interest and not merely in terms of party-political divisions, for us to re-assess this situation. The right place and the right community with which to begin is that of the Coloureds. They are a known and not an unknown quantity. They have always been a stable and a loyal group and there has been the very minimum of racial conflict between us and them. Human and economic adjustments in this field are required of us and there is no doubt that they will need much careful thought and careful handling. These adjustments must be made and they must be made pretty soon. I think the worst thing we can do, and the greatest disservice to South Africa, is merely to be evasive on the one hand or to take a tough, intractable line on the other, where such adaptation really needs the careful, balanced and steady consideration of us all.</p>

<p>These are not just merely words, they are very significant issues. In the meantime the prime need is to look at our social services and how these can best be utilized to rehabilitate those sections of the Coloured community who are most in need of them. At the heart of the deterioration of the fabric of Coloured society, as I said just now, is the Coloured family itself. This is the fundamental source of weakness of the Coloured community at the present time. Unless this damage is repaired, all the efforts to deal with poverty, alcoholism and crime will come to very little. The role of the family in shaping character and ability, especially of young children, is so pervasive as to be easily overlooked. The truth is that the family structure of lower class Coloured people in our urban areas is highly unstable today and, in many instances, it is approaching complete breakdown.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am just going to refer to some statistics. No statistics appear to be kept anywhere as to what proportion of Coloured husbands or fathers of children are absent from these homes. According to the 1969 report of the Medical Officer of Health for the greater Cape Town Municipality, 30.4 per cent of all Coloured live births were illegitimate in 1969. Hon. members talks about the Bantu. Hon. members on that side of the House will not allow the Bantu to live an ordinary family life in the urban areas. Let me tell hon. members that according to the Medical Officer of Health&#x2019;s report in 1969 there were living in Langa township, which borders on several Coloured townships, 24,320 most of them males living as single men and 4,508 women. In other words, some 20,000 Bantu men are today living in Langa at such close quarters with these Coloured communities, without their wives and families.</p>

<p>Hon. members know very well what has been happening as a result of that. A great deal of the illegitimacy is caused by this situation. This in itself is another off-shoot of Government policy. A lot has been said about family planning. I want to tell the House that great progress is being made in the area of greater Cape Town with family planning clinics, although there is still much to be done. Hon. members should know that between 1965 and 1969 the figures showed a drop in the Coloured fertility rate from 45.5 live births per 1,000 of the population in 1965 to 40.6 per 1,000 in 1969. This means that the municipality is doing what it can in this area, and that it is making some progress.</p>

<p>Low education levels in turn produce low income levels, which deprive children of many opportunities and so the cycle of poverty, ignorance and either unemployment or inadequate employment repeats itself. <span class="col_1281-1282" refersTo="page_0654"/>Housing conditions are another contributory factor to the social demoralization of the Coloured people, as the hon. the Minister knows very well. I would say, and hon. members certainly know, that the incidence of crime amongst the Coloured people today is nearly six times that among the Whites, a lot of it in the lower age group. There are no grounds for any easy assertion that the Coloured people are inherently more inclined to lawlessness than any other group. The fact is that their living conditions at the present moment encourage this type of behaviour. The conditions and the setting are amenable to crime, the bulk of which takes the form of drunkenness, disorderly behaviour and acts of personal violence.</p>

<p>I submit that this is because, as Professor S. P. Cilliers from Stellenbosch University has said, of the marginality of their position. They do not really know what they are. They are neither fish nor fowl. On that basis and with no clear future set out for them by this Government it is not surprising that there are deteriorating standards among them.</p>

<p>There is another point. The present generation of Coloured children growing up in these distant townships has probably less personal contact with the world of White South Africa than any other generation in our history. The loss is as much ours as theirs. In a word I would say that any national effort towards solving the problems of the Coloured community must initially be directed towards the question of the Coloured family itself.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me say that our present Department of Community Development is a complete misnomer. It never develops a community of any kind&#x2014;it only breaks them up. A proper department worthy of the name should be equipped with a staff of qualified social workers, social science graduates, statisticians, psychologists, dieticians, health educators and medical personnel. As matters stand, there is no single Government department that takes responsibility, in a positive sense, for dealing with community development. There is no adequate liaison among those concerned with health, education, employment or welfare. When faced with the frustration and the growing discontent amongst the Coloured people, no single Cabinet Minister is prepared to accept responsibility; and understandably so, because the situation in many ways looks frighteningly out of control.</p>

<p>The point of danger in all these matters will be reached once the mass of Coloured people become convinced that they have been and are largely being excluded from their legitimate place in the community as a result, very largely, of our own selfishness. Once that happens, they will certainly follow similar examples throughout the world and come to define themselves almost exclusively in terms of their disabilities. That is the danger point. At that point in our history no one can predict what the outcome will be. The object of this motion today is to plead with the Government for far-seeing action to be taken now in relation to these problems, before both Coloured and White societies in South Africa reap the inevitable whirl-winds of neglect.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had an opportunity today of making a contribution to the development of the Coloured community, and of giving guidance which could be stimulating to the bodies to whom the progress of this community has been entrusted, as well as to the leaders of the Coloured community themselves. Unfortunately I can only say that his speech here tried to introduce a note of political commotion into the relationships between the Whites and the Coloured population. What is more, I find it striking to note the extent to which that hon. member and the hon. member for Wynberg, who has just resumed her seat, contradicted each other in regard to the contact which the Coloureds today have with the Whites. According to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout they do not have this and that is the reason why they cannot progress, and according to the hon. member for Wynberg, the Coloureds have this to a greater extent now than they ever had before. The hon. members must discuss these things more thoroughly in their caucus and try to understand each other better before making such statements. At the outset I do not think I can make any better comment on what the hon. member said than to quote just a few sentences from a letter by a certain Mrs. Lydia Pienaar, who for years was a social welfare worker among the Coloured population <span class="col_1283-1284" refersTo="page_0655"/>in the days when the United Party was still in power. In a discussion of the book by Dr. Barnard, she said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a social worker I have worked with Coloureds and Natives who lived under the most shocking conditions in District Six and Windermere. Many a morning in winter I hurried to the little tin shanty office in Twelfth Avenue to accept with gratitude a copy of steaming hot tea from Mr. Forbes, the Coloured warden of Windermere. Mr. Forbes as one o&#x00ED; the Shawco students, will bear me out on conditions in those days.</block>

<p>Hon. members on the opposite side must listen very carefully now to the following. This comes from a person who did not sit on the soft cushions here, but who moved and worked among these people and did something for them. She went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was only since 1948 that conditions for non-Whites really improved all over the country. The shack in Twelfth Avenue was in 1952 replaced by a spacious community centre and the entire shanty town shortly afterwards totally demolished.</block>

<p>I think that this woman, in a few sentences, has commented on what hon. members on the opposite side said here today, by referring to the former conditions and what has since 1948 been done in regard to the Coloured community and the progress they have made. I want to tell the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Wynberg that in their outlook on life they only view the Coloureds as happy beings as long as they are the underlings of the Whites and are privileged to live in the backyard of a White person instead of on their own piece of land and in their own homes. What service are the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Wynberg doing the Coloured community here today by emphasizing malnutrition, poor housing, illegitimate children, inebriation, poor family life, etc.&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member must listen. In regard to the White people of South Africa I can also mention certain areas and talk about malnutrition, inebriation, of children being neglected, of illegitimate children, etc. I want to ask the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Wynberg what service they are doing the Coloured community by walking around in their residential areas and pointing out these deficiencies&#x003F; Why do they not also draw our attention to the wonderful family life of thousands of Coloured families&#x003F; Why do they not point out the financial and economic achievements of many Coloureds today who have become prosperous and rich people, or even ordinary artisans&#x003F; I want to tell the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that there are ordinary Coloured artisans who are earning more than he and I am earning. There are not one or two of them, but thousands. I want to ask hon. members on the opposite side what assistance they are offering the leaders of the Coloured community by referring to the Coloured population and trying to create the impression that the vast majority of the people are living under the most reprehensible conditions, on a very low moral level, etc.&#x003F; In addition to that, their charge is also that it is in fact the fault of the Whites that conditions are as they are. In the first instance, this is a completely distorted picture. Hon. members on the opposite side are not aware of the development and progress which the Coloured community has made, and which they are making every day. And if these things are partially still the case today, then it is precisely as a result of the lack of policy in regard to the Coloured population of the United Party for many years. For the Coloured population there was no place of its own in South Africa. There were no opportunities for it, except, as I said, in the backyards as the underlings of the Whites. To what extent was Coloured leadership developed during the time of the United Party Government&#x003F; None whatsoever.</p>

<p>The National Party, also according to the evidence of this woman who saw, knew and remembered the conditions, began <i>inter alia</i> in 1948 with a general programme of development for the Coloured community. To help the Coloured community realize itself, provision was in the first instance made in urban areas for Coloured group areas. Now I want to admit to hon. members that the housing <span class="col_1285-1286" refersTo="page_0656"/>provided by the State was in general sub-economic housing of a relatively low standard. But in by far the most cases it was better housing than these people had hitherto known. What is more, the National Party Government did not tell these people that they had to live in sub-economic houses for all eternity. As they improved their own economic position, mobilized their own savings, it was pointed out to them, the opportunity for them was there and the land was made available to them to build their own economic houses. Many of them are in fact already doing so and building societies and other bodies are helping them to do so. What is wrong with that&#x003F; The National Party commenced a general programme of development for the Coloured community. I have just referred to housing. Let us consider a few other matters now.</p>

<p>It is the National Party which established a general educational development programme for the Coloured population. When it suits hon. members on that side of the House, when they are addressing people in our rural areas who are a little conservative in some places, they use as an argument against us that so many Coloured schools and all kinds of other facilities are being established for the Coloured population.</p>

<p>I say that the National Party has for many years been engaged in a general programme of educational development, and the creation of opportunities. That is why, as the hon. member for Malmesbury has already said, there is a university for the Coloured population. No, as far as hon. members on that side of the House are concerned, they should merely have gone on attending the University of Cape Town and other universities. Then they would have been happier. Then they would have realized themselves.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout stated that they had no opportunities and contacts in the economic sphere. But they have all the contacts in the world. When the recently established Coloured Persons Representative Council needs advice to make a start with certain matters, the best economists in the White community are at their disposal, the Coloured Development Corporation, with its advisers and its money, is at their disposal. That is more than a White person had in our time.</p>

<p>In addition to that managerial and administrative opportunities are being introduced, which these people longed for and of which they had so little experience in the past. Today they are still lagging behind in this respect, precisely because they did not have the opportunity before. But that opportunity has been created. It is open to them in the Department of Coloured Administration; it is open to them in regard to the opportunities for their own businesses in Coloured areas where the business undertakings of these people are protected. They have the opportunity to develop in the business world. Their professions are being protected. Those hon. members are not aware of these opportunities. They do not know to what extent these people have already developed. I also get the impression that the Coloureds are no longer inclined to believe these hon. members and the stories they are still spreading today.</p>

<p>Sir, the policy and the development programme of the National Party for the Coloured population have opened opportunities for this population group which it has never had before, and if there is a road the end of which we cannot see, then it is the political road; then it is the road of the development of these people. We are right at the beginning and they are right at the beginning. A tremendous future lies ahead for them. Let us accept the figure of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout of 400,000 Coloureds in the Cape Peninsula who will in thirty years&#x2019; time number 1,400,000. Can you imagine, Sir, what opportunities there will then be for the Coloured population within the framework of this community&#x003F; If they are there, then they will be properly accommodated, even better than today. Can you imagine what opportunities there will then be for the Coloureds in trade, in the professions and in every possible sphere within their own community&#x003F; I say that the hon. members on that side do not know and do not understand what opportunities have really been opened for this community. They are utilizing these opportunities to the full, and they will continue to do so to an increasing extent in their own interests, and in the interests of their own people.</p>

<p>But I want to come to the thought with which I want to conclude, which is that it is continually being suggested to us&#x2014;this was also the tone of these hon. members&#x2019; <span class="col_1287-1288" refersTo="page_0657"/>speeches&#x2014;that the Whites and the Whites alone, are responsible for what will happen with the Coloureds in future, and that the unfavourable conditions which may exist today is the fault of the Whites. I want to emphasize here today that the hon. members must understand and realize that we have placed the Coloured population on the road to self-development.</p>

<p>That hon. member must just try to make certain where he is going. The Coloureds will determine their future themselves. Sir, we must get away from the idea that what will happen with the Coloureds is solely dependent on what the Whites do for them. The Coloured population has reached the stage where they are definitely doing things for themselves. If I may refer to the discussions and the work of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, then I should like to say that those Coloured leaders should place greater emphasis on this point, i.e. that these people are now in a position to promote their own affairs themselves; to determine their own future themselves; to ensure their own progress themselves.</p>

<p>There are tremendous opportunities. Sir, allow me now to mention only a few things in order to enlighten the hon. member for Wynberg a little. There is for the Coloured leader a very good opportunity, for example, to mobilize the savings of the Coloured population for their own development, whether through insurance, life insurance or other insurance, savings banks, etc., in order to create an even better future for the Coloureds. The Coloured population today has that opportunity. They are earning money which will enable them to do so. Thirty to forty years ago the Afrikaansspeaking sector of the White population was poorer than the Coloured population is today, and handled less money. They rose from the ashes; they created for themselves the necessary economic bodies to work out their own future, and that is what the Coloured population is able to do today. The Coloured population in the social sphere, in the political sphere, and in the economic sphere has that opportunity, and I am convinced that they will in the future come to realize this to an increasing extent, and that they will utilize that opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to return to the unfavourable conditions which the hon. members emphasized to such an extent: It is also a task, and it is also a problem for the leaders of the Coloured population in the first instance. But these are not things which can be established in one or two days, and that is why it is not fitting for us continually to be reproaching these people about these conditions which exist here. We must give them a chance. The responsible Coloureds are aware of this; they are painfully aware of these things, but you must give them a chance, with the aid of church societies, welfare associations and others, to educate and to train their people to improve their standard of living and their moral level and to clear up the unfavourable conditions. Sir, I say that these are not things which can take place in one or two days. But one fact is quite clear, and that is that the Government of this National Party, more than any other government, has given these people a place to live and a position in South Africa, not only in regard to land tenure, but also in regard to living space in the economic life, living space in regard to the development of their social life and living space in regard to all possible professions today. [Interjections.] I have just mentioned this now; the hon. member for Wynberg must read these things for a change and do her homework, then she will be reasonably conversant with these matters. Mr. Speaker, we are on this road. It is the National Party that will in future be given the credit by the Coloured population for having laid these foundations. As the educational level of the Coloured population increases and its social sense of responsibility develops and grows, they will be better off and they will have a richer and fuller share in the prosperity of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I think that the House is indebted to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout for this motion that he has introduced today. One would have expected from the Nationalist ranks, in view of the attitudes outside of this House amongst the people of the country, an approach <span class="col_1289-1290" refersTo="page_0658"/>to this problem and to the motion before us other than one of expressions of smug satisfaction about what has been done by the Nationalist Party. We had nothing else from the hon. members for Malmesbury and Piketberg. Sir, it is an extraordinary thing that the one hon. gentleman on that side of the House who has not spoken in this debate, is the one whose words I would now like to quote to those hon. gentlemen who have spoken against the suggestion that it is necessary to appoint a commission. On the 22nd May, 1969, the hon. member for Moorreesburg said in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our future, particularly in the Western Cape, remains intensely bound up with that of the Brown people. We in the Western Cape cannot wish them away from our back doors. In future we will have to face with the greatest wisdom the complicated tasks of the shaping of a policy and the practical implementation thereof. It is against this background that I as one who lives in the Western Cape want to ask today whether as regards the future dispensation for our Brown people the time has not come when we should have a Tomlinson report, if I may call it that, on the new patterns of the future which are developing at present. Should we not utilize the best brain power in our country, as was done in the case of the Tomlinson Commission&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, I want to say to the hon. member for Moorreesburg that in those sentiments he not only has the support of this side of the House but he has the support of most right-thinking South Africans who are concerned about the Coloured people.</p>

<p>What is this road that this Government has set them on&#x003F; The hon. member for Piketberg said &#x201C;hulle is op &#x2019;n pad&#x201D;. Where does that road lead to&#x003F; According to the hon. the Prime Minister that road has a dead end. Sir, speaking of that, may I say too what a disappointment it will be to the country that the hon. Prime Minister himself who wants to relegate this problem to future generations for solution, is not sitting in the House today to give us the benefit of his contribution to a discussion of this sort. Sir, when we talk about the building that should have been done for the Coloured people, the one foundation about which this Government has done nothing, was the foundation which should have been built upon. That was the decision of the Cape Provincial Administration in 1946 to introduce compulsory education for Coloured children. It was done on the basis of a realistic approach that there would be demarcated centres and children within eight miles of that centre would be subjected to compulsory education. In fact, the motion was introduced in the Provincial Council by the hon. member for Sea Point. It was started. Then there was a change of control in the Provincial Administration and all thought of compulsory education for the Coloureds was pushed into the backwaters by the Government and by the Administration. Similarly, why is it that the Cape Provincial Administration, which in 1964 stood against the rest of this country to see that there was justice in regard to salaries for professional staff employed by the Administration, and who were prepared to stand up and to reduce the disparity between White and Coloured to a 10 to 9 ratio&#x2014;and the hon. member for False Bay will know that that was the attitude which was adopted&#x2014;have now surrendered, just as the hon. member for Moorreesburg has gone back to his little corner and is no longer prepared to fight for what he believed should be fought for.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury made one interesting reference. He referred to the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s guide lines, the essentials for the development of the Coloured people, as set out in his statement made in 1961, when he indicated the four elements which were essential to the separation of the Coloured people on the road of self-development. He said the first was the development of urban residential areas, the second was economic development aided by the Coloured Development Corporation, the third was local self-government and the fourth was an elected Coloured Representative Council. Those were the four elements that he felt were essential.</p>

<p>Now let us examine what progress has been made. In the time at my disposal I can only deal with some of these things, and I will confine myself to the first three of these elements which are regarded as basic to any progress in separate development for the Coloureds. But they must be viewed in the light of the divergence of the guide lines as provided by the Nationalist <span class="col_1291-1292" refersTo="page_0659"/>Party on the one hand and by the United Party on the other hand. But even when it comes to the Nationalist Party, we had as recently as 1959 the Cape Nationalist Congress, on the motion of Dr. Malan, then M.E.C., rejecting out of hand any suggestion that there should be the adoption of parliamentary voters&#x2019; rolls for municipal elections in the Cape Province. In fact, Dr. Malan at that congress said we must stop treating Coloureds like lepers, and he was cheered. What has happened to the Cape Nationalist who now sits back and does not stand for that policy which was adopted by his congress&#x003F; I go further and I ask any member of the Nationalist Party in this House to tell me when a congress passed a resolution which was contrary to the 1959 resolution of the Cape Congress&#x003F; No, while we have on the one hand these statements like the resolution of 1959, and while we have the statements of the hon. the Minister of Defence and of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs about bringing us closer with the Coloured people, as was mentioned by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, we have on the other hand the Minister of Bantu Administration saying that we must go wider and wider apart.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if the fact that separation must increase over the future years, does not mean going wider apart, then I do not understand the language used by the hon. the Minister. But let me look for one moment at local self-government and at this direction which was taken by the Government a year ago.</p>

<p>To revert to the hon. member for Brakpan, I have here a report from <i>Die Burger</i> of 1st December, 1970, with the heading &#x201C;Kleurlinge moet Verder Weg van Blankes&#x201D;. If that does not mean wider separation, then I do not know what it means. But to revert to the question I was dealing with, namely local self-government, this Government decided to pursue local self-government. It decided to pursue it in the face of the Rossouw Commission which was appointed in the Cape, by the Nationalist Provincial Administration. It was a course embarked upon without any thought as to the financial implications or the practicability of establishing local self-government based on our traditional laws by which such local authorities are established. What do we find after nine years&#x003F; What progress, progress which seems to give such self-satisfaction to the members who have spoken in this debate, have we had&#x003F; After nine years, there are 22 management committees of which only six have partly elected members. The rest of the so-called management committees are all nominated by the Government. For the rest, we have 53 consultative committees. This is the great progress towards local self-government for the Coloureds, nearly 2 million people.</p>

<p>That is much more than you could offer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That is the progress which has been made, this limited progress towards local self-government, while the Coloured person, no matter what the value of his property is, will have no vote except in one of these six local areas. This is the case irrespective of where his property is and what municipality receives the benefit of its taxation. This local self-government has not developed, because this Government did not heed the Nationalist appointed Rossouw Commission.</p>

<p>I want to remind hon. members of some of the findings of the Rossouw Commission, before this stupid impractical course was set upon. In paragraph 31 the Commission reports: &#x201C;The Committee is not prepared to recommend that Coloured be deprived of municipal franchise&#x201D;. In paragraph 40: &#x201C;The Committee is convinced that there is yet no area in the Cape Province which can immediately be proclaimed as an independent local authority in terms of existing provincial legislation&#x201D;. In paragraph 66 the Commission found: &#x201C;The Coloured areas referred to at present do not possess the means and capital resources to exist as separate municipalities&#x201D;. Finally, in chapter 5 the Commission recommended the establishment of metropolitan authority to deal with services, before there was any step towards the establishment of Coloured local authorities. How correct that Commission has been proved to be! Sir, there can be no objection whatsoever to the establishment of local authorities based on viable geographic areas, whether they are White or non-White in the majority. Every hon. member will be aware that no local <span class="col_1293-1294" refersTo="page_0660"/>authority can survive unless it encompasses commercial and industrial rateable buildings of an appreciable value. It therefore is essential that industrial and commercial development is a pre-requisite for local self-government by the Coloured people. But there appear to be no signs of co-ordinated planning as far as this Government is concerned.</p>

<p>This brings me to the question of housing for the Coloured people. Housing in the Western Cape Province is dictated primarily by resettlement which has been made necessary as a result of the Group Areas Act and, to an extent, for slum clearance to be effected. This has resulted in tens of thousands of Coloured families having to be or having been resettled. What do we find occurring, for instance, on the Cape Flats&#x003F; This area will by the end of this century have approximately a million Coloured people living in it. I must concede that, if the basic necessity and the sole responsibility of the Department of Community Development is to put a roof over the heads of Coloured families, then there has been commendable progress both by the local authorities and by the National Housing Commission in the support which it has given to local authorities. But is this the end of resettlement, merely to put a roof over the heads of the Coloured people&#x003F; Coloured people today have a substantial number of qualified professional and skilled persons. They have numbers of persons who have qualified to enter into activities related to commerce and industry. There are a large number of members of, what one might term, the untrained labour force of the Coloured people. They also have amongst them their quota of aged and infirm people.</p>

<p>Culturally, we know as far as the Coloured people are concerned, they cover the whole spectrum which is common to any Western people. There is the highly educated and sophisticated group amongst the Coloured people. There is the traditional responsible middle-class family people and then there are the unattached and the unambitious as there are among any other Western race. Socially they equally cover the same normal range of the human race, from firmly established families, family units, to their own permissive society within their own ranks. They are no different from any other Western nation. I do not believe that these facts are taken into account at all in the resettlement schemes. I do not believe that we are contributing one iota to the development of economic or social advancement or of local self-government, by creating sprawling townships of single-storied dwellings as are cropping up in various parts of this country and particularly in the Western Cape. They are characterless, soulless housing estates.</p>

<p>We certainly need more planning. We need more planning for a viable Coloured metropolis of the future and particularly so in the Western Cape. On occasions I am shocked to find that even in the allocation of homes to Coloured people who have to be resettled, no investigation whatsoever is done into the status, standing or background of the families who have to be moved. Once the population register has been completed and once they are issued the K-card, the person becomes a digit as far as community development is concerned. I would like to show to some members of this House some Coloured persons who have been told to move next door to some of the squatters from the Valley of Plenty. They are people who have entirely different backgrounds and education. I have taken some of them to the department so that they can see the people they are dealing with. These are things that we on this side of the House believe need investigation.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member want class distinctions&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>This shows the complete ignorance of the hon. member for Brakpan. If I could only have the attention of the hon. member for Brakpan, I will tell him that it shows his complete ignorance of the Coloured people. He does not realize that they are like any Western race except for their colour and he does not realize that they have their social standards and social gradings amongst themselves. It exists and we cannot deny it. They are a Western race and I wish the hon. member would realize that. There are social differences among the people. When they become the responsibility of the Department of Community Development for rehousing, as I say, they become digits, they become units who have to be rehoused and not human people.</p>

<p>I believe that rethinking and more determined planning is necessary. The mere <span class="col_1295-1296" refersTo="page_0661"/>provision of houses is not enough. There must be locality development, planned development, and that is what needs attention. I do hope that in spite of what has been said by the two members on the other side who have taken part in this debate, the hon. the Minister will realize, when he speaks in this debate later, the urgent necessity for, as has been suggested, a Tomlinson-type commission. The infrastructure for family life, for economic life, for economic progress and for social development of the individual must be provided. Provision must be made for the industrial and economic development of the group as a group, and for the financial viability of the townships. No local authority can run a town if its sole income is what might derive from sub-economic housing. That is what we are expecting the Coloured people to do.</p>

<p>This requires the application of principles which are required in Europe. The hon. the Deputy Minister is probably aware of what is being done in Sweden. There they are redeveloping areas and in the redevelopment they are providing for higher population density areas with communal facilities, swimming baths, sports-fields or parks which are maintained by the local authorities. That is provided in certain areas and in other areas the separate dwelling type of housing is provided. The high population density areas with multi-storied flats are necessary. One also needs reasonably sized plots for home-ownership. Is sufficient attention given to those Coloured people who desire to have their own independence respected by being able to buy or to build their own homes when they are being resettled&#x003F; Is there sufficient&#x2014;and I suggest it has not been attempted&#x2014;community, business and civic facilities for industrial areas with even the elementary necessity of planting trees in order to create parks for future generations, if not for the present&#x003F; If one of those hon. gentlemen would fly over the Cape Flats and look down, they would see what horror there must be to these people if they have any love for nature, because there are vast areas without a single tree and without any attempt being made to create an atmosphere in which we ourselves might like to live.</p>

<p>Unless we are prepared to face these requirements and unless we are prepared to recognize that separate development will syphon off Coloured initiative, know-how and spending from the White areas into the new Coloured metropolises, we must reject the whole concept of economic separate development and look again at what is being asked for by the Minister of Defence, namely a closer liaison and a closer future between the Whites and the Coloureds in South Africa. The cost, the effect in the ultimate are at present unknown. What we do know is that on the course on which we are set now, we are fast losing the co-operation of the Coloured people. If this trend is to continue, if we are to be driven further apart by compulsion of law, we will be creating both for ourselves and for future generations problems which might well be disastrous for the well-being and peaceful co-existence of both Whites and Coloureds in South Africa. In other words, in supporting the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s motion, I want to say that the time has come, and I believe that the whole of South Africa is ready for it, to accept a new approach for this problem&#x2014;not the problem, but the fact&#x2014;of the co-existence of Whites and Coloureds. I believe, in the words of my hon. leader, that the time has come for a more compassionate society in which the dignity and the aspirations of the Coloured people are respected and also advanced in all spheres of our national life. Without the investigation and without the program which had been suggested by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, I can see us stumbling on in the years ahead with relationships deteriorating, rather than improving. For these reasons I support this motion.</p>

<speech by="#mclachlan">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. MCLACHLAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, all that this black picture which has been presented to us here this afternoon of the position of the Coloured people, reveals to me is the whole approach of the United Party to this question. They come and ask us for a commission of inquiry, a study commission, or whatever they want to call it, but there is one very good reason why we cannot debate the matter of such a commission with them. The reason is that they refuse to accept our premise. Our premise is that the Coloureds are a people-in-the-making. They are not prepared to go further than that. They merely say that the Coloureds must in future remain part of the Western group. They will not go any further than that. How then can we <span class="col_1297-1298" refersTo="page_0662"/>discuss this community&#x003F; Then they tell us that this is a community which lives in the most distressing conditions. If time had allowed, I would have given a few examples of what the real position is in regard to that community. I ask the hon. member for Wynberg in particular to study the editions of <i>Alpha.</i> Then I would ask her just to have a look at what is contained in that publication. She will see there how the Coloured lives today. Why does she now come and tell us about the thousands who are living in misery&#x003F; That is the whole purpose of the motion of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He wants to sell something to the world. He uses the words &#x201C;serious handicaps&#x201D; to try and prove to the world abroad that this Government is responsible for the extremely serious handicaps which are being experienced by these people. Then he uses a second word, and this word is a word which is purposely designed to mislead people. That word is &#x201C;rehabilitate&#x201D;. What must we rehabilitate&#x003F; This Government has removed nothing from the Coloured community. Just listen for a while to what Mr. Bergens, a member of the Executive of the Coloured Council, has to say in connection with education. He says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the education of Coloureds became the responsibility of the Department of Coloured Affairs in 1964, a new era began in the history of Coloured education.</block>

<p>But in another connection this same man said&#x2014;and that is why those words of his are so important&#x2014;(I am quoting from the newspaper of his party)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is with shame that we must attest that nothing of any significance was done for us in the past, except that we followed in the wake of an English imperialistic government as outriders. With the coming to power of the present Government, with its policy of separate development &#x2026; for us &#x2026; a new dispensation began, because now it is possible for us, on the level of separate progress, to reach unknown heights and unprecedented achievements.</block>

<p>Sir, that is what the leaders of these people say. When mention was made just now of the re-settlement and housing of these people, the hon. member for North Randmade a snide interjection and asked if they were happy there on the flats. The hon. member for Green Point also made a derogatory reference to those areas where there was not even a tree to offer shade. Is that party prepared to bring those people back to where they were&#x003F; Do not tell me it is no argument. A tree does not grow in a day; a garden is not laid out in a day. We know that in every situation of resettlement there must necessarily be some disruption.</p>

<p>Much has been said about the terrible suffering these people endure, those people who are now so poor and so neglected. Sir, in 1965 there were 56,000 Coloureds in South Africa in receipt of old-age pensions. In 1970 the figure was 61,000. But now there is another interesting figure. Unfortunately, the hon. member for Durban Point is not here. He can go and use it in Marico. Although the Coloureds number only half of the White population, in comparison they have more pensioners than the Whites. In regard to disability grants, more than 18,000 Whites receive them. In 1965 17,000 Coloureds received them. Now it is 22,000&#x2014;4,000 more than the Whites, while they are only half the size of the White population. These figures can be misused, but we are not afraid to make them known. We do these things because we want to show the world that on the one hand we are helping the middle groups, the stabilized Coloureds, of whom the hon. member for Wynberg spoke. We are giving that stabilized group an opportunity to govern themselves eventually. To the other group, which is still backward, through these and countless other welfare measures, which we will no doubt discuss further under the Vote of the Minister, we offer the chance to develop to autonomy. What the Opposition will not do is to accept the Coloured community as a developing people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have arranged that because of the time factor I will not speak any longer, but I just want to say this to the United Party, that if they think this afternoon that through this motion they can win the sympathy of the Coloured people, then they are doubly misleading the Coloureds. All that they are doing is to say that they, the United Party, now want to help &#x201C;rehabilitate&#x201D;. The National Party says: No, we will &#x201C;build&#x201D;, because we have demolished nothing; we can only build further from here.</p>

As far as making proposals is concerned, very little has been said about the implementation of a comprehensive programme for the rehabilitation and the development of this population group. We had to learn here this afternoon that the hon. member actually has in mind a kind of Tomlinson or Odendaal commission. When we consider their attitude towards the Tomlinson commission at the time, perhaps to a lesser degree, but certainly towards the work subsequently done by the Odendaal commission, I would rather like to ask him whether he would accept the findings of such a commission, should the Government now decide to appoint one.</p>

<p>In other words, he now first wants to stipulate who is to serve on that commission. After that he will decide whether he will accept the findings. He mentioned, <i>inter alia,</i> the name of the man he would like to see on it, namely Prof. S. P. Cilliers. He himself and others spoke of the particular social discrimination against the Coloured people. Does he know that it is the same Prof. Cilliers whose words he now uses and whose information and paper he now invokes against the National Party policy who said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is, however, worth While stating that, while emphasis is often put on the legal restrictions in this regard &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is now the relationship between White and non-White&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; these are, in the case of the Coloureds, relatively few and insignificant.</block>

<p>I think this is where the National Party comes in&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Colour Bar is overwhelmingly maintained on the basis of tradition rather than legal support.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask him, bearing in mind his definition of &#x201C;petty apartheid,&#x201D; whether he is prepared to give up this tradition. Is he one of those who will first set us an example in respect of what is said by this man, whom he wants to serve on the commission, Which must then give us a blueprint&#x003F; Will he be one of the first to set us an example, he and his friends on the opposite side&#x003F; Just give us a reply to this question, please, then we could discuss matters better and understand each other better as well. I think we could then exchange fruitful ideas. I would very much have liked to conduct a constructive debate on what has been done as a result of the announcement of a socio-economic programme for these people as far back as ten years. This is a programme for people about whom we do not need a Tomlinson commission, because they are more compact and mainly concentrated in the Western Cape. It is therefore much easier to come to a conclusion about which direction we want to follow with them. There may be some merit in certain aspects of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, but I have the gravest doubt whether it is still necessary at this stage, after ten or eleven years of purposeful rehabilitation, which, incidentally, is not acknowledged by hon. members on the opposite side. Hon. members opposite spent most of their time emphasizing in a negative way the desperate position of the Coloured people. They have torn them apart as a people. But whose side have they really chosen&#x003F; We know that there are two parties in the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council today. On the one hand there is the Federal Coloured People&#x2019;s Party, which is co-operating with the National Party on the basis of separate development. They say we are building a people.</p>

<p>Some of them may be nominated, but with them there are 14 who were elected. They agree. Together with them 158,000 people voted in favour of separate development and only 137,000 voted against it. So much for the moral aspects about which hon. members on the opposite side made such a fuss. Over against them there are others such as Mr. David Currie, who was quoted here by hon. members on the opposite side. He says, for instance, that &#x201C;we do not accept that we are a nation&#x201D;. Of course not. If I wanted to live with the Whites and be incorporated with them, it would hardly pay me to talk about a nation if I felt that I belonged to that class which could be easily incorporated. After all, that presupposes responsibility towards the people of my own group who are less privileged and to whom I must extend a helping hand.</p>

<p>Furthermore I want to tell the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that it is easy to read the quotations of our leaders out of context here in connection with the road of the Coloured people in the future. The hon. member said that the hon. the Prime Minister was leading the Coloured people along a road without knowing where it would end. Here is what the hon. the Prime Minister said on 22nd September, 1966: &#x201C;My reply is that I am leading the Coloureds along the road of self-realization.&#x201D; Do hon. members opposite want to deny that the Coloured people had not yet realized themselves in that year, that they are now struggling to realize themselves and that hon. members on the opposite Slide are prompting them not to realize themselves&#x003F; The Prime Minister continued and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am leading them along a road where they will be able to have their own facilities; I am leading them along a road where they will have their own educational opportunities; I am leading them along a road where they will have their own social facilities; I am leading them along a road where they will ultimately, when the Coloured Council has achieved its full development, have funds at their disposal, as my former Leader also said &#x2026;</block>

<p>I shall not repeat it, because we all know too what the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s view of this matter was. The hon. member has forgotten what the present hon. Prime Minister said subsequently and I shall come to that presently. One thing which he did say and which he also emphasized here and in subsequent speeches is that we are now laying the foundation. He said: &#x201C;It is the duty of this generation, if it can do nothing else, to lay a foundation.&#x201D; Then he emphasized the goodwill of one human being towards another. He said: &#x201C;We accept that these people are not the same as we are in the sense that they are a separate nation. We will in future have to do with a separate Coloured nation and a separate White nation.&#x201D; Whose opinion does the hon. member for Bezuidenhout represent when he stands up here&#x003F; Is he satisfied that he represents the majority of the White population when he says that the Coloured people are part of the White group, that they are an appendage&#x003F;</p>

It has been said that the hon. the Prime Minister also said once that he did not know where the road would end. What other great leader has also said this&#x003F; Shortly after the First World War Gen. Smuts said: &#x201C;As regards the non-European problem, my mind is full of Cimmerian darkness.

<p><span class="col_1303-1304" refersTo="page_0665"/>We heard a great deal here today about moral approaches to the Coloured people. I now want to put a question to the United Party. After all, they attack us on our differences of opinion on the Coloured people and their future. The United Party has a policy in terms of which it wants to give the 700,000 Coloured voters in this country six representatives in this House. The Whites are then to decide later on whether they are to get more. Has the United Party never taken cognisance of the decision given by the Whites over the past 23 years, namely that we cannot get them here&#x003F; If the voters were ever to become so confused or to wander so far off course as to put the United Party into power, and the six representatives were to sit in this House, what would the United Party then recommend&#x003F; Are the Whites then to decide whether their number should be increased&#x003F; The Whites decided long ago. The United Party, as a minority party, now wants to decide for them. They want to give 700,000 people six representatives in this House. Is this morality in politics, or is it a kind of <i>Realpolitik</i> with which they want to catch the voter and tell him that they will never be able to come into power&#x003F; &#x201C;We are placing a wall in front of them. They will never be able to come into power. We shall make sure of that.&#x201D; I am not at all sure that the United Party is being quite honest with the White electorate in that respect. But hon. members on the opposite side now want to discuss politics and not the content of the motion. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said precious little about the content of his motion. Since the hon. members sometimes speak of six representatives in this House, I want to ask him what the United Party&#x2019;s policy is at the moment, after having spent 90 minutes on discussions held behind closed doors with the Coloured Labour Party a few weeks ago. What did the United Party decide there&#x003F; Tell White South Africa this. I have a report from the <i>Cape Times</i> here which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Leaders of the Labour Party and the United Party had discussions behind closed doors here for about 90 minutes yesterday following the Labour Party&#x2019;s call for boycotts of various aspects of the Government&#x2019;s race policy.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout talked nothing but politics and I am also talking politics now. I want the United Party to answer just this one question. On which policy has the United Party now agreed with <b>a</b> party which is known for not wanting to co-operate with separate development&#x003F; Why cannot White South Africa and the Coloured people know this&#x003F; The United Party is not being honest with either of these groups. I think the hon. member wants to get us off his back, because he felt it was getting hotter and hotter, especially after having made the blunder with that definition of his which he cannot live up to. I think that is the reason. Now the hon. member has suddenly acquired kindred spirits outside this House. Now he has also conceived the idea of a Tomlinson-type commission. He thought he could put us off course with that and steer our thoughts in a different direction. We have been working under a Tomlinson commission assignment for eleven years now. Hon. members heard what was being done for the Coloured people in the educational field. None of the hon. members on that side of the House referred to what can and has been done for the Coloured people in the rural and agricultural spheres.</p>

I want to tell them that the Coloured people do not agree with them at all in this connection. The comment in the <i>Cape Herald</i> is that there is only one kind of apartheid: petty apartheid and big apartheid are all the same. Those hon. members would do well to read it. Even the Coloured people do not believe the United Party. It will be of no avail to the hon. members on that side of the House to come forward with cunning tricks (<i>jakkalsstreke</i>) such as these. They will not get these people on their side.

<p>I know, but that hon. member devoted only about three minutes to the real problems of the Coloured people. For the rest of the time the hon. member discussed their supposed problems. The hon. member disparaged the Coloured people as a people and for the rest only preached prophecies of doom.</p>

<p>In the educational field there has been fantastic growth as far as the Coloured community is concerned. Where were the Coloured people and where do they stand today&#x003F; Let us look at the position in 1960. In 1960 only 241,000 children attended school. Last year the number was already close to 400,000. This is as far as primary schools are concerned. In 1960 fewer than 10,000 attended high school. This number increased until there were more than 50,000 last year. Last year there were 15,000 teachers already. The hon. member for Malmesbury mentioned this.</p>

<p>That side of the House talked about salaries and attacked us on that point. They said we were utterly insensible to the pleas of these people. This is not the case. All salaries have increased; those of the Whites and those of the Coloureds. The salaries of the Whites and the Coloureds fall under separate departments. Now it can easily happen that salaries in one department increase more rapidly than those in another, but if the hon. member for Wynberg alleges that we are unsympathetic in this regard, the hon. member does not know what is going on. The Coloured Persons Representative Council made representations in connection with salaries. These representations were received by the hon. the Minister and he said that he would put the matter to the Public Service Commission. It is a matter which is constantly receiving attention. We are moving towards a narrowing of the gap between the salaries of Whites and non-Whites. This is very clear.</p>

<p>The hon. member is quite wrong in that respect. I am just telling the hon. member what has been happening in the past two months, something of which she is completely ignorant, or she does not want to know about it.</p>

<p>*This is accordingly a matter which is at present receiving attention. Hon. members will just have to wait and see what happens. However, I can give the assurance that the sympathy is there. The person who has equal qualifications and does equal work, who carries equal responsibilities and is equally productive in every respect, to a large extent has an argument when he compares his salary. But we also have to take the financial aspect into consideration. Hon. members on that side of the House made a fuss here today about Coloured housing. This falls under the Department of Community Development. However, I do not merely want to say that hon. members should discuss the matter with that department, but it is in actual fact a function of the Department of Community Development. I think the hon. the Minister of Community Development is quite capable of answering hon. members in that regard if they put their case to him in due course.</p>

<p>As regards the salaries, these are a question of finance, just as they are a question of finance as regards teachers, just as it is a question of finance as regards the introduction <span class="col_1307-1308" refersTo="page_0667"/>of anything. One has to go to the tax-payers. Now I would like the hon. members of the Opposition to ask during the Budget debate this year that we spend much more and make much more money available for education for the Coloured people. They should then ask for it openly and frankly. Then we will have it on record here and then we will be able to tell the people in the rural areas, where those hon. members spread the idea that we do too much for the Coloured people: No, what we are doing and what the United Party wants to do is what we all regard as the right thing to do. The hon. members should not keep quiet about these matters when they have the opportunity to refer to them.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I just want to return to what I have been asked. Hon. members on this side of the House referred to the upliftment of the Coloured people in the industrial sphere over the past 10 years. For the information of hon. members opposite I just want to say that such a thing as the Coloured Development Corporation does exist. The hon. member for Maitland has asked questions about it. The Coloured people have already received R5&#x00BD; million from the State by way of a corporation. This corporation has already granted loans amounting to more than R3 million to Coloured businessmen in the past 10 years. In 1960, however, there was nothing of this nature yet. Not only have loans amounting to this enormous sum been granted, but this corporation has also initiated their own enterprises where the Coloured people could not do it themselves. The value of these enterprises is about R2&#x00BD; million. I just want to tell hon. members that undertakings such as Superama and Spes Bona Bank are concerns that were started by the corporation itself. As far as the bank is concerned, the savings by Coloured people themselves already amount to R1&#x00BD; million.</p>

<p>Yes, I think so too. Of course, the Coloured Development Corporation is also helping the Coloured people with business training. It is helping them with the creation of facilities. There are factory sets. There are a number of fields at present in which the Coloured Development Corporation is helping the Coloured businessman to find his feet in the business world and to serve his own people. At the same time he can become a small capitalist, someone with free initiative. In addition to all this, other forms of training are also being provided to the Coloured people in order that apprentices, about whom hon. members opposite have so much to say, can become qualified. A few years ago only 900 Coloured artisans completed their training. Last year 2,834 Coloured artisans were trained.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>When we adjourned the other day, I was replying to the statement of the hon. member for Transkei that this Bill was not a Bill that was generally being desired by the Bantu peoples and, what is more, that Chapter 1 was unnecessary. I should like to correct the hon. member and, at the same time, the hon. member for South Coast, who made a similar statement specifically in regard to Zululand. I want to correct them by saying that all the executive councils and all the territorial authorities of the Bantu people did in fact express this desire for a constitutional development, development such as that which is embodied in this Bill. They expressed this desire either directly to me or to their commissioner-general and officials of my Department. It will be useful, particularly to the hon. member for South Coast, to hear what Chief Buthelezi, chief executive councillor of the Zulus, said in a radio talk in January of this year. He gave this radio talk after he had had access to this Bill and had discussed it with us on three or four occasions. At the time he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1311-1312" refersTo="page_0669"/>The successful and responsible way in which we in the meantime have conducted our own affairs, and the knowledge we have gained, have given rise to a feeling that we are now mature enough to take on to our shoulders further responsibilities. The Executive Committee has after mature consideration arrived at the conclusion that we cannot within the framework of the existing legislation develop fully constitutionally because we feel our powers are too limited.</block>

<p>Later on he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the knowledge of the great responsibility that full self-government brings we, after consultation with the Minister, decided that the law referred to should be so worded as to substitute the existing Territorial Authority by a Legislative Assembly. It will be composed of citizens of our homeland and in a manner which the State President after consultation with us will promulgate by proclamation.</block>

<p>You see, Sir, he read the Bill more attentively than did some hon. members opposite. I have here the reactions of all the territorial authorities, but I want to content myself by only reading out one more, i.e, that of the Ciskei. This is what the chief councillor of the executive council of the Ciskei had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My colleagues and I have during recent weeks visited a number of tribal authorities in the Ciskei where the implication of the envisaged legislation was explained to councillors. Chiefs and councillors of the centres we visited supported the changes enthusiastically and the consensus of opinion was that avenues would be opened which could only ultimately benefit the people of the Ciskei. We support the idea of an enabling Act wholeheartedly and desire to extend our sincere thanks to the Government for the sympathetic manner in which it has dealt with our problems and for the benefits which will flow from the proposed legislation.</block>

<p>We received the same reaction from the other territorial authorities as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei went further and even said that Chapter 1 of this Bill was unnecessary. But Chapter 1 does in fact make it possible for all the territorial authorities to advance in a much more meaningful way to the Transkei stage of development, as we have already come to know it in the Transkei over the past seven years. In the case of the Transkei, as the hon. member ought to know very well, the jump was a major one, from the territorial authorities they had at that time to a self-governing area. By means of Chapter 1 of this Bill we are making it possible for an intermediate stage, so to speak, to be reached, a stage between that of the old territorial authorities and that of the present Transkei Government, which makes it possible for the Bantu peoples to advance in their legislative systems to the higher stages of self-government in a gradual and proper manner. How the hon. member can tell me that Chapter 1 is unnecessary, is incomprehensible. But what I find even more incomprehensible, is this: The hon. member says that Chapter 1 is unnecessary, but the Opposition tells us that in terms of their race federation policy all the territorial authorities can reach the political stage which is comparable with the provincial system which we have in our four provinces today. They say that under their system the provincial stage and even stages higher than that can be reached by the territorial authorities, and yet the hon. member came along here and rejected Chapter 1 in this Bill, which does in fact seek to provide the Bantu peoples with additional constitutional experience and development along the road ahead. It is merely because the hon. members did not have any arguments that we had to listen here to such small talk.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that no country allowed any other state to make laws applicable to their citizens living in the other country. In this Bill there are two references to laws of other areas: whereas in the first chapter we state that the legislative councils in those areas may not amend an Act of this Parliament, we do say in the second chapter that once they have reached a higher form of self-government in the self-governing territory, they may in fact make laws on such matters as have been allocated to them, laws which may even amend Acts of this Parliament on those allocated matters. Sir, this is, to start with, an exact repetition of what has been happening in the Transkei for the past seven years. In the Transkei Constitution that very same power was granted to the Transkei, i.e. the power in terms of which they themselves can exercise by way of legislation the powers entrusted to them, even if, <span class="col_1313-1314" refersTo="page_0670"/>by doing so, they have to amend old Acts of our Parliament in Cape Town.</p>

<p>But, Sir, this is not a unique phenomenon either. We find it in other parts of the world as well. I want to remind the hon. member of the fact that in certain respects even the marriage laws of our own Whites are applicable in Britain to our people who get married there, whereas our marriage laws and their marriage laws differ from each other, especially in regard to ante-nuptial contracts. The hon. member ought to know that. Here in our own country, in South Africa, we have had the position over all these years that between Lesotho and the Republic, for instance, there has been an arrangement in terms of which they collect their taxes here from their people who are living here in our Republic. Furthermore, we have had the position over all these years that the Transkei has been doing the same thing here in respect of its people who are working in the Republic. After all, this is a situation which we in South Africa can create distinctively in order that it may fit in with our distinctive circumstances in view of the fact that we have here these various peoples, the White people and the Bantu peoples, who are living side by side and whose individuals are bound up with one another and move across one another&#x2019;s borders. This is, after all, a situation which we can create here and which we have already implemented here with success. Of course, the hon. member does not want to recognize this development along individual lines. The Bantu dowry laws are a similar system which is also being applied by themselves backwards and forwards, on both sides of their borders, i.e. in the White area as well. What we have here, is no strange phenomenon in respect of Bantu administration.</p>

<p>The hon. member also went on to speak about borders. He said that the borders of the homelands were so important that consolidation had to be affected in full before the Bantu homelands could be declared to be self-governing territories within the Republic, as is being provided in Chapter 2 of this Bill. At the same time the hon. member also reminded us of the fact that the Transkei was continually asking for additional land in Elliot and Maclear and such districts. But this is in fact being done by the Transkei subsequent to its being declared to be a self-governing territory and because the Transkei knows&#x2014;and the hon. member ought to know it too&#x2014;that in terms of the 1936 Act one may request and obtain more land for the Bantu. In fact, the Transkei Act also contains a provision in regard to land, and I shall refer to it in a moment, when I deal with the hon. member for Durban North. But the hon. member ought to know that although the consolidation of areas is very useful&#x2014; the sooner we are able to complete the consolidation of all the areas, the better&#x2014; there are many practical problems of which the financing is one of the most important, problems which do not make it possible for one to dispose of all these things in a very short space of time. And for that reason we cannot delay the constitutional development and the political development of those Bantu areas until such time as the last White farm has been acquired and the last incorrectly situated Bantu Reserve has been excised. These matters can go hand in hand with one another, for there is legislation which regulates them. We have been applying it over the years with reasonable satisfaction on both sides, both amongst the Whites and the non-Whites. And there is protection for Whites in the Act and also administratively in the application thereof.</p>

<p>That the Transkei is now laying claim to the districts of Elliot and Maclear, is no argument. They frequently do that, often on the strength of domestic political considerations. This Government has explicitly given its reply to that request, i.e. that we cannot consider it, and if this has to be repeated, it will be repeated for their benefit.</p>

<p>There is a question on the Question Paper and I shall furnish a proper reply to it, but at the moment we are dealing with this Bill and, in any case, I gave a reply to this point while the hon. member&#x2019;s mind was apparently wandering.</p>

<p>The major and important point made by the hon. member for Zululand, was that of the circumvention of this Parliament, i.e. that Parliament was being circumvented by means of the provisions contained specifically in Chapter 2 of this Bill, in which it is being provided that under the legislation before us at the moment, self-governing territories may in due course be established in the Republic by proclamation. But surely, Parliament is not being circumvented. Today, at this moment, it is after all being <span class="col_1315-1316" refersTo="page_0671"/>brought to the notice of this Parliament that those remaining areas may be declared to be self-governing territories within the area of the Republic. Surely, we are not circumventing Parliament. Instead of approaching Parliament seven times, we are now doing so once only. Here we are in Parliament now; we are asking for the principle that all those areas may become self-governing territories, and the hon. members can now say no to it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>After that we shall implement it when the time is ripe for doing so, if Parliament says yes to it now. The hon. member ought to know that. One of the hon. members opposite advanced an equally stupid argument by saying that this Parliament was giving up its sovereignty on that point. Parliament does not give up its sovereignty if it decides on all seven of them on one occasion instead of deciding on one of them on seven occasions. On the basis of this Bill Parliament has the right to lay down that principle now. Parliament will, therefore, not have given up one grain of its sovereignty, and no future Minister implementing that provision will be circumventing the powers of this Parliament. I think this is an outrageously fallacious argument to use.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand also spoke here about the history in regard to reserves in Natal, and he charged the Voortrekkers with things which should only be laid at the door of Sir Theophilus Shepstone and other people. He said that the British and the Voortrekkers had divided up the Zulu areas in Natal as they are today. Sir, we know who was responsible in Natal for the so-called &#x201C;grid-iron policy&#x201D;, the policy of cutting up areas in such a manner that they looked like the parallel bars of a grid-iron. We know where that comes from. That was not the work of the Voortrekkers. The hon. member for Zululand should not hide behind people who cannot defend themselves and who did not create these conditions. We are well aware that Natal is the product of that British colonial policy of scattering the Natives. The policy which the British colonial administration implemented there, was a very bad one, and today we are saddled with this problem. The hon. member for Albany is at present experiencing some of the consequences of the same policy in the Ciskei, where it was implemented on a much more-limited scale but, nevertheless, on the same principle. The hon. member for Zululand was also very worried about, or tried to delight in, the use of the word &#x201C;possible&#x201D;, which I used when I referred to &#x201C;ultimate possible independence&#x201D;. What is wrong with the word &#x201C;possible&#x201D;&#x003F; To my knowledge the word &#x201C;possible&#x201D; does not mean &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; at all. I inserted that word &#x201C;possible&#x201D; in order to confirm that the independence was a possibility, not an impossibility or a shadow. The hon. members are always telling us that we are presenting falsehoods to the members of our party and to the public of South Africa. We are merely referring to independence as a shadow or a possibility. The hon. member ought to know that the word &#x201C;possible&#x201D; means &#x201C;possible&#x201D; and not &#x201C;impossible&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand also said that the Zulu people would not be able assist in designing the form of their executive machinery. They would not be able to assist in devising it. Their executive machinery consists mainly of two aspects, i.e. their Legislative Council and their Executive Council. The hon. member should take a look at clauses 2 and 5 of Chapter 1 and clause 29 of Chapter 2, and then he will see that, as regards both the Executive Council and the Legislative Council, which may be established beforehand, the necessary has to be done after consultation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I now want to come to the hon. member for Houghton. She said that the White and Bantu people are irrevocably bound together and are not separable. I do not know in what context the hon. member used those words, but I assume that she used them in a political context.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>And in an economic context.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can assure the hon. member&#x2014;and I think she knows it&#x2014;that we will have more peace in South Africa, and more friendly co-existence between the White nation on the one side and the Bantu nations on the other in terms of our policy than would be the case if the Whites and Bantu individuals were unnaturally integrated into one political body as proposed by the race federation scheme of the United Party, and especially her party&#x2019;s new scheme of Saturday, to which I will refer again just now. I wish to refer to a most deplorable method which the hon. member for Houghton again applied in her speech. Referring to a certain section, she said that she disapproved of the fact that educational matters will also be delegated to these authorities and that they may decide on them, but with the approval of the Minister. The words of the hon. member were &#x201C;with the approval of the Minister&#x201D;. If one looks up the relevant section, one finds that it reads that they may handle those matters and may decide on them, in consultation with the Minister. There is a big difference between the expression &#x201C;in consultation with the Minister&#x201D; and &#x201C;with the approval of the Minister&#x201D;. There is still another and quite different expression, namely &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D;. I am talking of &#x201C;in consultation with the Minister&#x201D; and not &#x201C;after consultation with the Minister&#x201D;. This Bill reads: &#x201C;In consultation with the Minister.&#x201D; The hon. member for Houghton said that this Bill lays down that it will be done with the approval of the Minister. That is not correct. If this could be done with the approval of the Minister only, it would mean that I, as the Minister, will have the final say and that they could only make a recommendation. However, &#x201C;in consultation&#x201D; means that we must concur. I must concur with them and they with me. There is a vast difference between the two expressions. Why does the hon. member use the words &#x201C;with the approval of the Minister&#x201D;&#x003F; I think this is a mischievous misrepresentation of the hon. member, for avid consumption by people overseas and elsewhere in South Africa. We know that there are many enemies of our country who welcome such expressions, because they can play football with them as they like.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We must of course concur. [Interjections.] The hon. member is not so stupid that he cannot understand the difference. If this Bill read &#x201C;with the approval of the Minister&#x201D; it would mean that they could take a decision and the Minister alone would finally decide the issue. That is quite different from what is laid down in the Bill.</p>

<p>For the information of the hon. member for Houghton I can just add that this particular section in the Schedule is to the benefit of the Bantu authorities and to the benefit of the Bantu pupils especially because it contains a guarantee for the standards of education with regard to the syllabi, the examinations and the methods of teaching.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton also said that we know nothing about how the Legislative Council and the Executive Council will be constituted under this Bill. Those are in the main the matters in connection with which we will have consultation before those proclamations will be promulgated. There will be negotiations between the Minister and those Bantu authorities in order to formulate those stipulations with regard to their Executive Councils and their Legislative Councils. Such a proclamation will finally be tabled in this House. Parliament will have the opportunity to note its contents and even to reject it if it likes.</p>

<p><span class="col_1319-1320" refersTo="page_0673"/>The hon. member for Houghton also asked me whether clause 4 of this Bill will be deleted if the Bantu territories at some time become independent. It is of course not an issue under consideration at this moment. However, the reply is quite easy. It will all depend upon the agreement entered into between us and the particular Bantu authorities at the time when independence may be considered. That is not a matter on which we have to decide today. It is not even a matter which we have to discuss today, because there should first of all be negotiations between us and the Bantu authorities in regard to this matter. This speech of the hon. member for Houghton really is a speech which, to my mind should not have been delivered, especially in view of Saturday being so near to the date on which she held this speech to which I am referring. We noticed in this morning&#x2019;s Press that the Progressive Party congress on Saturday approved of a major change in their policy with regard to Bantu homelands. [Interjections.] No, hon. members must listen to what I have to say.</p>

<p>They rejected it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member must listen. The change brought about by their change of policy last Saturday brings the Progressive Party perfectly in line with the United Party with regard to the Bantu homelands. [Interjections.] Oh yes, it is definitely so. We know the kernel of the United Party policy with regard to political matters relating to the Bantu homelands was put forward in this House last year by my hon. friend, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He said that they can obtain provincial status and a status which will be even higher than that of the provinces. That is exactly what was said last Saturday by the Progressive Party. The Progressive Party now also envisages provincial status for the Bantu homelands and they even undertake to invite an independent homeland to return to the Republic as a province, according to the report which was published this morning. That indicates a very strong agreement between the United Party and the Progressive Party on the political aspects of the Bantu homelands. [Interjections.] If they make it possible for me, I would like to remind hon. members that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, gave an exposition last year of their race federation policy with regard to this very same issue, namely the homelands. He said that the homelands under a race federation could enjoy provincial status inside the federal state as local autonomous units. That is exactly the same thing which the Progressive Party is saying now, according to the statement this morning. [Interjections.] I do not know why both sides of the Opposition protest so much. I really cannot understand it. They should not protest so much, because it appears to me that a very fascinating political reunion between those two parties is in the offing.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Albany used a very ugly expression, which in actual fact reveals his subconscious mind and that of his party. This is to be seen in his words &#x201C;lasting peace and stability of the labour force&#x201D;. That is the major objective to be realized in South Africa. All they see in the Bantu people is &#x201C;lasting peace and a stable labour force&#x201D;.</p>

He is further back in the past than the stage of being old-fashioned if he thinks that that is the decisive consideration in political development in South Africa. The hon. member also referred to the legislation of this Parliament which can be repealed by the Legislative Assembly. He said that this was a denial of the sovereignty of Parliament. Actually, I have finished replying to this point and therefore I do not see any point in dealing with it again on this occasion.</p>

<p>I have already read out to the hon. member what the leader of the Zulu Territorial Authority said a month ago. I am going to read out more to this hon. member if he would care to listen. The hon. member also said that the officials of my department cannot convey to me in Pretoria the feelings of the Zulus. That is not so. If the hon. member says a thing like that, he does not know what he is talking about. My officials, including the Commissioner-General, time and again brought the messages of the Zulu people to me. Besides that, since 1966 as Minister of this department, I have had three or four visits by the Zulu leaders themselves to Pretoria apart from what I heard from them at Nongoma, in which they conveyed to me their wish to have a Territorial Authority in Zululand. It was brought to me by the late Cyprian and by Israel and was also told to me by Gatsha Buthelezi, their present political leader. My officials are also very capable of conveying messages, as they have over the years. The hon. member for South Coast also said &#x201C;that the enforcement of this measure is an enforcement of a European form of government on the Bantu&#x201D;. The hon. member nods his head affirmatively again. If the hon. member blames us for such a thing, what can we think and what should he then think of his own policy&#x003F; Under his own policy he will bring in representatives of the Bantu and ultimately Bantu themselves right into this Parliament. Is that not a confrontation with the Western form of government in this Parliament&#x003F; If this measure before us will be an enforcement of a European form of government the hon. member should also not be in favour of his race federation policy, because that also forces a European form of government on them. But what are we doing&#x003F; We have given a practical demonstration in the Transkei of what we have been doing in the last seven years. There we have a combination of that which is applicable in the Western form of political administration with the traditional form of political administration as the Bantu know it since their earliest years. That is what we have achieved in the Transkei; that is what we have in mind and that is what the Bantu also want in the other territories as provided for in this Bill. There we have the Transkei where we have this combination of what is applicable and useful in the Western system together with that traditional form of government and it is working well. This system will be modified from territorial authority to territorial authority when it is applied to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast also said that there is nobody on the Government side, not even in the Cabinet, who in the past supported and at present supports the views of the late Dr. Verwoerd. The hon. member said it was not supported by a &#x201C;single Minister, not by any Senator and not by an M.P&#x201D;. He said that Dr. Verwoerd was the first man to talk of the fragmentation of South Africa. As far as the fragmentation of South Africa is concerned, if the hon. member wants to call it that, we all supported him. The hon. member is very wrong when he said that Dr. Verwoerd was the first man to have said that. May I read out to the hon. member what the late Gen. Hertzog said as far back as 1913&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that hon. member would benefit an infinitely great deal if he read the many speeches which Dr. Hertzog made in the teens and in the twenties. If there ever was a person who, half a century before the time, correctly understood the basic premises of our Bantu policy, as we see it today, it was the late Gen. Hertzog. Gen. Hertzog rendered to this country, in the early years of its existence, infinite and immeasurable services, the first of which was the recognition and the stimulation of the future of the Afrikaner people. The other one was the recognition of a correct policy of separate development. The hon. member would be well advised to look up all those speeches.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Zululand said the Zulus could not understand constitutional development by means of proclamation in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> If ever a nonsensical thing was said it is this. The fact of the matter is that the Bantu of South Africa, including the Zulus, know government by proclamation already for many decades. We especially laid that down in the Act of 1927 and since then there have been many laws by way of proclamation. Furthermore, this very Bill which gives us power to do certain things by way of proclamation they understand and they accept. I am going to read out to the hon. member what was said &#x2026;</p>

<p>All the same, Sir, you should not discourage me from being grateful! In any event, let me explain that in August Mr. Liebenberg and other officials were in Zululand to explain to the Bantu there the basic concepts of this Bill. After that there were other consultations and ultimately they came to see me in Pretoria in November. There Chief Buthelezi told me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We supported the Liebenberg draft in August. We appreciate your efforts to facilitate the process of self-government up the ladder. We also thank you for the guidance you have thus far given us and hope you will still support us in future. We welcome the enabling second part of the intended law with a view to progressing to higher levels of self-government.</block>

<p>This was after I extensively and intensively explained to them how the second part of the law will be drafted, i.e. with power to the State President to regulate constitutional development by means of a proclamation. Afterwards the Bill was circulated to all territorial authorities, including those of the Zulus, and from some of the replies I have received I quoted earlier in my speech. To say that the Zulus are not in favour of constitutional government by means of proclamation is consequently very far-fetched.</p>

<p>*I come now to the hurricane speech, a speech I want to say very little about. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town is sitting there laughing now because he is thinking of himself, while this is something at which he ought to hide his head in shame. The hon. member made an extremely reckless speech here; that is all I can call it&#x2014;a reckless speech. The hon. member must remember that this Council Chamber is not an anthill on his farm on which he can stand and shout and shout &#x201C;Listen here!&#x201D; at anyone he pleases. This is a place where we want responsible statements from people who aspire to occupy important positions in the country. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that those who think that the Blacks can govern the country are out of their minds. But then he and his colleagues on those benches are the first to be out of their minds because it is they, after all, who want to bring the Blacks here into Parliament. [Interjections.] Hon. members opposite do not think what they are saying. In terms of their policy of race federation they want to give the Bantu representation here and in due course the Blacks themselves must come here, as we recall from television talks and from statements made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself. Even if they allege that the Blacks are so irresponsible that they cannot even govern their own areas, they are making an objectionable statement, an extremely objectionable statement. That hon. member, as well as other hon. members on the opposite side&#x2014;unfortunately the hon. member for Mooi River as well&#x2014;must bear in mind that as far as relationships between White and Bantu are concerned, one cannot, as the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town did, sow dragon&#x2019;s teeth. He who sows dragon&#x2019;s teeth, as the hon. member for Mooi River and the hon. member for Orange Grove, as well as the hon. member for Durban North did, must realize that what springs forth axe not nymphs and pixies, but devils and dragons. That is what hon. members did. They must count their words when they are discussing matters such as these, which involve the relationship between the Black peoples and we as Whites. With this way they have of sowing dragon&#x2019;s teeth, they are creating devils and dragons and not nymphs. That is not our function in this Parliament, nor is it the reason for which the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town was elected by mistake.</p>

I had a quick look through our congress papers of the sixties. In any case, I remember everything, because for the last ten years <span class="col_1327-1328" refersTo="page_0677"/>now I have been present at virtually every congress, and I therefore know about the draft resolutions which were discussed there. I have the resolutions in front of me here, but to save time, I am only going to quote extracts. The position is that at the congress in the Cape, as well as in the Transvaal, Natal and South-West Africa, where I had to give a long elucidation of policy two, three years ago, the policy of the National Party was fully ratified on each occasion, and it was even requested that we should speed up the political development as it was manifesting itself in the Transkei. The precise words are recorded here; I have them here, but to save time, I do not want to quote them now. [Interjection.] If the hon. member does not want to believe me then, I can just refer him to the resolution adopted at the Transvaal Congress, viz. (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Congress expresses its gratitude towards the Government for the positive steps which it has taken in respect of the Transkei.</block>

<p>This resolution was adopted in 1962, that is, after the Transkeian legislation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>During the general elections of 1970, 1966 and 1961 I made numerous speeches of this nature. I can still show the hon. member notes of speeches which I made at places such as Ixopo and Melmoth in Natal, of all places, where I set out the policy in full, right up to the independence of these areas. The hon. member need not think that we are hiding it away.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Maitland said that we were interfering with the territory of South Africa, and that these were matters over which peoples had already waged world wars. No, Sir, we are not interfering; we are doing everything quite openly, as I put it when I was dealing with the Citizenship Act at the beginning of 1970, when I said that what our policy amounted to was that we were establishing nations and forming countries for them. I made it clear and we are doing this everywhere; nothing has been hidden away, and we will not have a world war starting in South Africa because of that; not even a local war.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District had a lot of argumentative things to say here. He who scarcely knows what the Tswanas look like, comes along and tells me that the Tswanas had asked for independence. He had recourse to a newspaper report which he had found. The Tswanas requested development leading to the form of self-government the Transkei had, and here I have their resolution in my hand. To save time I will not quote it, but it is very clear that they asked to ascend to a higher form of self-government than that they have at present. The hon. member reads things in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> and other rags like it, and then he presents it here as the authoritative version of the resolutions. Mr. Speaker, this is also confirmed in the interviews I had with them, and the notes relating to those interviews I also have here with me, where Chief Lukas Momope said: &#x201C;We are coming to you to ask for a more extensive form of self-government.&#x201D; Now the hon. member claims that they asked for independence. They will ask for that in their <span class="col_1329-1330" refersTo="page_0678"/>own time, if they want to ask for it, but that is not what they have asked for now.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Kensington. I have already dealt with his only important point, in regard to which he indulged in much hairsplitting here. It is that we, as he said, now want to establish Black states without a resolution of Parliament. I actually dealt with this matter when I said that all of it is before this Parliament today.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member for Kensington said that an indigenous national feeling among the Bantu peoples would result in enmity and a lack of loyalty towards the Republic. No, Sir, just the opposite. What will in fact elicit enmity and opposition from the Bantu peoples, is when that party wants to keep them in subordination for ever, with a small minority representation in this Parliament. That is what will generate hostility, resentment and opposition among them. After all, not all independent states in the world are inimical towards one another. According to the standpoint of the hon. member for Kensington all independent states in the world must be inimical towards one another, which is surely not the case. No, the suppression of the indigenous national feeling among the Bantu peoples is more likely to alienate them from us and make them hostile towards us.</p>

<p>But talk such as this, particularly that which came from him and from other hon. members who are continually referring to Chinese alliances and dangerous Blacks who will cause a second Congo here, etc., is conditioning the Natives into hostility towards us as Whites, which is a very wrong thing for the hon. members opposite to do. I know they want to bring about the downfall of this Government party. That is their legitimate goal which they may set themselves; it is something which they may strive to attain, but then they may not unleash those irresponsible and reckless tirades against South Africa and against the good relationships between Blacks and Whites, such as those we heard here. They are not benefiting their party by doing so but are harming South Africa and our White/non-White relationships.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington told me here across the floor of the House that there were far more non-Tswanas than there were Tswanas at Ga Rankuwa, and he expected me to reply to that by shaking my head. Sir, I am not one to shake my head; he may be one, but the true facts about Ga Rankuwa are a far remove from the allegations made here by the hon. member. But we have known him for many years in the field of journalism. I personally have times without number obtained proof to the effect that there is only one man here who can carry on with greater abandon with statistics than the hon. member for Yeoville, and that is the hon. member for Kensington. The fact of the matter is that there are more than twice the number of Tswanas in Ga Rankuwa than there are non-Tswanas.</p>

<p>Just look at them scuttling away now. Sir, he said in the first place that there were far fewer Tswanas than there were non-Tswanas. Then when I tell him that this is an untruthful statement, they scuttle away to another topic. Sir, the non-Tswanas in Ga Rankuwa are all being accommodated elsewhere on an exchange basis, with the co-operation of the Tswana Government. We are giving this matter entirely satisfactory attention, and the hon. member need not concern himself about it. But I know he does not feel any concern about it; he is revelling in it.</p>

<p>Reply to my speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have replied to it. I now coma to the hon member for Mooi River, who has informed me that he would be unable to be present here today. The hon. member for Mooi River recounted to me here the Biblical episode of Solomon and the cutting in two of the child, and he said the United Party was like the mother who refused to have the child cut in two. Sir, in doing so the hon member unthinkingly said something which is tremendously detrimental to them something we have been struggling for a long time to get from them by way of a public admission; for when he referred to that, he also referred to the division between the Black peoples and the Whites in the political sphere in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_1331-1332" refersTo="page_0679"/>In other words, when he professes that the United Party is like the mother who opposed the division of the child, a poor image which is no way relevant here, he implies that the United Party refuses to make a division between Whites and Bantu and they therefore see Whites and Bantu as one organic whole, as that mother regarded the child to be one organic whole. [Interjections.] Yes, the hon. member for Mooi River has read the Book, but he read in the wrong place and he did not read enough. The hon. member said: &#x201C;An independent or self-governing area is a dead end.&#x201D; I maintain that these and many other words he spoke are insulting and disgraceful words, because what we are presenting to the Bantu in this Bill, is very clearly not a dead end. In fact, that is precisely what hon. members on the opposite side are objecting to, because we are saying that this Bill may be regarded as a step in the process of development which can culminate in independence which is a possibility.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member tells us that this is a dead end. It is not a dead end, and to state it thus is a false desire of the hon. member. Like the hon. member for Durban North, he also spoke about the rootless and rightless people. We now know all those clich&#x00E9;s of theirs, such as the rootless, rightless people of whom they are always talking. All of them say this. These are words they distribute among one another. It is common property to be used whenever it suits them. The hon. member for Mooi River went so far back as to hold up the example of Sparta as a small country which did not make the grade. It is not necessary for him to go back and use Sparta as an example of a small country. He can look around at the present time and use Lesotho as an example, or Botswana, Swaziland, Malawi, Gaboon, Madagascar, Mauritius, Luxemeburg, or Belgium. There are many countries in the world that in size or in population are smaller than our Bantu homelands which must be helped to develop. In what way have they failed&#x003F; A small country like Belgium, which is a smaller country than these Africa states, has a seat in U.N.O. while a country like Russia, which comprises one-sixth of the surface area of the earth, also has a seat there and these two countries have equal rights there. How can the hon. member suggest that countries must all be of an equal size or must have an equally numerous population&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central mentioned a few points which I want to go into a little more closely. I have already dealt with certain of his points, such as those in respect of the sovereignty and of the so-called circumvention of Parliament, to which he referred. He also said that our policy that separate Bantu areas may become independent states, is not conducive to a sound labour policy. In regard to labour I want to ask where we have pursued our policy to its clearest and furthest extent&#x003F; We did so with the independent country of Malawi, in respect of the labour agreement. We concluded an agreement with the independent country of Malawi to the effect that their people come to work in South Africa, and the agreement is working extremely well. Why then should a labour agreement with an independent country who went through the development with us, not also be able to work well if it were to be applied to a Transkei, a Vendaland or a Tswanaland&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can never discuss principles as an hon. friend of mine, the hon. member for Germiston, expects him to. He must not expect it of him. They do not do any synthetic thinking, only analytic thinking. They cannot see a plan in its process of development. They are always busy with a minor little component as if it were the main issue. The same applies now to the hon. member for Pinelands.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North waxed very eloquent here about Kwa Mashu and Umlazi in particular. The hon. member did the same in regard to Umlazi as the hon. member for Houghton did in regard to the approval of the Minister to which I referred a moment ago. He referred to Umlazi as &#x201C;State land&#x201D;. Surely the hon. member knows that it was not State land. It was not State-owned land in the ordinary sense such as land which belongs to the Minister of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is State-owned land.

<p>I asked the other day by way of interjection, and I want to ask it again clearly now, what is wrong with having a Black country and a White country here in Southern Africa with large towns and cities which are situated close to one another on either side of the border&#x003F; What is so strange about that&#x003F; It is the case throughout the entire world.</p>

<p>No, Berlin is not the same. Berlin is the handiwork of that hon. member and his henchmen. It is a creation of the victor. Umlazi is also a quite different matter.

Where is Maseru and where is Ladybrand situated&#x003F; They lie cheek by jowl. This has always been the case. Are Fouriesburg and Ficksburg not situated <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> Lesotho&#x003F; Where is Mafeking located in comparison with Botswana&#x003F; We already have this everywhere in South Africa on a smaller scale. But, as I said the other day in my interjections to the hon. member, go to Europe and see what things look like there where France and Germany adjoin. The cities glare at each other across the borders. This has been the case for years and for centuries. It need not always lead to enmity. That will depend on the spirit of the people and of the governments in those same cities and areas which adjoin one another.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to section 3 of the Transkei Constitution Act in a context which does not hold water. Section 3 of the Constitution Act of the Transkei relates to the addition of White land to the Transkei. The consultation in regard to the addition of such land which must be finalized in this Parliament by means of a resolution, has nothing to do with the comparable proclamation we are discussing here in terms of which new Bantu governments will be established. The comparison he draws with section 3 of the Transkei Constitution Act is quite irrelevant therefore, even if he is called a juridical expert in South Africa by his own colleagues.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Orange Grove is the other hon. member who carried on to such a tremendous extent here and who spoke about the Communist Embassy in Umtata.

A statement such as that conditions people to do harmful things. We want to condition people to do good things. The hon. member and his other colleagues ought not to make such statements here.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether Parliament would be consulted if the Transkei or any other Bantu area should also want to become independent. But surely there is no legislation before this Parliament in terms of which any of these Bantu areas will be <span class="col_1335-1336" refersTo="page_0681"/>made independent. The hon. member should know very well that to make any Bantu area independent, this Parliament will have to be approached. Surely that is very clear. Surely what is at issue in this legislation is not the attaining of independence. When the hon. member for Orange Grove spoke about independence, he was actually talking about a subsequent piece of legislation which will have to be brought before this Parliament. He was not talking about the Bill which is now under discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In this Bill a total amount of R3,999,450 is requested, of which R3,482,000 is needed for additional operating expenditure and the remaining R517,450 for additional capital expenditure.</p>

<p>Particulars of the additional appropriations required under the various heads of the estimates appear in the Estimates of Additional Expenditure that have been laid upon the Table. The additional funds are necessary to provide mainly for salary improvements introduced on the 1st January this year and the Department&#x2019;s resultant higher pension liability, higher maintenance costs and other additional expenses that have to be met during the present financial year.</p>

<p><span class="col_1337-1338" refersTo="page_0682"/>I should like to explain that approval for the new building work, for which a nominal amount of R50 is requested, is necessary at this time to obviate delay in calling tenders. The position with regard to the additional amount of R400,000 under the sub-head &#x201C;Purchase of Land&#x201D;, is that the Department&#x2019;s planning requires that transfer of the sites for which it is intended should be taken as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It does not appear necessary that I go into further details at this stage. I can assure the House that it is necessary in the public interest that the expenditure for which the additional appropriations are requested, should be incurred during the present financial year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as is customary, this side of the House have no intention of conducting a lengthy debate on the Second Reading of this Additional Appropriation Bill. In his speech the hon. the Minister, and I want to thank him for the courtesy of supplying me with a copy of it beforehand, indicated certain particular items and explained why these items were in the schedule. I believe that these items can better be discussed during the Committee Stage when the schedules are put. If I therefore do not reply to the hon. the Minister on the particular issues that he mentioned in his speech, he will understand that the occasion to do so will arise very soon.</p>

<p>I would have appreciated it, however, if the hon. the Minister could have given us a general picture of why he wanted these additional amounts at this present moment. According to the latest published financial statements of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 12th February, the income for the first nine months of the current book year at the moment exceeds the expenditure, in the Post Office, by almost R20 million. We know that the Minister has the usual right of transferring savings on one sub-head to another sub-head, and in the light of this one would have thought that it would not be necessary for the Minister to ask Parliament for such a substantial additional amount. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can give us some idea of the general financial position and tell us why, in view of the profit of R20 million the Post Office already shows for the first nine months, it is necessary to ask for such a large additional amount.</p>

Secondly, I would have liked more details in connection with the item &#x201C;Miscellaneous Expenses&#x201D;. I would be glad if the hon. the Minister would explain why an additional amount is now being requested for this. As the hon. the Minister knows, there is a total of 31 items under the head &#x201C;Miscellaneous Expenses&#x201D;. I am sure he will be able to tell us which of these 31 items are covered by this additional amount of R64,500.</p>

<p>In this particular schedule there is only one other matter on which I should like some additional information, i.e. why there is an increase of R160,000 in respect of our contribution towards the development of communication satellite systems. After having received a reply from the hon. the Minister, I may have further questions to put to him.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I gladly accede to the hon. member&#x2019;s request that I should furnish particulars in regard to this additional expenditure. As far as the extra expenditure under sub-head A is concerned, <span class="col_1339-1340" refersTo="page_0683"/>it is related to the total increase of R4,259,000. That amount will be met partially from a saving of R2,484,900 on other sub-heads, and the remaining R1,774,300 has to be voted. The increase is mainly due to the improved salary structure which came into operation on 1st January.</p>

<p>Concerning the next question, in regard to sub-head E&#x2014;&#x201C;Miscellaneous Expenses&#x201D; &#x2014;I should like to give the following details: Additional provision is required mainly in respect of losses arising from pending third party claims which still have to be paid, levies and registration fees in respect of Bantu employees, and increased contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund as a result of more persons having been taken into service and the improved salary structure, respectively.</p>

<p>Lastly, the hon. member wanted more information in connection with sub-head S&#x2014;&#x201C;Contribution towards the Development of Communication Satellite Systems&#x201D;. The details in this respect are as follows: The increase in the contribution is due to the fact that since August, 1969, when the original estimate of South Africa&#x2019;s contribution for 1970-71 was prepared by the Interim Committee of the International Telecommunication Satellite Consortium, the international body has decided, because of programme adjustments, to incur considerably higher expenditure than had previously been envisaged for the period April, 1970, to March, 1971. The contribution made by South Africa is, 0.269462 per cent of the total contribution of all countries which are signatories to the agreement to share in the world-wide communication satellite system. The contributions to be paid by member countries are calculated by the Interim Committee and controlled by a special financial committee of member countries.</p>

<p>I trust that these particulars will satisfy the hon. member.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am satisfied as far as the Minister&#x2019;s explanation of sub-head A is concerned, i.e. about salaries, wages and allowances. We are naturally happy that there has been this increase. I am sure that further aspects of this matter will be further discussed during the Budget Debate. Perhaps the hon. Minister can give us an indication of the amount these adjustments amount to during a full year.</p>

<p>Regarding miscellaneous expenses, there are 31 items and he did not deal with all of them. As far as items 17 and 24 of sub-head E are concerned, the original estimates are being increased but as the hon. Minister has indicated, for this there are sound reasons. I am, however, a bit more doubtful about the increase of R160,000 being requested for Comsat. While expressing doubts I want to make it quite clear that we agree 100 per cent to the underlying principle of Comsat. All I am concerned with at the moment is what we are going to get for this R160,000. The Minister mentioned certain things. He said that in August, 1969, it was decided&#x2014;I take it by the board of Comsat&#x2014;that the contributions of the different countries should be increased. He mentioned, <i>inter alia,</i> programme changes which have made this additional amount necessary. I am satisfied with the general principle that where more is demanded of all members of Comsat South Africa too should make the additional contribution. However, the Minister owes this House an explanation about the part South Africa is playing in these program adjustments for which an additional R160,000 is now being asked. After all, we have two international communication satellite systems, Intelsat III, at the moment&#x2014;22,000 miles above the Atlantic Ocean and above the Indian Ocean. Channels have been allocated to our country, channels that we can use today and in future when television comes. We are paying for these and, what is more, we are now being asked to pay an additional amount of R160,000. There are more than 60 earth stations already and more than 50 countries making use of this system. But we are not yet doing it. That is why I feel dubious about this request for an additional R160,000 of the taxpayers&#x2019; money while the money is not being used. I want a clear indication from the hon. the Minister exactly what we are going to get for this additional R160,000 from the magnificent opportunities being offered by this fantastic satellite system, a system we have been ignoring all over the years.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to stress the aspect raised by the hon. member who has just sat down. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to tell us whether this is part of the agreement of leasing entered into with the various countries for the use of these particular satellites. There is no doubt that this form of communication is <span class="col_1341-1342" refersTo="page_0684"/>something to which a young country like South Africa can well lend itself, particularly because we have the excellent opportunities of a satellite on either side of the country&#x2019;s borders&#x2014;one over the Indian Ocean and one over the Atlantic Ocean. I do think that we should get a little more detail of the uses to which we have put it. Perhaps we should also know whether this expenditure is purely part of our expenditure under a leasing agreement and that we need not necessarily use it. It would be a great pity. But if we do use it, then perhaps we should get some information from the hon. the Minister so that we can know what is taking place with regard to the future development of our world communications.</p>

Perhaps it would not be advisable for us to wait until we need it someday, because then they might tell us that there is no room left for us.

<p>I just want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to two items. The first is the item concerning the purchase of land. I should like to know what the purpose of this item is. The second item refers to buildings. Under &#x201C;Buildings&#x201D; I find that a particular building is described as a new training school (local) for Post Office technicians. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether that is to serve Pretoria alone or whether it is to be a training school for the rest of the Republic; whether it has in fact been built; when it will become operative, if it is being built, and whether it will be for the training of Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Natives or for the training of White technicians alone&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>In respect of subhead (3) the particulars are as follows: The additional provision is intended for sites which become available and of which the department must take transfer as soon as possible, as the acquisition of suitable sites is a prerequisite for proper planning.</p>

<p>In respect of the item &#x201C;Buildings&#x201D; the particulars are as follows: The gross saving on this subhead amounts to R1,074,000, which is reduced by an amount of R50 in respect of the new service which is required to be voted. The saving will meet excesses on other subheads. The saving arises from the shortage of labour and material in the building industry delaying the execution of services. The increase in building costs has been taken into account. The voting of a <span class="col_1343-1344" refersTo="page_0685"/>nominal amount of R50 for the new building work is required in order to avoid delays in planning. As far as the purpose of the training centre is concerned it is mainly to meet the needs of the Transvaal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not quite satisfied with the reply the hon. the Minister gave in regard to this additional amount of R50 being asked for buildings. In his second-reading speech&#x2014;and he repeated it now&#x2014;he stated that a nominal amount of R50 is requested, if necessary, to obviate delay in calling for tenders. Now I realize that one wants to obviate delay in calling for tenders as much as possible, but you will recollect, Sir, that in all main and additional expenditures where a nominal amount is asked for of R50, which is the customary amount, it is stated for which particular building it is asked. Even if plans are made for buildings two or more years ahead, a nominal amount of R50 appears on the Estimates, additional or main, but there is an indication of what building it is for. Here we are being asked to vote a nominal amount which can expand into millions of rands in future, and we would like to have some indication from the Minister as to what buildings are being planned for which this nominal amount is being asked.</p>

<p>In regard to the new training school for Post Office technicians, that is a new amount. This side of the House naturally has no objection to further training facilities being provided for post office technicians; in fact, we welcome it. We think this is a belated amount which should have been voted a long time ago. As my hon. friend said, it is long overdue. Could the hon. the Minister indicate whether at this particular training school there will be facilities not only for the training of Whites but also of non-Whites, whether Bantu, Indian or Coloured&#x003F; I believe there are plans in the Post Office for a limited form of training to be given to people who assist technicians in the Post Office, and perhaps the Minister could indicate to what extent this will tie in with the whole system of the training of technicians. Will this college also be used to train and to orient technicians brought from abroad to work in the Post Office in order to teach them more about our methods and systems&#x003F;</p>

<p>As telephone mechanics. This is actually work which falls in a category between the labourer and the technician, and it comprises the installation of telephones in homes as well as the joining of cables leading to the homes. This is quite a big task and it requires a good deal of labour. The Coloureds will be trained for these purposes at the place I referred to. The Indians, on the other hand, will be trained in Durban. As far as the Bantu homelands are concerned, approval has also been granted to start training Bantu to do similar work there for their own people.

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in regard to this clause, namely the definition clause, I have one difficulty in respect of which I would like some clarity from the hon. the Minister. I refer to the definition of &#x201C;child&#x201D; in paragraph (v). This definition is something quite new in pension legislation dealing with the question of pension rights. In view of the definition of &#x201C;dependant&#x201D; in paragraph (viii) which defines &#x201C;dependant&#x201D; as meaning the widow or child of a deceased member of the pension fund or of the superannuation fund, it is important that we get further clarity in regard to this definition.</p>

<p>The definition of &#x201C;child&#x201D; in paragraph (v) refers to a child born out of a customary union of the member of the pension or superannuation fund or out of a marriage &#x2014;the normal type of marriage&#x2014;whether or not such customary union or marriage subsisted on the day of such member&#x2019;s death. We have raised this question during the Second Reading with a view to obtaining further clarity in the case of a child of a deceased member of the pension or superannuation fund, i.e. its standing to claim as a dependant in terms of this section.</p>

<p>The clause clearly states that there is a proviso that the child in such circumstances must also meet certain requirements. One of these requirements is that the child has not contracted a marriage or is not a partner in any customary union. The child must not have attained the age of 18 years and must not be self-supporting. Sub-paragraph (d) mentions too that this child must be one designated by the Secretary as a child for the purposes of this Act. I would like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister the reasons why it is necessary to have a stipulation that a child must also be designated by the Secretary as a child for the purposes of this Act. It would appear that this is an added proviso which is somewhat different from that embodied in other legislation of a similar type. Here, of course, we realize that we are dealing with a type of pension and superannuation fund, which is specifically for the employees of Bantu authorities. Here the question arises of extending the dependant&#x2019;s right to claim as a dependant in terms of this definition, where the child is over the age of 18 years and, as often happens as far as Bantu are concerned, is still attending a school in a full-time capacity and is therefore not self-supporting. The hon. the Minister did indicate during the Second-Reading debate that it was possible, that in terms of regulations there might be a means of seeing that that particular child would still be able to claim as a dependent of a deceased member. However, it would appear that it is clearly stated in paragraph (b) that a child must not have attained the age of 18 years. I would therefore be grateful if the hon. the Deputy Minister could give further clarity with regard to that definition.</p>

<p>Whilst dealing with this clause, I would also appreciate further clarification from the Deputy Minister as far as the definition of a widow is concerned on page 8 of the <span class="col_1347-1348" refersTo="page_0687"/>Bill, clause 1 (xxviii), where a widow is defined as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The surviving woman who was associated with a deceased member of the pension fund or of the superannuation fund in a marriage (as defined in the Bantu Administration Act of 1927) subsisting at such member&#x2019;s death; or</block>

<block name="quote">The surviving female partner (as so defined) of every customary union (as so defined) between her and such member, subsisting at his death.</block>

<p>Here we realize that there is a difficulty in the definition of a widow, as far as the widow is concerned, where a member might in terms of Bantu custom have more than one wife and consequently several widows, as to whether these persons who were dependent on the member, would be fully covered in terms of the definition of a widow as we have it before us in this Bill. We realize that this could entail a great deal of difficulty in defining a surviving female partner, as put forward in the clause that is now before us, to see whether persons married in terms of their customs would be covered by this definition and qualify as widows on the death of a member of the pension fund or of the superannuation fund.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I should very much like to reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s questions. I think that it would be best to begin by explaining to the hon. member that the necessary provision for these specific cases will be made by way of regulation in terms of clause 5 of this Bill. I want to say to the hon. member at once that we intend to use the same provisions as apply in the case of the Public Service Pension Act as a basis for the promulgation of regulation powers here. In respect of dependants, the Public Service Pension regulation reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dependant in relation to any person:</block>

<block name="quote">(a) the widow or a minor child, or stepchild, or a legally adopted minor child of such person &#x2026;</block>

<p>In particular I want to draw attention to the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(b) any other relative or person,</block>

<p>In other words, &#x201C;any other relative or person&#x201D; who is dependent upon such a person for maintenance. By way of the same paragraphs (a) and (b) we will make provision for individual cases as well by means of a regulation in terms of this Bill. Having said this, and having now laid the foundation in terms of which this will be done, I can reply to the questions of the hon. member for Umbilo very easily.</p>

<p>In respect of the definition of a child which is given in clause 1 (1) (v), I want to point out that this, since reference is, <i>inter alia,</i> made in paragraph (b) to a child which &#x201C;has not attained the age of 18 years&#x201D;, and (c) &#x201C;is not self-supporting&#x201D;, refers to the special benefits for such a child. In the regulations provision will now be made for beneficiaries. I am using the word &#x201C;beneficiaries&#x201D; in a qualified sense. I am not using the word &#x201C;dependants&#x201D;. Nor am I using the word &#x201C;child&#x201D;. I am talking about beneficiaries. Since this Bill therefore refers to the special benefits and the regulations make provision for the beneficiaries, it will therefore be possible to make provision for a child over the age of 18 years who may for example be studying. I made very certain that this is correct, because the hon. member asked during the Second Reading already whether it would be possible in terms of this Bill to make the necessary provision in the case, for example, of a beneficiary who is in fact a child who is studying, but who is 20 years old and who actually, in terms of all interests in such a pension matter, ought really to qualify if the person who was supporting him were to die. The Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, as well as the legal advisers, gave me the assurance that this is in fact the case because, so they say, this definition of a child does refer to special benefits, but in the regulation powers, which are stated very widely, there is in fact the necessary authorization to regard such a person over the age of 18 years as a beneficiary and that the necessary provision can therefore be made in the Bill for that type of case. That, then, is my reply in respect of the hon. member&#x2019;s first question.</p>

<p>In respect of the second question put by the hon. member, I want to point out that in terms of the customary Bantu union, the hon. member must bear in mind that it is very possible, and does in fact often happen that in a customary union one man has four, five or six wives. Now we are, as I said during the Second Reading debate, <span class="col_1349-1350" refersTo="page_0688"/>obliged to strike the necessary balance somewhere. If for example such a Bantu has five wives and has four children from each, we cannot make the necessary provision for all 20 children. How can this be done now&#x003F; It can only be done by means of the provision which is being made in subclause (v) (d), namely &#x201C;&#x2026; has been designated by the Secretary as a child for the purposes of this Act&#x201D;. The Secretary will then have to use his discretion in terms of Bantu law in regard to which there are already various court decisions, in order to determine which children of those four, five or six wives will be designated as being children for the purposes of this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>That will be difficult.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That will be very difficult. I readily concede that point. But the hon. member must now bear in mind that we are not dealing with Whites where it is much easier to draw the necessary lines, but that we are dealing here with Bantu. We must, as I have already said, try to strike the necessary balance. I can give him the assurance that, while it seems difficult on the surface, it is in practice not really as difficult as all that, because there is much method in the way in which Bantu law is being applied among the Bantu themselves. Therefore we think that it will not be impossible to do this. However, I concede, at the same time, that it will not be too easy.</p>

<p>The same explanation applies to the third question put by the hon. member. This deals with a widow and the definition of &#x201C;widow&#x201D; as it appears in clause 1 (xxviii). There the position is precisely the same. In terms of a customary union it may happen that a man has four, five or six wives. In terms of Bantu law and custom it will then be determined which one of those four, five or six has a legitimate claim. In case all five or six have a legitimate claim in terms of Bantu law, it will have to be dealt with as such. This is also a case which will be difficult to deal with, but we can do nothing but make specific provision for this by way of this Bill. The question to which I have now replied is the last question put by the hon. member in regard to clause 1, and I shall therefore let this suffice.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have no objection to the amendment which has been moved by the hon. the Deputy Minister. Indeed, we welcome the amendment in view of the fact that it does clarify to a great extent one of the difficulties we have experienced prior to this amendment. It concerns those persons who are in the employment of a body or authority which is taken over by the Bantu authorities and who then have to become members of either the pension fund or the superannuation fund by compulsion.</p>

<p>However, there is one further aspect in regard to this clause to which the hon. the Deputy Minister could give further attention. If you look at subsection (7) of this clause you will realize that those who are, for example, in the employment of a municipality or another local authority and who are already existing members of a pension fund or a superannuation fund will by necessity be compelled to become members of the new authorities&#x2019; pension fund and the new authorities&#x2019; superannuation fund, depending on whether they are in permanent employment or not in permanent <span class="col_1351-1352" refersTo="page_0689"/>employment when they are taken over by a Bantu authority. Therefore, it is important to see that these people who do not have the right to elect to remain a member of the existing superannuation or pension fund, should be fully protected. The hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s amendment does meet this to a certain extent, seeing that it intends to protect those rights by clearly saying that the benefits shall not be less favourable than those benefits they would have enjoyed had they remained members of the previous fund to which they had belonged. However, in terms of subsection (8) there is one word which I think requires greater clarification. This reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where a class or category of persons who, while in the service of the Government, or in service with an authority prior to the fixed date, performed work of such a kind as to become members of any other pension fund or a provident fund of which the benefits are substantially more favourable than the benefits payable in terms of the regulations in corresponding circumstances out of the pension fund &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here the word &#x201C;substantially&#x201D; is the one which requires some clarification. It depends on the interpretation of this word whether the benefits which they were enjoying in terms of the previous pension fund or superannuation fund to which they had belonged are &#x201C;substantially more favourable&#x201D; or whether they are just &#x201C;more favourable&#x201D;. The question who will define the words &#x201C;substantially more favourable&#x201D;, is very important. In subsection (8) it is stated that the Minister may direct that special benefits, subject to the regulations, may be paid to such persons. This is now of course going to be amended by the amendment of the hon. the Deputy Minister, namely that benefits must not be less favourable than if the persons concerned had remained members of the previous fund. However, it is at the discretion of the hon. the Minister to direct whether benefits may be paid. The thing that concerns me is whether the conditions and benefits are going to be substantially more favourable or merely more favourable. I would suggest that to give greater clarity to this section the hon. the Deputy Minister could perhaps consider the deletion of the word &#x201C;substantially&#x201D; so that the subsection would read &#x201C;of which the benefits are more favourable than the benefits payable in terms of the regulations in corresponding circumstances out of the pension fund&#x201D; of which they are compelled to become members in terms of this clause. I would be grateful if the hon. the Deputy Minister could give consideration to that point.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before replying to the hon. member in regard to the use of the word &#x201C;substantially&#x201D;, I should like briefly to sketch the background as to why a Bantu cannot be allowed a choice here to remain a member of the one fund if he transfers to the other fund. The hon. member must bear in mind that we are dealing here with Bantu from all over the Republic and with a great variety of Bantu who are now going to become members of this pension fund and superannuation fund. My Department, as well as the Department of Social Welfare, decided after a very thorough discussion, that since this pension fund and superannuation fund will in the near future, so we hope, be transferred to the territorial authorities, it was going to create great confusion among those territorial authorities if we allowed a Bantu at this stage to choose whether he wants to remain with his old fund or whether to transfer to this new pension fund or superannuation fund. The first reason is therefore that we are afraid to create confusion, and for that reason we were therefore unable to allow a choice. At this stage the administration involved will also be very difficult We are dealing here with Bantu from all over the Republic and if a choice is allowed, it will make the administrative work very difficult. The second reason is that we are aware that some of the funds to which Bantu today belong, are poor funds. For that reason, too, it was very difficult for the department which I have already mentioned to allow a choice. The third reason is perhaps the most important. It is desirable that a strong pension fund be built up as quickly as possible. This it will be difficult for us to do if we allow the members a choice to remain with any fund of which they were formerly members. The hon. member must bear in mind that we are dealing here with Bantu, many of whom are not so well conversant with these matters. If the pension fund and superannuation fund therefore offers considerably better advantages, some Bantu will purely out of ignorance remain with <span class="col_1353-1354" refersTo="page_0690"/>their old funds. As the hon. member knows, there are other factors as well which are involved here. Personally I would have liked to have seen, and I also initially thought, that they should be allowed a choice as we will do in other Bills of this nature. The officials of the two departments had to go to much trouble to convince me that it was better not to allow a choice.</p>

<p>The question as to whether the word &#x201C;substantially&#x201D; should be inserted, was also something which was argued about at length. We were told that if only the words &#x201C;more favourable&#x201D; were inserted, the problem would be one of knowing where to draw the line. The officials of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions then pointed out that this fund would then be reduced to one working with cents. The word &#x201C;substantially&#x201D; has therefore been inserted in order to prevent the possibility of working with only a small difference of one cent or so. I want to tell the hon. member that I am very sympathetic towards him in regard to this matter. I think, however, that we should leave the Bill as it is, and allow that word to stand. I want to give him the undertaking that with the application of this matter we will take particular note of this&#x2014;and it is really the spirit of this Bill&#x2014;that a person should not be worse off when he transfers from the other fund to the pension fund. &#x201C;Substantially&#x201D; will therefore have to be interpreted as the hon. member has suggested, and I agree that we should apply this clause very carefully and reasonably. I hope the hon. member is satisfied with this explanation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Before the commencement of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1966, loans were granted to owners of land by the Minister of Water Affairs for the construction of a water work in terms of the provisions of the Water Act, 1956. Consequently such loans were subject to the prevailing State interest rates as determined by the Minister of Finance from time to time in terms of the Financial Adjustments Act, 1917. Chapter 9 of the Water Act makes additional provision for the granting of a subsidy in respect of the costs of a water work, and where the costs do not exceed R60,000 the subsidy is limited to R3,000, or a third of the costs of the works, whichever is the lesser amount.</p>

<p>The introduction of uniform measures for the granting of credit by the Agricultural Credit Board in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act has resulted in loans for the construction of water works also being granted in terms of the latter Act. The chief object of this Act is the introduction of measures for the granting of assistance, on a uniform basis, to farmers who are dependent upon the State for their credit needs, and provision is also made in it for a uniform, subsidized interest <span class="col_1355-1356" refersTo="page_0691"/>rate of 5 per cent (for South-West Africa it is 4 per cent), the compulsory consolidation of all departmentally recoverable farming debts and the benefits of free registration of mortgages and exemption from stamp duties in respect of all security documents, as well as exemption from transfer duties where agricultural land is purchased with the aid of assistance.</p>

<p>The introduction of those uniform measures was, however, not meant to take over the financing functions of other credit bodies or to compete with them, and on the basis of a principle it is determined what category of farmers can come into consideration for assistance in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act. With due regard for the aforementioned benefits involved in the granting of assistance, use is made of the so-called means test in the selection of applicants. The means test does not apply, however, to instances where assistance is granted in the interests of the nation, for example in the granting of loans for the preservation of livestock, the provision of water, conservation of the soil and the erection of dwellings for non-White farm labourers.</p>

<p>The fact that a loan for any amount can be granted to a person in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act for the construction of a water work on the recommendation of the Minister of Water Affairs, and that sometimes this is a considerable amount, entails that such a person not only receives a subsidy, as provided in the Water Act, but also the benefits of the subsidized interest rate of 5 per cent, which means that on any amount of the loan owing from time to time he also saves a considerable amount in respect of interest. The prevailing State interest rate is 8 per cent.</p>

<p>As I have explained, the subsidized interest rate of 5 per cent is indeed a special concession to the farmers less endowed with capital. It was therefore not the intention that it should apply without restriction to all loans for the construction of a water works, works that are already subsidized and in the normal course of events are of immediate benefit to the farmer, unlike soil conservation works. Measures for granting loans from State funds for the construction of water works, as embodied throughout the years in the Water Act and now incorporated in the Agricultural Credit Act, are indeed necessary, but there must be certain restrictions on the payment of interest on such loans. Clause 3 of the Bill now before you therefore proposes an amendment of section 15 of the Principal Act to provide that if such a loan exceeds a certain amount, as determined by the Minister after consultation with the Agricultural Credit Board, and the board states it as a condition in the granting of such a loan, the amount owing from time to time in that respect will be subject to the prevailing State interest rate. In the granting of a loan that exceeds the specific amount, the board will therefore be able to subject an owner of land, who is not normally dependent upon the State for financial assistance, to the condition that the loan will be subject to the prevailing State interest rate.</p>

<p>Statistics indicate that in the past very few individual loans greater than R20,000 were granted for the construction of water works. In respect of 117 loans granted during 1963 to 1967, 94 were for amounts of up to R5,000, 13 for amounts between R5,000 and R10,000, five for amounts between R10,000 and R20,000 and five for amounts greater than R20,000. From 1967 to 1970, 898 separate loans were granted. 778 of these were for amounts of up to R5,000, 88 for amounts between R5,000 and R10,000, 29 for amounts between R10,000 and R20,000 and three for amounts greater than R20,000. One can therefore foresee that only a few loans will be subject to prevailing State interest rates in terms of the suggested provision.</p>

<p>The amendment proposed in clause 4 has to do with the settlement of cases under the Land Settlement Act, 1956. Section 60 (1) of that Act provides that the Minister of Agriculture may cancel a land settlement lease if a lessee has not complied with certain conditions or has been guilty of certain contraventions. Section 60 (2), on the other hand, provides that the Minister shall forthwith have to cancel any lease if the lessee concerned has failed to pay all amounts due by him by way of rent interest and installments of purchase price on his holding in respect of four consecutive years.</p>

<p>Although the Land Settlement Act was repealed by section 51 of the Agricultural Credit Act, which came into force on 1st October, 1966, the provisions remain in force for the settlement of leases contracted under that Act before it was repealed. At present the department has a number of cases in which a lessee has already failed to pay all the rent, payable in terms of the <span class="col_1357-1358" refersTo="page_0692"/>Land Settlement Act, for four or more consecutive years, or where the lessee has paid the rent and exercises the right to purchase, but subsequently for four or more consecutive years, has failed to pay the interest and installments of the purchase price and requests&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) in terms of section 35 of the Land Settlement Act to be exempted from residence and/or occupation and/or to exercise an occupation having no relation to his farming or his holding; or</li>

<li>(ii) in terms of section 47 of the Land Settlement Act, to sub-let his holding or cede his interest in the lease; or</li>

<li>(iii) assistance by way of a loan in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act in order to pay the outstanding rent or interest and installments of the purchase price in respect of his holding; or</li>

<li>(iv) assistance in terms of section 11 (b) of the Agricultural Credit Act, i.e. for the consolidation of amounts recoverable in terms of the Land Settlement Act and other Acts repealed by section 51 of the Agricultural Credit Act.</li>

</ol>

<p>As has been explained, the power of the Minister to cancel a lease under the circumstances referred to in section 60 (1) of the Land Settlement Act is permissive, and indulgence may be granted in respect of transactions permitted in terms of the Act. However, the question has cropped up whether the provisions of section 60 (2) are mandatory, i.e. whether the Minister is compelled to cancel the lease forthwith as soon as a lessee has failed for four consecutive years to pay all amounts due by him by way of rent, or by way of interest and installments of the purchase price of the holding. This would mean that under the circumstances referred to the Minister would no longer be empowered to make any concession with respect to exemption for residence or occupation, or to cede rights under the lease, and, in addition, that the granting of assistance in terms of sections 10 and 11 of the Agricultural Credit Act, i.e. by way of a loan for the payment of overdue or outstanding debts or the consolidation of debts, will not be able to prevent the compulsory cancellation of a lease in terms of section 60 (2). With a view to removing the doubts, the legal advisors were approached for their opinion, and confirmation was received that section 60 (2) must be interpreted as being mandatory.</p>

<p>The Agricultural Credit Act was passed in 1966 with the chief object of introducing comprehensive measures for granting assistance to farmers and making the consolidation of debts possible with a suitable loan term for the repayment of debts. It is therefore felt that it must be possible for land settlement lessees who are four years or more in arrears as a result of setbacks in their farming which are beyond their control, to be assisted under the existing measures, without the compulsory cancellation of the lease coming into effect in terms of section 60 (2). Since the Land Settlement Act has already been repealed, provision is now being made for the supplementation of section 51 of the Agricultural Credit Act with retrospective effect from 1st October, 1966, in order to interpret section 60 (2) of the Land Settlement Act as permissive; in other words, that the Minister may, and not must, cancel a lease if a lessee has failed to pay all amounts due by him by way of rent, interest and installments of purchase price on his holding in respect of four consecutive years.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>This side of the House will not oppose this change to the Agricultural Credit Act; there are, however, certain points we should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention. The first is this: This legislation proves to us that it has become necessary that more prosperous farmers will have to be assisted when they want to tackle certain water works. I want to point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;he realizes this himself, of course&#x2014;that there are many farmers who do not receive assistance from the Department of Agricultural Credit, farmers who are not prosperous. They are betwixt and between as far as their financial position is concerned, and I think that the fact that the Minister is prepared to grant them loans at an 8 per cent interest rate is fair under the prevailing circumstances, but at the same time I must point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is not fair to the farmer under the prevailing circumstances where they are all faced with a difficult situation through already having to pay an increased interest rate to commercial banks and other financial <span class="col_1359-1360" refersTo="page_0693"/>institutions. When they tackle such a water work they would be decidedly fortunate to get hold of a loan at an interest rate of 8 per cent. We therefore welcome this concession, but we nevertheless want to point out that Agricultural Credit&#x2019;s interest rate is normally 5 per cent here and 4 per cent in South-West Africa. It seems strange to us that in helping people it is impossible to do so at the present Agricultural Credit interest rate.</p>

<p>The second point I want to bring to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention is this: Why must this legislation be made of retrospective effect from December&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister unfortunately did not explain this, and I hope that in his reply he will tell us very clearly what reasons gave rise to the decision to make it retrospective from December of last year. Our attitude on this side of the House is that when Agricultural Credit matters are discussed we ought to restrict ourselves as far as possible to the present interest rate of Agricultural Credit.</p>

<p>As far as the last clause of the Bill is concerned, clause 4, where the hon. the Minister is granted the power to cancel a lease, it is a decidedly good concession that is being granted, and we on this side of the House appreciate it, because we realize that there are people that hire land from the State, whether it be on the more densely populated settlements or on other agricultural land, who have been through a very difficult time in the past few years, and if the hon. the Minister sees his way clear to helping these people and not cancelling their contracts we on this side of the House would distinctly welcome it. With these few words I want to support the Second Reading.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to follow up on what the hon. member for Newton Park said. What is not clear to us, is in a case where a person has to negotiate a loan and is unable to obtain that loan from Agricultural Credit at an interest rate of 5 per cent, but where it is a bigger loan, in respect of a work which not only benefits the individual but also the country as such, why in terms of the legislation he has to pay State loan interest that amounts to 8 per cent at this stage. Another point I should like the Minister to look at is this. It is laid down that if the board makes such a provision he will pay 8 per cent interest on such bigger loans, and if the board does not, he still pays the 5 percent. This is clearly defined in the Act, but it is not clear to us why it is left to the board to determine from time to time whether a person must pay 8 per cent for a bigger loan for a water work according to State loan interest rates, or whether he should pay 5 per cent according to what the board shall determine from time to time.</p>

<p>As my colleague said here, in the constellation we have today, it also seems quite a reasonable rate of interest to us that a person is able to obtain money for a water work at 8 per cent. But it seems to us as if it would have been much more appropriate if the interest rate as such were fixed. If we cannot do this at the same interest rate that Agricultural Credit can, i.e. 5 per cent, it should be laid down that it will be 6 per cent, if the State feels that it cannot do it for 5 per cent and that it must be a bigger interest rate. This has always depended on what the interest rate for State loans will be. In other words, loans that have been negotiated at various times can carry various interest rates. I should like the hon. the Minister to reply and say what problems are involved in such additional, bigger loans carrying a specific interest rate that is defined in the Act, and why it must be 8 per cent and not a lesser interest rate where there are few of these works. Even if there are only 3,000 of them exceeding the R20,000 mark, it is still to the benefit of the country as such and not to the benefit of the farmer or the individual alone. Why is it subject to State loan interest rates and not to a particular interest rate laid down in the Act&#x003F; If they must be greater than those of Agricultural Credit, why must they be so much greater that they exceed those interest rates by 3 per cent&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister a question or two. I am not quite clear as to the maximum amount of a loan that is granted to an applicant. In cases of certain farmers that are perhaps struggling under the very difficult situation in which the farmer finds himself today, a loan at 5 per cent in excess of the amount that the Minister lays down, might be of great help in rehabilitating a particular farmer. I would plead that in a case like that the hon. the Minister should adopt a flexible attitude in defining the maximum amount a farmer can get at the interest rate of 5 per cent.</p>

<from><span class="col_1361-1362" refersTo="page_0694"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the principle as initially contained in the Agricultural Credit Act is that the 5 per cent is laid down as an interest rate that is subsidized by the State. That is the principle. Now this Bill could create the situation where a man must pay more than the 5 per cent laid down, i.e. at prevailing interest rates that are not subsidized. The position is that some farmers can qualify for these specific loans, but their financial position is such that it is not necessary for them also to pay the 5 per cent subsidized interest rate. The hon. member asked why the Agricultural Credit Board must determine the interest rate. This is the case because the Agricultural Credit Board is the body that is in a position to be able to determine whether a person can indeed qualify for a subsidized interest rate or not. That board is the only body that is in a position to determine this interest rate.</p>

<p>It would be very unreasonable if a person must be subsidized at an interest rate of 5 per cent if he is financially able to pay the prevailing interest rates laid down by the State. It would be unreasonable in respect of those persons who cannot pay that interest. I think this is the gist of the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. members for Walmer, Newton Park and East London City touched upon the problem of interest rates. We are aware of that. However. the hon. member for Bethal summed the position up correctly. The Agricultural Credit Committee investigates these cases individually and makes a recommendation to the Agricultural Credit Board. This is in the case of a person who is not financially in a position to pay more. These are however, mostly in respect of smaller works. The scheme is only applicable to water works approved by the Department of Water Affairs. Now the hon. member for Newton Park asks why this has been done with retrospective affect. We had a case in December, for example, of a farmer wanting to set up a water scheme. But that farmer was a prosperous farmer. In my opinion he could have tackled the project on his own. Now one asks oneself whether he should have let this scheme come to nothing while we could help him at an interest rate of 8 per cent. 5 per cent is the subsidized interest rate. The Department of Water Affairs told him that they had determined that the scheme was economically justifiable and that he would recompense himself. It was a water scheme for irrigation purposes. That is where the whole matter originated. Those cases must be dealt with individually. Let the one person pay 5 per cent. But one surely cannot give the prosperous individual subsidized interest as well. If, after completion, a scheme appears to be a paying proposition such a person is entitled to a rebate in respect of income tax. It is regarded as a capital work erected by him. I wish we could give everyone 5 per cent interest. But this is not realistic and fair. We have now, however, got our footing in being able to help these people. Previously they could get no help from the Department of Agricultural Credit.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Walmer asked what the maximum was for which a farmer can qualify. There is no maximum. If the Department of Water Affairs approves of a loan because a scheme is an economic proposition; the loan may amount to R250,000. One thing, however, must be remembered. There are some schemes worked out by the Department of Water Affairs that are subsidized up to 30 per cent and more. Those are not schemes such as these we are discussing. I now refer to irrigation schemes for groups of farmers. Some time ago we had one for seven farmers which was subsidized by 33 per cent.</p>

<p>*I must thank the Opposition for their support of this measure and the amendment of the law, because it is for the benefit of the farmers. I also think they understand that not everyone can be given subsidized interest, because this would cost us too much money. The farmers are already very glad of this concession.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>As a result of the increasing use of radioactive isotopes and X-rays in the field of medicine, commerce and industry, great concern was expressed through various <span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_0695"/>organizations and individuals regarding the possible dangers to which this could give rise. Cases were quoted where the users, especially of X-ray apparatus, did not take adequate precautions to safeguard their personnel as well as members of the public against excessive radiation.</p>

<p>However, the extent of the dangers to which the public were exposed was not known. Consequently the Government decided in 1959 to appoint a commission under the chairmanship of Prof. S. F. Oosthuizen, president of the South African Medical and Dental Council and professor of radiology at the University of Pretoria, to investigate the whole question of the dangers arising out of X-rays and other ionizing rays.</p>

<p>The commission investigated the matter thoroughly. Information was obtained by means of verbal and written evidence, inspections in loco and a comprehensive study of all available literature on the subject as well as of legislation in force in South Africa and 38 other countries. The commission found that in 32 of these countries legislative provision already existed for controlling radiation and that in the remaining six countries the introduction of appropriate legislation was contemplated. So far as South Africa is concerned existing legislation was found to be entirely inadequate.</p>

<p>The commission found that excessive exposure to radiation emanating from radioactive isotopes and X-ray apparatus could cause lesions, and that cases of lesions from X-rays had in fact occurred in South Africa.</p>

<p>In December, 1965, the Cabinet approved of the introduction of legislation to deal with the situation. Shortly thereafter, however, it was learned that it was intended to tighten up control over radioactive isotopes by means of the amendment of the Atomic Energy Act. This was in fact done during the 1967 session, so that all that remained to be done so far as the commission&#x2019;s recommendations in this respect were concerned, was to provide for the exercise of proper control over X-ray apparatus. In this regard the commission found the position in South Africa to be alarming. In point of fact its investigations revealed that the majority of X-ray installations in the Republic do not comply with the minimum safety standards and constitute a danger to those who operate them as well as to the public.</p>

<p>Legislation to deal with this situation was prepared for introduction during 1968, but was not proceeded with as the Medical Council wished to give further consideration to certain aspects of the legislation. The council has recently indicated that it is satisfied with the present proposals. In the meantime the developments in respect of rays emanating from the electro-magnetic spectrum, other than ionizing rays, have been so great that it has become necessary to make provision for controlling, as the need arises, not only X-rays, but also all rays emanating from the electro-magnetic spectrum, such as ultraviolet and infrared rays, microwaves, radio frequency waves, laser rays, infrasonic, ultrasonic and magnetic fields.</p>

<p>Investigations have shown that the above non-ionizing radiation waves are capable of producing not only physical discomfort, but burns of the skin and deep tissues, cataracts of the eye and retinal burns.</p>

<p>Microwave use has developed rapidly in the last decade and includes the following&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) microwave transmitters;</li>

<li>(ii) domestic microwave ovens;</li>

<li>(iii) commercial microwave ovens;</li>

<li>(iv) microwave diathermy units;</li>

<li>(v) radar on pleasure boats;</li>

<li>(vi) stationary radar; and</li>

<li>(vii) industrial microwave heating units.</li>

</ol>

<p>Both microwave ovens and radar equipment can cause genetic changes and microwave ovens can also cause cataracts. The use of microwave ovens for both domestic and commercial purposes is expanding rapidly and it is imperative that safety standards be laid down for the manufacture and operation of these ovens. In view of the importance of this aspect the South African Bureau of Standards has already drawn up standards in respect of microwave ovens.</p>

<p>The Bill before this House takes the form of enabling legislation designed to give the Minister the power to promulgate regulations in regard to a variety of matters which are necessary for protecting all concerned from the dangers to which I have already referred.</p>

<p><span class="col_1365-1366" refersTo="page_0696"/>It provides for the licensing by the Secretary for Health of electronic products and premises on which any such product is installed, the requirements with which such products or premises must conform, the prohibition of the use of unlicenced electronic products or premises, controlling who may operate such products, the prescription of the duties of persons in charge of such products or premises, the precautions to be taken for protecting the health of any person in control of or employed in connection with any electronic product or of any other person who may be exposed to radiation emanating therefrom, for the inspection of electronic products or premises on which any such products is installed, the submission to the Secretary for Health of statistics and reports on such products and premises and for the appointment of committees to advise the Secretary for Health on any matter concerning any electronic product. Further, the Bill contains a comprehensive definition of the expressions &#x201C;electronic product&#x201D; and &#x201C;radiation emanating from an electronic product&#x201D;. and provides for consultation with the Medical Council before any regulation providing for the control of any electronic product for diagnostic or therapeutic use on man is promulgated.</p>

<p>The regulations for controlling the radiation emitted from electronic products will of necessity vary from product to product. For example, control of X-ray equipment will include the licensing of the building housing the equipment, the monitoring of the radiation received by employees, and the safety of the public who may be exposed to radiation from X-rays when visiting institutions where X-ray sources are operated. In other non-ionizing radiation electronic products control will consist of strict standards of manufacture of the electronic products incorporating built-in safety devices which make it impossible to operate the electronic product and so endanger the operator if all the safety devices are not operating.</p>

<p>Many of the investigations of the biological damage caused by non-ionizing radiation are still in the initial stages and it is difficult to predict the extent of possible genetic and tissue damage. Only when these investigations have been completed can the health hazard to the population be properly assessed and the necessary legislation promulgated. However, because of the possible genetic hazards that can affect future generations, we cannot take any chances in the meantime and are thus taking steps to control the present uses of electronic products.</p>

<p>As already mentioned the Bill has the support of the Medical Council. Inclusion of this measure in the legislative programme is also supported by the Atomic Energy Board, the Department of Labour and the Department of Health.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the institution of control over electronic products in the manner provided in the Bill is urgently necessary in the interest of the health and welfare of the public of South Africa and I accordingly trust that the Bill will be adopted without opposition.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is high time that a Bill of this nature was brought to this House, whereby the uncontrolled and unrestricted use of electronic products, which has been happening up till now, because the restrictions and regulations have become outdated, can be stopped. After this Bill passes through this House, we will for the first time have records of why electronic products are being used, where they are going to be used, and on whom they are going to be used. The hon. the Minister pointed out that safety measures such as are contemplated in this Bill, are absolutely necessary. We all agree with him. I am pleased that he has taken note of the possibility of electronic products affecting those people who do not even come in the direct line of the electronic products. X-ray apparatus may be installed in a building and people passing repeatedly through the corridor of that building could easily be affected by the X-ray machine. It is good to know that all these matters have been adequately gone into and that the various bodies which are interested in the therapeutic and diagnostic uses of electronic products are taking all these matters into consideration. I would like to say to the Minister he must make sure that unauthorized persons are not allowed to use machines which may cause damage by cumulative effect. Some of these massage machines which are being used, which appear to be ordinary electrical appliances are being used indiscriminately and without any control. They may, by cumulative effect, cause damage to tissues. I wonder if it is not possible for us to have another opportunity at a later date of investigating such machines and if necessary, restricting the use thereof.</p>

<p><span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_0697"/>The premises where the machines are being used at the moment or will be used will come under the inspection of, I hope, trained inspectors. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that these inspections should be done frequently. It is not good enough to have an inspector going around every six months to a building or to a hospital where such machines are installed. I think that these machines and the environs of the machines should at the very least be examined monthly. I am pleased that provision is being made for the keeping of statistics. It is only in this manner that we will be able to learn the usefulness and the abuses of these machines. I am particularly concerned about the effect on tissues and glands where such machines may be used by the inexperienced indiscriminately. I feel that this subsection which deals with statistics should be carefully watched and every person who receives treatment, should be instructed to report any untoward effect caused by the treatment, to the person who is in charge of the institution.</p>

<p>I do not think that I need to elaborate any further on the value of this Bill. We on this side of the House will support it and we hope that the hon. the Minister will not be burdened with too many amendments. We also hope that this Bill in itself and the regulations arising out of this Bill will be sufficient to look after our population and to do away with any hazards which might possibly be caused by electronic equipment.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased with the attitude of the hon. member for Rosettenville and we are grateful that they are supporting this matter together with us. To me this is quite a historic day in the development of medical science in this country. If we open this Bill in front of us, we shall find that it is a Bill amending the Public Health Act of 1919. If we read it in the High Dutch translation, we really come to realize how far medical science has advanced in the past 52 years. It is characteristic that one has to read here in what is almost a strange language, the language of 1919, of an &#x201C; &#x2018;elektronisch produkt&#x2019; een produkt dat vervaardigd of gemonteerd is en wanneer het in werking is uitstralingen van een elektronisch produkt voortbrengt of bij ontstentenis van doeltreffende beschutting of andere voorzorgmaatregelen zou voortbrengen&#x201D;. Then we really come to realize that medical science is one of those sciences which have made the most progress in the past half century.</p>

<p>This radiation, and I am glad the hon. the Minister explained it so clearly, has a twofold effect. This protection is firstly for the people who undergo treatment and secondly for those who handle the equipment. In 1919 we did not know what a radiograph was. In 1919 we did not know what an ion or a radio-active isotope was. Today, as the hon. the Minister made so abundantly clear to us, radio-active isotopes are used by many institutions in diagnostics as well as in the treatment of certain diseases. I am very glad that the hon. the Minister also mentioned that this radiation is being carefully investigated, not only its immediate reactions and harmful effects, but also what the effects may be in future. I am also glad that research will be continued. Fifteen years after the explosion of the atom bomb on Hiroshima certain conditions emerged in Japan of which nothing had been known during those 15 years. In the same way we can expect certain conditions caused by excessive radiation to emerge, not in the first generation, but certainly in the second or third generation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville also mentioned other instruments which are operated by electric power. I do not want to anticipate matters, but I think that provision is being made in other legislation for the standardization and utilization of certain other instruments which are used as therapeutic devices. We on this side of the House are very grateful for the support from members opposite. We can only express the wish that the effects will be minimal and the control maximal, because there are so many factors in medicine of which we have no knowledge at present. Furthermore, we hope that this legislation will only promote the health of the human body.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the hon. member for Rosettenville, because the provisions of this Bill go very far. As was pointed out by the hon. the Minister its implications will be felt in industry as we know it today. We know that the infra-red drying lamps used on motor car paintwork and a number of other instruments and machines do emit radiation. One really does not know what effect some of these machines have. At one stage in the past it was said that even the lights in this House could have an effect on people. In the old days one could have <span class="col_1369-1370" refersTo="page_0698"/>one&#x2019;s feet X-rayed before buying shoes. Dentists often take X-rays of one&#x2019;s teeth. Up to now we have always had the very effective Factories Act which looks after workers. I know that strict measures are taken when machines emitting radiation are used. In this regard I think of arc-welders, for example. Where workers use arc-welders they have to be screened. We also know that X-rays are used in the aviation industry where components are inspected for metal fatigue and possible cracks. It therefore has far-reaching effects. It is a protection for the workers who use these machines. The only thing that worries me is that the Minister has not mentioned whether or not industry has been consulted about this Bill. Here I want to point out that, in terms of the licence for which provision is made, the person using various machines would have to have some sort of qualification. However, a person putting up a set of lamps to dry out paint work would not need to be highly qualified. One could use a labourer to do such work. Supervisory qualifications would probably be required, but I can see that when this Bill comes into effect and the regulations are framed, industry will have to examine the position and put its house in order. There can be no doubt that this Bill is going to be very far-reaching. In fact, as far as industry is concerned, it will be even more far-reaching than we think, because every day new machines are coming on to the market and one really does not know what effect they may have on the persons who operate them. Although the Minister has already had consultations with the Minister of Labour, I hope that they will consult with each other further in regard to the use of the Factories Act. It is a very useful Act which covers workers in many ways, and I hope that it will be able to play its part when it comes to the application of this particular measure.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Salt River made specific reference to the industries also involved in this matter. The fact that industries are involved will explain to hon. members why this legislation has been so widely defined. The reason is that we want to make all kinds of apparatus which can possibly be used in industries, in the medical profession, or wheresoever, subject to the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member also pointed out that several years ago one could have an X-ray photograph taken of one&#x2019;s foot in a shoe store prior to buying a pair of shoes. That is so, but I do not think one still finds shops like that today. The reason for this is that we have been holding out the prospect of this legislation. Therefore I do not want to regard this Bill as a measure to be applied with the laws of the Medes and the Persians. I want to regard it as legislation which has two other aspects, and these are perhaps the most important. One is that it brings to the notice of unsuspecting people the possible source of danger which certain apparatus may be. Secondly, it acts as a deterrent. When apparatus which may be harmful is used, such use will be terminated long before the Act is actually applied.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of co-operation with the Department of Labour. I can give the hon. member the assurance that we also desire very close co-operation with the Department of Labour. The hon. member is not correct when he refers to the qualifications which will be laid down for persons who operate such apparatus. This Bill does not provide for the qualifications having to be laid down, for very obvious reasons. The furthest we are going is to enable the Minister in the new section 133 (A) (1) (e) to make regulations &#x201C;prescribing the duties and responsibilities of any person in control of any electronic product &#x2026;&#x201D; The qualifications cannot be stipulated here. The qualifications for persons in the medical and other professions who control and use this type of apparatus are covered by other legislation. In the industry we rely on the sound co-operation of the industry itself. We assume that they will not place persons in control of expensive apparatus who have not been trained for the job. Accordingly no provision is being made in this Bill for laying down qualifications.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brentwood drew our attention to the use of Dutch in this Bill. I am pleased he did this because the department has now started the consolidation of the whole of the Public Health Act, a prospect which has been held out on previous occasions. The High Dutch sections will be translated into Afrikaans at the same time. The hon. member can understand that this is an enormous task. We have for some considerable time been trying to find staff who have legal training to deal with this work. It is one of the ideals I cherish myself, and my department as well, not only to bring this legislation up to date, but to consolidate it.</p>

<p><span class="col_1371-1372" refersTo="page_0699"/>Then the hon. member pointed out the tremendous progress&#x2014;greater perhaps than in any other sphere&#x2014;which had been made in medicine. It will make hon. members realize how great the responsibility of the Government is to afford the public minimum protection at least with regard to apparatus, minimum protection with regard to the premises or buildings, but also minimum protection with regard to the person who operates this apparatus. I have already pointed out in reply to the hon. member for Salt River that this minimum protection is to be found in various things but, <i>inter alia,</i> in the minimum qualifications and training of such a person, for which provision is being made in other laws and which will come up for discussion in the next Bill on the Order Paper and in others.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville underlined the importance of this legislation. I think it would be impossible to overemphasize the importance of this legislation in the times in which we are living. The hon. member referred to persons who come into contact with radiation from such apparatus, not directly perhaps, but unconsciously, by entering a building for instance, not knowing that apparatus such as this has been installed in the building. This is why we are hereby assuming control over the premises and the building as well, in order that we may protect all possible persons and not only those who work with apparatus such as this.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the importance of inspection and made certain proposals. Hon. members will understand that the question of inspection is a very essential matter, but one which is influenced by the availability of inspectors who have been properly trained. We will undoubtedly take the necessary steps to have the people properly trained. I only hope that the State will be able to find and keep a sufficient number of them.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also referred to the obligation which can be imposed with regard to statistics. This is specifically being done because, as I indicated in my Second-Reading speech, there are still many things concerning which we do not have all the information and which will, of course, emerge from the statistics which are made available to the department by the different bodies.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members on both sides for their support and especially the hon. members who spoke.</p>

<heading>MEDICAL, DENTAL AND PHARMACY AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>With the exception that the proposed new section 39C of Act 13 of 1928 (clause 7) has been amended by the law adviser, this Bill is exactly the same as the Bill to amend the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act which was introduced last session but which had only had its first reading when Parliament was prorogued.</p>

<p>Section 39C as originally drafted debarred any person other than a member of a particular profession supplementary to medicine, and in certain circumstances a doctor or a dentist, from performing in a prescribed area any act specially pertaining to such profession. In this regard sight was lost of the fact that the activities of certain professions supplementary to medicine overlapped to some extent. This, for example, is found in the case of physiotherapists and masseurs. Section 39C, as now drafted, provides for contingencies of this nature.</p>

<p>The primary object of this Bill is to effect certain important amendments in the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act in relation to the regulation and control of the various health services professions supplementary to medicine; the removal of restrictions on the professional activities of medical practitioners and dentists who hold certain foreign qualifications; the prohibition of the treatment of cancer by persons other than medical practitioners and dentists and the tightening of control over the sale or supply of instruments and apparatus intended for use in connection with the diagnosis, treatment, prevention or relief of physical defects or disease in man.</p>

<p>Other amendments envisaged in the Bill concern representation by the South African Nursing Council on the Medical Council; the procedure to be followed by the Medical Council in connection with disciplinary inquiries; the imposition of penalties <span class="col_1373-1374" refersTo="page_0700"/>arising out of such inquiries and action by the Medical Council against registered persons who become addicted to potentially harmful drugs. The remaining provisions of the Bill deal with the relaxation of the existing restriction in regard to the carrying on of the business of a chemist and druggist under a personal name in certain circumstances and the exemption of toothpaste containing not more than the prescribed amount of fluorine from the requirements of the Act relating to the labelling of poisonous substances.</p>

<p>Having summarized the principles contained in the Bill, I now propose to deal with the various items in some detail.</p>

<p>In so far as health services professions supplementary to medicine are concerned, the position is that for many years the need has existed for statutory recognition and control over those members of these professions who are accepted by the Medical Council as qualified and competent through training and examination to perform defined public health services.</p>

<p>The need for regulation and control of such professions has been accentuated during recent years by advances in medical science. The ambit of general health care has widened to such an extent that it has become virtually impossible for a general medical practitioner to be proficient in or to cope with the treatment demanded in all fields of health care. Thus the tendency has been towards specialization in the many diverse fields. Consequently health care services have crystallized into a team effort.</p>

<p>Allied professions such as pharmacy and nursing are already under statutory control, but this is not yet the case with certain other vitally necessary professions, such as optometry, physiotherapy, radiography and psychology, to mention but a few.</p>

<p>Many of these professions have instituted training courses at advanced technical colleges or at university level as well, with qualifying examinations recognized by the Medical Council. They have further voluntarily submitted to registration and control by the Medical Council, in accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Act which provides for registration and control on that basis. I may just underline the fact that under section 32 there can only be voluntary registration and not compulsory registration. There are, however, no statutory measures to protect the public and the professions concerned against exploitation and competition by unqualified persons who set themselves up as practitioners in many of these professions&#x2014;more often than not by blatant advertising.</p>

<p>Negotiations with responsible bodies representative of these professions regarding the adoption of appropriate legislation to meet this situation have been in progress for some time under the aegis of the Medical Council. These negotiations have now reached the stage where agreement in general has been reached on the basic principles in that regard as contained in the Bill now before this House.</p>

<p>The present position regarding control of para-medical personnel is that in terms of section 32 the Medical Council may establish registers in respect of any profession referred to in that section and register persons who pass examinations prescribed by the Council or who, in lieu thereof, hold diplomas or certificates recognized by the Council. Persons registered in this manner are subject to control by the Council. However, they are not compelled to register, and those persons Who do in fact register with the Council, do so of their own free will.</p>

<p>The Bill does not disturb the present position regarding voluntary registration. It, however, envisages the eventual prohibition of the practice of any particular profession by persons whose names do not appear on the register kept by the Council in respect of that profession. The first step towards the attainment of this objective is the setting up of professional boards for the respective professions supplementary to medicine, with the object of promoting high standards of professional education and conduct amongst members of those professions. Provision in this regard is made in clause 2 of the Bill which provides for the establishment of such boards by the State President on the recommendation of the Medical Council. However, before making any recommendation in this regard the Council is required to consult representatives of persons whose names appear on the register kept by it in connection with the profession in respect of which the board is to be established. Where the professional activities of two or more professions are so closely related that separate boards for each profession would be illogical, the Bill provides for the establishment of one board to serve the professions concerned. For example, it might well be decided to establish a single board in respect of optometrists, orthoptists and dispensing <span class="col_1375-1376" refersTo="page_0701"/>opticians, because they mostly do the same work.</p>

<p>Clause 2 also provides for the constitution, powers, functions and duties of these boards to be prescribed by the State President by regulation. However, certain aspects which are regarded as essential for the proper functioning of any board are circumscribed in the Bill itself. Thus any regulation relating to the constitution of a professional board must provide (a) for at least one member to be a member of the Medical Council; (b) for the election of the majority of the members by persons whose names appear on the Council&#x2019;s register in respect of the profession in question, and (c) for at least one medical practitioner or dentist who has special knowledge of the profession concerned to be a member of the relative board. Further, in addition to performing duties prescribed by regulation, clause 2 requires a board to report to the Medical Council on any matter referred to it by the Council, but the Chairman of the Board may attend meetings of the Council as of right where such a report is considered, and while attending the meeting he has all the privileges of a member of the Council. Clause 2 also confers on any professional board the right to make to or through the Council representations for the making, amendment or withdrawal of any rule or regulation of concern to it, and provides further for consultation with the board before any such rule or regulation is made.</p>

<p>In general the professional boards envisaged in the Bill will function as advisory bodies to the Medical Council in regard to matters affecting the profession or professions in respect of which they have been established. Consequently, provision is made throughout for consultation with the relative board on all matters affecting it or the profession concerned. In addition to the provision in this regard contained in clause 2 to which I have already referred, I wish to invite attention to the requirements in this respect laid down in clauses 5, 7, 13, 15 and 19 in relation to the erasure of a name from a register; the definition of the scope of a profession in respect of which a board has been established; the registration of persons who do not possess qualifications referred to in section 32 but who satisfy the Council regarding their competency in the field in which they have practised for the past five years; the prescription of acts or omissions which constitute improper or disgraceful conduct; the consideration of complaints regarding the amounts charged for professional services and the prescription of annual fees payable by persons registered under section 32 of the Act.</p>

<p>Apart from performing such functions as may be assigned to them by regulation under clause 2, such as for example the preparation of syllabi and curriculae, regulations regarding the conduct of examinations, ethical rules and so forth, clause 12 of the Bill confers on professional boards similar functions in regard to the holding of inquiries into charges of misconduct by members of the profession concerned, to those possessed by the Medical Council in respect of medical practitioners and dentists, but with this difference&#x2014;a board is not empowered to impose penalties on the person charged if it finds him guilty. In such cases the board must advise the person charged and the Council of its finding and the penalty which it recommends should be imposed. It must also furnish the Council with the minutes of the proceedings of the inquiry held by it.</p>

<p>After the person charged is given an opportunity of making written representations to the Medical Council, the Council must review the matter in the light of the minutes of the inquiry held by the board and any representations made by the accused.</p>

<p>The Council may reject or accept the Board&#x2019;s finding and may in the latter event impose whichever of the penalties prescribed by section 42 of the Act it deems fit. In lieu of or in addition to any such penalty it may impose a fine not exceeding twenty rand.</p>

<p>Having dealt with the question of the establishment and functions of the proposed professional boards in some detail, I shall now turn to what might appropriately be referred to as stage two in our efforts to place the various health services professions supplementary to medicine on a sound footing.</p>

<p>This latter stage is concerned with matters relating to the restriction or prohibition of the performance by unqualified or inadequately qualified or unregistered persons of acts specially pertaining to any particular profession.</p>

<p>In this regard the Bill firstly provides for the definition by the State President by regulation, on the recommendation of the Medical Council, of the scope of any profession supplementary to medicine by specifying the acts which shall be deemed <span class="col_1377-1378" refersTo="page_0702"/>to be acts specially pertaining to that profession. As mentioned previously the Council must first consult the professional board concerned before making any such recommendation. Moreover, if there is a difference of opinion on the matter between the board and the Council, the latter is required to bring that fact to the notice of the State President. The provision in this regard is contained in the first part of clause 7&#x2014;that is, in proposed new section 39A (1).</p>

<p>In accordance with the customary practice in connection with legislation designed to restrict or prohibit the performance by inadequately qualified or unregistered persons of acts specially pertaining to a particular profession, the proposed new section 39A (2) of the Act gives such persons who have for the past five years been earning a living by practising a profession in respect of which a board has been established, an opportunity of registering under section 32 of the Act. However, before being accepted for registration they must pass an oral and practical examination to the satisfaction of examiners appointed by the Council on the recommendation of the relative board. Further, their applications for registration must be submitted to the Council within six months after the date on which the board was established or such longer period as the Council may allow, and the application must be supported by a certificate of good character from the board.</p>

<p>Possibly the most important provisions of the Bill affecting health services professions supplementary to medicine are contained in proposed new sections 39B and C., which have as their objective the eventual total prohibition of the performance for gain by unregistered persons of any act pertaining to a profession referred to in section 32. In this regard provision is made whereby the State President may, on the recommendation of the Medical Council and if he is satisfied that in any area the facilities for obtaining the services of persons registered under section 32 of the Act in respect of any profession are sufficient for all classes of the population, declare such area to be a prescribed area in which no person who is not registered under section 32 in respect of the profession in question may for gain perform any act pertaining to that profession, except in the special circumstances which I mentioned in my opening remarks. Moreover, the State President may define by regulation the acts which unregistered persons may perform for gain in areas which have not been proclaimed as prescribed areas. These restrictions naturally do not apply to the performance by medical practitioners or dentists of acts specially pertaining to their respective professions. I might mention that similar provisions are contained in the Nursing Act of 1957. So far as chiropractors are concerned hon. members will no doubt have observed that they are being dealt with in a separate Bill. I may just mention that I am consulting with representatives of the chiropractic profession and perhaps we can come up with something which satisfies them.</p>

<p>The remaining provisions of the Bill which affect the performance of paramedical services provide for consultation by the Medical Council with professional boards before a name is removed from a register established under section 32 (clause 5); the imposition of penalties for pretending to be registered under section 32 when not so registered (clause 8); the prescription of acts or omissions by persons registered under section 32 which constitute improper conduct; consultation by the Council with the relative professional board when considering complaints regarding fees charge by persons registered under section 32 and the prescription of annual fees to be paid by persons registered under the same section.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I trust that the explanations which I have made so far will have given hon. members a reasonably clear picture of the objects of the Bill in so far as health services supplementary to medicine are concerned. Personally I feel confident that I can state without fear of contradiction that what we now propose in this regard constitutes an important milestone in the development of the health services of the Republic. I may say that there has been a clamouring for this for many years, emanating not only from the Medical Council but from most of the paramedical health services. I think the time has really come when we can no longer delay this particular step in providing them with some form of not only statutory recognition but also, if the State President so promulgates, imposing compulsory registers.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of the relaxation of restrictions on the professional activities of persons possessing certain foreign medical or dental qualifications, the position is that in terms of section 22 (1) (a) of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, <span class="col_1379-1380" refersTo="page_0703"/>no foreign qualification may be prescribed as entitling the holder to register and practise in the Republic unless&#x2014;(i) the qualification in question entitles the holder to practise in the country in which it was obtained, i.e. the reciprocity provision; (ii) persons holding South African qualifications are entitled to practise in that country without further examination (in other words there must be reciprocity between the Republic and the respective foreign country in regard to the recognition of qualifications for purposes of registration); and (iii) the Medical Council is satisfied that the possession of the foreign qualification in question indicates a standard of professional education not less than that prescribed for medical practitioners or dentists in the Republic.</p>

<p>Provision is, however, made in section 22 (2) (a) for exemption from compliance with subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of section 22 (1)&#x2014;that is from the reciprocity requirements&#x2014;of persons possessing foreign qualifications prescribed under section 23 or such other qualification referred to in section 22 (2) (b) which in the opinion of the Medical Council indicates a satisfactory standard of professional education.</p>

<p>Persons who are registered under section 22 (2) (a) are only entitled to practise, and this is important because this is what is being changed now&#x2014;(i) for an initial period of five years and thereafter for such period as the Council may determine; (ii) in respect of such area or areas as the Council may determine; and (iii) subject to such restrictions in respect of their professional activities as the Council may determine, in other words a restricted practise.</p>

<p>The relative regulations restrict the practising by persons registered under this section to full-time service of the State, provincial administrations, universities and scientific institutions and missions.</p>

<p>Considerable dissatisfaction has for some time existed on account of the fact that there is no provision in the Act for persons registered under section 22 (2) (a) who have rendered efficient service over some years, of obtaining unrestricted registration other than by acquiring a South African medical degree after at least three years&#x2019; study in the Republic. This dissatisfaction is understandably even greater when the persons concerned hold a degree prescribed under section 23, which when held by a South African citizen entitles him to unrestricted practice in the Republic.</p>

<p>In addition to the pressure for the removal of the restrictions imposed in terms of section 22 (2) (a) in suitable cases from persons directly affected, representations have for a considerable time been made by the Department of Immigration in this regard. In this connection I might mention that the immigration authorities are only prepared to issue temporary residential permits to persons registered under that section.</p>

<p>After thorough investigation of the position, the Medical Council has recommended that provision be made for the removal of the restrictions imposed on a foreign holder of qualifications prescribed under section 23 of the Act, subject to the following conditions&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) he must have been registered for at least two years and have practised at a hospital or similar institution in the Republic for at least two years, of which at least one year must have been at a hospital or other similar institution approved by the Council;</li>

<li>(ii) he must submit a certificate from the head of the latter hospital or institution stating that he was found to be professionally competent and of good character; and</li>

<li>(iii) he must satisfy the Council regarding his knowledge of the laws of the Republic relating to the practice of his profession and as to his proficiency in at least one of the official languages of the Republic.</li>

</ol>

<p>In so far as holders of qualifications referred to in section 22 (2) (b), other than those prescribed under section 23, are concerned, the Council has recommended that they too should become eligible for the removal of restrictions imposed on them, provided that in addition to complying with the aforementioned conditions, they pass an examination prescribed by the Council for the purpose of determining whether they possess knowledge and skill which is not lower than that prescribed for medical practitioners or dentists in the Republic. Hon. members will note that we are dealing here with two categories of people, namely those that have to sit for an examination and those who are not required to do so.</p>

<p><span class="col_1381-1382" refersTo="page_0704"/>The question might well be raised as to why persons holding degrees prescribed under section 23 are not also required to sit for a professional examination. The reason is that no degree may be prescribed under that section unless it indicates a standard of professional education not lower than that applicable to South African qualifications, whereas the other qualifications referred to in section 22 (2) (b) need only indicate a satisfactory standard of professional education.</p>

<p>Provision for giving effect to the Council&#x2019;s recommendations is made in clause 3 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now go on to refer to the proposal contained in clause 6 of the Bill which is aimed at curbing the activities of unqualified persons who profess to be able to treat and cure cancer.</p>

<p>It is indeed tragic that in spite of the advances that have already been made and are continuing to be made in regard to the treatment of cancer, there still exists the cancer sufferer or the person who fears that he has cancer, who through ignorance or unjustified fear of the necessary medical treatment, seeks the aid of the so-called cancer curer rather than that of his doctor.</p>

<p>Treatment, usually at considerable cost to the patient, by these unqualified persons frequently has maiming and tragic results, more particularly delay in seeking proper medical treatment before the condition has reached the stage where it can no longer be cured or arrested. It is really sad to know that these things are taking place daily in our midst, while the best treatment known to medical science is readily available at our hospitals, and free of charge if necessary.</p>

<p>For many years&#x2014;and this is rather important&#x2014;the National Cancer Association of South Africa has been active in bringing these facts to the notice of the public as well as to cancer sufferers in general.</p>

<p>In spite of these efforts, coupled with those of the Department of Health and others, little progress has been made in combating the activities of these quacks.</p>

<p>In the circumstances both the National Cancer Association and the Medical Council have urged that action be taken without delay to eliminate this danger.</p>

<p>Provision has accordingly been made in clause 6 of the Bill to prohibit any person, other than a registered medical practitioner, from diagnosing or treating any malignant condition or from offering to or holding out that he can diagnose or treat such a condition, or from holding out that any article, medicine or apparatus is or may be of value for the alleviation, curing or treatment of cancer.</p>

<p>I sincerely trust that the measures now proposed will have the desired effect. In this connection it will be noted that the words &#x201C;for gain&#x201D; in relation to treatment, etc., have not been used in this instance. They have been omitted deliberately, as these charlatans, and I make no apology for referring to them as such, invariably manage to circumvent the law when prosecuted for performing acts pertaining to that of a medical practitioner, by pleading that they made no charge for treatment. They of course have other methods of fleecing their unfortunate victims.</p>

<p>A matter which has for some time engaged the attention of the Department of Health concerns the quality and value from a medical point of view of certain instruments and apparatus purporting to be of use in the treatment of human ailments.</p>

<p>Section 83 (b) of Act 13 of 1928 confers on the Minister the power to prescribe standards of accuracy in respect of thermometers or other instruments or apparatus used or intended to be used in connection with the diagnosis or treatment of physical defects or disease in man, and also to prohibit the importation into or the manufacture, sale or use of such articles in the Republic which do not comply with the prescribed standard.</p>

<p>The Act, however, does not provide for the prescription of standards in respect of other qualities, such as efficacy, something which experience has shown to be urgently necessary in the public interest. A glaring example of the need in this respect is to be found in the case of certain types of respirators which are widely advertised for use in cases of emergency, but which in practice have been found to be quite ineffective. These totally unsatisfactory articles which are used in cases of emergency, have already been found in ambulances. It would indeed be superfluous to stress the obvious danger to the public created by such a state of affairs. Similarly, hearing aids have been found to be ineffective or unsuitable for the person to whom they have been sold.</p>

<p>In other cases entirely useless articles, purporting to be effective in the treatment or relief of human ailments, are foisted on <span class="col_1383-1384" refersTo="page_0705"/>the public. In this connection I have with me here a circular which was recently sent to me&#x2014;of course not by the seller of the article. I shall read it so that hon. members can see for themselves the sort of thing that is going on and the need for putting a stop to it. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By means of wearing the ruminate body belt around the waist direct to the skin or over underwear, the permanent magnetic rays penetrate into the blood stream and body cells and gives relief of pain.</block>

<p>It is quite obvious that there is no value in this whatsoever. Yet this is being circulated amongst the public.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 18. Clause 18 is designed to extent the Minister&#x2019;s powers to enable him to prescribe standards in respect of any quality and also to enable him to prohibit the manufacture, sale or supply of any instrument, apparatus or other article, even if no standard therefore has been laid down, if he considers this in the public interest from a health point of view.</p>

<p>Section 2 (5) of the Act provides for the nomination by the South African Nursing Council of two of its members as members of the Medical Council. In terms of the Nursing Act, Act No. 69 of 1957, the members of the Nursing Council consist of persons registered under that Act as well as persons who are not registered. It could thus occur that a lay person is nominated to represent the Nursing Council on the Medical Council. Consequently, the Nursing Council has requested that this anomaly in the Act be remedied by providing that the persons nominated by the Council as members of the Medical Council shall be persons who are registered under the Nursing Act. In other words, nurses shall represent the Nursing Council on the Medical Council. The request is logical and is supported by the Medical Council itself. Provision for giving effect thereto has accordingly been made in clause 1 of the Bill.</p>

<p>The disciplinary powers of the Medical Council in respect of persons registered with it, are contained in Chapter IV of Act 13 of 1928.</p>

<p>Section 41 of the Act confers on the Council the power to institute inquiries into allegations of improper or disgraceful conduct against registered persons. The procedure to be followed in this connection is laid down in sections 42 and 45 of the Act and the regulations made under section 42.</p>

<p>A person who after inquiry by the Council is found guilty, is liable to one or other of the following penalties&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) a caution or a reprimand or a reprimand and a caution; or</li>

<li>(b) suspension for a specified period from practising or performing acts specially pertaining to his profession or calling, or</li>

<li>(c) erasure of his name from the register.</li>

</ol>

<p>In this regard the Council has requested that provision be made for penalties imposed by it to be reduced to writing, in order to ensure that the accused and any other person or organization concerned has a permanent record of the Council&#x2019;s finding. Provision in this regard is made in clause 9 of the Bill.</p>

<p>The second amendment contained in clause 9 concerns the appointment of a legal assessor to be present at disciplinary inquiries. The existing position in this regard is that section 42 (4) of the Act empowers the Council itself to appoint such a person. This is frequently inconvenient as the Council usually only meets twice a year. Consequently, at the request of the Council, provision has been made for the legal assessor to be appointed by the President of the Council or the chairman of the relative committee if the inquiry is being held by a committee of the Council. This is just a practical arrangement which has become necessary. Thirdly, clause 9 affects the present position whereby the Council may terminate the suspension by it of a person from practising before the specified period or restore a name to a register by providing that, where it considers this advisable, it can attach such conditions as it deems fit to the termination of suspension from practice or to the restoration of a name to the register. This proposal has the advantage that it enables the Council to make the person concerned furnish concrete evidence that he has mended his ways by serving what might appropriately be referred to as a period of probationary practice, before being given the right to resume practising unconditionally.</p>

<p><span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_0706"/>Another amendment requested by the Council in relation to disciplinary inquiries, is that it be granted power to postpone sentence or the application of a penalty imposed by it, subject to compliance to such conditions as it may deem fit. This principle is, I might mention, embodied in section 352 of the Criminal Procedure Act, Act No. 56 of 1955. The adoption of this proposal in respect of which provision is made in clause 10, has the advantage that in suitable cases a doctor who has transgressed could be allowed to continue to practice for such period and subject to such conditions as the Council might determine, knowing full well that if he does not comply in all respects with those conditions he will either be required to come up for sentence or the penalty already imposed will be put into operation. On the other hand, if he complies in all respects with the conditions imposed, he would be at liberty to resume practice in the normal manner.</p>

<p>Under section 45 of the Act, the Registrar of the Council acts not only as <i>pro forma</i> prosecutor in cases of disciplinary inquiries, but also as secretary of the body, namely either the Council or a committee of the Council which holds the inquiry and passes judgment. Further, the members, or at least some of the members, of the committee which has in the first instance to decide whether the facts at its disposal shall <i>prima facie</i> be evidence of improper or disgraceful conduct, are invariably members of the body, namely the Council or a committee thereof, which must investigate the matter and pass judgment thereon. For obvious reasons this duality in respect of the Registrar and the members of the Council can create the impression that the Council acts as both prosecutor and judge in the same case. After careful consideration of the matter, the Council has recommended that the disciplinary procedure laid down in section 45 of the Act and the relative regulations, should be amended in order to eliminate any possible identification of the judicial body with the prosecution. Provision has been made in clause 11 of the Bill in this regard.</p>

<p>Section 81 (1) of Act 13 of 1928 empowers the Medical Council to take disciplinary action against a doctor or dentist who becomes addicted to any habit-forming drug. However, its power in this regard does not cover those cases where a doctor or dentist becomes addicted to a potentially harmful drug, something which experience has shown does in fact occur. Consequently the Medical Council has requested that section 81 of the Act be amended so as to rectify this gap in the law. The adoption of this proposal would be in the public interest. Provision has accordingly been made therefor in clause 16 of the Bill. The opportunity is also being taken of rectifying the omission of the word &#x201C;regularly&#x201D; from paragraph (c) of section 81 (1) in the English text.</p>

<p>The South African Pharmacy Board has for some time pressed for the modification of section 76<i>bis</i> of the Act which prohibits the use of a surname as a part of the name under which the business of a chemist and druggist is carried on, unless such surname is the name of the owner of the business or of a director of the company concerned. Further, the right of a firm to carry on business under the name which it was using at the time the relative provision came into force, is protected. The original object of section 76<i>bis</i> was to prevent a person who is not registered as a chemist and druggist from misleading the public by creating the impression that he is in fact a chemist and druggist and consequently so place the trust in him which the public normally places in a chemist and druggist.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the provisions of section 76<i>bis</i> handicap companies who carry on business as manufacturers, distributors and importers of medicines. These companies have no direct contact with the public through retail trade and a situation such as that referred to where the public is misled would thus not arise in the case of such companies: yet we find that pharmaceutical firms which are well known internationally are prevented from trading under their own names in South Africa in those cases where the name under which they normally trade would contravene section 76<i>bis</i> of the Act. If for example the well-known South African firm of Rembrandt wished to manufacture pharmaceuticals in South Africa, it could not do so under its own name.</p>

<p>In the circumstances the Pharmacy Board has requested that the Act be amended so as to make the provisions of section 76<i>bis</i> applicable to retail chemists and druggists only. This change has also been advocated by the Treasury in the interests of the Republic&#x2019;s economy. Provision has accordingly been made in clause 14 of the Bill to give effect to the Pharmacy Board&#x2019;s representations.</p>

<p><span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_0707"/>Finally I shall deal with the question of the addition of fluorine to toothpaste. No. 35<i>bis</i> of the present regulations under the Food, Drugs and Disinfectants Act, Act No. 13 of 1929, prohibits the inclusion of fluorine in toothpaste. On the recommendation of the Dental Association of South Africa as well as of the Director of Pathological Services, it is proposed to amend the relative regulation in order to permit the presence of not more than 1,500 parts per million of fluoride-ion in toothpaste.</p>

<p>The object of this proposal is to enable those persons who wish to use toothpaste containing fluorine as a preventative measure against dental caries to do so. This of course also applies to dentists who wish to prescribe it. In this connection I wish to stress that the addition of fluorine to toothpaste will not be compulsory.</p>

<p>Further, the draft regulations provide that toothpaste containing fluorine shall be prominently labelled &#x201C;Fluoridated Toothpaste&#x201D;. In terms of section 82 of the Medical Dental and Pharmacy Act, Act No. 13 of 1928, preparations containing fluorides are classed as poisonous substances, and the containers are consequently required to be labelled &#x201C;Poisonous&#x2014;Dangerous&#x201D;. Now, if toothpaste containing fluorine as proposed, and which incidentally is not poisonous or dangerous when used in the minute quantities envisaged, is not exempted from the provisions of section 82 of the Act, the whole object of the amendment of regulation 35<i>bis</i> would be defeated as nobody would be likely to purchase toothpaste which is labelled &#x201C;Poisonous&#x2014; Dangerous&#x201D;. It is accordingly proposed to exempt toothpaste containing not more than 1,500 parts per million fluoride-ion from the labelling requirements of section 82 of Act 13 of 1928. Provision in this regard is made in clause 17 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Several of the amendments proposed, more particularly those relating to the regulation and control of health services, professions supplementary to medicine, the removal of restrictions on the professional activities of medical practitioners who hold certain foreign qualifications, the prohibition in relation to the treatment of cancer by unqualified persons and the tightening up of control over the sale or supply of instruments, apparatus, etc., are of considerable importance from a public health point of view. Where I now move the Second Reading of this Bill, I sincerely hope that I shall have the support of the whole House for this rather important measure as far as public health is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has been good enough to give us a very detailed explanation of the many facets of this Bill. I agree with him that there is no part of this Bill which is not important. I hasten to say that the formation of the professional boards, particularly for the para-medical services, is perhaps paramount. Here we have a difficulty in that we do not know how far the provisions of this Bill go. We have here legislation which seeks to prohibit a group of people from practising their calling. It would appear, on the face of it, that this Bill may also prohibit the activities of these people. I refer, Sir, to the chiropractors. When the Minister replies I should like him to tell us whether it is his intention to exclude the chiropractors from the provisions of this Bill. If it was his intention to do so, would it be possible for him to introduce an amendment, which would then have the agreement of both sides of the House&#x003F; I must say that up to now we are not at all satisfied that these people are excluded from the provisions of the Bill. We on this side of the House do not wish to take away the livelihood of these people who have been giving a service to many of our population for many years. We shall, however, return to this matter later and discuss the matter again if it becomes necessary. Other speakers on this side of the House will also raise the matter.</p>

<p>As far as I know from those with whom I have been in contact, the legitimate members of the para-medical services are indeed pleased that this legislation has been introduced. They want boards to be formed. They wish the Medical Council to look after their interests and to be interested in their activities. They want ethical standards to be established so that all people belonging to these para-medical services will have pride in their professions. In addition, with the establishment of these boards, with the establishment of their ethical standards and with the control they will have over the members of their professions, I feel, that they in turn will have better and closer relationships with the medical profession.</p>

<p>It is going to be a slow process, but I hope that those people who are interested in the formation of these boards will put their own house in order as soon as possible so that they can make the necessary <span class="col_1389-1390" refersTo="page_0708"/>representations and the Medical Council will know who wants a board and who does not want a board. I want to emphasize one thing here which may be in the minds of certain people. I think that there are people who feel that the South African Medical and Dental Council is some strange body that only want to see doctors and dentists and pharmacists allowed to practise. I do not think that that is altogether true. I do not think there is any basis for it at all. We have been inundated with telegrams and petitions and circulars and we have been subjected to lobbying by people who wish chiropractors, for instance, to continue to practise.</p>

<p>I do not know about the other members of this House, but of the 11,000 odd doctors who have been practising in this country, I do not think any one has made any move to encourage the members of this House to prohibit chiropractors from practising. They have left it to the good sense of this House. The hon. the Minister has not said whether the Medical Council has used its influence in this connection at all. That is something which we can perhaps deal with later on but I want to put the matter straight. Doctors can look after themselves. They have their own associations; they have their own council. It is quite surprising, in spite of the snide remarks which are occasionally made about doctors, what great strides the medical profession has made over the years and how much help and increasing help they have given to the public especially in recent years. We must not think therefore that these little innuendos which are thrown at the medical profession from all sides have any effect at all. The doctor will continue to do his duty to the public. He is there to help. Most doctors, of course, hate to see patients going to people who are destroyers of health and not healers. Whether they destroy tissue in one part of the body or in the whole body, I still condemn these quacks as destroyers of the body. It is the doctor who is always there to repair the damage that has been done by the unqualified and the ignorant. Sir, I leave that matter there.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about those people who will come under the control of boards which are not registered, particularly the physiotherapists. There are many, many physiotherapists who have taken on the name of physiotherapist but who were previously labelled &#x201C;masseurs&#x201D;. They call themselves masseurs. These people have been practising for very many years, some of them for 30 or 40 years, and they have provided a very good service, especially to athletes and so on. They will now come under control, but they have no qualifications; they have no university degree; they have no college diploma. They want to enjoy the protection of a board. According to the Bill, as I see it, these people will be given an opportunity after a certain period to write an examination.</p>

<p>I do hope that the Minister&#x2019;s advisers will make these examinations a matter of form for these people because it is going to be very difficult for a man of 50 or 60 years to go back again and to start learning all the technical terms that are used and to learn something about the latest apparatus that is being used, and which he himself has no desire to use. He is the man who rubs you down after a rugby match but feels that he is also performing a professional service, and I think a great deal of leniency should be shown towards these people who want to join their colleagues who have a higher degree of education and who, I am sure, would be willing to take these people under their wings and perhaps even encourage to do a little more study.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of doctors who have been coming into this country and who do not enjoy reciprocity, we have here a matter that needs very, very careful consideration. I am pleased that the Minister has now relaxed some of the very stringent regulations which prevented these people from helping out with the great shortage of medical personnel that we are experiencing at the moment. I hope that these doctors who come here will realize that we want them, that we do not want to restrict their practice, but that we only want to bring them in line with doctors who have qualified at universities in this country or at universities in countries which have reciprocity with our universities. We should in fact go out of our way to encourage more of these people to come here; they are providing an essential service for us, a service which in many cases cannot be provided by our own people.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about the restrictions which are going to come into being as a result of this Bill with regard to those people who profess to be able to diagnose and cure cancer. I stand with the hon. the Minister and with my medical colleagues <span class="col_1391-1392" refersTo="page_0709"/>in this House who say that there is nothing that should be condemned more than the laxity with which these people have been allowed to practise, if you can call it &#x201C;practise&#x201D;. They have bluffed people into believing that they are curing cancer; they have called small innocent growths cancers; they have put plasters on these little growths and caused cancer through their ignorance. Many, many people have spent hundreds and thousands of rands on useless and, unfortunately, also very dangerous attention given to them by these people. I am very pleased that the Minister is now bringing in legislation under which these people can be curbed and punished and their activities stopped.</p>

<p>There is one clause about which I am not sure. I am not sure how it will affect the unregistered person in the para-medical services. I understand that the Minister will now bring into being prescribed areas in which registered persons will be allowed to practise. What happens in the unprescribed areas&#x003F; I am not sure what is going to happen there. It would appear that a physiotherapist, for example, who is unregistered and who is practising in a prescribed area, may be told that as from the 15th of next month there will be sufficient registered and qualified people in that prescribed area and that if he wants to continue practising as a masseur or as a physiotherapist, he will have to go to an unprescribed area and open up a practice there. Perhaps the Minister will make a note of this and tell me what the position is. I am not sure why he should be deprived of his living in an area if he is going to perform the same service in an adjacent area.</p>

<p>I think that those are the main points. I think we are all pleased that now one will be able to buy fluoridated toothpaste and also that the Minister will see that the machines which are brought into our country from overseas are machines which really can help in the diagnosis and in the treatment of illness and that when those machines do come in they will have to comply with a required standard. This is most important. As the Minister knows, we have had an awful lot of rubbish coming in here, which is supposed to help people but which is really useless and just a money-making racket; a lot of people were robbed, and the gullible are always ready to fall for it.</p>

<p>I think with those remarks I want to tell the hon. the Minister that our attitude towards this Bill in the main is that we will support it, but we will be very careful to take note of what the Minister says in regard to those clauses which may prohibit a chiropractor from earning his living.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>As a member of the medical profession, I am particularly grateful today for this Bill which has been submitted to this House after many a long year. I think there are two things in this Bill which one calls to mind very clearly; in the first instance, the actual position occupied by the South African Medical and Dental Council and the S.A. Pharmacy Board in regard to the protection of the South African population. I think one should put this very clearly. I think the public outside often confuses the Medical Council with the Medical Society. The Medical Society is a professional society for the medical profession on a par with the Dental Society which is trying to promote the dental profession and is carrying out scientific research into that field. As against that, there is the Medical Council, a statutory body composed of medical men, dentists, nurses and lay members, and it is pre-eminently the body to protect not only the medical profession, but also the public of South Africa. The measure before this House today mainly serves the purpose of showing to what extent the Medical Council is protecting the public.</p>

<p><span class="col_1393-1394" refersTo="page_0710"/>The second matter which is of the utmost importance here and which we should decide for ourselves, is to what extent the Government should empower the Medical Council to protect the public. In other words, the question is whether every person or individual should not merely be left at liberty to do what he likes as far as his own health is concerned. If he wants to go to just any person to be treated for anything, should he not simply be left at liberty to do so&#x003F; Should he be allowed to have full say over his own body&#x003F; I think this Bill indicates clearly to us that the Council and the Department of Health cannot simply wash their hands of it; they have a responsibility towards the public as well. The most important way in which the Department of Health, through the Medical Council, can protect the public to a very large extent, is to require of certain people who practise certain medical professions or para-medical professions, to comply with certain requirements for registration. In this way every medical practitioner must obtain certain qualifications, reach certain standards and follow certain syllabi and courses before he can be registered as a medical practitioner. For this reason we have this measure before this House today and for the same reason I am pleased about the support from the Opposition. We have now gone so far as to provide further protection to the public in that the possibility is being created for the registration of the para-medical services as well, because, as the hon. the Minister explained so clearly, this no longer is work which can be done by one man. It requires teamwork to treat a patient today. For that reason it is so very essential for the Medical Council to have powers to ensure that not only one member of that team is properly qualified, but that the whole team is properly qualified.</p>

<p>The second question which arises, is whether a person should not simply be allowed to go where he wants to. I would be the last person to tell people that they cannot go to a specific place, or that they may not go there. But if one has had the perhaps doubtful privilege of having had patients in one&#x2019;s care who landed themselves in the hands of the so-called cancer doctors or cancer quacks at some stage in the past, then the reply to that second question is a definite no; the State cannot evade its responsibility in this respect. The State is obliged to protect the patient for his own sake from this own decisions. The reason for this is that these so-called cancer quacks are totally unscrupulous people, and the poor unprotected public outside do not know to what they are exposing themselves. They do not know the consequences of what they may be going through. Those extra two or three weeks, or a month or perhaps six weeks, for which a member of the public has put himself in the hands of these cancer quacks, may be the very period that causes that patient&#x2019;s death. It is a privilege for me to be able to support this Bill today, especially in regard to the so-called cancer quacks. For that reason, as far as this Bill is concerned, I am altogether in favour of these paramedical services being registered. Let me state very clearly that I had not intended talking about chiropractors here today, but I think the hon. member for Rosettenville mentioned the name here and for that reason I have no choice in the matter of broadly outlining my own point of view in this regard. I am not one of those people who thinks that other people should not have a place in the sun as well. I am not one of the people who believes that not a single chiropractor has been properly trained. The only thing I am saying, is that there is a considerable number of them who have not been properly trained. The only thing I expect, is that we should obtain legislation&#x2014;and I hope the Minister will succeed in effecting the necessary amendments to the proposed legislation along with the chiropractors association so to enable these people to get their own affairs in order&#x2014;for affording the public protection in this respect as well. You see, Sir, there is no point in our talking among ourselves and saying that this one did this for one and that one did that for one, that that doctor made one so ill and that that chiropractor helped one. In my first year as a practitioner, a good friend and worthy colleague from the Western Transvaal told me an interesting story. The story concerned a young doctor who had been called out to a farm to attend to Oom Jan. Oom Jan had a strangulated inguinal hernia. As a young doctor, he struggled for two hours or longer but he could not cure the strangulation at all. He then told Oom Jan that he had to take him to hospital so that an operation could be performed. Oom Jan, however, did not see his way clear to consenting to an operation. Like so many elderly people, Oom Jan then said, &#x201C;Doctor, in that case I must die, but I shall at least die in one piece.&#x201D; The <span class="col_1395-1396" refersTo="page_0711"/>doctor spoke to Oom Jan&#x2019;s wife. She said, &#x201C;Doctor, if Jan says he does not want an operation, that is that&#x201D;. The doctor then simply gave Oom Jan a lot of pain-killing tablets, to treat him as best he could. After that he departed and waited at his home for the announcement of Oom Jan&#x2019;s death. Ten days later, however, he met Oom Jan in the street. He said, &#x201C;But, Oom Jan, you ought to have been dead by now&#x201D;. To this Oom Jan replied, &#x201C;Yes, doctor, I would have been dead, but shortly after you left, my old friend Carel arrived.&#x201D; The doctor then asked him what had happened. He replied that he had told Oom Carel what was wrong with him. He told the doctor that Carel had two big sons, called Piet and young Carel. Carel then ordered young Carel to fetch two ox-riems. Then they tied these to his feet, threw the two riems over the collarbeams, hauled him up and left him hanging like that for two hours. He then said that, with his head hanging two feet from the ground, the hernia disappeared with a clicking noise after two hours.</p>

<p>I have told this curious anecdote so as to illustrate that it will serve no purpose if we were to reproach one another. I do not think any hon. member in this House would have expected of me as a doctor to have suspended Oom Jan from the collar-beams. In that case Oom Carel probably was a better doctor than I am. I do not believe either that that hon. member would expect the Medical Council to register Oom Carel as a medical practitioner. I believe we should find ways and means of helping these people. I am referring to the chiropractors. We must help these people to get their own affairs in order.</p>

<p>There is another point in this Bill about which I feel extremely happy as well. A year or two ago, when the Department of Health still was very verkramp, there was a tremendous agitation about a report on the fluoridation of water. As a result of agitations, telegrams and sermons, a tremendous agitation was launched against this report. People would allegedly be poisoned, and it was also maintained that it was contrary to the religious beliefs of certain people. The particular health aspect, i.e. that of tooth caries, was completely overlooked. The possibility of children&#x2019;s teeth and the growth of their teeth benefiting from the application of a minimal quantity of fluorine to drinking water, was completely overlooked. For that reason I am pleased, without forcing people to use fluoridated water, that certain people who realize the value of fluoridation, are being given the opportunity, through the agency of the Dental Association, of using this toothpaste which is to be labelled &#x201C;fluoridated&#x201D; and need not be labelled &#x201C;poisonous.&#x201D; I believe that in years to come we shall find that this toothpaste containing fluoride, irrespective of which firm made it, will have exceptional value in advertising and selling that make of toothpaste. Each individual will be at liberty to make use of this medical knowledge which has existed for years.</p>

<p>The only other clause to which I should like to refer here, is the one in regard to the slackening of restrictions imposed on overseas colleagues who have studied abroad and have come to South Africa as immigrants. I believe this is a long-felt need as doctors who come to South Africa as immigrants have regarded this as, one can almost say, an insult. It has very often been found that when a highly qualified doctor or specialist comes from overseas, he is obliged to work in a hospital for a few years and to repeat the last three years of his clinical studies in South Africa at a medical faculty. Immediately afterwards, he is appointed as a professor in one of the subjects. This is a situation which appears to be rather incongruous. Subsequently provision has been made for the Medical Council to grant these people certain concessions, so that they may work in certain prescribed places. What this actually amounts to is that these people may work only in Government hospitals. The fact of the matter is that these people have produced excellent and distinguished work in Government hospitals and have even trained students, but one nevertheless not allowed to be in private practice. I believe that in this new arrangement, for which provision is being made in these several clauses, we have the possibility of obtaining more colleagues from overseas, colleagues we need very badly at this stage. I believe that they will be most desirable people, because the condition remains that they must practise in a hospital for two years, of which one year must be in a prescribed hospital, that they must produce a certificate from the superintendent of that hospital and that they must pass in a language test and in a test on South African medical laws to prove that they have the required knowledge of such laws. It is my privilege to give my support to this legislation.</p>

<from><span class="col_1397-1398" refersTo="page_0712"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a great deal of public interest has arisen as a result of the introduction of this particular bill. We know, as the hon. the Minister has explained to us, that the bill was introduced during the last session and that it evoked an outcry from members of the public, which I, during my brief nine years in the Chamber, had not experienced before. When it became known that this bill would be re-introduced, the same reaction from members of the public was evident. Although this bill has many facets, I believe that, primarily, the one aspect which has caused the greatest concern is the clause which deals with the formation of professional boards. Firstly, and clearly, I think one must say that anything which will eliminate quacks and quackery will be welcomed by both sides of the House. But in so far as chiropractors are concerned, I believe we should make it quite clear now, that this matter must be dealt with on a certain basis. I listened with great attention to what the hon. the Minister said. He gave a very detailed exposition of the various clauses of this Bill. But when it came to the question of chiropractors&#x2014;I think I took the hon. the Minister down verbatim&#x2014;he said: &#x201C;As far as chiropractors are concerned, I have consulted with them. Perhaps I will come up with something that will satisfy them all.&#x201D; With respect, I suggest that this House cannot legislate on the basis of &#x201C;perhaps&#x201D;. Therefore, I wish to make it quite clear at this stage that we on this side of the House will move an amendment during the Committee Stage that will ensure that chiropractors will be excluded from the terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, when he dealt with this particular aspect of professional boards, indicated certain sections of professions related to health services. If I remember correctly, he referred to the health care services and mentioned optometry, physiotherapy, radiography, psychology, etc. But I believe, from the very terms of this Bill, that the scope is very much broader than this, because in clause 2 of the Bill it says quite clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Council &#x2026;</block>

<p>And that is the Medical Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; deems it in the public interest that a professional board be established in respect of any profession in respect of which a register is kept under section 32 &#x2026;</block>

<p>It then goes on in that strain. The fact is that the Medical Council, acting in the interest of the public, should make recommendations that certain boards should be established. With due respect to the Medical Council, is the Medical Council or the medical profession in this particular instance, able really to judge objectively, what is in the public interest&#x003F; I ask this in all seriousness, because the very fact that they are judging this question of professional boards in the public interest is a matter, too, which has a direct personal effect on their own financial interest and their own professional activities. I believe that certain people who, I think, are justifiably in a position to be recognized by certain of these boards, could to a certain extent operate in competition with the medical profession, and operate legitimately.</p>

<p>The point that disturbs me is that the medical profession or the Medical Council as such, has this right in the public interest. In clause 4 (1) it is made quite clear that the council may establish and keep registers of persons practising any other profession which has as its object the treatment, prevention or relief of physical defects or disease in man.&#x201D; To me that is rather broad. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if in his reply he would give some indication as to the scope and the number of boards which possibly could be formed in the interest of the public. I accept the boards to which he referred, but I raise other matters. I ask what is the position with regard to chiropodists, masseurs and many of the other health services. I can think of at least ten different health services which could be regarded as playing an important part in connection with the whole aspect of treatment in South Africa. I believe it would be fair to this House if the hon. the Minister would give some indication as to what he feels in regard to these other people. There are the homeopaths, there are the naturopaths, there are the herbalists. Even at the risk of sounding facetious, which I am not, there are the Native nyangas and medicine men who also have as their object &#x201C;the treatment and prevention or relief of physical defects and disease in man&#x201D;. Is it the intention that these people should come under some form of control in the interest of the public&#x003F;</p>

<p>I feel, as the chiropractors themselves have been the object of such publicity, that it would be right at this stage to refer <span class="col_1399-1400" refersTo="page_0713"/>briefly to the circumstances which have led, I believe, in part to the submission of this particular section of the Bill. If we go back we find that in 1961 leave was granted to introduce a Bill, which I believe was a private member&#x2019;s bill, to deal with the question of chiropractors and to give them their own special council which would have been able to control the profession and ensure that no quacks could operate under the name of chiropractors and be let loose on the public. Various other matters were dealt with in that Bill. I believe that at that time there was a great deal of support for that measure from the South African Federation of Trade Unions Co-ordinating Council, the Steelworkers Union and the Mineworkers Union, because certain medical aid schemes at that time were not prepared to accept services of chiropractors, while many of the employees of the firms which provided the medical aid schemes, felt that this was something which was necessary in the interests of their members. There were objections by hon. members of this House who were in the medical profession. When the suggestion was made that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee there was one objection and consequently in terms of the Rules of the House at that time, the matter was precluded from being referred to a Select Committee. It is interesting to note that the objection came from the previous hon. member for Turffontein, Mr. Badenhorst Durrant. Apart from his objecting for two or three consecutive years, as far as I can see, he did not make any attempt to enter the debate. Then, in 1962, more or less a similar procedure was adopted when the then member for Pretoria West, Mr. Van der Walt, also sought to introduce a private member&#x2019;s Bill whereby chiropractors as such would receive some recognition and whereby their practice would be put under some satisfactory control. It is interesting to note that an amendment was moved during the Second Reading of Mr. Van der Walt&#x2019;s private members&#x2019; Bill to the effect that it be read &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;! This amendment was moved by the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, the present Minister of Health. I feel that, considering developments which have taken place since then, the hon. the Minister could be somewhat biased in regard to chiropractors as such.</p>

<p>Then we had this commission to investigate the question of the chiropractors. I believe this commission was not as objective as it could have been. Anyone who has read the report, which only became available after the Bill was tabled, will agree that they had closed minds on certain aspects. As evidence against the activities of chiropractors, they say that the medical association sent out a circular letter to 50 or 60 general practitioners and that from the replies it came to light that apparently in 47 cases the treatment received from chiropractors had been detrimental. If 50 to 60 letters were sent to the members of a profession which is now represented by approximately 11,000 medical men, how can the report be objective&#x003F; In dealing with this particular aspect I will try to be objective and I will deal very briefly with the matter. There are approximately 120 chiropractors in South Africa. If they were to send out a questionaire I wonder how many replies they would receive which would indicate that a considerable body of medical men themselves avail themselves of the services of the chiropractor. Not only do they avail themselves of the services of chiropractors, but they also send their wives and their families to chiropractors. This is done in their own good judgment and consequently I believe that this is almost a form of hypocrisy in so far as their condemnation of chiropractors is concerned. I wish to quote from a letter which I received recently from a man who would be regarded in high esteem by every member in this House. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was with particular concern that I read in the paper of the strongly worded unfavourable report which the Commission of Inquiry on Chiropractics had apparently presented to Parliament. It would appear that this would strengthen the hand of the Minister concerned to attempt legislation to ban chiropractic. I am one of many who would be utterly dismayed to see this happen. I, as well as many others known to me, have found great benefit from the treatment of men of this profession. In my own case the medical profession took days to diagnose my complaint and suggested it would take many months of treatment, inconvenient and in my case, impracticable, to bring about a cure perhaps. A chiropractor found the fault in a few minutes without consulting X-ray plates and cured me within a matter of weeks at a fraction of the cost.</block>

<p><span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_0714"/>That is the one case, but these professional boards will deal with many other people who provide some service in so far as supplementary health services are concerned. I ask the hon. the Minister again whether he would be able to give some indication as regards these people, the herbalists, naturopaths, osteopaths, chiropodists, dental mechanics, pharmaceutical technicians, native medicine men and others.</p>

<p>When we refer to this Bill we find that quite a number of clauses are concerned directly with this question of the creation of professional boards. The hon. the Minister has explained to the House the import of many of these clauses. In so far as clause 7 is concerned I have one reservation, namely in regard to the decision on &#x201C;the scope&#x201D; of the professions. As I understand the clause the Medical Council will define the scope of the various professions. I know that in many of the clauses of this Bill there has been the question of consultation and that the Medical Council will consult with these bodies. But at no stage does it say that there shall be any agreement. It is just consultation. Literally, as I read it, after consultation, if the Medical Council still feels that in the interests of the public they should recommend that boards should be formed and that registers should be kept, that will be, in fact, what will take place. When it comes to the question of scope, I believe that this is a very important aspect. If there is a difference of opinion here there will be no basis of negotiation. All that will happen is that the Medical Council will advise, I think it is the State President and make mention of the fact that there was opposition on the question of scope.</p>

<p>There is another aspect that also falls under clause 7 and that is in regard to the proposed new section 39C, namely the question of the prescribed areas. I believe I understood the hon. the Minister correctly when he detailed the implications of this particular clause, but I am a little concerned in this case for my own profession. As I understand the clause, the prohibition will apply to those registered under section 32, those whose scope is defined under section 32, and it will also apply as stated specifically in the Bill to the calling of medical profession and that of dentists. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he would tell me why the chemist and druggists are excluded from this because, as I see it, the medical practitioner has a statutory right to dispense under certain conditions. Certain of the other people who will now fall under registration under section 32 could also be regarded as being able to supply medicines in a prescribed area, whereas as I see it, no chemist and druggist will enjoy the right extended to a medical practitioner or to a dentist. The particular groups to which I refer could here again be the homeopaths who do supply medicines and the herbalists who also supply medicines. If we are going to have these prescribed areas where apparently a chemist and druggist could be excluded, because he is not specifically mentioned, I should like the hon. the Minister to clarify this matter.</p>

<p>Then, as a matter of interest, I think one should refer briefly to clause 8 which specifies the penalties for professing to have professional qualifications. I want to say quite clearly again that I believe that anybody who professes without justification to undertake any sort of healing or remedial work, should be under very strict control and should be punished. But is the House generally aware of the fact that the penalty for &#x201C;professing&#x201D; in the Act as it stands, was merely a R40 fine&#x003F; Now this fine has been increased five-fold to R200. There is also an optional and/or 12 months&#x2019; imprisonment. I am not suggesting that this should be done away with. I am just pointing out to the House that this is a big increase in the sentence.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the question of the cancer quacks and the fact that this bill should outlaw them completely. No man of sane mind would not welcome this provision, because I believe everyone of us has at some time or other had experience or known of people who have suffered great pain and inconvenience, and sometimes fatal results as a result of the activities of various, perhaps well-meaning, but improperly trained cancer quacks.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with clause 17, which amends Section 82 of the Act. The only really appropriate matter here is the question of the fluorides. I am very glad that the provision now made in this Bill will permit the manufacture, promotion and sale of toothpaste containing fluoride in South Africa, because here, as a result of the present intention of Section 82 of the Act, it has not been practicable, as I see it, to manufacture these products. We have fallen behind other countries of the world, who in their wisdom have seen the advantage of incorporating fluoride in <span class="col_1403-1404" refersTo="page_0715"/>toothpaste. Today, not only is it big business, but in many of the Western countries of the world, it seems as if the fluoridation of toothpaste has become something which is very popular with the public and which I believe the public is only taking advantage of because they believe or have found from their own experience, that fluoride helps in the elimination of or prevention of dental caries. We find that in the United States, according to the latest figures which are available, namely for 1967, 36 per cent of the toothpaste market represented toothpaste containing fluoride. In Canada the figure was 37 per cent, in Australia 26 per cent, in Sweden as high as 58 per cent and in Finland 63 per cent. Even in Rhodesia, one of our near neighbours, 17 per cent of the toothpaste on the market contains fluoride.</p>

<p>The Minister made very comprehensive reference to the question of the amending of Section 76<i>bis.</i> I raise this point, too, because, although I believe that it is a matter which can be discussed in a more detailed manner in the committee stage, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he thinks it will really serve his purpose when he specifies those bodies operating solely for the manufacture and sale of drugs and medicine, and whether it will not exclude some of the very firms to which he has referred. Owing to diversification under present economic conditions, these firms have now broadened their scope and they now handle cosmetic ranges and other items.</p>
